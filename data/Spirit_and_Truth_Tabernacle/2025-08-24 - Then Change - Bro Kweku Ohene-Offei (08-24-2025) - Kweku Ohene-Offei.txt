So, Father, come and be God to us, Lord. Have your way in us, Lord. Use our vessels, Lord, to perform your purpose here upon the earth. Father, you desire to gather all your children, Lord. They're scattered abroad, Lord Jesus. And Father, what we hear here, Lord Jesus, we take to them there. So, Father God, use us, Lord. Each one of our vessels, Father, we pray now over our giving, Lord, we give according to your word, Lord Jesus. And Father, as we give according to your word, there are promises associated with the with the with the word that goes forth and us obeying your word. So, Father, we expect it, Lord. We've done our part. We're expecting you to do your part. Use it, Lord, for the upbuilding of the kingdom. Lord God, we'll give you the praise, honor, and glory. Bless our brother as he prepares his heart to bring the message. Anoint him with a fresh anointing. Lord, speak, Lord, to us. Oh, Father, our hearts are ready for the word, Lord.

We give glory and honor to your name. For there's only one name elevated on earth, in the ocean, in the heavens, in all the universe, in this dimension, and in the eternal dimension. And that is the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And that is the name that deserve glory and honor. Father, when we go to sleep, that is the name that goes to sleep with us. &gt;&gt; When we wake up, that is the name that wakes us up, Lord Jesus. When we walk, we walk in the name of the Lord. Father, we do everything, Lord, in the name of the Lord. For there's only one name given among men for salvation. That is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, we thank you this day. We thank you for the breath of life. We thank you for the grace to be here Lord Jesus Christ to have conference with the father of love that Lord you pour your love upon our hearts. Father, your Lord, you know the needs of each and everyone. You know the spiritual atmosphere, the temperature of our hearts. Father, Lord, you know everything that goes on in every life here, Lord Jesus. Father, speak into every situation. &gt;&gt; Dissolve every doubt. &gt;&gt; Destroy unbeliefs. &gt;&gt; Consume attacks of the enemy. And father, give victory unto your children. &gt;&gt; Father Lord, is anything hard for you, Lord Jesus? We can see from the Bible Luke 1:37 when the angel of the Lord Gabriel met Mary and Lord the angel prophesied thou are highly favored. &gt;&gt; Not just favor but the highly favored &gt;&gt; and Mary was confused. What kind of greeting is this? Who is this man? &gt;&gt; He said you have highly favored among all the women on earth &gt;&gt; for you bring forth the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And normally it's not possible for a virgin to bring forth a son. &gt;&gt; He said I know not a man. How can this be? And Gabriel said, for with the Lord nothing shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; Or for with the Lord all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Father, this is where we stand. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; for every brother, every family, our pastor, ministers, Lord Jesus, therefore with you all things are possible. Every desired church, individuals, children, mothers, fathers, homes, Lord Jesus, all things are possible. And Father, we believe. Not only do we believe but we receive with all of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Father Lord your essence is we believing your word and manifesting your word on earth. God &gt;&gt; we thank you. We love you. We bless you till the permanence Lord Jesus Christ and even our brothers and sisters Lord streaming online in different places and wherever the word will reach Lord Jesus. May you quicken the seed and bring forth life. We thank you. We bless you in Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah to the Lord. The Lord is good. Amen. Uh we can take our Bible and just do a little bit of reading h before we take our seats. So we want to speak on our little God bless you our Saraphimson and and H those who change the atmosphere for us. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you for doing that for us. We thank you. &gt;&gt; So we want to speak on a lot of topic then change &gt;&gt; if you can bring it uh project it on there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; On on on the on on the board for us. &gt;&gt; But let's see. You know, the Lord will not let you do something that he he hasn't done it already. &gt;&gt; So before he will ask you to go through a change, &gt;&gt; it means he has gone through the change before. &gt;&gt; So we want to take a look at Luke chapter 22. Probably we can read is 4143. But let's read a little bit. Go back a little bit and read to get a background. Luke 22 41. Let's see where we can read from. Glory and honor be to the Lord. Luke 22:41. Let's go back to let's let's read it from the 30 39 instead. Luke 22:39 downwards. That was Jesus praying in Gethsemane before his crucifixion. So 39 said and he came out and went as he was as he was want means that he was led to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him. For 40 And when he was at that place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation. 41 And he was within them about the stonecast and kneel down and prayed. 42 saying, "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but thine thine be done." Amen. And 43. And there appeared an angel on unto him from heaven strengthening him. &gt;&gt; Means what? Jesus was what? Weak. &gt;&gt; For somebody to be strengthened, you don't strengthen a strong person. &gt;&gt; A weak person is that you strengthen. Amen. And I always believe that Jesus Christ was 100% almighty God &gt;&gt; and also 100% human being. &gt;&gt; Baram said in one of the quotes it marveled me said if he chose to marry he could have married. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he chose not to. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he had all the human instrumental instrumentalities in him. &gt;&gt; So here the human being was in display looking at the cup. It's not a physical cup, but it's talking about our suffering, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The cruelty of the the the the cross that he was going to suffer for us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And being a human being, you could see in vision &gt;&gt; those Roman soldiers and the Jews with hatred. Pharisees, they have tried several times to kill him &gt;&gt; in the temple. It wasn't time. So, he disappeared in the theophony &gt;&gt; and break his body back. &gt;&gt; But now, this is the time for him for body to be broken that you and I will have salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so as a human being, the human spirit was praying looking at the suffering that he was going to going through in a few minutes and few hours. He prayed the father, the pillar of fire in him. Abraham said that when you pray, you don't pray to God in the sky. &gt;&gt; If you're a Christian and God lives in your heart, you pray to Christ in you. &gt;&gt; So he was praying to the pillar of fire in him. &gt;&gt; Jesus is 100% human being and the Christ is the almighty God. 100% Christ in God in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he went through that change for us. Amen. and you may take your seat. Glory hallelujah to the Lord. &gt;&gt; He went through that change of being weak and then be strengthened, being down and being elevated. &gt;&gt; So when he asked you to change, he has already gone through the change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So let's see. Let's take a look at the topic then change. How this topic was born into my heart. It was let make sure I have the date right. It looks like June. I will tell you in a moment. Glory. Hallelujah. The Lord does things so strange. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was June the 8th, 2025. I think we were in the old church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And my car broke down. So, I couldn't come to church that day if I remember correctly. So, I was just sitting on my bed and studying. I said, "Okay, I'll use the time to study." And this topic dropped on on my heart. Then change. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I'll go back also to talk a little bit about it that the change. Let's look at what we mean by change. Let's just break it into pieces. Let's look at the word. Let me see. Let me go to Okay. Then change. Let's go to then change. I think slide four. Thank you. So when then means it's an adverb that is used to connect a sentence. &gt;&gt; I mean the school kids can tell us the grammar &gt;&gt; which means at that time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; H in the it could be the past tense in the future. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then next in order of time something to happen or something that is going to happen subsequently or soon after. Right. &gt;&gt; An example is a simple example is Anna is working to save money. Then takes vacation to Hawaii. Takes goes to Hawaii for vacation. &gt;&gt; So working to save money and then something following he goes on to take vacation in Hawaii. &gt;&gt; The next one is the sky was almost black. That was in the past and then it started hailing. &gt;&gt; So then it's connecting the two. &gt;&gt; Now let's look at change. Of course we all know change. Change means making someone or something different from what it used to be. Alter a material, modify or replace something completely with someone or something else of the same kind but newer or a better functioning version of that. Amen. In computers sometime you have to update your computer, replace uh certain things for the computer to function. So change we go through changes all the time. Glory hallelujah. So this change uh came about from I from a vision that a brother had then changed. In the vision the brother was in the woods and it was uh blistering and storms and it was white out snow everywhere and he was lost. So we begin to wonder how am I going to go home? And all of a sudden he saw a man in a hood coming and when the man drew closer it was Abraham. So he was happy said thank God the Lord sent Abraham to lead me and take me from this storm. And so Abraham came and said follow me let's go. And as they were going it wasn't too long Abraham changed into from the human figure into a forooted animal &gt;&gt; and begin to gallop at a higher speed. And the brother said oh my I'm lost I can't make it. And a voice said then change. &gt;&gt; And then he changed and swung from human figure into four-footed animal and took after Abraham. So they kept going in. It wasn't too long and Abraham changed again from 4-footed animal into an eagle and begin to soar into the sky. And said, "Oh Lord, I'm lost. There's no way I can make it." And the voice came by said, "Then change." &gt;&gt; And then he changed from the for-footed animal into an eagle and begin to soar high with Abraham. And as they keep So Abraham went directly into the sun. He said, "No, I can't make it. The intensity will blind me. I'm lost." And the voice said, "You have arrived here. Only eagles can come here." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Only eagles can come here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you an eagle? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Have you arrived? &gt;&gt; Do you have the new birth? &gt;&gt; Only eagles can be born again. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Non eagles can go through the Broadway. They can go through the way of the old birth, the sex birth. But the new birth is only for the predestinated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Only eagles can come this way. &gt;&gt; And I I like to break things down. If I take a vision, it talks about our life from this earth as we were born into this world in sin, in unbelief, lost in blisters in in in the storms of this world. But then God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; to lead us. Amen. &gt;&gt; To take it from the storm and from our lost condition &gt;&gt; into presence of Christ. &gt;&gt; And we go through the stages. Everyone has got their stages of life that they go through to come to the son of God. Not the physical son but the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let go back and this is not part of my sermon but this is something happened uh during the meetings and I want to talk about it and that is sister's testimony actually to be to begin with. Sister Erica permit me to share your testimony what the Lord showed you. Amen. Let's go to uh the picture of the moon. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. This was uh 26th uh June I think that was no July rather. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I missed it. I'm not good in dates so forgive me. 26th July 2025th at Palm Beach Gardens High School when we were having the special meetings and I think it was Saturday if I'm correct. So I was doing ushering open doors for brothers and coming in and I was thirsty. So I said let me go get some water from my car and I was parked all the way. So I was going I step outside and sister was close to where the cups if you are coming from if you are going into the auditorium the cup was the cup used to stand on the right side but if you're coming from the auditorium he was on the left side so I think was on the on the side close to the cup so I came and passed by by by her and he said brother look and I turned back to I look at I said look at the sky I said wow this is what brother brothera was preaching &gt;&gt; that's right the time the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking about the seven church ages and how the light was almost gone just a flick of life in the seven church age this year. &gt;&gt; And he was talking about I remember he talked about Esther that Esther was in the palace before the the the enemy even tried to destroy the Jewish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said I like to get into details of thing. Amen. I like the finer details. And I remember sister if I'm right if I'm wrong correct me you were wearing blue dress if I'm if I'm right and I look at the sky and I look at blue sky &gt;&gt; and it was he was the first lady of the house the pastor's wife &gt;&gt; he she wasn't a preacher &gt;&gt; but she was the first lady &gt;&gt; she's Esther &gt;&gt; in her position &gt;&gt; and God eternity dealing with Esther &gt;&gt; and Kenosaurus is what Christ &gt;&gt; dealing with the wife of Christ showing her things &gt;&gt; the Lord didn't to the ministers. No, &gt;&gt; but he showed the woman the first lady of the house &gt;&gt; that God has positioned his bride, the wife of Christ in her rightful position. &gt;&gt; And he can know her position. She was wearing blue, blue dress. Blue is a color of the heavenlies. &gt;&gt; Color of the sixth dimension, color of eternity. &gt;&gt; Color of all the blessings come from blue. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the sky was blue. No. &gt;&gt; So I took a picture and later went to I said share with brother Jack, brother Quinton and me and brother Quinton. I think about an hour or so we went and the picture was still there. The moon was still there. We took several pictures at different stages. &gt;&gt; Glory &gt;&gt; to show that God is with his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in uh Hebrews chapter 11 verse no Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same God with the old prophet, &gt;&gt; with the judges, with with with the with the patriarch, with the women of God, the same God is with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not lesser than Esther. No. &gt;&gt; You are no lesser than Hannah. &gt;&gt; You are no lesser than Sarah. &gt;&gt; You are no lesser than Elizabeth. &gt;&gt; In fact, you have been given more than Elizabeth Kat. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to sacrifice goats and lambs. &gt;&gt; Because Christ himself is what? On the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The mercy seat is not in some wooden somewhere animal skin. But a mercy seat is right in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you've got a new birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. And the Lord show before he does things on earth. He shows it in heaven. &gt;&gt; And as brother was preaching, the Lord is already showing what is happening in the churches right in the skies in the first Bible, the zodiac. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord. So now let's go to the sermon. Let's go to slide I think six and we are not going to do calculus but I want to see we want to look at how God Okay this is that the next slide let me see I'm just mixing it up okay here we go so we're going to look at equation we not going to do calculus here so don't be scared you're going to say brother Jack say are you turning my my church into a calculus class no I'm not doing that we just want to see how God displays himself evening everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We remember the story of brother Brown talk about a young lady. I think he finished high school or college and she wanted to party in the house and the father is old Pentecostal. Amen. Hallelujah father. So he told the father I'm going to my girlfriends are coming to the house. Please just for this time is my graduation. So please I'm going to take your Bible from you. Take your message book from you. H take all the poster that talk about Jesus Christ and put in mine somewhere. We're going to have a party. You're going to have some good time here. Just only for this one. So please daddy no a no hallelujah just take this geography book you know read it look at the look at the wonders of of the world &gt;&gt; and the old father didn't see nothing he just took the geography book and then this listen it was Saturday day she brought her girlfriends and they have their their jazz and hip-hops and and what else pop music and metallic music and what have you blasting the whole house and the father was upstairs looking at geography book looking at uh map of uh United States looking at the mountains Everest looking at South America, looking at Africa, looking at the pyramid and say, "Glory." Inspiration begin to draw draw came on him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Oh my goodness. God is wonderful. &gt;&gt; I never knew God is in geography. Holy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was looking at the oceans, Mediterranean ocean, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean. &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, you are so wonderful. &gt;&gt; And the young lady came, daddy, I gave you. Please, you don't have your Bible. How do you see Jesus Christ in geography book? Just read a geography. Don't don't say amen. Just we only have like 45 minutes, you know. Please, daddy, don't do that. Don't disgrace me. But they say, "Oh, sweet, you don't know God is in geography. I never know." Thank you for giving the geography book. &gt;&gt; If God is in you, you see him wherever you are. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a little song. He said, "God made the sun to shine just for you. He made the desert sand, the mountains and the sea." If God is in your If God is in your heart, then you can see him too. Just God, he made it all for you and for me. Yes. &gt;&gt; So if God is in your heart, whether geography, whether computer, whether the skies, the moon, the sea, human beings, the building, you see God everywhere. &gt;&gt; You can look at the building and see God. You look at the foundation, you see the alpha. &gt;&gt; You look at the structure, you see the seven changes. You look at the roof and you see the capstone, the omega age. &gt;&gt; God is everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; So I have this equation here. Like I said, we are not going to do calculus here. when I used to when I was in Texas I used to teach and in my class before we do I used to teach a medical assistant student pharmacy text uh criminal justice so they pass through my class and they take about 3 weeks math class and of course many people don't like math so before I start teaching I do we have a wedding in our class simple wedding I love math so I get m said Jesse I love math and someone said Mr. I hate math. He said he said, "Don't even do this wedding because I'm going to divorce math right after the wedding. There's no way I love." I said, "You just say it. I love math." So, I get them to say, "I love maths." I said, "Let's let's blow up the building. Just say it as much as as loud as you can. I love maths." And then from there, I give them the basics about, for example, if you want to multiply negative number by positive, let's say -2 * -3, the answer is going to be positive. two negatives. If you divide the same thing if you add it depends on the bigger size. So -5 + 3 as take it like you owe $5 and then you pay $3. So you still owe $2 and oh we never know math is so easy and after they fall in love with math. So we are not going to do math here. I'm going to use &gt;&gt; some basic to see how God displays himself even in calculus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have this equation here. Y is equal to X to the^ 3. Don't be disturbed. Okay, we are not in calculus class. And then I say Y stand for Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Equals sign X. The X stand for you &gt;&gt; and I elected sons and daughters of God. When we were born physically on this earth, we're a variable. In other words, you could be changed. You have choices to make. &gt;&gt; Your choice can take you to land of domination &gt;&gt; or it can take you to the region of the bless. &gt;&gt; So you're a variable. You can you can you have that choice human choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a three sub supercript &gt;&gt; the super god has given you a predestination &gt;&gt; that you find the voice in your heart &gt;&gt; Yahweh which is why &gt;&gt; because you are part of Yahweh &gt;&gt; and he put something in you though even in our lost estate there was something in us &gt;&gt; that tell you that you are not of this world. &gt;&gt; You are not born meant for this. You are not born to go to club. You are not born to be a womanizer. &gt;&gt; You are not meant to be a drunkard. You are not meant to be a boxer fighter. &gt;&gt; But you are meant for eternal purpose on earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that super script is always ringing in your heart. &gt;&gt; Even when you were lost, you didn't know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So, you go through life just like everybody else. And when the time comes, Yahweh said, "Now I want the key &gt;&gt; to to to start." Like you have a car, &gt;&gt; push the start button. &gt;&gt; Let the engine the the the gasoline begin to run through the the system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To let you know that you are not just a human being, &gt;&gt; but you're a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. So the Yahweh eternal thought of God when we were born through the natural sex, you were just lying down moving about with our earthly achievement. But number two, you have to make a change. Now the change is the first one is what? Repentance. &gt;&gt; Repent. The Bible says in Act 2:38, repent. And you don't stop at repentance. You have to go to the second stage and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So the first one in calculus, they have what they call derivative or differentiation and and and uh disintegration. So you differentiate the the x to the power y the supers which is three. You bring it to become h the coefficient that is the number multiplying the x and then reduce the power by one. In other words, your eternal attribute that is in you &gt;&gt; that you never knew it begin to come on earth. &gt;&gt; Not only lying in the mind of God, but it has to come to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Imagine your parents give you give you billions of dollars and it's just a check. The check doesn't do you too much good. &gt;&gt; But if you translate a check into cash, &gt;&gt; then cash is what? King. Yeah, &gt;&gt; when you got the cash then you can do things that you want. You can buy mansions do whatever you need to do. &gt;&gt; So as long as the thought is lying the man of God not manifest manifesting on earth it doesn't do good. It's just a mental knowledge. &gt;&gt; But God want to become what? Flesh. &gt;&gt; So what he thought about brother Johnson, brother Solomon has to become manifested in brother Solomon. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Solomon can say I'm a son of God. If Christ is not on the inside, it's just a theory. &gt;&gt; It's just a recite recitation. But when Christ quickens brother Solomon then he becomes a son of God in display. &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the first step is what derivative is repent and the second derivative is be baptized in the name of the lord Jesus Christ. And if you realize that as you keep changing the super becomes a part of his life it's no longer super. It reduce it by one. And here the two multiply by the three it reduce by one. So it means your potentials and your attributes the peace the love the healing the gift of God begin to manifest in your flesh in real time not just in the mind of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah to the Lord. Then the the the most the utmost change is the third one. The third derivative that is when you dis disintegrate and become part of Christ. That is the new birth, the new supernatural birth. Amen. And when you are born again, you are not just just a human being walking on two feet, but you are Christ, a in a sister, in a brother walking on two feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the new birth is what made a change. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The atmos change is not just the repenting. You can repent and go back to drinking. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You can be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you look like the devil. &gt;&gt; As you never you were never even born a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when the utmost change &gt;&gt; of the new birth, what is the new birth? The new birth is Christ himself &gt;&gt; coming into you &gt;&gt; consuming the old birth &gt;&gt; burning it and it completely complete an inhalation that it doesn't even exist no more. &gt;&gt; And then Christ take your flesh and the atoms of your body and create a new person, &gt;&gt; a brand new man. &gt;&gt; As the song go says, I'm I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. &gt;&gt; Old things they have passed away. I've been born again. &gt;&gt; And then on and on and on. So become brand new creation in Christ Jesus and nothing can change you. Amen. When you are born again, &gt;&gt; it's impossible &gt;&gt; to go back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no way &gt;&gt; a born again sister or brother &gt;&gt; can go back. It's just not impossible. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Bible said that there's no sin accounted for the one that is in Christ, the seed of God. Cuz when you're born again, the life that you live is not brother Solomon. It's not brother Jack. It's not Erica. It's not brother Joseph. It's Jesus Christ on the inside living his life outside of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. It's like your clothes. You control your clothes. You can wash it. You can wear it. You can put it off. You can do whatever laundry. Whatever you need. So when you born again, you become an instrument that God uses. Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed. Let's go to some changes that uh we found in the Bible. Let's go to uh three women that had some changes that were not normally typically that couldn't even be possible. Let's go to the next slide. Change your belief and thinking. We have sister Sarah, sister Anna, sister Elizabeth who were baring women and we know their life story. Some were all of them were past menopause. Sarah was 99. No sorry uh 90 rather and her husband Ibraham was uh almost 99 Hannah was past 70 years. Elizabeth the same thing. So in the normal life situation medically speaking anatomic anatomically physiologically it's impossible for them to give birth to children &gt;&gt; because the eggs are no longer producing &gt;&gt; and you need a egg and a sperm of a man to fertilize and produce a child. &gt;&gt; So this doesn't happen. So it's impossible. That is even the normal pro God made us. &gt;&gt; But with the Lord nothing shall be impossible &gt;&gt; with the Lord. All things are possible. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And I want you to soak that in your heart &gt;&gt; that you apply. And I'll tell you later about my situation that this applied to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not preaching sermons from the mind but we are preaching what the Lord has done in our lives. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So this account is there. I don't have time to read all the scripture. Genesis 18 9 to 9-11. You can read them when you get back home. And let's look at uh Hannah's situation. This lady was past 70. And being a child, she's being a daughter of Jehovah. Serve the Lord with all of her hearts. And there was a desire in her to have children. But she got to a place that there was no hope, humanly speaking, for Anna to have children. How can 70 70 years old grandmother have children? It's gone. But there was something in Anna that she wanted to have children but not children but children and dedicate them to the Lord. &gt;&gt; So one day the husband really loved Anna. They used to go to the temple to to h they go to Shiloh to sacrifice for for for service and things like that. &gt;&gt; And one time they went to Shiloh and there was something I'm not going back home. Told her the husband and the family can go back home. She went to the temple to pray. She prayed till her voice was gone and she was just opening her mouth. No voice was coming. And the priest Eli felt she was drunk. And he said, "No, my lord. I'm not a a daughter of Baham. I'm not a serpent seed. I'm not an ungal woman. But out of abandoned, the sorrow of my heart, I'm prayer to Jehovah." &gt;&gt; And he spoke. He said, "Let it be the Lord give you the desires of your heart." &gt;&gt; And right away there was conference in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As when you pray, you might not see nothing. &gt;&gt; Abraham said that the weakest prayer of the weakest Christian is still ominant. &gt;&gt; Anna was just sorrowful praying for the desires of her heart. But there was conference in the sixth dimension. God called a conference called all the angels. They came around said, "Do you know my daughter Anna?" Say, "Yes, we know her. She saved me all of her life and she has a desire in her heart and it's time for me to honor my daughter. Amenise. &gt;&gt; Imagine God want to honor you. &gt;&gt; So the Lord had a conference. What do we do for honor? And let's say h one of the angels let's say uh Gabriel said Lord why don't she say woman why don't you give her maybe twins two lovely twins you know why don't you give a girl a girl child and this one will say Lord send me. I'll just go and speak the word. I'll just go and plant twins in a womb. Plant a son in a womb. Plant this. And the Lord said, well, she has a desire. Her desire is to get a manchild. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Not only that, she want to give that manchild to me. &gt;&gt; But I want to give her something more than she desire. &gt;&gt; I want to give her one of my prophet &gt;&gt; Samuel, &gt;&gt; one of my greatest prophet on earth. &gt;&gt; I want to take Samuel and plant in the womb of Anna. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord said, "Let it be." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Anna, right away when the priest said, "Let it be," Jehovah give the desires of your heart. &gt;&gt; Right away, Anna conceived supernaturally. &gt;&gt; And when she went to be with her husband, the natural was just just an addition. &gt;&gt; Supernaturally, the Lord has already planted Samuel in the womb of Anna. &gt;&gt; And when you pray, you don't see physical. Sir, don't worry. &gt;&gt; Just rejoice as if you have seen you have got everything in your in your hands. Amen. Don't worry about, oh, I'm praying for $1 million. I don't even have $1 in my pocket. &gt;&gt; You've got $1 million already. &gt;&gt; How is going to be in your hands? Is not your problem. &gt;&gt; That's why you pray to a higher power. &gt;&gt; And a higher power is the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and he will make it happen. Yours is to believe, receive in your pocket, talk about it, testify about it. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm a millionaire. I've got 1 million. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say, bro, you you you've got 1 million. Yes, I do. Yes. &gt;&gt; But you don't have $1. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; It's you looking at my physical pocket. But I've got a supernatural pocket. &gt;&gt; I've got a bank of heaven. &gt;&gt; Not a bank of America. &gt;&gt; Not a Chase Bank. Not Wells Fargo, not a credit union, but a bank of heaven that never broke, that never filed for bankruptcy. That bank is your bank. And you can draw resources from that bank all the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; As as brother Jack put it, the the resources could be cut from the earth, but the source is God. &gt;&gt; The source of heaven, the bank of heaven never run dry. Your resources may run dry, but the source is there to just draw from. Amen. Just go back to the resource. Sorry. Go back to the source and draw your resources. Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible said that sister Anna just left home no more sad but rejoicing. Her desires have been met. &gt;&gt; But then physically there was nothing. She wasn't physically. If she went for pregnancy there's nothing. Same old. You don't even menrate how you going to get pregnant. &gt;&gt; But God has already placed something in your womb. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Sister Elizabeth went through the same thing. Sarah for the sake of time I want us to read something regarding uh sister Mary's situation. How the Messiah had to come on earth by changing of a virgin's mind then change. Amen. Let's go to Luke chapter 1. It looks like one. Praise be to the Lord. Luke chapter 1, instead of reading the 36, let's go to verse 27. When the angel Gabriel appears to Mary so Luke 1 verse 26 and that's where it begins. And in the sixth month of in the sixth month, remember the number six is what? number of a man. &gt;&gt; That is natural things. In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. 20 28 And the angel came unto him, and said, Hail, thou are highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. 29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind, what manner of salutation this should be. 30 And the angel said unto Mary, unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus. 30 32 he said and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign h over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be singing I know not a man so now God is going to bring a contrast in a man's way of life is not possible to conceive without knowing a man. So say, "How shall he be? I've never even known a man. I'm only engaged. I'm not married yet. So how am I going to I've not consumed my marriage. How am I going to get pregnant?" Let's see. 35. And and the angel And the angel said answered and said unto unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee." Therefore, so that the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath she has also conceived a son in her old age. And this is the sixth month with her who he she who was called barren. &gt;&gt; Verse 37, I want you to underline, highlight, absorb, eat, chew it, believe it, &gt;&gt; and do whatever you can do with it. &gt;&gt; That's the key word that will bring the chain that you desire. &gt;&gt; This was for Mary, but you have your own desire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yours is not to conceive the Messiah, but yours to produce the Messiah from your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; So verse 37 say, "For with God, &gt;&gt; nothing, &gt;&gt; nothing shall be impossible." &gt;&gt; Do you have God in your in your heart? &gt;&gt; If you have him, then there's nothing impossible in your life. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I like the 38. This is sister writes and Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord." Now she got a revelation. Behold the hand handmade of the Lord beat unto me according to thy word. And the angel angel departed from her. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. Wright did. He said, brother Bill, you are right. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the word is preached to you, you don't have to understand it. As long as you is the word, you believe it. You say amen to it. The word has been conceived in your heart. &gt;&gt; And that is what sister Mary got a blessing. That's what she conceived the Messiah and brought life onto the whole the whole human human race. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord. So God has to change, sorry, Gabriel has to change Mary think Mary's thinking from the natural sex birth to the spoken word birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spoken word doesn't need a man and a woman. It is need God and elected flesh. &gt;&gt; Are you an elected seed of God? &gt;&gt; Are you seeking the Holy Ghost baptism? &gt;&gt; Young people, are you seeking the Holy Ghost baptism? Do you want to have your own experience like your parents have the experience or you just want to come to church and go back home? If you can't go come to church and go back home, one day you're going to find yourself wanting, &gt;&gt; you're going to be like the man that was invited for a wedding and then in the eastern country when you they invite you, the the the groom and the bride provide you with the wedding garment. And this guy was found in the wedding without a garment. &gt;&gt; And they said, "No, this is not a garment we supply, &gt;&gt; they cast him out into the outer darkness." &gt;&gt; What's the outer darkness? If you don't have the Holy Ghost, the devil will eat you like a lion eating a lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the new birth now when you are young, you are angel, you are sweet, you are lovely, you are innocent. But as you grow, become a adolescent teenager. &gt;&gt; You are not always going to be sitting with your dad and your mom. &gt;&gt; You're going to probably find a job when you get a certain age. &gt;&gt; You're going to go to high school, college, &gt;&gt; you're going to be outside your parents. &gt;&gt; That is when you're going to find that you needed the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's Oh wow. I should have listened to what Braj was telling me. All right. &gt;&gt; I should have asked my pastor to pray for the Holy Ghost for me. &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for the devil to tear you into pieces because that is his job. &gt;&gt; The devil comes to what? To steal your peace, &gt;&gt; to steal your innocency, to steal your joy, &gt;&gt; to steal your blessing and to kill and to destroy you. &gt;&gt; But thank God there's a contrast to that. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ comes to give life &gt;&gt; and give it abundantly. &gt;&gt; So he give you one eternal life in your heart and all the blessing. Don't rush for something that is not your time yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wait on the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't rush to do what your parents do. &gt;&gt; Your parents are legally married. They are married have been blessed of the Lord. But if you if you're not married and you want to do what your parent do, the consequences is not what you're going to like. &gt;&gt; It might what do you call it? It might be h what's the word? It might be um it will bring temporal &gt;&gt; come again give me the word &gt;&gt; satisfaction to your flesh &gt;&gt; and to your human spirit. But the pain that you going to bear in this life, &gt;&gt; you regret it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil will condemn you all the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to You're going to bring children that you didn't plan for. &gt;&gt; You're going to end up being being a mother without a husband, a father without a wife. &gt;&gt; And you're going to go through life in a very difficult way. &gt;&gt; So God brought brother Jack and the ministers, your parents &gt;&gt; to raise you in the fear of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That you walk like Esther. &gt;&gt; You walk like Mary. that God himself will said like he did to Anna, I've remembered my daughter, this is a time for me to bless her. Amen. &gt;&gt; As a young brother, God will bless you at the appointed time. &gt;&gt; You have to got a decision to make &gt;&gt; that I'm not going to go go in the world the way of the world. &gt;&gt; If you don't make that decision in your heart when the worldly things you come across them, it going to overtake you. But if you have make your own decision that I'm not going to defile my body just like Daniel, Meshach, Shadrach, Abednego did that. They were young people. They were not they didn't have church. &gt;&gt; They were young men who were taken as slavery to another country. The only fellowship they had was with one another. &gt;&gt; They didn't have the Lord Jesus Christ, the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifying them. &gt;&gt; They were under the blood of boos and lambs and goats and things like that. But Daniel as a human being define his own life. He didn't let the world define him. &gt;&gt; He didn't let rock and roll define him. &gt;&gt; He didn't let the metallic song define him. You can hide and play your metallic song. Your parents may not know, but you are embibing demons into your life. &gt;&gt; You can watch pornography. Your parent may not see you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; but the devil is destroying your life right there. &gt;&gt; But if you allow the Lord to baptize you &gt;&gt; in your heart by the Holy Ghost baptism, my brother, my sister, young person, life will be sweet for you. Of course, life will bring challenges, but when the challenges come, you're going to be like David. Remember what David did when he came across hamping the lamb for feeding and then a lion came around a bear or whatever came around. Jehovah he he invoked the name of the lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the lord gave him a strength that naturally you cannot fight a bear. &gt;&gt; But he was able to tear the bear into pieces and take his lamb. &gt;&gt; Another time a lion came around. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He just transferred the battle to what? To his deity. All right. &gt;&gt; Because he has the dity of Christ in him. &gt;&gt; And Jehovah came around and he was able to summount and kill the lion. So when he was faced with Golad, he didn't wasn't afraid. &gt;&gt; He know who he was. Amen. &gt;&gt; He know who was with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a baptism of lamp and goat at that time. &gt;&gt; So when he came before Saul said, "So David, please, you're a young man, young lovely, handsome man. I don't want you to go die. Take my my helmet and things like that." He tried. He said, "No, I've not tried before. God has given you a weapon just for you, my sister, &gt;&gt; to overcome your battles. &gt;&gt; And that weapon is what you're going to use to overcome your battles. &gt;&gt; You can't use my weapon. I can always use your weapon cuz you have your covenant with the Lord. I have my covenant with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even your family, your parents have their covenant. And you have your covenant. And you have to know the covenant the Almighty has for you personally. &gt;&gt; Because under that covenant, oh my goodness, when you stand, the whole eternity is with you. &gt;&gt; You are not afraid. Let let all the demons let whatever come before your way. You just stand aloof and let the Lord do the battle for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So David came before Golite. Golad was had all the demons. If you read the Bible, he's got gods, demons and dities. And he was cursing David in the name of his daties. Even beside the physical strength, his physique. He was so what do you call it? Invoking his deity, &gt;&gt; his superpower. &gt;&gt; That was the demons in him. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And David said, "I've got greater than your demons. &gt;&gt; I've got God of Jehovah." &gt;&gt; And David prayed a little prayer in his hand and took five simple stones and begin to w them singing, singing psalms of David &gt;&gt; and then singing and watching Jehovah and the voice came release it. You think David was acting as a human being? No. &gt;&gt; He was acting as a son of God &gt;&gt; in his position. not outside his position but what the Lord made him to be to kill the demons and he got to a place heard a voice he released the stone he just released it wasn't David David's might and skills no it was a supernatural &gt;&gt; and the Bible said this guy has got even armor bearers who has got sword and shield to block stones and whatever you want to throw at him and he's got helmet all around him but there was a little hole &gt;&gt; little little hole here &gt;&gt; and this stone go around permeated all around the the bodyguards and everything and hit his head &gt;&gt; and brought him down. &gt;&gt; If you have Jehovah in your heart, &gt;&gt; my little sister, my brother, &gt;&gt; regardless of the battles, just let the slingshot, &gt;&gt; a little word come, even if you can't pray &gt;&gt; and I'll share my testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was in Texas working good, getting good good money with my work. It blessed me to take care of whatever I need to take care of, church back home, go to Mexico to preach. And one day I said, "Lord, there's more for me." I felt I began I was thinking, should I tear my certificate and license? That's the license that I used to work. I said, "No, I want to there's more for me. I don't want to get stuck here." And I said, "I'm going to pack my certificate. I'm not going to renew them. I want something more from the Lord." And I put my certificate and licenses that I work with. I said, "I'm not going to renew them. Pack them somewhere." And the Lord opened the door for me to do NBA, my MBA, and then come to pharmacy school in Florida. Then change. If the old is not working, you have to change. &gt;&gt; If your horse is not working, do not try to revive the old dead horse. &gt;&gt; Don't go to Cali to learn how to ride dead horses. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; If you go to a point, you know that this horse is dead. Bury the dead horse &gt;&gt; and jump up on a a lively horse. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't go to Hav and say, "I'm going to Hav to learn how to ride dead horses." You can put spritz some powder on the horse and whip them. They going to they not going to do nothing. The horse is what? Dead. &gt;&gt; You have to belongs to the ground. &gt;&gt; Dig somewhere and put the horse there and get a new horse. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who makes the horses? &gt;&gt; Jehovah. &gt;&gt; God made the horses. &gt;&gt; There are more horses for you to ride. &gt;&gt; Don't mourn over a dead horse. Amen. &gt;&gt; God can give you blessing, finance, money, anointing. You work with it and they run dry. Say, "Thank you, Lord. This was for yesterday, yesterday. I need new anointing. I need new finance. I need new beginning." And God will bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Where are we? Let's go to Gabriel. Let's go to Mary, virgin, conceive, and basia. I think we read two. Let's read. Yeah. Verse two. If you I'm not going to read it for the sake of time. When you go home you can read it. Then let's talk about Jesus change the wine. Jesus one of his first or that was his first miracle. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was at wedding with his mother invited and his disciples with him and he ran out of wine and they brought the mother the mother knew him &gt;&gt; you know and they said you know what Lord they need they need a wine said well it's not my time yet. And then he told the people whatever he says do it. I remember last week brother Jack preached was it last week that uh that's how did he put it? He said, um, believe the Lord. &gt;&gt; Believe Believe the Lord and believe in his prophet. &gt;&gt; Help me. &gt;&gt; The Lord, you'll be established. &gt;&gt; Establish his prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. Believe the Lord and you'll be established. Believe in his prophet and you will prosper. &gt;&gt; If you want to prosper, if you want to be established, believe the Lord &gt;&gt; with all of your heart. &gt;&gt; Then don't stay right there. Don't say, "I believe the Lord. I don't believe Jack. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord. I don't believe sister Erica. No. I believe the Lord. I don't believe my parents. My parents are human beings. I believe the Lord. I believe my pastor. I don't believe the Lord. &gt;&gt; They have Christ in them. Amen. &gt;&gt; So believe in his prophet, in his men and women of God &gt;&gt; and that will bring prosperity to your life. &gt;&gt; That will bring untored blessings that you cannot even have enough room to contain &gt;&gt; and your blessing will overflow onto others. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. I remember rejack I don't I don't see your sermon but last week you was talking about h establishing your business and then employing people giving 41k but I believe there was a time when you were working and getting paycheck isn't it &gt;&gt; but now God has moved you changed &gt;&gt; that you don't have to go and work for somebody to give him some paycheck &gt;&gt; do you know what we do when we work for paycheck I'll give you a scenario it's like a mother hen chicken right they call them hen the British English here we call everyone everything chicken &gt;&gt; but the mother is called hen. Forgive me. The mother is called hen, right? So, let's say mother hen had got 10 eggs and then 10 eggs is going to need 21 days to lay on the on the eggs 21 days for it to hatch into into chicks or chicken, whatever you call it. Anyway, but then the mother chicken say, you know what, I don't have the time to know lay on this eggs for 21 days. I want to have a good time. So, rather I'm going to make a contract with another hand. Hey, sister hen, this my 10 eggs. Can you lay on them and then when they hatch just give me three chicken &gt;&gt; and you can take a risk and when you work for paycheck for Caesar that's what Caesar do to us &gt;&gt; regardless of how much they pay you an hour &gt;&gt; you don't know how much your sweat and your blood bring to the company &gt;&gt; you know how they made their millions and the billions it's your sweat but we are afraid to make a change &gt;&gt; we always like oh no I need to pay my mortgage I need to pay pay my car I need to pay my children I still work for McDonald's for for 5 years and you saw my manager you are not nothing they just feeding off your sweat and your blood &gt;&gt; they give you that tag you are midonas manager &gt;&gt; and you get a little bit of bonus and you're happy do you know what they when you get three chicken three three chicks they get 7 10 20 from you &gt;&gt; but if you can take a bow step and pray &gt;&gt; and with the direction of the Lord just like in the Bible they were business women and businessmen In the times of Paul, Joanna was a businesswoman, right? The Bible say she was selling purple. That was a business in that time and even supporting Paul's ministry and the brethren. So there's nothing wrong if you become a business woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can have faith, pray and let the Lord direct you. &gt;&gt; And the Lord will show you what you can do. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you have time for the Lord. I was speaking with one minister and said, "We spend all the time with Caesar." &gt;&gt; Amen. Ministers, imagine the time in Abraham where they didn't have to work for Caesar. We could do more for the Lord. We could do more for the kingdom of God. But we spend 5 days for Caesar. You come back home tired, broken, &gt;&gt; and you can't even you can't do much. &gt;&gt; But if you have our own business as ministers of God, as daughters and sons of God, and you spend two, three hours praying, do you know how what that prayer will do? &gt;&gt; Not only for you, it will work in Zimbabwe. It will work in England. It will work in Mexico. It will save somebody in Puerto Rico. It will transform lives. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but we spend all the time getting little paycheck &gt;&gt; and we happy when they give you some bonus. No, they making millions out of you. &gt;&gt; So we have to pray. We have to change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When changes comes, changes bring blessing. I didn't even finish my calculus. I didn't put that down. In calculus, this simple equation that we did, you might not know what they use in the world. A lot of things that we do in this world is based on this this little calculations. The fundamentals ships uh if you go and go to hospital to do MRI, CT scan, those principle are based on incremental changes. If you use look at the aircraft, the forces that act on the aircraft even spacecraft NASA, it's based on calculation from from from calculus. If you go to medicine and pharmacy, if you are you take a medication, the medication stays in your body for some time. We call it change. Go through what we call half lives. How long does it stay in your body? They have to consider the toxic aspect of the body. If it's toxic, then they have to let it stay in your body for a short time. So medicine, hy and a lot of principle in the world, they use calculus. If human beings can apply science to do a lot of things, ships, different just name it, all the areas of life, all the field, they apply calculus. &gt;&gt; What about if you change and you get the Holy Ghost baptism? &gt;&gt; If you get Christ in your heart, &gt;&gt; what can you do with Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Number one, eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Number two, safety. &gt;&gt; Three, peace. &gt;&gt; Healing, &gt;&gt; joy, &gt;&gt; good marriage, good home, children, business. &gt;&gt; You can become a millionaire. It's not. There's nothing wrong with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as you use it to to bless the name of the Lord, &gt;&gt; you still serve the Lord, you still humble. There's nothing wrong with being a billionaire. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the Lord made it for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we live below our privileges. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we limit God. &gt;&gt; But God want us what? To stop limiting him. &gt;&gt; Cuz if we limit, we don't limit. We limit ourselves. We limit our blessing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody's believing God. Amen. And changing. But we think, "Oh Lord, I need to so ride my dead horse." No. &gt;&gt; Good preaching, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was I had a dead horse, too. &gt;&gt; My car was gone and I still wanted to like I need to do this. I need to get this. I actually pick a car Honda pilot. I like always like the eight seat and extra seat. And I took it back because there was some issue with it. But I needed another horsepower. So I think about probably 3 weeks I was driving to from Jag Road going through to Lantana for an appointment and I said in my heart I didn't pray loud. I said Lord let it be the last time I put money in this vehicle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I look at people driving said how people are driving brand new cars all over new cars. Why can't I drive? Why do I have to keep beating my old horse? No. No. &gt;&gt; What is wrong with me? &gt;&gt; And the problem was me not not God. was my limitation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, I have to put this horse down. I get a new horse rider. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And thanks be to God, two weeks ago, I got a new horsepower. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I've got a I've got a Volkswagen Atlas. But Quinton, God bless you. He was with me. We went to buy it. He was with me all the way. God bless you. He sacrificed a lot of time for me. God bless. Brother, [Applause] &gt;&gt; my brother, my sister, there's nothing difficult for the Lord to do. Let's go to the next slide quickly. What is the common denomin denominator about change? It is the sixth dimension. We don't have time to read, but let's uh let's look at the let's probably I think let's read John chapter 14. Let's see the woman of the world. The conversation between that woman and Jesus Christ. We look at how Mary said, "Let it be unto me." And let's look at the same thing that the woman at the wall when she was convinced then she become concerned. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, let's see if we can read a little bit from John 4 somewhere. Praise be to the Lord. The change is in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to find out &gt;&gt; that you already changed. We only you didn't know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your blessings are already there for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just go pick them. They are yours. Nobody Your name is written on. Nobody can take your blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No devil, no demon, no sickness, &gt;&gt; no poverty, &gt;&gt; no nothing can take your blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing can take your hold your children. &gt;&gt; They are yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And you've got a dimensional power. You've got a the the six dimension is the denomin denominator, the common denominator that bring the change. And you've got a six dimension. That's the Holy Ghost in you. All things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak sometime. You don't need to pray. You have to think &gt;&gt; because you have got Christ in you. When you think, &gt;&gt; he knows your thoughts. &gt;&gt; When you imagine things in your heart, he knows your imagination. &gt;&gt; And what you imagine, you don't speak out loud. &gt;&gt; I was driving when I was just in my heart. Lord, this will be the last time I will put money on this vehicle. &gt;&gt; I do not want it. This is the last time I don't want to work this job anymore. I'm not going to renew my certificate and license. I want to move on and the Lord will make you move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So John chapter 4, &gt;&gt; let's start from where? One moment verse 13. Okay, let's start from verse 9. Let's see. I want to try the conversation between Jesus and the woman at the Samar. Okay, let's start from verse one. Let's see. Jesus talked with a woman of Samaritan. John 4:1. When therefore the Lord knew how that the Pharisee heard that Jesus was made and baptized more disciples than John, though he Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples, he left Judea and departed again into Galilee. And he must and verse four, look at form of redemption. So and he must need go through Samaria because he had an elected daughter who has been kidnapped by the devil by prostitution. &gt;&gt; Verse five, then came he on them came then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called Sika h near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Verse 6. Now Jacob's well was there and Jesus was therefore being worried with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour. Then cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said unto her, "Give me to drink." No, you always have to descend. Like I said, when you want to give the gospel, be a human first. &gt;&gt; Talk about human things. &gt;&gt; And the Lord himself will open the door &gt;&gt; for dimension. But don't bombard people right away. Hey, you repent. Hey, stop smoking. Hey, you going to go to hell. &gt;&gt; You're just pushing them away. &gt;&gt; But find common grounds that you can relate to them. &gt;&gt; Be a human, brother. &gt;&gt; Be a human. Talk about things human do. Then the Lord will open the door for you &gt;&gt; and then things flow in the right channel &gt;&gt; and it bring the desire changes. Amen. So even Jesus had had to be a human. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He wasn't lied about the water but he want to use the water to connect with woman of Samaria. So he said give me water to drink and then let's see how the conversation proceeded. H give me water. And verse 8 for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat. Then said the woman of Samaria unto him, "How is it that thou, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which I'm a woman of Samaria?" Racism didn't start today. For the Jews had no dealings with Sam Samaritans, and all of them claimed Jacob as their father. Verse 10, Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knowest the gift of God, and who is he that speaketh to thee, give me to drink, thou would have asked of him, he would have given thee living water. Amen. The word the woman said unto her unto him, "Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep? From whence then hast thou this living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the world and drank the drunk thereof himself and his children and his cattle?" Jesus answered and said unto him, "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall thirst again. But whosoever drinkketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst. But the woman But the water that I shall give unto him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Amen. Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living waters. The woman said unto unto him, sir, give me this water that I test not, neither come here to draw. Amen. Now we talking. Now she's in the same channel with Jesus. verse verse 16. Then Jesus said, "Go call thy husband and come hither." The rest is a story. Right? So now when God present the gospel, you have to come to a point now to accept full acceptance of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; For you to be born again, for a man to marry you, you have to accept a man. &gt;&gt; For a woman to marry you, you have to accept a woman. &gt;&gt; It can't happen if you can't fully accept each other. &gt;&gt; And it's a married relationship between you and Christ. If you can't fully accept the word of the Lord that was given to you by the prophet, God through his prophet, you will never receive the Holy Ghost baptism. You can be a good awesome religious person, go to church, whatever church you want to go, but for you to be born again, &gt;&gt; to have Christ on the inside, you have to come by the way Christ has allotted for you. Amen. Sometime people don't know who the pro prophet of God is. Prophet is God in flesh. Amen. H it was said in uh back in the time of the prophet there was an African uh African president he wasn't a president then but he was a student he went to high school here in the university I think wuba force university for school in Ohio he was sponsored to go to high school here he went to college to study medicine h the man I'm trying to find his name I think it's called kamuzu uh where's brother brother Simba do you know the the president that gain independence from Malawi. Okay. Right. I I have I have his name somewhere. He's called Kamu Zubanda. It's called Hastings Kamuanda. Anyway, so this president got to be at Abraham's meetings when he was a student in the United States. He was in Ohio. He was in Indiana. He went to medical school in Tennessee. He went to college in Chicago. So he was in some of the programs meeting and later he went back to Malawi to become a president. He helped gain independence. And there was a time there was persecution against the Messi believers. When you go to Africa and most of the country they call believers braites and this is Abrahamress that's what they call they call it oh you are a Brahhamite you are bra that's what they call the believers anyway. So it came before they were in schools they have their culture just like here they do sports and the girls wear shorts and things like that. So the believer said no we're not going to allow our daughters and sons to wear dress that way to do those not just sports but culture where they have to display they have to dance certain things that is ungodly no it's not going to happen and so it became an issue with the government and things like that so it came before the president and president says no who are those people and they said those are the brahham they don't want to do sport they don't want to do do drama cultural and things like that and the president said no leave those people alone &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; don't force them to do nothing because he wasn't even a believer but the meetings in Abraham influenced his life and even his president said no for those people leave them alone don't touch them &gt;&gt; they are my people don't touch them &gt;&gt; leave them if they don't want to do sport they don't want to dance and strip themselves just leave them alone and it was said that the president had to censor every movie that comes to the country he doesn't even allow if there's even a kissing in the movie no &gt;&gt; it has to be blank it has to be edited &gt;&gt; wow It doesn't allow women to wear uh skirts below their word above their knees. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; The only time women can wear skirts above their knees is when they are in club where they are not in but in public a woman is not allowed to wear shorts sorry skirts that is that is is what above the knee it should be below the knee &gt;&gt; that was a present he wasn't a religious person &gt;&gt; but even the meeting the prophet &gt;&gt; seeing Christ not in William's personality no but seeing Christ Jesus being displayed &gt;&gt; in William's ministry he saw that this man is has God a a is a man of God. &gt;&gt; How can you say that that man is an is a devil? &gt;&gt; That man is a deceiver. &gt;&gt; No, you have your God has to open your eyes. &gt;&gt; You need a change. Then change. &gt;&gt; If you change, you see God as he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read. I have only one quote. Let's go to the quotes and read it. Oh yeah, I met some of them. Jesus changed the temple of Solomon. Let me just go back to the the six dimension. The woman at the wall. Jesus changed the harvest of corn and wine to harvest of souls of men. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus brought a drastic change in his in the ministry. The law of Moses was accomplished. But the people talk about law harvesting corn. But Jesus said that you are Peter, you're going to be the what? You are going to harvest souls. &gt;&gt; He changed fishing from fishes of fish to what? Fishes of men and women to catch them for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus changed the temple of Solomon to his own body. He said the time has come that they that worship God will not go to temple of Solomon but they that worship God will worship him in truth and in spirit &gt;&gt; and that's where we are and that's where brother Jack God gave him the vision to call the tabernacle the spirit of truth and spirit the spirit of uh the tabernacle of truth and spirit &gt;&gt; I think I'm just jumbling it up you know it so that when you are preaching your brain goes at a frequency way beyond so that that is a god we don't worship God in temple in in temples here we congregate &gt;&gt; but the worship &gt;&gt; is in your heart &gt;&gt; the spirit of truth &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the spirit of Christ in your heart the truth of the word of the lord and the holy ghost in that truth &gt;&gt; that is where we worship the lord &gt;&gt; glory hallelujah Jesus met a man that was impotent and the man tried for 38 years whenever God sent angel every year to come and kind of well the water and whoever jumps into the water is whatever sickness, cancer, HIV and whatever stage four cancer, it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; You're going to be healed instantly. &gt;&gt; And this man is impotent kind of wickedness in his feet. And each time the angel comes, he tries to go there. Somebody goes ahead of him for 38 years. &gt;&gt; Will you do that? You might have given up. I would have given up. But this man kept going &gt;&gt; and one day he met the man himself &gt;&gt; that sent the angel every year. &gt;&gt; That's right. Of course, he didn't know that was the man. He was an ordinary man. But Ram said he was like a he wasn't even 6 foot. He was 57, 56 somewhere. A very lanky fella because he was fasting all the time. He doesn't eat much. And he met this man and he said, "Do you want to be made whole?" said, "Well," he started narrating his story. Well, for 38 years, I've tried all the time, you know, God since Jehovah sends angel to to kind of shake the water and I try to go and somebody goes ahead of me. Jesus said, "Do you want to be made whole?" I'm not interested in your past. &gt;&gt; God doesn't care about your past. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care about your mistakes, &gt;&gt; your failures, &gt;&gt; then change. He want to give you the change. &gt;&gt; So your past because you fail. That's why he's here to give you the change. &gt;&gt; So you respond to the changes given to you. &gt;&gt; Like Mary, let it be according to according to your word. Like the woman of Samaria, Lord, give me this water to drink. Like he did right. You've said the right thing. And when you say the right thing, the word will come to you. And now the man begin to cut the revelation and said I want to be made whole. Said now stand up and walk. &gt;&gt; You don't need to go wash us go to the poor anymore. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometime God will cut the processes. &gt;&gt; We are human beings. We reason. &gt;&gt; We have imaginations. &gt;&gt; We have memory. We have affection. And that is sometimes that that bring limitation. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; There's three kings, five kings in the flesh. Seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and what? Uh the fifth one I remember. &gt;&gt; Feeling that's the five kings of the Amorite and dub side. We need to kill those five kings. &gt;&gt; And other five kings that is what? Memory, affection, reason, imagination, and conscience. We have to kill those five kings as well. &gt;&gt; Cuz that five kings will lay you where you are. &gt;&gt; And you're going to try whipping the dead horse. try to get a dead horse to to rise up and and and gallop with you. No, it's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; But there's 11th king. &gt;&gt; That is the fifth king. That is king Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; King faith, king belief, &gt;&gt; king, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; That is the king that you have to resurrect in your heart. &gt;&gt; And when you believe that king, nothing shall be possible with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus has to bring this man from all the 38 years of failures to know that this is another age. &gt;&gt; This another season. This is a blessing for you. God is doing new things in your life and the man got his his health the way he wanted begin to walk. Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you need in your life? My brother, my sister that the Lord can't do for you. &gt;&gt; Let's read the last quotes. We just coming to an end. uh 19 future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride 640802 paragraph 525 but went through changes too in his ministry he said I rec I recognize the divine presence of the being of Christ who is the word and the bible said that the word is powerful than two-edged sword and it cuts to the marrow of the bone and descend the thought that is in the heart revealing the secret of heart look why I didn't know those things years ago go and when I said it not knowing it look like look what he's done he said now you take the people by the hand and don't think nothing just speak what attribute is told you say it it's a tumor whatever it is then said it will come to pass that you have to do that see it will discern the very thing that is in them amen and of course he talk about he said now we had all kinds of impersonations. We know that almost to deceive the elect if it's possible. Watch how the rest of the things goes with the word. Then you'll know whether it's right or not. But still Jesus Christ remains the same yesterday, today and forever more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham had to go through changes. &gt;&gt; What is the change? When the Lord called him, angel of the Lord told him, go and pray for the people of the world. You hold them with your hands, I think left or right hand, and you see a vibration, your hand will swell. And if it's infection, let's say bacterial infection, HIV, you'll be able to tell them what is going on in their life. But God move him to another step further. He said, "Now I'm not going to tell you nothing. Before then, you will see a vision. You see the the clothes that you wearing, a brother wearing a checker shirt, a sister wearing this dress, and everything before he goes to the meeting." That's right. &gt;&gt; Even those who were opposing him, the Lord reveal everything to him. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And he know their names, what they were thinking. the secret meeting. They were trying to destroy his meeting. He know everything. &gt;&gt; But there was a time God said, "I know. I'm not going to show you no vision. &gt;&gt; You're just going to go there blank &gt;&gt; blank slate. No vision. You don't know ahead of time." And when you go, whatever comes out of your heart. &gt;&gt; If it's tumor, just say tumor and bring the tumor demon out of their life. If it's HIV, if it's cancer, just say it &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Some it will tell you. In other words, the pill of fire will tell without you having a proud vision. That's right. &gt;&gt; And sometime the Lord will want circumstances to be dressed right, dressed right, just right. But God doesn't need circumstances. He need your faith. &gt;&gt; Just like you run a prophet through certain things, God will place things everything for you to get it. Certain times he just want to go blank faith &gt;&gt; and just believe &gt;&gt; and brother that pleases the Lord more than God make things comfortable for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even our ministry, the Lord brings certain things like it feels so challenging. How can I do this, Lord? But just move. And as you move, the Lord bring things to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By faith, we have the church already. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is also a transition. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it shall come to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church is sitting somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether it's a brand new church or something going to buy and remote, it is still there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you believe, speak it and just rejoice. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about circumstances. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is just bringing changes from today when I was driving I drove I was thinking do I go through Okchobee? I said no let me go through uh what they call the other way Jag road. So I went through he look at the old church and drove through the school look at the school and drove through here &gt;&gt; and I said this is the transition. Glor &gt;&gt; I came here when when when when closed the dollar shop right he hill &gt;&gt; and now then to the school &gt;&gt; and now here &gt;&gt; thank God but here is still not the final final place &gt;&gt; it's relaxing and comfortable thank God &gt;&gt; way better than the school &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; we don't have to park and things like that &gt;&gt; but yes sir it is not our own place &gt;&gt; you don't you don't have &gt;&gt; the full control amen &gt;&gt; when God gives something to you &gt;&gt; all It's for you, brother Jack. Amen. It's for you, sister Erica. Sister Sarah, Sister Cab. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Xavier, it's for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somi is for you. &gt;&gt; Brother Nemiah is for you. &gt;&gt; And you said, "The Lord gave me brother Nehemiah &gt;&gt; and nobody can take it from me." &gt;&gt; But we can't. God didn't give it to you. You are the preacher, but God gave me better than Nehemiah. It's mine. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And it's mine and mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God gives something to you, it's for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil cannot take the blessing from you. &gt;&gt; You can even sleep and God will come and wake you up and say, "My daughter, take this your blessing." &gt;&gt; You can wake up and the Lord, you check an email. Where's this email coming from? Where's this money coming from? &gt;&gt; H this doesn't is not real. &gt;&gt; It doesn't look to be real. &gt;&gt; There was one time I had a amount of money in my in my account and I used to say with H Bank of America and I saw the money. I said, "No, this not real. I have to go to the bank." I didn't even drive. I said, "Bank of America is right here. I'll just run and go and check to see if this money is for real." And I went and the money was for real. I said, "Glory, hallelujah to the Lord." &gt;&gt; God will give you what what what is for you. &gt;&gt; And it's not the money that I desire, &gt;&gt; but it was meant for me. So God impressed upon a friend. This friend wouldn't let me. So like, "Go get it. Go get it." I said, "No, it's it's pass. It's pass." He pushed me to lie. I couldn't rest &gt;&gt; and I had the money drop in my account. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; God will give it to what belongs to you. &gt;&gt; He's interested in your affairs. Everything about you, God is interested. The little things and the big things, he's interested in you. &gt;&gt; Just change. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think we are the last but one slide. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Oh, that's the last slide. Slide 10. Something like that. I hope I didn't miss nothing. You are changed. Amen. You are changed into the sun as the brother had a vision from a blizzard doesn't know where he's going to be and the prophet led him go through the processes four-legged in life you go through the where visions and dreams are symbols in life you go through certain stages go through the school room come to the tabernacle but God got your church by the jack for you &gt;&gt; where you you feel the most comfortable &gt;&gt; to pastor the congregation of the Lord &gt;&gt; where you don't feel hindered you don't have to pack rush and where you can have meetings and invite people from all around to come and enjoy the goodness of the Lord. Amen. So we are changed into the image of the son of God. You are a son of God. You are a daughter of God. All the blessing is for you. You are born to be a ruler. Where do we rule? You rule as a son and daughter on this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who was the God of this earth? Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam and his wife. They were all Adam. &gt;&gt; Mr. and Mrs. Adam. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They were ruling the earth. &gt;&gt; The animals. God didn't say, "I'm the god of this earth. Are you my son? &gt;&gt; You are the God of this earth. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God has made you a god of this earth. &gt;&gt; In your home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your workplace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even your company. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the one. Your blessings go around the people. They may not know it. They will not recognize it. But you are the one that bring blessing around them. &gt;&gt; And God take us through transformations from calling us elected seed to be a bride. And then he marries you and give you the Holy Ghost baptism and put a wedding ring the token on you. &gt;&gt; All right. And then you go into a queen, a king and a ruler. And only eagles can go through that stage. You are changed. You have arrived. The Lord Jesus Christ bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we pray? Our Lord and father, we thank you this day.

Certainly appreciate the word of the Lord. Uh on today, Brother Quu was uh talking about uh not trying to revive a dead horse and uh took me back in my mind on on um man changed, you know, that that that took place for me um when we started Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. And uh I remember going to school one weekend and I I I didn't want to go to school because it was a Friday, Saturday, Sunday uh class and I say I I don't want to miss church, you know. I I I I I really don't want to do this. But it was in order to graduate I had to take this class. So you know I went and uh and I believe um they required us to read a book and only book I like reading is the Bible. Uh, but we had to read this book and I say, "I'm a right to get through class. I got to I got to do this." And I remember reading a book and recently, you know, I was at the house and going through my office doing some cleaning and I and I and I saw a report that I wrote on that book and I reread that report and I was like, "Oh my goodness." Um, looking back 20some years and to see the change that took place. But the name of the book was Who Moved My Cheese? &gt;&gt; And and if you have if you have if you're a person that that that uh is in a season of change, it's a good book for you to read. Who Moved My Cheese? And uh and and now cuz cheese was something different for everybody. uh like what brother Quaker was just saying that he was in a particular job certified but like God got more for me than this right here. So his cheese was moving, &gt;&gt; right? And he had to realize in order to get more, you got to leave that situation. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You you have to be willing to make changes &gt;&gt; if you want more from God. Right. And and and sometimes God will put you in a situation he stirs you up just a little bit, makes things a bit uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I I know we got We're running out of time, but I I feel like sometimes it's the it's the mother eagle making the little eiglets feel a little bit uncomfortable inside the nest. And sometimes when it's time to make change, she takes the eaglets out and she drops them for their first flight. And if they have the instinct on the inside to just stretch those wings out and begin to soar, then she know, okay, they got they're doing exactly what they're supposed to do. But if they don't have that and they begin to tumble and fall and do all kind of other things, she would she grab one with a claw. She'll grab another one with a bead and she'll make sure they get back to safety, you know. But she said, "Now look, you were born to be eagles. And at some point in time, you going to have to use what God gave you, but you got to be willing to make change." Hey, &gt;&gt; that who moved my cheese changed my mentality. [Music] &gt;&gt; And and from that book, I'm telling you, that was the seeds of Spirit and Truth Tabernacle being birthed. From that little book, God knows how to do things. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I I appreciate the word of the Lord on today. This was this was for me. This was for me. [Applause] Let me just have a word of prayer. We have to make a change. I receive what brother Quu said. This is just part of the journey. It's part of our story for his glory. Let's pray. Father, we thank you. Thank you for your servant just getting himself out of the way and allowing you to use him to speak to our hearts. We have been blessed by your word. And father, we are declaring that we will be all that you have called us to be. Our hearts say yes. Our will says yes, our mouth says yes. And as brother Quin says, say we're millionaires. I I I claim that I'm a millionaire. I I I'm speaking it. That's that's who I am because that's what you got for me, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, I I pray your blessings upon the saints as they prepare to leave this place, but not your presence. Give traveling mercies to everyone as they go and bring us back at the appointed time on Wednesday night. meet us once more is our prayer. Ask that you would cover each one and God that you would give them God ideas, Lord, that they would be able to go forth and accept this change, Lord, that is that is that is coming upon us. Father, there's you're you're moving and Lord, we want to be sensitive to the move of the spirit. Pray your blessings upon each heart, Father, is our prayer. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. I I was also going to mention, you know, one of the other changes we got today is we added a third camera. Uh so they're going to be able to pick up the audience from the front now. It's changes happening all around you. We thank God for all things. God bless you. The brothers will dismiss you at this time. I'll say yes. Oh Lord, I grieve my desire. Passion is to be what you call me to be. That's what I need. [Music] Oh, I will be what you call me to be. Oh Jesus, I'll see it. Lord, I agree. My desire. All that need is to be where you call me to be and that's what I will be. Yes. I will be what you call me to be. I say yes. Oh Lord, I agree. My desire. [Music] I'll be want to be. I will be. Hey, that's where I will be. [Music]
