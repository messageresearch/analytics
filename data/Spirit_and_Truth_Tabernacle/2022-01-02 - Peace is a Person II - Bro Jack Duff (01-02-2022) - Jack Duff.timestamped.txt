[6:02] [Music]
[6:08] praise the lord
[6:09] [Applause]
[6:12] hallelujah
[6:13] [Music]
[6:14] praise the lord we never want to get
[6:16] ahead of god
[6:17] i was thinking on our way driving here
[6:19] about cain how he tried to get ahead of
[6:21] god
[6:22] you know the bible says that he offered
[6:25] abra offered unto god a more excellent
[6:27] sacrifice than cain which means cain's
[6:30] sacrifice was excellent it was just out
[6:32] of season
[6:33] remember jesus was the first fruits
[6:36] of the resurrection so he was trying to
[6:38] get a resurrection without a death
[6:40] amen he also named his first son
[6:44] enoch
[6:45] he also was trying to get a rapture
[6:47] without a death
[6:48] praise lord so we want to wait on god we
[6:50] don't want to get ahead like cain
[6:52] praise the lord um
[6:54] actually uh
[6:57] i didn't have a psalm to read this
[6:59] morning
[7:00] i was actually praying to the lord this
[7:02] earlier this week about some things
[7:05] and i really wanted to know
[7:10] about
[7:11] why we are not
[7:13] me and my family haven't moved here yet
[7:16] so i was praying about some things and
[7:18] my wife she she woke up early that
[7:20] morning and
[7:21] she saw something that she posted years
[7:24] ago on facebook
[7:25] and it's a it's a quote and i want to
[7:27] read
[7:28] to you what it was and it sort of sort
[7:30] of answered my prayer
[7:33] instead of reading this psalm this
[7:34] morning
[7:36] the prophet says one night as i was
[7:38] seeking the lord the holy spirit told me
[7:39] to pick up my pen and write
[7:42] as i grasp the pen to write
[7:44] his spirit gave me a message for the
[7:46] church i want to bring it to i want to
[7:49] bring it to you
[7:50] it has to do with the word and the bride
[7:53] those in the bride do only his will
[7:56] no one can make them do otherwise
[7:59] they have thus saith the lord or they
[8:01] keep still
[8:02] they know that it has to be god in them
[8:05] doing the works
[8:07] fulfilling his own word
[8:09] he did not complete all of his work
[8:11] while in his earthly ministry
[8:13] so now he works in and through the bride
[8:17] and that was the key for me
[8:19] she knows that for it was not yet time
[8:22] for him to do certain things that he
[8:24] must now do
[8:26] but he will now fulfill
[8:28] but he will now fulfill through the
[8:30] bride that work which he left
[8:33] for this specific time
[8:35] and right there is where i found my
[8:37] answer i believe we all
[8:39] can find our answer there for this is
[8:42] our purpose
[8:43] which makes it our protection
[8:45] praise lord let's buy our hearts
[8:46] almighty god
[8:48] father god you speak to us in so many
[8:50] different ways lord but we can find lord
[8:52] pinned in the pages of the bible lord we
[8:54] can hear lord from the message of the
[8:57] hour lord god what you have spoken to us
[8:59] in this day
[9:00] father
[9:02] we have so many desires lord but our
[9:04] main desires to fulfill your will we're
[9:07] here to perform the work that you left
[9:08] for us to do lord so father god as being
[9:12] a part of the bride of the lord jesus
[9:13] christ we have gathered together to
[9:15] receive instruction this morning lord
[9:17] god on how we must make our next move

[9:22] spirit lord and as you will speak to us
[9:25] lord through our pastor father god as

[42:47] covert and there's so many others that

[43:09] and i um
[43:11] we did reach out to the um
[43:14] uh the team here the janitorial team
[43:17] they told us that the ac is actually
[43:19] broken
[43:20] and that's why we don't have ac this
[43:22] morning

[43:24] know if we had our own building and the
[43:26] ac was broken you know we do we keep
[43:28] worshiping
[43:30] and keep worshiping
[43:32] and if you think this hot you really
[43:34] don't want to go
[43:36] amen to the alternative when you leave
[43:38] here so
[43:39] let's get the word in our hearts and
[43:41] amen let's live this let it transform us
[43:43] and make us who we need to be in christ
[43:46] amen i won't uh have you stand too long

[43:58] bless you amen good to have you uh with
[44:00] us amen visiting from south carolina
[44:05] uh we those that we did not get an
[44:07] opportunity to do we want to wish you a
[44:09] happy new year
[44:11] we celebrated it by going there to be in
[44:14] service with brother westco and we had a
[44:16] wonderful time
[44:18] there you know at the service and
[44:21] i was just kind of flying back in on new
[44:23] year's eve i was up in north carolina
[44:25] they had went to youth retreat
[44:28] this year that i was supposed to be
[44:30] ministering at and they had to cancel it
[44:32] because of
[44:33] you know just not wanting to have an
[44:35] outbreak a man of covet amongst
[44:38] the saints so they did a
[44:40] like a virtual stream of the service uh
[44:42] there in north carolina and had me and
[44:45] brother stephen coffey and brother
[44:47] burley williams we were the guest
[44:49] speakers and you know they just kind of
[44:51] went to the church and let a few people
[44:53] in and just streamed it and
[44:54] and uh just really really blessed uh
[44:57] i've been hearing uh we were in prayer
[44:59] on tuesday night the brothers were in
[45:01] and brother simba began to pray and in
[45:04] his prayer he start talking about
[45:08] we
[45:10] our purpose is our protection and then i
[45:13] heard brother solomon say it this
[45:14] morning her brother troy said on
[45:16] wednesday night which i was blessed by
[45:18] brother troy's sermon on wednesday night
[45:20] and uh just you know just different ones
[45:22] that i'm hearing that purpose into
[45:23] protection so that was the thought that
[45:25] i used um just kind of talking a little
[45:27] with my wife and she was just
[45:29] encouraging me so that was the thought
[45:30] we used on wednesday night while we're
[45:32] there your purpose is your protection we
[45:34] had a wonderful time and and then i had
[45:36] to kind of form a quick um presentation
[45:41] something i've never taught here i've
[45:43] only talked about it to different ones
[45:45] individually and i finally put a
[45:48] presentation with it and i called it
[45:50] the four tires of marital relations
[45:55] and
[45:56] so i was up to about two something in
[45:58] the morning trying to get it all
[45:59] together and and the lord used it for
[46:01] his glory uh there while we were uh in
[46:05] north carolina so at some point in time
[46:07] i'll bring that amen to the church the
[46:10] four tires of marital uh relations amen
[46:14] all right um so
[46:17] let's just turn our bibles here to
[46:19] john 14
[46:22] and
[46:23] i don't think i'm going to be able to
[46:24] keep on my jacket today because

[46:39] it verse um

[47:17] come unto him and make our boat with him
[47:20] he that loveth me not keepeth not my
[47:23] sayings

[47:30] sent me
[47:31] these things have i spoken unto you
[47:34] being yet present with you
[47:36] but the comforter which is the holy
[47:38] ghost
[47:40] whom the father will send in my name
[47:43] he shall teach you all things
[47:46] and bring all things to your remembrance

[48:05] troubled neither let it be afraid
[48:09] amen the lord had a blessing to reading
[48:11] this word let's just
[48:13] have a quick word of prayer
[48:15] father we
[48:16] certainly appreciate
[48:18] the ability to read the scripture
[48:21] but we know it takes the holy spirit to
[48:24] help us understand
[48:26] what it is that we have read and god not
[48:29] only what we've read but how we apply it
[48:31] even to life today so god we ask that
[48:33] you at this minister to our hearts
[48:36] thank you for um the opportunity to
[48:39] gather and
[48:40] might not be the the uh the conditions
[48:43] that we're most uh accustomed to but we
[48:46] know there's saints all over this world
[48:48] that's gathering in much worse
[48:51] conditions
[48:52] and they're not complaining they're
[48:54] actually so happy to be amen
[48:56] uh present and in your presence god help
[48:59] us to have an attitude of gratitude
[49:03] and uh god forget about all these other
[49:05] things and lord let us hear the word and
[49:08] not let the enemy distract us amen this
[49:10] morning but help us to hear the word and
[49:12] what you want us to hear today and
[49:15] thank you for the school that has opened
[49:17] their doors to allow us to come in and
[49:19] to fellowship uh uh here god we're
[49:22] grateful for it so bless those that are
[49:24] working on the problem and on the issue
[49:26] god uh bless them and and we certainly
[49:29] god i want to be a help to them not a
[49:31] hurt to them so help us god just to
[49:34] endure amen this time and use uh use it
[49:37] for your glory for your honors in jesus
[49:39] name we pray amen you can be seated amen
[49:43] in the presence of the lord we certainly
[49:47] also want to thank the lord for
[49:49] watching over all of the saints that had
[49:51] been traveling
[49:54] over this past week not just myself i
[49:56] know that uh assistant tina a man
[50:00] went up to
[50:01] south carolina there and and and
[50:04] the silvers
[50:06] uh i don't know where they went they
[50:08] just
[50:09] they just all over the place but uh we
[50:12] thank god for just watching over them
[50:14] and i know that sister michelle uh also
[50:17] is uh her and sister charissa in texas
[50:19] and brother clinton they text me on
[50:21] yesterday let me know that they were in
[50:23] texas
[50:24] uh so just all the saints that are
[50:26] traveling right now we really thank god
[50:28] for that and just pray that god will
[50:29] just give them uh traveling mercies amen
[50:32] um we want to continue our uh thought if
[50:36] peace is a person
[50:39] amen peace is a person i made mention of
[50:43] um
[50:44] of this on last week and i just want to
[50:46] kind of open up by reading a little
[50:48] quote from
[50:49] uh the message
[50:52] uh let's see here possessing all things
[50:56] amen i made mention this last week but
[50:58] we we we're we wanted to just prove that
[51:00] peace itself was a person uh we we have
[51:03] received uh here you know we just kind
[51:06] of i guess we just finished the
[51:08] christmas season i think we did uh but
[51:11] but uh in um
[51:13] you know just in the scripture we were
[51:16] uh
[51:17] told
[51:18] that
[51:20] isaiah said that he would be called
[51:22] wonderful counselor mighty god
[51:25] everlasting father said the government
[51:27] would be upon his shoulders and you know
[51:29] he would be the prince of peace
[51:31] uh so just just by reading scripture we
[51:34] can clearly see that jesus himself is
[51:37] peace and without jesus uh there is no
[51:41] peace there is no peace
[51:43] after i finished the sermon last week
[51:45] brother solomon sought me out and was
[51:47] just kind of sharing a testimony with me
[51:49] there was a brother he was telling me
[51:50] that was a a a a minister
[51:53] and he was young and young in the
[51:55] ministry and and uh you know he just had
[51:58] a real zeal about just preaching the
[52:01] gospel so
[52:03] he did something i think he was in a
[52:05] mall or something like that and somehow
[52:06] he got the
[52:08] uh security guards all wrapped up in
[52:10] something
[52:11] and uh and as they got wrapped up he
[52:14] locked the doors went to the intercom
[52:16] and just start preaching the gospel
[52:18] uh to all the people inside you know the
[52:20] mall and and as as he was preaching you
[52:23] know some was enjoying it some are like
[52:25] why is this guy doing this to us and you
[52:27] know it was just you know someone's just
[52:29] totally offended that this man would
[52:30] take an opportunity like that so finally
[52:32] when they got the doors open and got
[52:34] back in there they got him and arrested
[52:36] him
[52:36] and uh took him on the to the uh uh you
[52:39] know to jail and everything and so his
[52:42] his day had come up uh where he was
[52:44] supposed to go before the judge
[52:46] and the and the judge was you know kind
[52:48] of saying hey we got you on this charge
[52:52] of disturbing the peace
[52:54] you say what you got to say you know on
[52:57] this we got you on this charge you you
[52:59] disturb the peace and
[53:00] and um
[53:02] thank you
[53:04] um you know and and as um you know as
[53:07] they got him on the charge you know the
[53:09] man could only come back to a scripture
[53:12] that the lord had given him and uh he he
[53:15] cried out
[53:16] according to my bible there is no peace
[53:19] saith the lord unto the wicked.
[53:24] and uh it went when he when he said
[53:26] there is no peace saith the lord unto
[53:28] the wicked the judge said case dismissed
[53:31] because that's exactly the truth amen
[53:34] you couldn't disturb the peace amen if
[53:36] they don't have peace
[53:38] hallelujah if you're wicked you don't
[53:40] have peace you'll never have peace if
[53:43] you're a wicked person amen uh you know
[53:46] and what we find out if you're addicted
[53:48] to evil
[53:49] right you'll never have peace until you
[53:51] come in contact with the lord jesus
[53:54] christ that's the only way that you can
[53:56] have peace
[53:58] hallelujah hallelujah so here you know
[54:01] we we um just establishing a man out of
[54:04] this quote here
[54:06] uh peace is a person possessing all
[54:09] things the prophet says this
[54:11] we find
[54:12] in this great story that abraham on the
[54:14] road back coming uh back after
[54:18] the victory was over
[54:20] amen uh he met the possessor of heavens
[54:24] and earth melchizedek which is the king
[54:27] of jerusalem king of salem which was
[54:30] jerusalem which is king of peace so
[54:34] melchizedek a man the the individual is
[54:37] the king of peace and jesus also is the
[54:40] prince of peace right so so we know
[54:42] peace is a person amen he says which is
[54:45] the king of peace which is a king of
[54:47] righteousness he had no father he had no
[54:49] mother he never did begin he never will
[54:53] end
[54:54] so that was nothing else but the
[54:56] almighty and he met him on the road home
[54:59] from the slaughter of the king he met
[55:01] the possessor the one who owned all
[55:04] things met him on the road back what a
[55:06] glorious thing says now abraham i like
[55:09] this abraham was heir to all
[55:12] by the promise so he can lay claim on
[55:14] everything that was in the land and the
[55:17] land itself can i say that again amen
[55:21] abraham glory to god was heir to
[55:26] all
[55:28] hallelujah by the promise
[55:30] amen and he could lay claim
[55:33] oh my god
[55:35] he can lay claim to everything that was
[55:37] in the land
[55:39] hallelujah church amen and and this is
[55:42] what we got to realize as abraham's seat
[55:46] we also are heir to everything god
[55:48] promised
[55:49] amen no matter what it is that we go
[55:51] through no matter how long it takes amen
[55:54] that ain't got nothing to do with the
[55:55] promise of god being made manifest if
[55:58] abraham had to wait 25 years on a
[56:01] promise amen we may have to wait a few
[56:03] years for something to take place but
[56:04] hold to your confession
[56:07] hallelujah amen according to the
[56:09] scripture abraham's faith got stronger
[56:12] as the days got went by he did not get
[56:15] weak in faith but he got stronger in
[56:17] faith kept confessing that promise and
[56:19] we're going to keep confessing the same
[56:21] thing
[56:22] hallelujah to the lamb of god amen and i
[56:26] confess that last year amen and and i'm
[56:29] confessing again this year i believe
[56:31] this year going to be the year that god
[56:32] gonna plant me in the land
[56:36] god gonna plant the church in the land
[56:39] i'm claiming this year you know because
[56:42] one of these days i'ma walk out and step
[56:44] right into
[56:45] my promise
[56:47] hallelujah to the lamb of god amen you
[56:50] got to start claiming your promises
[56:53] don't let the devil just push anything
[56:54] on you just stay with what god promised
[56:57] you it's not up to you to bring it to
[56:59] pass it's up to god to bring it to pass
[57:02] hallelujah i'm only going to say what he
[57:04] said
[57:06] he's a god that supplies all my needs
[57:09] amen is this a need well it's going to

[1:03:03] was given was the prince of peace and we
[1:03:05] just established between these two
[1:03:07] scriptures that peace is a person and if
[1:03:11] you do not know the person of the lord
[1:03:13] jesus you can never have
[1:03:16] peace
[1:03:18] not not only not have peace in this life

[1:03:44] thing i don't think
[1:03:46] this out of lamb and the dove
[1:03:48] out of lamb and the dove and
[1:03:51] in this quote you know uh brother
[1:03:52] branham was just kind of sharing a
[1:03:54] little bit
[1:03:55] about
[1:03:56] being over in the orients and how he was
[1:03:58] there and and he noticed some shepherds
[1:04:02] and it's something that just kind of
[1:04:03] brought a a a a a startling revelation
[1:04:06] to him
[1:04:07] and as he noticed these shepherds you
[1:04:09] know there's a couple things that that
[1:04:10] he uh that he
[1:04:12] uh
[1:04:13] just observed and one was
[1:04:16] how
[1:04:17] you know these sheep were following this
[1:04:19] shepherd
[1:04:20] and they were just all in one line just
[1:04:22] kind of going wherever the shepherd went
[1:04:24] you know if the shepherd stepped to the
[1:04:26] side like this
[1:04:28] the sheep would also step to the side
[1:04:29] the shepherd moved in this direction
[1:04:32] then the sheep would also move in that
[1:04:33] direction and brother branham just
[1:04:35] watched how those sheep was just
[1:04:36] following the shepherd just just just
[1:04:38] being led by the shepherd he says and
[1:04:40] then uh he noticed also that you know at
[1:04:43] the market they would have uh their food
[1:04:46] and everything just out there in the
[1:04:47] open it wouldn't be packaged like when
[1:04:49] we go to you know to the supermarket
[1:04:51] today we got it all packaged and if the
[1:04:53] package itself is broke people don't buy
[1:04:56] it
[1:04:57] hey man you know that all they did was
[1:04:58] just put it in that package and then
[1:05:00] wrap it right you know that that's all
[1:05:02] they did they took it from amen it was
[1:05:04] out uh just out they just grabbed it put
[1:05:06] it inside the package and wrapped it
[1:05:08] they got a machine that wraps it and you
[1:05:10] just see one little poke in the package
[1:05:12] oh i ain't buying this ain't nothing
[1:05:14] wrong with the stuff
[1:05:16] i'm telling you the truth there's
[1:05:17] nothing wrong with it they oh and all
[1:05:19] they gonna do when you say you don't
[1:05:20] want it they're going to go up go back
[1:05:22] to the back
[1:05:23] open up the package re-wrap it again and
[1:05:26] put it back out there
[1:05:29] when you talk about you ain't going
[1:05:30] about just pray over your food and eat
[1:05:32] it and keep on going right but but but
[1:05:34] you know here they have to just leave it
[1:05:36] out there you know in the marketplace
[1:05:38] and he says he noticed the sheep as they
[1:05:39] were following shepherd he said now they
[1:05:41] had things that would tempt them amen
[1:05:44] these uh you know that this food he'd
[1:05:47] say these pears and all that see these
[1:05:49] things these are these this is food that
[1:05:50] the sheep like to eat and their stuff
[1:05:52] there to tempt that sheep to make it
[1:05:54] wanna you know maybe deviate a little
[1:05:56] bit but because the sheep was in tune
[1:05:59] with the shepherd
[1:06:01] hallelujah amen it did not fall to the
[1:06:03] temptation amen it stayed right in line
[1:06:07] amen going wherever the shepherd went
[1:06:10] hallelujah and we have to stay in tune
[1:06:12] with the word of god christ is our chief
[1:06:14] shepherd and we have to follow him
[1:06:16] wherever he moves we want to move with
[1:06:18] him we don't want to get out of line
[1:06:20] hallelujah glory to god we don't want to
[1:06:23] get out of step we want to stay in line
[1:06:25] with what god is calling us to in this
[1:06:26] hour
[1:06:28] now here you know i'm going to just read
[1:06:30] a little bit of this uh and this message
[1:06:33] the lamb and the dove i think i gave you
[1:06:35] e1j but i'm going to start at e1k amen
[1:06:38] e1k and it says this just a little
[1:06:41] further
[1:06:42] i seen another shepherd and he was
[1:06:45] hurting in the field and there was
[1:06:46] donkeys camels sheep
[1:06:48] goats all together and i said well that
[1:06:51] that shepherd's got things all mixed up
[1:06:54] i said i thought a shepherd just heard
[1:06:56] its sheep no he said no shepherds can
[1:06:59] hurt most any kind of animal
[1:07:02] now i want you to just kind of get that
[1:07:04] because now don't don't think about this
[1:07:06] field amen that that they're talking
[1:07:09] about and thank you lord for the ac
[1:07:11] thank you god
[1:07:12] uh but but but don't think about just
[1:07:14] this field there but think about a
[1:07:15] church
[1:07:17] hallelujah amen because in the church
[1:07:19] you have sheep that come amen you also
[1:07:22] have wolves that are come acting like
[1:07:24] sheep
[1:07:25] praise the lord amen but a shepherd has
[1:07:27] to be shepherded to everything
[1:07:29] oh my watch this now amen it says uh
[1:07:33] a shepherd can herd almost any kind of
[1:07:37] animal
[1:07:38] can almost hurt any kind of animal now
[1:07:41] hey man
[1:07:42] let's just keep going with here uh he
[1:07:44] says uh i said well why
[1:07:47] why is there why is it they all eat
[1:07:50] together he said they all eat from the
[1:07:52] same field but he said brother branham
[1:07:54] the strange thing about this that the
[1:07:56] shepherd will watch over them and
[1:07:59] correct each one through the day but
[1:08:01] when night time comes
[1:08:03] the donkeys
[1:08:04] and the camels
[1:08:06] and the goats go out into the field but
[1:08:09] the shepherd takes the sheep in the
[1:08:11] sheepfold
[1:08:12] all right he says i said uh brother i
[1:08:14] want to be sheep don't you and he said i
[1:08:16] often wonder what saint john 10 meant
[1:08:19] when he said i'm the door to the
[1:08:20] sheepfold how could he bring a man yet
[1:08:23] be a door and i asked this good man he
[1:08:25] said you see brother branham when the
[1:08:28] sheep are taken in at night the shepherd
[1:08:31] never lays down until he has counted
[1:08:35] every sheep
[1:08:36] hallelujah and then when he lays down he
[1:08:40] lays across the door and the sheep will
[1:08:43] never go over the shepherd
[1:08:47] hallelujah
[1:08:48] now a goat may go outside but a sheep
[1:08:52] will always follow shepherd
[1:08:56] all right now look at it look at what he
[1:08:58] says here oh hallelujah you know we were
[1:09:00] when we was there in israel you know uh
[1:09:03] i was um we were talking uh uh we went
[1:09:06] to this garden there and there was this
[1:09:08] man just kind of talking and he was just
[1:09:10] talking you know just about the shepherd
[1:09:12] and it says what you think a shepherd uh
[1:09:16] think about at night
[1:09:17] what do you think he thinks about it
[1:09:19] tonight
[1:09:20] and everybody's kind of quiet the same
[1:09:22] way y'all quiet right now
[1:09:23] you know and he said he said the
[1:09:25] shepherd is always thinking about his
[1:09:26] sheep
[1:09:28] he's always thinking about his sheep
[1:09:30] it's saying the other thing that
[1:09:30] happened with the shepherds say now you
[1:09:32] know while they they're grazing here
[1:09:34] they're eating here today
[1:09:36] that shepherd has already gone forward
[1:09:39] amen looking for other pastors oh
[1:09:43] hallelujah you know i'm not i'm not just
[1:09:46] thinking about the sermon that i'm
[1:09:47] preaching right now
[1:09:49] but i'm already thinking about
[1:09:50] determining that i gotta preach next i'm
[1:09:53] i'm never off duty
[1:09:55] praise god amen but that shepherd amen
[1:09:58] he has to go before to see because look
[1:10:00] y'all gonna eat up all the grass over
[1:10:01] here
[1:10:02] we're gonna have to have some more grass
[1:10:04] to take you to
[1:10:05] glory to god but but when i get there to
[1:10:08] the grass i gotta really search it out
[1:10:10] amen
[1:10:11] because it might be grass but it also
[1:10:14] may have little holes where where where
[1:10:16] snakes are sitting down in there
[1:10:18] hallelujah and that that shepherd got to
[1:10:20] be careful because while the sheep are
[1:10:21] eating
[1:10:22] amen a snake could jump up out of there
[1:10:24] and hit one on the nose and and now he's
[1:10:26] sick you can't do nothing with them but
[1:10:29] the seven is watching all the land make
[1:10:31] sure there's no rocks there make sure
[1:10:33] it's grassy and make sure they can eat
[1:10:35] real good
[1:10:37] hallelujah
[1:10:39] glory to god this is the way our god
[1:10:41] thinks about us god has already gone
[1:10:44] before us
[1:10:46] he's already searched out the land he
[1:10:48] knows it's a good land
[1:10:50] it's flowing with milk and honey
[1:10:54] god already knows these things all we
[1:10:56] got to do is just follow the shepherds
[1:10:59] don't be a goat in this hour be a sheep
[1:11:03] hallelujah let's go on in this amen
[1:11:07] amen amen all right he says uh
[1:11:10] when the sheep are taking at night the
[1:11:11] shepherd never lays down until the sheep
[1:11:13] he has counted every sheep and then when
[1:11:16] he lays down he lays across the door and
[1:11:17] the sheep will never go over the
[1:11:19] shepherd
[1:11:20] or the wolf cannot get to the sheep
[1:11:22] without crossing the shepherd see the
[1:11:25] shepherd becomes the door
[1:11:26] amen and says i'm and i said i'm so glad
[1:11:30] to be a sheep this time
[1:11:32] trials may come and go but to be a sheep
[1:11:35] brother some glorious day he's going to
[1:11:38] take us to the sheepfold when the sun
[1:11:40] goes down i'm glad of that and god saw
[1:11:43] fit to let his beloved son being
[1:11:45] represented as a sheep meek gentle
[1:11:48] little animal he says and then god
[1:11:51] himself represent himself to the earth
[1:11:53] he came in the form of the meat of the
[1:11:55] most meekest bird that flies to heaven
[1:11:59] the dove
[1:12:00] it says the dove is a peculiar bird
[1:12:03] it's a different amen bird from all the
[1:12:05] other birds in the bible we see it many
[1:12:08] times it represents the holy spirit and
[1:12:10] we notice that the dove is also
[1:12:13] the dove also is a sign of peace
[1:12:16] the dove also is a sign of peace the
[1:12:18] peace wonderful peace says it says in
[1:12:22] noah after the flood was over and
[1:12:23] judgment had brought uh to the earth and
[1:12:26] there was peace the dove came back
[1:12:28] representing peace peace with the olive
[1:12:32] leaf in his mouth let's just kind of
[1:12:33] stop there just for a moment
[1:12:35] here you know we find in the days of
[1:12:37] noah
[1:12:38] the earth
[1:12:40] uh was full of violence
[1:12:43] just like it is today and jesus said in
[1:12:45] his word he says as it was in the days
[1:12:47] of noah so shall it be in the coming of
[1:12:49] the son of man and there were a couple
[1:12:51] problems there a lot of violence in the
[1:12:53] earth in noah's day another big issue
[1:12:56] was marriage and divorce people getting
[1:12:57] married and and divorced and remarried
[1:12:59] and divorced and rematched just a lot of
[1:13:02] issues like that that was happening
[1:13:03] happening in those days and uh and it
[1:13:05] got to the point where god said i'm
[1:13:07] tired this i got to judge these people i
[1:13:10] got to judge so he he anointed uh noah
[1:13:13] gave him a a message amen i believe
[1:13:15] brother troy was telling us on wednesday
[1:13:18] night that that was a portal anybody
[1:13:20] that got inside that ark they were
[1:13:22] inside the portal they could be they
[1:13:24] could get through the judgments and here
[1:13:26] we got to have an ark today that ark is
[1:13:28] the word of god
[1:13:30] amen and i want to put it this way the
[1:13:32] reveal word of god
[1:13:34] amen because there's many people
[1:13:36] carrying bibles
[1:13:37] but they're not inside the ark
[1:13:39] hallelujah but you have to have the
[1:13:41] reveal word of god that you're standing
[1:13:43] on in this hour so here here here noah
[1:13:46] is bringing the message to the people
[1:13:47] it's gonna rain it's gonna rain it's
[1:13:49] gonna rain
[1:13:50] and uh and finally you know uh all all
[1:13:53] that preaching 120 years of preaching
[1:13:55] the only people that noah could get into
[1:13:57] the ark was his family members what a
[1:14:00] shame
[1:14:01] all the other people died outside the
[1:14:03] ark amen and we we after reading the
[1:14:06] scripture we know that it rained 40 days
[1:14:08] and 40 nights and and and every all of
[1:14:10] mankind died the only ones that were
[1:14:12] spared with noah and his family the ones
[1:14:14] that were inside the ark now after the
[1:14:16] rain had uh stopped uh noah was just
[1:14:20] kind of waiting for the sun to come out
[1:14:21] and dry up the earth a little bit and
[1:14:23] before he would come out of the ark so
[1:14:25] he he sent a raven out
[1:14:27] amen or the ark first to maybe go and
[1:14:29] kind of show some sign as to whether
[1:14:32] amen the rain had stopped and whether
[1:14:34] the earth was dry you know before he
[1:14:35] stepped out he wanted to know so he sent
[1:14:37] a raven out but the raven never came
[1:14:39] back
[1:14:40] hallelujah i believe brother branham
[1:14:41] tells us that the raven was was
[1:14:43] comfortable eating amen dead carry on
[1:14:47] hallelujah
[1:14:49] glory to god you see a dove got a very
[1:14:51] special diet
[1:14:53] hey man a dove just don't eat anything

[1:15:05] eating amen because what you eating got
[1:15:07] to get you ready for a rapture
[1:15:10] hallelujah but but here the the the the
[1:15:13] raven never came back but finally you
[1:15:15] know uh noah salmon sent a dove out the
[1:15:17] dove went out
[1:15:19] and when it went out the bible said
[1:15:20] could not find a place to rest his feet
[1:15:24] oh hallelujah and when that dog said i
[1:15:26] couldn't rest my feet so the dove
[1:15:28] actually came back to the ark
[1:15:30] hallelujah there's another thing you
[1:15:31] need to know about a dove a dove will
[1:15:34] always go back home
[1:15:38] oh
[1:15:39] jesus amen a dove will always go back
[1:15:43] home it can't find peace and it has to
[1:15:46] go back home that dove could not find
[1:15:48] anywhere to rest outside of that ark
[1:15:51] so it came back home
[1:15:54] hear that dove you know come back home
[1:15:56] and and and and uh no wait seven more
[1:15:59] days say i'm gonna send the dover i can
[1:16:01] trust this dove
[1:16:02] i know it's gonna come back if it can't
[1:16:04] find a place to rest his feet i can
[1:16:06] trust it it's going to come back so the
[1:16:08] noah sends it out again hallelujah and
[1:16:11] this time it comes back
[1:16:13] with a with an olive leaf in its mouth
[1:16:15] and that's a symbol for peace
[1:16:18] that olive leaf was a symbol for peace
[1:16:20] now it's also showing that amen the
[1:16:22] wrath of god amen had been accomplished
[1:16:26] and now uh the earth was dry and man can
[1:16:29] step out and live again and be fruitful
[1:16:30] and multiply amen but but this this
[1:16:33] olive branch was representing peace and
[1:16:35] not only that god sent this animal a
[1:16:37] dove out he allowed the dove to go out
[1:16:39] also symbolizing peace
[1:16:42] oh hallelujah
[1:16:45] third time noah sent it out this time
[1:16:46] the dove didn't come back

[1:21:18] there that i was just reading
[1:21:20] this this piece when the holy ghost is
[1:21:22] there
[1:21:23] when the holy ghost is there
[1:21:25] my i'm telling the holy ghost when
[1:21:26] you've got his peace dwelling on the
[1:21:28] inside of you it don't feed off the
[1:21:30] things of the world
[1:21:32] amen it don't want the things of the
[1:21:34] world
[1:21:35] amen it wants the things of god if you
[1:21:37] have a desire for the things of the
[1:21:39] world something wrong with you
[1:21:41] let me tell you we're getting closer and
[1:21:42] closer to the coming of the lord
[1:21:44] amen hallelujah amen we want to draw
[1:21:47] closer to him look at this he says we
[1:21:48] could spend much time studying on the
[1:21:50] dove the dove is one bird
[1:21:53] yet he could fly like the crow of the
[1:21:54] scavenger but he can't eat the diet of
[1:21:57] the scavenger
[1:21:58] amen because his makeup is different
[1:22:01] when you got the peace of god dwelling
[1:22:03] on the inside of you your makeup is
[1:22:06] different amen he has no gall
[1:22:09] the dove doesn't have a gall so he
[1:22:11] cannot digest the things that the
[1:22:13] scavenger bird would eat
[1:22:15] hallelujah he can only eat the clean and
[1:22:18] pure things
[1:22:20] amen how it types the christian that
[1:22:22] packs the dove in his heart he just
[1:22:25] can't stand the foul things of the world
[1:22:28] amen see he hasn't gotten to god no
[1:22:30] bitterness about him he's humble
[1:22:32] humility amen what's what's what's any
[1:22:36] sweeter than the cool of a dove
[1:22:39] all right all right all right it's when
[1:22:41] you have his peace because he said my
[1:22:43] peace i give unto you that's his holy
[1:22:46] spirit that's what gives you power to
[1:22:48] overcome that's what keeps you calm in
[1:22:50] the midst of a storm i don't care what
[1:22:52] you're facing just like jesus when he
[1:22:55] was on that on that stormy sea he could
[1:22:57] step up and just speak out of his mouth
[1:22:59] and the whole thing changed you realize
[1:23:01] you got that dwelling on the inside of
[1:23:03] you that when everything get rocky all
[1:23:05] you got to do is open up your mouth
[1:23:07] and speak to it and watch that thing
[1:23:09] change
[1:23:12] you got peace living in you
[1:23:15] if you got the holy ghost you got peace
[1:23:17] his peace is living inside of you
[1:23:20] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:23:23] all right
[1:23:25] i was looking at this amen
[1:23:28] uh and the next quote i want to read
[1:23:29] here is out of key to the door
[1:23:31] uh last week my my sister uh was here
[1:23:34] with us and she text she emailed me
[1:23:36] earlier in the week she would just tell
[1:23:38] them how blessed she was by the sermon i
[1:23:40] thank god for that and and she uh she
[1:23:42] said you know this scripture i was just
[1:23:43] reading i think just go right along with
[1:23:45] it i'd say i'm at it so she gave me
[1:23:47] ephesians 2 14.

[1:23:55] assure him for he is our peace
[1:23:59] for he is our peace
[1:24:02] who have made both one and have broken
[1:24:04] down the middle wall of petition between
[1:24:07] us
[1:24:08] we had no way to get back to god
[1:24:11] but when peace came that's why the
[1:24:13] angels announced peace good will towards
[1:24:16] oh man
[1:24:17] when he was born he is our peace we have
[1:24:21] who have made both one and have broken
[1:24:23] down the middle wall of petition between
[1:24:25] us now you know i want to just um
[1:24:29] take a little uh a a a a time just to
[1:24:32] kind of break that when when i looked at
[1:24:34] that word peace in that scripture
[1:24:36] in the greek lexicon
[1:24:38] amen it uh
[1:24:40] it has a number of definitions and and
[1:24:43] and one of them is it's a state of
[1:24:45] national tranquility amen exemption from
[1:24:48] the rage and havoc of war look the only
[1:24:50] way we're going to have a national
[1:24:52] tranquility is have everybody meet jesus
[1:24:56] amen it's it's it means also a peace
[1:24:59] between individuals a harmony
[1:25:01] a man uh a harmony uh and just no no
[1:25:05] this no discord here also security is
[1:25:08] safety prosperity
[1:25:10] felicity
[1:25:12] amen which felicity means intense
[1:25:14] happiness
[1:25:16] whoo amen and i like to security
[1:25:19] safety
[1:25:20] prosperity felicity amen it says also
[1:25:24] it's it's the messiah's piece that makes
[1:25:27] a way and leads a man to salvation glory
[1:25:31] to god now let me also just kind of uh
[1:25:33] uh just just state here that when we
[1:25:36] looked at that scripture in john 14 and
[1:25:39] verse 27
[1:25:40] peace i leave with you
[1:25:42] my peace i give unto you not as the
[1:25:45] world giveth give i unto you let not
[1:25:48] your heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:25:50] afraid if there was ever time that we
[1:25:52] needed peace that's this time right now
[1:25:56] amen i mean the world is is completely
[1:25:59] overrun with this pandemic people don't
[1:26:01] know what to do so much has happened and
[1:26:03] people just don't know what to do but i
[1:26:05] tell you we can have peace in this our
[1:26:07] church we can have peace god gives us
[1:26:10] that kind of peace hallelujah all right
[1:26:12] let's look at this amen we'll get we'll
[1:26:15] get is it something that
[1:26:18] i see everybody moving it just kind of i
[1:26:21] have to stop and just let let everything
[1:26:22] get taken care of because i know how
[1:26:24] that works
[1:26:25] thank y'all brothers for handling it god
[1:26:27] bless you all right let's look at this
[1:26:29] uh let's look at this quote
[1:26:31] the key to the door
[1:26:33] key to the door
[1:26:35] this peace
[1:26:36] that he gives us a man is
[1:26:39] it's messiah's peace it's the peace that
[1:26:41] leads to salvation and and the other
[1:26:43] definition it says it's a blessed state
[1:26:45] of devout and upright men after death
[1:26:49] this peace that i give you it it it
[1:26:51] caused you to be in a blessed
[1:26:52] state devout and upright after death
[1:26:56] remember the man i read to y'all last
[1:26:57] week that uh you know he died by hit by
[1:27:01] hit got hit by a car and he could never
[1:27:03] have peace because there's no peace to
[1:27:05] the wicked he kept getting hit over and
[1:27:07] over again hallelujah here we want to
[1:27:10] have peace we don't have a devout
[1:27:11] standing before god that this is the
[1:27:13] peace that he gives us the key to the
[1:27:15] door says there's only
[1:27:17] one door to peace
[1:27:20] yeah my peace i give unto you
[1:27:22] he's only one door to genuine peace you
[1:27:25] might think you got peace i like this

[1:27:35] buy your home you might accumulate
[1:27:37] enough money to get your children closed
[1:27:41] have food to eat you but you might have
[1:27:44] accumulated enough popularity to be
[1:27:46] popular amongst people but when you slip
[1:27:49] off your shoes at night and get ready to
[1:27:51] lay down there's only one thing can give
[1:27:53] you peace
[1:27:56] amen that is if you know you were dying

[1:28:21] jesus is the door to all these things
[1:28:23] and faith is the key that unlocks the
[1:28:25] door now jesus is the door to all these
[1:28:28] promises of god faith in his finished
[1:28:30] work unlocks every door to every
[1:28:32] treasure there is inside the kingdom of
[1:28:34] god see uh faith is the key that unlocks
[1:28:38] the locks blocks every promise he makes
[1:28:40] the key of faith does that faith in his

[1:29:57] uh speak unto aaron
[1:30:00] and unto his son saying on this wise ye
[1:30:03] shall bless the children of israel
[1:30:06] saying unto them the lord blessed thee

[1:30:50] prayer that the jewish believers always
[1:30:52] pray over one another and you know and

[1:30:55] scriptures amen the lord lift up his
[1:30:57] countenance upon thee and give thee
[1:30:59] peace this word means shalom
[1:31:04] hallelujah amen this word is shalom in
[1:31:08] in in the hebrew lexicon it means
[1:31:10] completeness
[1:31:12] it means soundness
[1:31:14] it means welfare
[1:31:16] amen it's completeness in number it's
[1:31:19] safety and soundness in body it's
[1:31:22] welfare health and prosperity

[1:31:56] peace you got to be a faithful tithe
[1:31:58] pair
[1:32:01] oh hallelujah how do you know that
[1:32:03] brother jack because he said that if you
[1:32:05] brought the tithes to the house he said
[1:32:07] he will rebuke the devil for your sake
[1:32:10] oh glory to god let me just stop just
[1:32:13] for a few minutes
[1:32:14] amen just for a few minutes but you know
[1:32:16] he said he'll rebuke the devil for your
[1:32:18] sake amen and i remember years ago
[1:32:22] glory to god i lost uh lost my job and
[1:32:26] and uh you know when you lose your job
[1:32:27] you don't have no income coming in it's
[1:32:29] hard to have peace
[1:32:33] it's hard to have peace you worried
[1:32:35] about how this gonna happen how that
[1:32:36] it's hard to have peace but but you know
[1:32:39] as we just kind of just went back to the
[1:32:41] scripture
[1:32:42] god you said that you rebuked to the vow
[1:32:44] for my sake
[1:32:46] policemen knocking on my front door
[1:32:47] serving me papers
[1:32:49] amen but yet and still i could i could
[1:32:51] have a peace that passeth all understand
[1:32:54] i don't know how but i know god gonna
[1:32:56] take care of it
[1:32:57] because i'm basing myself on this
[1:32:59] scripture right here you said you
[1:33:01] rebuked to devour for my faith
[1:33:05] and before i knew it god had worked
[1:33:06] things out where they had lowered my my
[1:33:09] payment my salary had decreased
[1:33:12] by twenty thousand dollars i had lost in
[1:33:14] salary but even though my salary
[1:33:16] decreased they lowered my payments to my
[1:33:18] to my lower salary to allow me to be
[1:33:20] able to afford the house god gave me
[1:33:22] peace in the midst of that
[1:33:26] oh hallelujah
[1:33:28] my wife was just having a conversation
[1:33:30] with somebody

[1:34:27] saying well you know maybe it's not the
[1:34:29] will of the lord for you to get it
[1:34:32] now that's your revelation ain't what
[1:34:33] god told me
[1:34:34] just just because i got told no one time
[1:34:37] ain't the will of the lord
[1:34:38] no no no that that that was not the deal

[1:35:43] poor
[1:35:44] but then abraham became very rich the
[1:35:47] bible even declared that
[1:35:48] so at some point the season must change
[1:35:51] and i'm stepping into peace even in my
[1:35:54] finances i'm stepping into peace even in
[1:35:56] my body i'm stepping into peace in my
[1:35:59] family i am stepping into peace
[1:36:04] give me that scripture sis my god my god
[1:36:08] amen bring ye all the tithes into the
[1:36:10] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[1:36:13] house and here's what god said improve
[1:36:15] me now herewith
[1:36:17] saith the lord of hosts if i will not
[1:36:20] open
[1:36:21] you the winners of heaven now see that
[1:36:24] was the other part i mean i think we
[1:36:25] must have missed uh
[1:36:27] uh
[1:36:28] it's the next okay all right i'll stay
[1:36:30] but this is the first part that we gotta
[1:36:32] catch i'm gonna open you the windows of
[1:36:33] heaven
[1:36:35] and pour you out a blessing
[1:36:40] that might not be the will of the lord
[1:36:42] no do not read the same bible that i'm
[1:36:45] reading if i'm a faithful tithe pair not
[1:36:48] only he gonna rebuke the divine for my
[1:36:50] sake
[1:36:51] but he said i'm going to open up the
[1:36:53] windows of heaven
[1:36:54] pour you out a blessing
[1:36:57] now this ain't any kind of blessing
[1:36:59] this is a special kind of blessing this
[1:37:02] is a blessing where you have room not
[1:37:04] enough to receive it god wants you to
[1:37:07] have peace
[1:37:09] in your finances
[1:37:12] keep on going keep going amen the next
[1:37:14] verse says
[1:37:16] and i will rebuke to the vow for your
[1:37:18] sex i like that
[1:37:20] i know god blessed me with that house
[1:37:22] that i got
[1:37:24] it's testimony behind the house
[1:37:28] i i mean you ever i went to buy this
[1:37:31] house
[1:37:32] and i we put a condition on say now let
[1:37:34] us sell our first house first and then
[1:37:36] we'll buy yours man say okay i'll give
[1:37:38] you three months to do that
[1:37:40] and i said we we went trying to sell
[1:37:42] nobody bought that house nobody nobody i
[1:37:44] said lord what's going on here
[1:37:46] so the man told me and said look now he
[1:37:49] knew something that i didn't know but
[1:37:50] it's okay i still i still take it as a
[1:37:52] blessing he knew the market was getting
[1:37:54] ready to crash
[1:37:56] so he told me say look i will pay six
[1:37:59] months of your payments
[1:38:01] on your other house if you just buy my
[1:38:02] house i said you give me what
[1:38:05] pretty much he gave me ten thousand
[1:38:06] dollars

[1:38:10] ten thousand dollars to buy his house
[1:38:12] have you ever had that happen well
[1:38:14] somebody give you money to buy their
[1:38:17] house

[1:38:20] but god
[1:38:22] this ain't number god you gonna give me
[1:38:24] how much i probably could have
[1:38:25] negotiated and got a little bit more
[1:38:28] but but but i know that's the hand of
[1:38:30] god
[1:38:31] so when the devil came to try to devour
[1:38:33] it after i lost my job god did his part
[1:38:37] he rebuked the devil for your sake and
[1:38:40] he shall not destroy the fruits of your
[1:38:42] ground neither should your environ cast
[1:38:44] the fruit before the time in the field

[1:42:45] i'm at
[1:42:46] 640119 uh the hours here if i could have
[1:42:49] been back there before the days that the
[1:42:50] world was created
[1:42:52] looked down seeing the whole thing
[1:42:54] the father had said to me what day would
[1:42:57] you want to live
[1:42:59] i would say
[1:43:02] right now
[1:43:03] this is the hour
[1:43:05] this is the greatest hour that the
[1:43:08] church has ever moved into
[1:43:11] just before the coming of the bridegroom
[1:43:14] oh the real church of the living god
[1:43:16] ought to be on fire
[1:43:18] burning with the light of the gospel
[1:43:20] being vindicated
[1:43:22] among them rise and shine for the light
[1:43:26] has come to you the light of this day
[1:43:28] isaiah
[1:43:31] was the light of his day
[1:43:33] noah
[1:43:34] was the light of his day why he had the
[1:43:37] word manifested and the gospel the bible
[1:43:40] words for this day is the light of the
[1:43:41] day what a glorious time that we are
[1:43:44] living he says now good morning
[1:43:47] it means peace
[1:43:49] darkness is gathering what's it what's

[1:43:53] isaiah 61 rise and 60 and one rise and
[1:43:57] shine forth for the light has come to
[1:43:58] you that's the reason i can say shalom
[1:44:02] the light has come to you god's peace to
[1:44:06] the elected woman
[1:44:09] everybody can receive that but god's
[1:44:12] peace shalom god's peace to the elected
[1:44:15] woman and to the elected lady those who
[1:44:17] god before the foundation world called
[1:44:20] out and ordained to that to the rest of
[1:44:22] them
[1:44:23] they will never see it they'll never
[1:44:24] know nothing about it the bible said so
[1:44:26] when jesus said so no man will come to
[1:44:29] me except my father draws them first and
[1:44:31] all the fathers giving me
[1:44:32] will come i want to say god's peace to
[1:44:34] the elected lady
[1:44:36] his peace he gives to us
[1:44:38] you know we're living in a very dark age
[1:44:41] and this next quote i want to
[1:44:43] line up here
[1:44:44] uh i want to just kind of tell a story
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:52] and then all this darkness is sometimes
[1:44:54] very hard to have peace
[1:44:57] but when you know that you have christ
[1:44:59] on the inside
[1:45:01] you don't have to be worried and frantic
[1:45:03] and frustrated like everybody else you
[1:45:05] can actually live in a state of peace
[1:45:07] everybody else trying to figure out why
[1:45:08] are you so calm
[1:45:10] i've met the person of peace
[1:45:13] and he lives on the inside he actually
[1:45:14] gave me his piece
[1:45:16] and you can have it right but but you
[1:45:18] know you you can stand there uh just so
[1:45:21] different from everybody else and what
[1:45:23] it is it's like the story that brother
[1:45:24] branham told of the the little the
[1:45:26] family
[1:45:27] that went to new mexico and they went
[1:45:29] into the caverns
[1:45:32] you know and as they were going down i
[1:45:33] think they called the carlsbad caverns
[1:45:35] and and as they were going they had to
[1:45:37] get on the elevator
[1:45:39] and then as they were standing up top
[1:45:41] everybody can see everything
[1:45:43] but as they begin to get lower and lower
[1:45:45] into these cameras in the elevator uh
[1:45:47] you know they got to the bottom thing
[1:45:49] open up and lights would shut off and
[1:45:51] they say it was so dark if you put your
[1:45:53] hand in front of your face you would not
[1:45:54] see your hand say it was extremely dark
[1:45:57] they call it midnight dark
[1:46:00] oh my god
[1:46:01] so there was a little girl standing
[1:46:03] there with a brother and with a with a
[1:46:05] father and mother and and that girl was
[1:46:07] so frantic like i can't see mama
[1:46:10] i can't see daddy now you can hear
[1:46:12] voices
[1:46:13] amen but you can't see nobody and
[1:46:15] sometimes a man uh hearing is one thing
[1:46:19] but seeing
[1:46:20] the manifestation
[1:46:22] is it's a whole nother thing you know
[1:46:24] sometimes when you see something it
[1:46:26] brings a different calm than just a
[1:46:28] hearing and sometimes when you're seeing
[1:46:30] it you know you still need to hear
[1:46:32] something too but but sometimes when
[1:46:33] you're in a state like where this girl
[1:46:34] like look i can't see nothing
[1:46:37] and i know daddy's standing here and i
[1:46:39] can feel him but actually i don't even
[1:46:41] know if that's my daddy
[1:46:44] i don't know if that's my dad it could
[1:46:45] be anybody i need to lay my eyes on him
[1:46:48] hallelujah glory to god and sometimes we
[1:46:52] get to stay we just need to lay our eyes
[1:46:54] on the promise
[1:46:55] that's what i'm expecting in this this
[1:46:57] year we're going to lay our eyes on the
[1:47:00] promise we don't heard him speak certain
[1:47:02] things word but now it's time to see
[1:47:04] what he said become a
[1:47:06] manifestation amen
[1:47:08] that girl was sitting there like you
[1:47:10] know
[1:47:11] it's kind of dark in here say i can't
[1:47:13] handle this you know i i know you hear
[1:47:15] and y'all saying you know and and
[1:47:17] everybody trying to keep her calm say
[1:47:18] that girl just just got hysterical
[1:47:20] so finally her brother began to speak up
[1:47:22] say uh sis don't worry stop crying stop
[1:47:26] being so frantic
[1:47:27] i i i i know i know it look dark right
[1:47:30] now i know the situation look helpless
[1:47:32] right now i know i look hopeless right
[1:47:35] now but since i'm standing next to
[1:47:37] somebody
[1:47:38] amen there is a man that i'm standing
[1:47:40] there and i know he's there i watched
[1:47:42] him when he came in here i know he's
[1:47:44] there and not only this man not just
[1:47:46] standing there but this man has the
[1:47:48] ability to change the situation
[1:47:51] this man right here is able to turn on
[1:47:53] the lights he said so don't worry sis
[1:47:55] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:47:58] lights so in the midst of all that
[1:48:00] darkness that boy had
[1:48:02] peace glory to god he had a revelation
[1:48:06] of who was standing in the room
[1:48:08] hey if the disciples would have had a
[1:48:10] revelation who was inside the boat they
[1:48:13] would have had peace
[1:48:15] church we know who's with us
[1:48:17] that's why we have peace
[1:48:19] in the midst of every storm he said
[1:48:21] don't worry little sis

[1:52:02] each time praise the lord all right uh
[1:52:04] you know what uh yeah okay so let me uh
[1:52:08] kind of come home with with this
[1:52:11] i was saying earlier how
[1:52:15] the way that uh
[1:52:16] god used the dove in the beginning with
[1:52:18] noah
[1:52:20] that dove went out of the ark
[1:52:22] came back with that olive leaf in his
[1:52:23] mouth and that was that that olive leaf
[1:52:26] has been a symbol of peace in the dove
[1:52:28] as well has been a similar piece to
[1:52:30] mankind uh for generations and most of
[1:52:32] them don't realize that's where it came
[1:52:34] from right out of the scripture that
[1:52:35] god's judgment had been
[1:52:38] performed and now he was having peace
[1:52:40] with man again noah would begin to be
[1:52:43] the beginning of this and here the
[1:52:45] spirit you know when jesus was baptized
[1:52:47] the spirit like a dove
[1:52:49] came and settled on jesus that same
[1:52:52] spirit is the peace that he gives us and
[1:52:53] that lives inside of us
[1:52:56] hallelujah god has always used the dove
[1:52:59] amen as a symbol of peace a dove is a
[1:53:03] man uh uh a a special
[1:53:06] animal you know uh there was a a couple
[1:53:09] statements that brother branham made
[1:53:10] about the dove let me just give that to
[1:53:12] you and i'm gonna just tell you
[1:53:13] something we'll be
[1:53:15] we'll move on he says the dove is a
[1:53:16] symbol of peace in every nation it says
[1:53:18] because of its gentleness
[1:53:20] because of its innocence
[1:53:22] that's the reason it's the symbol of
[1:53:24] peace and it says the dove is a home
[1:53:26] loving bird
[1:53:28] say the dub loves to stay home
[1:53:31] it says another thing about the dove is
[1:53:33] loyal to its mate
[1:53:36] it like to stay home it's a home loving
[1:53:38] bird like to stay home and is loyal to
[1:53:40] his mate
[1:53:42] you know years ago we
[1:53:44] we went to
[1:53:47] kimberly south africa
[1:53:49] and there in kimberly they have the the
[1:53:51] great
[1:53:52] diamond mines that they would they would
[1:53:54] they would mine and get diamonds and
[1:53:56] everything but the way things were done
[1:53:58] there in kimberley is that there was one
[1:54:00] big company i think called de beers and
[1:54:02] they just owned all the diamond mines so
[1:54:05] they they never get down their mind but
[1:54:07] they own any diamond that come out of
[1:54:09] there and you have men that would go
[1:54:12] down there into uh the mines and and
[1:54:15] they would uh
[1:54:16] they would uh they would be out there
[1:54:18] chipping and getting this and getting
[1:54:20] that and pulling all these these rich
[1:54:22] diamonds out of the rock and loading
[1:54:24] them into some cart and taking them back
[1:54:25] up and the beers just taking them away
[1:54:27] and
[1:54:28] and and chipping them and and making
[1:54:30] money lots of money off it so these
[1:54:32] these guys that were workers in the
[1:54:33] diamond mine they realized man there's a
[1:54:35] lot of money to this
[1:54:37] it's a lot of money in this you know i
[1:54:38] mean we ain't getting nothing we just
[1:54:40] getting paid for labor just to chip them
[1:54:42] out but it's more money and what we
[1:54:44] chipping at than just chipping
[1:54:46] these guys got smart so they start
[1:54:48] coming to work with a pet dove
[1:54:53] they had a pet dove that they just come
[1:54:55] on no no big deal you know and i just i
[1:54:58] feel better with this dove next you know
[1:54:59] some people
[1:55:00] go on the plane they got their dogs
[1:55:03] you know i just went up there to the
[1:55:04] north carolina i jumped into a seat uh
[1:55:07] uh you know i'm
[1:55:09] just spread out a little bit and i
[1:55:10] jumped into this little seat and said
[1:55:12] say anybody sitting here no no i said
[1:55:14] okay i sat down and you know in between
[1:55:16] it's just an empty seat and next thing
[1:55:17] you notice i hear a roof roughly
[1:55:20] they got a dog down here
[1:55:22] no that's why ain't nobody want this
[1:55:24] seat
[1:55:25] but uh but you know people it's their
[1:55:27] comfort you know whatever but these guys
[1:55:29] said you know we we got a plan here i'm
[1:55:32] gonna just take my dove
[1:55:34] and get down there and they chip off
[1:55:35] some of that rock they put a little rock
[1:55:37] over here in the um
[1:55:39] in the bin and they take a little rock
[1:55:41] and tie it to the dove foot
[1:55:44] and the dove they say now you can uh
[1:55:46] they i guess around lunch time just let
[1:55:48] the dove go go go you know get on out of
[1:55:51] here i'm going back to work they knew
[1:55:52] where that dove was going
[1:55:54] a dove liked to go
[1:55:59] a dove will go back home
[1:56:02] i mean even if you're going to funerals
[1:56:03] and you see people bring them them doves
[1:56:05] a symbol of peace right and when they
[1:56:07] when they release to dove
[1:56:09] some sometimes they don't get it
[1:56:11] released
[1:56:12] but but when they release that dove i
[1:56:14] don't care that dove can be miles away
[1:56:17] and that dove might take off going in
[1:56:19] this direction
[1:56:20] but before you know it
[1:56:23] it starts swinging
[1:56:24] and it's going right back to where it
[1:56:26] come from and by the time that owner get
[1:56:28] back home they know all them doves
[1:56:30] coming right back
[1:56:32] six seven eight nine ten don't matter
[1:56:34] they'll turn off go this way but they
[1:56:35] got to get back home because they are
[1:56:37] home loving birds
[1:56:42] brother branham told a story of
[1:56:45] a book that he was reading one time of
[1:56:47] how the the army
[1:56:51] was all pinned down
[1:56:54] and um
[1:56:56] they were fighting there in the war and
[1:56:58] they got so pinned down they they could
[1:57:00] not figure out how to get out of
[1:57:01] situation they'd run out of ammunition
[1:57:03] and
[1:57:03] they were just they were just really
[1:57:04] stuck
[1:57:06] they were messed up
[1:57:07] they knew that
[1:57:09] their only hope was to uh
[1:57:12] forgot to work some type of miracle so
[1:57:14] you know as they were there you know on
[1:57:16] the battlefield just kind of waiting
[1:57:18] uh waiting things out
[1:57:21] they finally realized one of the guys
[1:57:22] said you know i got a pigeon carry i got
[1:57:24] a dove here
[1:57:25] and uh what we can do is tie a little
[1:57:27] message
[1:57:28] on the dove's foot
[1:57:30] maybe you know it'll get back to the
[1:57:32] rest of the arm and we'll tell them
[1:57:33] exactly where we are tell them we out of
[1:57:35] ammunition tell them if we don't get
[1:57:36] help right away we're gonna die
[1:57:39] and they tied the little message to the
[1:57:41] foot on that dove and
[1:57:43] and that dove uh you know again it's a
[1:57:45] home loving bird
[1:57:47] so that dove rolls up from the middle of
[1:57:50] the the the battlefield
[1:57:52] and when the dove rose up
[1:57:55] the other army realized what was going
[1:57:58] on
[1:57:59] they knew about about they knew now see
[1:58:02] if it bit a crow
[1:58:04] they wouldn't have worried about it
[1:58:06] right if it would have been some other
[1:58:07] type of bird they would have never
[1:58:09] worried about but because they could see
[1:58:10] that's enough
[1:58:12] oh hallelujah they say they know based
[1:58:15] on a man this did that particular animal
[1:58:18] he ain't just flying just to be flying
[1:58:21] and maybe they probably also knew that
[1:58:23] we don't even have them type of birds
[1:58:25] over here
[1:58:26] but that bird there that bird has a
[1:58:28] message
[1:58:30] oh hallelujah and he said he said he'd
[1:58:32] say that that that bird
[1:58:34] they began to shoot at the birds say you
[1:58:36] know they took every gun they could aim
[1:58:38] to that that bird and he just dodging
[1:58:40] them bullets maybe got hit in one wing
[1:58:42] maybe got hit in one foot or something
[1:58:44] like that but he just dodging his his
[1:58:46] whole objective
[1:58:48] that bird is not not to go back down in
[1:58:51] the battlefield that bird got one thing
[1:58:53] on the inside say i got to get back home
[1:58:57] hallelujah and somehow somewhere they
[1:58:59] say that the dove came crashing
[1:59:02] into you know a home base and and when
[1:59:04] they realized the dove i mean not people
[1:59:07] not running from the dub they actually
[1:59:08] run into the dove
[1:59:10] they realize if this does made us back
[1:59:12] it's got something to tell us
[1:59:14] and if they looked and saw tied to his
[1:59:16] foot
[1:59:17] was a little note
[1:59:18] as to exactly where the army was and how
[1:59:20] they was out of ammunition the rest of
[1:59:22] them got their gear on and went right to
[1:59:24] that spot and saved their brothers
[1:59:27] see that dove brings peace
[1:59:32] and the dove of the holy spirit is here
[1:59:35] to bring you
[1:59:37] peace
[1:59:41] oh thank you
[1:59:42] jesus
[1:59:44] let me uh finish off with this little
[1:59:46] quote here
[1:59:50] the second quote on shalom
[2:00:01] here um
[2:00:05] the prophet says this remember when the
[2:00:06] full bible
[2:00:08] listen and closing
[2:00:10] when this full bible
[2:00:12] has been thoroughly vindicated
[2:00:16] then there will be an eternal shalom and
[2:00:18] and i'm gonna tell you
[2:00:19] um
[2:00:20] we have peace especially being message
[2:00:22] believers that a lot of other people
[2:00:24] don't have you know
[2:00:25] people
[2:00:26] people so concerned about the vaccine
[2:00:29] as if it was the you know they think
[2:00:30] it's the mark of the beast they're
[2:00:32] misinformed
[2:00:33] they're misinformed and it's not to make
[2:00:36] you go out and get the vaccine but just
[2:00:38] don't use that as an excuse that is the
[2:00:40] market of beasts don't say that that's
[2:00:41] not right that's not right if the mark
[2:00:44] of the beast was the vaccine then it
[2:00:45] would have been it would when brother
[2:00:47] branham was dealing with the salk
[2:00:48] vaccine his day it would have been a
[2:00:50] mark of the beast den right but don't
[2:00:52] don't say things like that but a lot of
[2:00:54] people a lot lot i mean
[2:00:55] i told you i was listening to somebody
[2:00:57] some well-known guy
[2:00:59] saying you know people what they call it
[2:01:02] uh
[2:01:03] not take the shot take the
[2:01:05] jab take the jab you took the jab and
[2:01:08] pretty much say you you couldn't even be
[2:01:09] forgiven of sin
[2:01:11] if you took the job like wow where'd
[2:01:12] y'all get that from what scripture you
[2:01:14] looking at on that
[2:01:16] right but it's just you know just just
[2:01:18] just misinformed but here we have a
[2:01:20] message a vindicated message and you
[2:01:23] want to know who who actually have
[2:01:25] shalom who actually have peace people
[2:01:26] that's following this vindicated word
[2:01:29] you have peace
[2:01:31] my peace i give to you
[2:01:34] not like the world i give you this piece
[2:01:37] oh my let's look at this it says uh
[2:01:40] the full bible
[2:01:42] listen
[2:01:43] uh and close and when this full bible
[2:01:45] has been thoroughly vindicated
[2:01:47] then there will be an eternal shalom
[2:01:51] eternal peace
[2:01:52] see he come and he was peace on earth
[2:01:54] good will towards men
[2:01:56] man but the world didn't receive it
[2:02:00] see
[2:02:01] see he was the peace to everyone that
[2:02:03] come to him for peace
[2:02:05] say peace on earth good will to man he
[2:02:09] was the peace
[2:02:11] at that new year beginning
[2:02:13] new day of god for why he was a
[2:02:16] vindicated light of that day see but
[2:02:19] there is more word to be a vindicated
[2:02:22] he's got to vindicate more word and when
[2:02:24] the last word is vindicated
[2:02:28] is vindicated rather than death is
[2:02:29] swallowed up in victory and the dead in
[2:02:32] christ shall rise the millennium will
[2:02:34] set in it'll be one great peace
[2:02:38] shalom
[2:02:39] let's live for that day
[2:02:41] brother sister for that one great shalom
[2:02:45] remember the bible is the fountain of
[2:02:48] all wisdom
[2:02:49] and holds all hopes to the future to the
[2:02:51] church
