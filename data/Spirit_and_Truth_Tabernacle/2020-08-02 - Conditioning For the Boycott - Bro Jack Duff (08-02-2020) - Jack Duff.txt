TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god um it didn't get to hurricane status when it got to us just strong winds and rain and um we also miss the uh the brunt of the storm so we are feeling some effects but nonetheless we're able to bring online service to you on today and and we're certainly happy um to be able to do that amen we thank god for all things as we just opened the service on today i wanted to read from psalm 91 amen seem like this is very very applicable to us here in florida as we face these various storms that come this time of year but thank god for his protection once again amen psalm 91 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the foul and from the noisome pestilence he shall covet thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at their right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high by habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he has set his love upon me for therefore will i deliver him i will set him on on him because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word shall we just bow in a word of prayer amen this morning father we are certainly appreciative

periscope uh maybe you just want to get over on the facebook stream and um glad we got two different platforms that we can use uh just to try to make things better for you amen so do appreciate the brothers just doing everything they can to try to stabilize the environment amen amen so uh i do have a couple announcements uh that i need to just bring to your attention and and i'm i'm so grateful uh this morning we we brought just a skeleton crew um to the church being that the storm was upon us but we're grateful that we we um we made it through and it didn't do didn't do that that much

brother i am so sorry that this weekend we are expecting a storm we don't know what the conditions are going to be uh so we we um i said this you know we'll make the most of what we got and we're probably going to end up having to cancel our morning service because we just don't know what the conditions are going to be but we'll try to have that the afternoon service and he made it a man by god's grace and he was just texting me like is this has the storm come are we in a hurricane no brother we we didn't feel this way so uh by god's grace he knew you were coming brother mark he spared

come on wednesday nights we'll continue to do that but everybody else will be welcome just to do the streaming live we made some tremendous improvements i believe with the sound quality uh over the last week just to kind of get the volume raised and amen it just seemed like the devil just love to try to find somewhere to attack us so we're doing everything we can to kind of keep you know keep your experience positive y'all just bear with us but uh brother ciggy there in georgia was just getting onto our uh our test stream and just giving us feedback and we appreciate that brother ciggy the lord bless you and we trust that uh you all be blessed amen by the service so wednesday nights will continue to do what we have been doing amen so everyone is welcome to join either via periscope or via facebook uh you can see our facebook name is s.a.t tabernacle you can just find that also in periscope you find spirit of truth tabernacle and you can join the service on wednesday night we're teaching in the book of ephesians we just started the chapter 2 and i'm sure that we will enjoy ourselves as we go through this amen also no uh friday night services until further notice we'll let you know when that will start again uh and sundays we will still be at 9 a.m and 12 p.m and our groups will be separated in order to ensure that we have social distancing amen in the sanctuary so we're continuing to split the church like that and have the two services until um further notice i wanted to just make mention of an opportunity that has been given to our church uh i am i'm grateful this is something that we have been praying for you all know that we we're doing outreach services over at um pinnacle palms and we've been there for a number of years but uh what caused us to have to stop is this pandemic you know we couldn't go there in the midst of uh you know some of the elderly were there we wouldn't want to be the ones bringing in anything in we wouldn't want anybody to say well your church did this our heart is just to go and serve people take them the gospel uh that's the ultimate thing the gospel must be given to the people when we're giving when we're doing uh um fulfilling the the commission the great commission that the lord jesus gave us to go into all the world and preach the gospel uh you know that's that's what it's all about so you know there are certain things that we do just to get people's attention but ultimately we want to bring them the gospel amen the hope of salvation through our lord and savior jesus christ he's changed our lives and we ought to be willing to share that with others so he can change their lives as well uh but this new opportunity has been given to us as uh pinnacle palms no longer are we able to go there and preach the gospel the way that we desire to what has been given to us someone reached out to me and said you know uh we have this food pantry that we uh have and we don't have anybody to run it it runs pretty much by itself all you got to do is take the food and just give it to the people you know but we need someone to be responsible for it and uh they took me and showed me the little neighborhood right here you know within uh within about five or six miles of the church and uh they showed me a little neighborhood of where they do everything i say wow this is this is a really good opportunity and um you know so i was um start you know just looking at it and praying about it and uh and we we decided that we're gonna take this on and it's gonna be every thursday amen i believe about four o'clock we'll be going to this neighborhood and just kind of giving out food to the families but the lord also just kind of put something in my spirit that you know while we're giving out food i would like to kind of get some cards made and i want the cards i just want them to say we pray for the sick we pray for the sick we'll have the church address on that but i want to put that those words in spanish i want to put it in creole i want to put it in english and we want to just give people an invitation to just be able to come to the house of the lord to be prayed for but before they're prayed for uh they will have to hear the gospel they'll have to hear the gospel we want to preach the word of god to them and then after they've heard the gospel then we give them opportunity to pray for pray for them and and i'm going to put on there maybe some instructions that when they're coming to the church that they'll need to bring that card with them it's like a prayer card that they'll have so when our brothers recognize that they got the prayer card you know exactly why they're here you know they want to be prayed for right they come they want to be prayed for so we just get some information from them and and then after the service we want to just minister to their needs amen uh those that would need prayer we want to minister to their needs so uh we want to do that and and i believe that's something that the lord's just kind of laid in our laps i believe it's an answer to one of our prayers of just being able to do outreach and and when we talk about going into all the world and preaching the gospel uh that's right in our own neighborhoods we don't have to go to another country to do that we can do that right here in our own neighborhoods there are people right around us that need to hear about the hope that we have found in christ so i believe the lord has given us this and amen uh sister tina is going to be spearheading amen these efforts and and if you desire and you're able to just dedicate some time it might maybe you can come only certain thursdays of the month or something like that but we love for you just to be a part of it uh we need brothers we need sisters because they're separating of the food and then there's when we get the food separated we have boxes that we'll give to the people there's sign up sheets and things that that have to be done it's going to be a really really good operation and and if you desire to just be a part of it reach out to me also reach out to satina uh but uh but just find you know maybe you can commit to hey i can do it once a month or i can do it twice a month but it's gonna be every thursday at four o'clock we'll be meeting in this place about five minutes from here five five ten minutes from the church and uh it's centrally located so i think it'll be a real real blessing so looking forward to this outreach opportunity i'm trusting that we have we'll have a chance to impact lives not just giving them natural foods amen that's to get their attention we want to bring spiritual food because that was that's what matters most praise the lord so uh keep that in mind keep it in prayer and uh you know just just uh uh if you desire to help us with that we want to and just access you just reach out to me reach out to satan and reach out to my wife amen just let us know that you're interested and we will try to get our team together so we can do this with excellence amen praise the lord so let's uh just talk about our giving here oh my um i actually updated the uh building fund and um i do need to bring that out so let me uh just mention that really really quick praise the lord i totally forgot about that but god knows if you all just we'll just quickly just mention this on the building fun [Music] the lord is good the one thing i can say is that the building fund continues to move in the right direction uh and god is just providing for us and making ways a man [Music] yeah um i i unfortunately i don't have the exact information that i need but i'll give you this here um so our goal this year was to raise a hundred and five thousand dollars towards uh our building fund uh what was pledged of that goal was sixty thousand nine dollars a man and what has been received year to date is twenty thousand fifty eight dollars in nine cent uh we thank god for that and then also uh our interest for this year is 2 278.19 that's still positive even in the midst of this great pandemic and how the um uh the economy has been impacted but we're still moving in a positive direction so our net for this year is three hundred thirty six dollars and twenty eight cent that has been uh raised and the good thing is that we have not had to use any dollar from the building fund for any other expenses it's just going straight to the building fund and uh god has been good to us so we're very very grateful uh some people look at uh charts like to say well y'all didn't do this y'all didn't do that you know what i only see positive things i see a glass that is half full uh when i look at that chart i see glass that is half full so i'm very grateful and i want to thank you all for your giving and man i believe last month there was a total of like twenty seven hundred dollars and something given i don't have that exact number in front of me because uh i left that in the office but uh but we thank god for each one and what they've been doing amen to help us get there at the end of this year this is we had a three-year plan uh for raising money and for our building fund and we will reach the end of that three years at the end of this year december will be the end of the year uh for us and uh we thank god for that anybody that want to continue to contribute we certainly welcome that but uh we will that'll be the end of you know just us doing this particular drive amen that's what we voted on and and i'm grateful that the lord has allowed us to amen a achieve amen something i was telling somebody years ago we would never in a position like this we were just not here uh but god has provided god has blessed god has made a way god has touched his people's finances and and we just give god all the glory and all the honor and all the praise so we're very grateful for that so god bless you thank you so much amen for your giving also on today you do have the ability to give here amen uh to the work of the lord you can give online of one of two sources either cash app or through paypal uh paypal we ask that you choose the option give to friend or family member and when you choose that option make sure you use the email address of giving at john423.org giving john423.org if you want to use cash app just use the cash symbol spirit and truth tea is our name there and cash out uh spirit and truth tea cash them with spirit and truth t if you desire to mail something in uh to the church we greatly appreciate that we have received some offerings in the mail and we thank you for that the address to the church is spirit and truth tabernacle 3951 have a hill road suite 109 and that's west palm beach florida 33417 amen that is also found on our website [Music] www.spiritandtruthtabernacle.org amen i was uh yesterday informed and and i've been working with uh our app developed i mean the the team that's responsible for our church app uh there was an update that was pushed down and for some reason the app is not working the way it needs to uh if you uh notice on your phone that uh it's requiring an update for your app i'm gonna advise you please don't select that because it will break the app and um and i'm working with them i've been texting them and emailing them i should say about the problems that we're experiencing so they're working on that to try to get us back up and running so just keep that in mind um one of the other things i want to make mention of quickly uh two weeks from now we are planning to do some services brother nathan bryant a man there in uh indiana um uh he was uh we were talking i want to say oh probably a year ago about trying to get some services done uh for this time of year we were looking at our calendars and and he was going to bring a couple brothers with him and and then uh i said well that'd be great we'll we'll get that set up and and then you know uh the pandemic hit and we were just like well i don't know if it's going to work because i wouldn't want to bring them into harm's way from indiana um you know because i was just told we we've become an epicenter down here in south florida and i just don't want to put you all in harm's way but i said let me just keep praying and see what the lord just gives me uh and in the middle of praying amen brother nathan has sent us a testimony of his mother being healed from stage four cancer uh god just did something supernatural god did something miraculous brother nathan has a ministry where he prays for the sick uh and uh and god has heard his prayer we were praying here like lord brother nathan has come and prayed for different ones in our church we had my own sister-in-law that was healed of cancer my mother had a problem with the circulation amen of blood and and god touched her in her body and just so many different things i had a a uncle that came here to the church that couldn't i mean he could barely walk he hadn't driven a car and and i don't know how and quite quite some time but he come here to the church got into the prayer line that he prayed for and after he left church that night he got in the car and drove 45 minutes home and been driving ever since his his appetite has returned he's gaining weight i mean everything changed went through a mighty healing right here amen just a couple years ago there was another man that came to church and he was bringing a relative of his and he had a growth you know on on his wrist and they said he came into the prayer line and he went went back home to washington dc and when he got to washington he says pass i don't know what happened but the growth is not there anymore see god is is proving that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah so as i was just processing this and thinking about what can we do here uh the lord just put in my spirit just go forward with the services amen let brother nathan and the brothers come on down and and uh and we'll we'll have to have the service services anyway we'll contin it'll be a sunday morning 9 a.m sunday afternoon 12 p.m but we're also going to add another service today we're going to do a saturday night service a man only for the youth amen this service is strictly for our young people we'll have a young minister that'll be preaching that night and uh but we only want the youth again we're doing this because of social distancing amen we can't have everybody come to the church so only the youth will be invited uh you know those uh i mean you know you what i know that some of us might uh even myself i'm over 50 and i might consider myself youth but uh you understand what i mean by only the youth praise the lord glory to god we don't want we don't want to have to turn nobody away and i don't think you fit the category you know but but uh don't don't don't please don't do us like that but but if you know we want the young people to come you know 20s 30s teens you know things like that even even some younger than that uh they understand the gospel bring them on into the house of god you know so we want the youth only that night it's going to be i believe the 15th of august amen august 15th i believe that's a saturday night and we'll probably get started about 6 6 30. i'll let you know i'll confirm that in a little bit uh but we'll get started and have a young people service and this is strictly for uh the saints that spirit and truth tabernacle i know we have other young people uh around that might be watching this even video today some of the other churches we can't bring everybody together because of the social distances so it will be available online but this only the ones that will be welcome to the sanctuary are those that are attending the church right now you know so uh we we want we want we want to do that so keep that in mind amen and uh sister tabitha you're certainly welcome to be a part of that all right amen and i gotta get brother leo and his uh his children as well we wanna we wanna make sure that they're they're they're here but uh we're gonna do that uh the 15th 16th uh weekend uh we'll have a saturday night service for the youth then we'll have a sunday morning service and then on sunday afternoon the 12 o'clock service we will actually uh brother nathan will be preaching that service so those that are attending that service those that that regularly attend the 12 o'clock service if you have uh something that you need prayer for it might not even be for you it might be for a loved one uh but if you have someone that you you want to stand in the gap for uh we will have a prayer line that service and and we want to pray for the sick now those that are not able to attend we're asking that you would do something uh unique for us send us a text or send us an email or something just let us know what what you need prayer for and we're going to have brother nathan still commit those prayers to god it would be what we call a virtual prayer line service amen so uh those that are that are on the other end we're asking that you being be in tune with that service make sure you're locked in online because when it calls out your request amen we want you to touch and agree with him and believe that god's going to do what god promised to do i i'm thinking of the scripture that uh jesus was told by the uh by the by the centurion said you don't have to come to my house you don't have to come and touch my servant but if you would just speak the word only my servant will be made whole so we we're gonna put that in practice there will be some here in the sanctuary that will have hands laid on them amen uh but there will be others that will join us online and we want to pray for your requests as well so there'll be kind of a hybrid a virtual prayer line as well as a metaphysical prayer line so those that might have a need i was at the hotel and i invited a particularly if you know anybody that fighting cancer fighting this i mean tell them to come you know just tell them to get online because we want to we want to pray for them we really want to pray for them we believe god is in the healing business we have a preacher that just experienced it with his own mother so we know that god is real amen he's not dead he's still alive praise the lord so get ready for that church amen that'll be coming uh in the next couple weeks god richly bless you thank you so much i appreciate you all amen on today uh i will uh just turn our attention to the word of the lord amen here uh this morning uh those of you that have um been with us since beginning of the year you know that we have been on a journey um i've been preaching to you uh from a prophecy that was given uh back in the 60s and man 1962 there was a prophecy given and that prophecy was written for this time and what i've been doing is just taking uh paragraph by paragraph and just preaching uh from you know just grabbing a little inspiration from that paragraph and just preaching that to the church and just trying to not just leave it as a prophecy for you know years ago but trying to make it very relevant to where we are right now um god's prophet was told pick up his pen and write and which is very very um uh significant or i should say scriptural because the prophet isaiah was told the exact same thing he told pick up your pen and write amen a particular thing so uh there was a need for god having his prophet write these things write these things and send that you know to us in our generation that we might have something to hold on to in an hour like this so i'm picking up amen from that uh on today and i want to read just a couple scriptures so those amen everyone in your home as well as those in the sanctuary let us stand as we read the word of god and uh we trust that the lord will just bless amen our uh thought amen i'm taking a title today uh conditioning for the boycott a man conditioning for the boycott amen uh let us read out of romans um actually let's read from uh revelation 13. uh verse 11 and then also we will pick up from romans 1. i left my little timer on my desk you just grabbed my um phone off my desk and just thank you uh revelation 13 and um uh verse 11 says and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth uh and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon now so that we're not too alarmed on this we see things like this in the book of revelation it just kind of throws us a little bit uh but the um um the good thing here is that by god sending us a prophet we actually have a little understanding of uh what this is saying and uh if you know i'll just read i'll read this and then i'll i'll go into that just just for a second um and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him uh and causes the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed praise the lord uh and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men now what brother branham tells us this this beast that um is spoken of here in this section of revelation uh 13 is actually the united states of america beast represents a power all right uh so here this is the united states of america and if you notice this the united states of america started off with 13 colonies uh our flag when we first got it it had 13 stripes i believe it also had 13 stars when they first created the flag so he was able to show how this is really this is the united states of america uh prophesied in scripture okay it's prophesied in scripture now when when it talks about in verse 13 he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on earth in the sight of men this was actually the bomb that dropped on hiroshima an atomic bomb that was that was coming down from the uh from from the heavens uh and that it caused great wonders people wonder what in the world they get this type of technology from right uh great wonders you you the united states of america so some of these things that that people waiting to be fulfilled it's actually already been fulfilled and actually in the process of being fulfilled revelation is upon us even right now right so he goes on he says in verse 14 and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which it power to do in the sight of the beasts saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast and this this first beast that we're talking about here in this if you go back and read the first of uh revelation 13 it's talking about the roman catholic church okay that's the first piece the first power uh that was there it's the roman catholic church it says um and and that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life um unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship cause as many as that uh as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed so if you didn't worship the image of the beast then you you die okay uh verse 16 says and he calls causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bombed to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads okay verse 17 says in that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name all right so you couldn't even uh if you didn't go along with this system you wouldn't be able to buy or sell okay uh and here it is verse 18 says here's wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 603 score and six i want to just also just go back to a quick scripture i will uh honestly this is romans 1 16. uh honestly uh i just mentioned i was trying to sidestep this particular sermon uh i was you know i was going and just looking at other things that i could preach but it just seemed like everywhere i turned god just kind of kept bringing certain things right back to the sermon so i'm yielding amen and i've learned that in my journey uh just yield to the lord he knows what he wants said and he knows when he wants it said so i'm learning that uh here in romans 1 16 uh my declaration for i am not ashamed praise god of the gospel of christ amen for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek praise the lord let us just bow on a word of prayer father we thank you for the ability to read scripture the lord we know it takes the holy spirit to lord help us understand what it is that we are reading uh here especially when we start looking at the book of revelation lord you put it there you place it in scripture for a purpose and and god uh we believe that you uh through your anointing would help us god to understand and position ourselves appropriately that we would be ready lord for the things that we are about to face lord help us god take control of our thoughts speak to every heart uh lord and only a way to you candace in jesus name we pray amen and amen praise the lord you can be seated amen uh so just bear with us as we just kind of go through this i'm i'm talking a man about the conditioning for the boycott and uh as a as i'm looking here at revelation 13 these this is prophecy this is this is prophecy there there there comes a time a man where uh we realize that the united states is represented here in revelation 13 uh and as i just mentioned this the country started off with 13 stars 13 stripes uh represented in revelation 13. and you know just uh uh uh we we can we can see just through a prophetic lens and this is the key i'm not looking at things through a uh uh a theo a theological lens i'm looking at things through a prophetic lens when it comes to scripture scripture was actually written to us by prophets amen so when it comes to interpretation of scripture we're going to need a prophet to give us the interpretation if god allowed it to be written by a prophet then he's going to reveal it through a prophet amen so you know we we take that prophetic lens and we look at what that prophet might say about particular scriptures and then we have clarity then we have understanding then we know where we are standing and then we we realize we don't have to have a fear but we can have amen the fear that we have is a holy reverence for god hallelujah but but we're not fearing all the things that about to come upon the earth because there's a promise to us as believers hallelujah amen but but here there's a a boycott a man that that is promising scripture you won't be able to buy you won't be able to sail unless you're taking uh this mark in your right hand or in your forehead hallelujah amen now now we need to understand that we're not looking physically for a mark in somebody's right hand people have tattoos all over their bodies you know and and so so with a tattoo i mean people got tattoos all over their heads so it's not going to be something physically that you're going to be able to see but i can tell you this much it's going to be having more of a spiritual implication because uh the the hand is what we use to work with amen and then the forehead is what we use to kind of think with and and sometimes we commit our work we commit our our actions we commit everything to something that's actually against the word of god hallelujah so we want to be careful of this what we want to do what we want to do in the south align ourselves with scripture amen we want to align ourselves with what god says we can't align ourselves with a man of the newest movement because there's gonna be another movement come out right we can't align ourselves with with things that are just not uh that that that that go against the word of god we can't do that no matter how good it may seem you have to watch the spirit behind everything that you're aligning yourself with hallelujah so i want i want to encourage you align yourself with what god says in his word that's the only thing that matters i want to read amen a couple of quotes here just to kind of get us started out amen we're talking about conditioning for the boycott and this message the mark of the beast uh god's prophet amen makes a couple statements here that i want to just bring to our attention he says says then i think i'll announce uh tomorrow night maybe if the lord willing says what we'll talk on for saturday night he says now tonight is the mark of the beast and tomorrow night the seal of gods they're the most uh they're they're two it says they're the two most of i guess most vital subjects to be spoke on in this day for i truly believe that we're living in the time of this investigating judgment of god now you know i'm gonna just stop and just inject something there on this investigating judgment you know uh the prophet says that oftentimes what what our uh leaders call ufos right unidentifiable flying objects they say we don't we don't know what they are we have no idea what this is brother branham tells say these are angels actually coming into this atmosphere investigating what is happening here on earth hallelujah do you realize before sodom and gomorrah was destroyed god sent down two investigating angels before he came himself and we're we're living in a time like that again where god is sending a man investigating angels and what they're what they're investigating is their they're investigating is it time for god's judgment to strike the earth i want to tell you something amen it is time for god's judgment to strike this earth people don't want to hear that anymore right but it's the truth this is prophecy that must be fulfilled we cannot leave out this part of the scripture amen god will judge the earth for the sin that is committed on this earth hallelujah let's go on a little further here he says uh i truly believe that we're living in the time of this investigating judgment of god i believe we're right in the day of it and we don't want to be radical we don't want to be fanatically we just want to approach it just as saying as the bible was speaking here and that's perfect of course it says and now in doing this we hear so many people today talk about the mark of the beast you've heard it for a long time what is it what does it where who's going to have it and if if they do have it what's it going to do to them what what could it harm you is there any harm to it it says well now we want to find out from the word of god first thing if there is a mark of the beast spoke of in the bible and the next thing what age will it pertain to and who will be the people that'll have it that's very important right says and what would you do could you have it and not know it oh ain't that something you could actually have the mark of the beast and not realize it look at it says could you have it and not know it and so forth says suggest just those questions so to the best of my knowledge that this would be one of the most vital two subjects that i could think of in the bible the mark of the beast and the seal of god amen these are two very critical subjects that must be a man spoke of so people are prepared for what is about to happen amen you can actually have the mark of the beast and not realize it hallelujah look at this i'm going further in another message questions and answers amen the prophet tells us something here we want to know what the market obese is and you know we realize there's something in the hand and something in the forehead but what really is this let's go a little a little deeper he says the mark of the beast is owned today amen so if you want to know what time is this going to happen it is here today glory to god amen it said the mark of the beast is on today the seal of god is the holy spirit amen and i remember preaching that at the beginning of this pandemic you know about that seal of god and i said there would be no killing until there was a ceiling amen according to ezekiel chapter 9 there would be no killing until there was a silly and i believe god is in the midst of sealing his people with his spirit that's why corona virus couldn't take you out amen that's why none of the other things that's rising up on earth are going to be able to take you out because god is preparing his people for his coming amen no killing till there's a feeling of the holy ghost glory to god amen look at this says the mark of the beast is on today the seal of god is the holy spirit now this is the critical thing this is why you can you can actually take the mark of the beast and not even realize it people are looking for a physical mark but it's something spiritual that we need to we need to worry about the bible is a spiritual book not a physical and natural book it is a spiritual book so to understand scripture you must get in the spirit to understand what god is writing look at this it says the mark of the beast is on today the seal of god is the holy spirit to reject it is the mark of the beast so to reject the word to reject the spirit of god the seal of god that's to receive the mark of the beast look at this it says ever who sees the holy ghost that you're supposed to receive it and don't do it automatically you take the mark of the beast because there's only two classes to exist all that didn't have the seal of god have the mark of the beast so to receive the seal of god is to receive the holy ghost to reject it is to have the mark of the beast there's a whole thing that's exactly right very simple not something a man in your head or in your hand but it's just rejecting the holy spirit hallelujah amen to receive the holy spirit is to be sealed by the spirit of god but to reject the holy spirit is to take on the mark of the beast so a person can have the mark of the beast and not even know it you know they can still go to church they can still feel the blessings they can do all of those things but they have rejected the very god that came to change their lives let me tell you something you can't live right on your own amen you've tried that many times and it has failed the only way that you can live right is you get a new heart and then you get a new spirit and then you get his holy spirit so those three things must take place inside of you a new heart then you get a new spirit not your own personal spirit but then you get his holy spirit let me tell you another way that god ordained us to receive his spirit he says he says repent hallelujah and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he says you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he says the promise is unto you and to your children those that are false as many as the lord our god should call that's according to the book of acts chapter 2 verse 38 amen god has given us instruction on how to receive him all we got to do is follow his instructions let's go on a little further here see to reject the spirit of god is to take the mark of the beast to accept the spirit of god is to be sealed with his spirit amen all right let's go on a little further here amen this is coming out of another sermon questions and answers part two glory hallelujah amen look at this it says we've got to get in the spirit because we understand that this is the last days this mark of the beast amen is something that'll be happening in this time we don't have to put this off to a man some some great day uh you know in the future it's gonna happen in this time there was a people that were living on the earth at the right time when they knew jesus was about to be born amen maybe some of those people had no idea what was going to happen but god in his uh in his economy of time he knew this was the time that this thing was going to take place that prophecy of christ coming to the earth it was going to be fulfilled and i can tell you what has been written in scripture we are underneath a prophecy amen we're underneath the prophecy the united states is in the midst of that prophecy we are underneath this we realize it is closer than it's ever been before we're living in this time right now to reject christ is a take amen the mark of the beast to accept christ is to take the seal of god it's just that simple look at this he says question and answer part two he says we've got to get in the spirit of the of the last day when the last days are here you go to the dance hall you gotta get in the spirit of dancing amen amen amen amen you know typically when people are getting in the spirit of dancing they already listening to the music before they actually get there to the hall so so as soon as amen the dj begins to play a particular song there's just something overtakes them they say that's my song you know and you go running out on the dance floor to just let loose people get into the spirit of it before they actually go out there to do it hallelujah look at this he says uh say you got to get in the spirit of dancing or they won't dance if they don't get in the spirit so you gotta get you gotta uh you gotta you gotta you go to the church you've got to get in the spirit of worship before you can worship right so if you at home amen you don't have a a big blow up big argument amen it's hard for you to come to church and worship because you're actually underneath a different spirit at that time but if you can come to church with your praise music on amen and maybe you listen to the word of god on the radio or you're listening to a tape or something like that amen somebody preaching the word of god you are getting yourself in the spirit to receive something from god hallelujah if you ever want to get something from god you got to get in the spirit to get it oh hallelujah look at this he says this he says you go to the church you got to get in a spirit of worship before you can worship the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days come now this is a critical statement that is being made the world has got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come so there has to be a conditioning hallelujah there has to be certain things take place in order for the world to get into the spirit of the last days in order for a great boycott to come there's some other things that's got to happen before and what i'm here to share with the church watch these things spiritually hallelujah i'm going to get into some things today amen that and i'll be honest this is it's not something that i usually do from the pulpit but uh and in light of this sermon in light of the prophecy that you know when brother branham was told to pick up his pen and write in light of some of that i had to address certain things amen i felt compelled as a pastor to address certain things hallelujah but but i'm trying to get you to see from a spiritual side amen i i'm not i'm not i'm not falling on this side of that side i'm standing on god's side i stand with the word of god hallelujah that's where i stand so so spiritually i want you to try to see that we're being conditioned for a great boycott hallelujah amen and this boycott goes against you you understand that because you're the one a man that refused to take the mark you've taken a man the seal of god therefore you're not taking the ark of the beast when i say you taking the seal of god that means you've been filled with the holy ghost hallelujah you pressed him in a man not only been filled you want to be refilled with the holy ghost you're constantly pressing into christ amen and with that constant pressing in the christ not only that you have revelation of the end time so you refuse to take the mark and no guess what the boycott will come against you you're the one that can't buy and you're the one that can't sell they're standing against you what are you going to do then hallelujah what are you going to do then you got to have something greater than what you got now amen let's go on church let's go on let's go on let's go that's nothing to be afraid of i mean we serve a god that would take two fish and five loaves of bread and feed five thousand just by prayer right and if he can do that showing us what the power that we have with with with within us when we have a need it will manifest itself nothing to be running from nothing to go try try to hide from this and no no no no they'll find you anyway amen but i i will tell you some really good news uh when it when the pressure really come down jesus is coming to take us home i got good news when the pressure really comes down jesus is coming to take us home that is part of the prophecy let's read let's read let's read the world's got to get in the spirit of this of the last day before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days and god promised that these things would be here and that's what we got we're in the last days and men and women are setting asleep and don't realize it now why i'll you can take it down there i'm gonna stop there i i there there's a term that people even use today right and you you you sleep you need you need you need to stay woke they use these terms they don't even realize they're being conditioned right don't even realize they've been conditioned so so here the prophet tells us men and women are setting sleep and don't realize it sleeping don't realize don't even realize what's going on we just we just we hashtag anything don't even realize what we're hashtagging ain't done no research at all just sitting out there be careful what you do church hallelujah be careful who you identify yourself with amen be careful who linked to your page all right amen all right let me go a little further i i i i want to just i want to i want to show i i'm trying to show the spirits that's in the land amen and and when i when i start showing these things i don't believe that churches should use some of the things that's happening in our world today they shouldn't use that to draw division amen because sometimes a a minister can go into the pulpit and say things a certain way and it creates more division but what we're trying to do is bring a unity only in the body of christ amen hallelujah and i can tell you this right now amen the body of christ as a whole denominational church as a whole will never unite i'm gonna tell you why because the only thing that can bring unity is when we go back and agree with the word if we're not going to agree with the word there will be no unity so this is for individuals that are willing to say lord i say amen to what your bible say i heard what this man said and i heard what that preacher said but i say amen to what the bible says hallelujah stay with me here i don't think the church should use these things that are happening amen in our world today to draw division i want to say this separate from the world and stay with the word i encourage you separate from the world but stay with the word stay with the word and it's just one letter in that that changed those two words one we add that l in there separate from a world but stay with the word look at this a couple of scriptures i want to just mention because we align ourselves with all kind of stuff and i want y'all to remember this amen first john 2 15 amen it tells us hallelujah in first john 2 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him john 2 1 john 2 15. we're supposed not when we're not supposed to love the world or the things of the world so i want to encourage you separate from the world amen but find yourself a line or stay aligned with the word amos 3 3. i'm leaving this out here for you amen before you hashtag anything check your sources hallelujah check these things out don't just just don't get wrapped up hallelujah amen and just what everybody's doing there is a spirit underneath and i'm going to show you some spirits here underneath some stuff today praise the lord glory to god hallelujah amen i realize that this is something that is going that's broadcast on on social media i realized that you know but uh but nonetheless uh that's why i said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ right i mean as a believer i want people to know i stand with the word of god look at this amos 3 3 can two walk together except they be agreed right so as we hashtag are you agreeing with this glory to god hallelujah and some things you don't have an opportunity to explain so you got to watch what you what you align yourself with you can always align yourself with the word of god all right watch this now this is a prophecy when the prophet was told to pick up his pen and write i'm going to spoken words the original seed it says uh pick up your pen and write and he said this message that you're writing 1962 the angel of the lord comes and says pick up your pen write this out because this message is for the bride amen this message is for the bride this is talking about the spirit and the bride it says so so he wrote it in 1962 and here we are you know um you know well over 40 years later almost 50 years later and here we are seeing amen manifestations of many of these things oh glory to god amen do you realize that when jonah went down into nineveh and he and he prophesied to them that if they didn't repent god was going to destroy nineveh well it was one of the greatest repentance uh uh uh uh it was it was the greatest repentance that was recorded in scripture not only did the king repent but as people around him repented they even had the animals repenting that that that's some serious repentance when the animals have to go with sackcloth and ashes that's serious opinion i say only if the u.s could be or the whole world could be brought to repentance like that you know it they it delayed jonah's prophecy for 100 years repentance delayed a prophecy i want you to get that repentance delayed a prophecy now then stop it it came to pass a hundred years later hallelujah but you know what there's been some things that's happening we probably would've you know the rapture would have took place a long time ago but maybe repentance has has caused god just to kind of let me give a little bit more grace just a little bit more grace at some point in time we're going to extend all the grace that we can hallelujah we're going to frustrate as a nation the grace of god as a world will frustrate the grace of god look at this quote the angel told the prophet pick up his pen and write this is what he wrote a portion of what he wrote i'm not giving you the whole thing i'm preaching to you just section by section now look at this elijah's behavior moses behavior john's behavior leaving their field of service many of the people didn't understand them it was because they was rejected and their message right the seed had the seed had been sown now when you look at it elijah elijah was out there in the in the wilderness and you know serving god but god called him out of the wilderness to come back and challenge jezebel and ahab you know these false prophets that they they raised up jezebel paying for him he said let the god that answered by fire let him be god that was the judgment of god striking amen israel because them serving a false god hallelujah amen when moses went down into egypt he came with the judgment of god when he was calling for those plagues hallelujah we're in the midst of one of the greatest plagues that the world has ever seen and people don't realize we're underneath judgment hallelujah you know it gets so common it's so easy right you know when this thing first started people couldn't find toilet paper but when the toilet paper got back on the shelf everybody calmed down right they don't even realize they're in the midst of judgment can't even i mean actually what happens is that we're so unspiritual that we become desensitized to when god is moving hallelujah god help me to be spiritual so i can catch when you're moving in my midst hallelujah now watch this watch this there's rejected and their message the seed had been sown judgment was next and they was a sign to the people from god that judgment was at hand planting was over now this is the statement that i'm bringing to us today this is the part that i'm really preaching this is where i'm getting my inspiration from i believe someday the real bride of christ will be forced to stop preaching i believe oh hallelujah now you know they already do it certain things that they don't agree with amen on these social media platforms they would just take your video down i'll do but they already started these things say so so so he says i believe that the real bride of christ will be forced to stop preaching now i'm going to tell you if you're going to a church and they're actually forced to stop preaching something's right about that church but if there's a church that can still preach to the midst of this this uh amen the the mark of the beast being manifested something's wrong if that church can keep preaching evidently they have not said anything hallelujah that would go against the grain let me tell you when jesus went to the cross it's because jesus went against the grain when jesus went to the cross it's because jesus went against the grain now i'm not saying amen that we just try to find things that we can just stand against people on but no what i am saying is that your faith will be challenged and when your faith is challenged are you going to stay with the word or you're going to stand with the world popular opinion is not good enough i want to stay with see the world does not have a heaven or a hell to put me in hallelujah but god does look at this now look at this i believe that the real bright someday the real bride of christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of god the bible prophesies of it in revelation 13 16 if you want to put it down denominations will force it to stop or take its mark then when the lamb would take his bride and say this is that's that's that's the part that i want to make sure we catch then the lamb will take his bride and judge the for this the he's referring to is the catholic church right he says denominations will actually force us denominations will come into amen this world council they will agree they've already they got a document that they've already signed in the past few years that all the church is going to come together and agree on on on a few things and stand together to try to try to have what we call a uh a forced unity it's not real amen but we're gonna sign this document and because you signed the document hey man you got to agree to stay unified for certain things that we're just gonna stand on now when it comes to amen uh even even if it goes against scripture they'll stand unified i can tell you there's a few people that was not a part of that signing few churches that was not there we weren't there and we'll never be invited i can tell you that much right now i want to i want to get you to see that boycott is that they'll they'll they'll stop they'll be forced to stop preaching the word of god amen and i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ they'll be they'll be forced to stop preaching the word of god as the bible prophesied according to revelation 13. there's the prophet bringing that in there that the boycott is actually coming against you coming against the church but the good thing about it is that when that occurs the lamb which is christ will come and take his bride and he'll judge the for what she's done hallelujah thank god that we got something we can look to even in a time like this let's talk talk about this a little bit more this boycott amen i said we're being conditioned for the boycott now what a boycott is i look this up is to withdraw from commercial or social relations amen withdraw from commercial or social relations with a country organization a person a punishment or protest you know years ago some brothers was telling me amen that uh uh on the previous president over and over in in in uh one of the countries in africa uh the president told them that uh if you all would just agree with uh uh um same-sex marriage if you will accept that then we'll provide funding to you we'll provide certain funding to you and uh and the leaders of the country say no that's against what we believe according to the bible we will not sign an agreement like that so they got boycotted they were not they were not able to get services from the u.s because they refused to sign an agreement like that hallelujah and when they refused to sign an agreement then all of a sudden there was an uprise in their nation and and and the news report said a particular way to us but the people that said no it's because we refuse to sign that agreement now they created this uprising our nation but you know what the people found a way to get the ammunition that they needed they went to other countries and they got the ammunition ammunition they needed and they they were able to to satisf i mean to get the people that was rising up they was able to squelch them and get them calmed down again hallelujah had they had the ammunition initially they would have never had an uprise but because they refused to sign an agreement that said they agree with same-sex marriage hallelujah now it's not just them saying that they they they disagree with same-sex marriage the bible disagrees with it hallelujah i i know people that say you know i don't want to go to that church anymore because they preach against same-sex marriages well i'm not sure what church you was going to in the first place because the other uh if you don't if you if you're a christian and don't see that in the bible we need to have a conversation praise the lord it's clear that god himself is against it so as christians we also stand against it all right i'm going further amen a boycott is withdrawn from commercial or social relations with a country organization or person as a punishment or protest is to refuse to buy or handle goods and that's to be as a punishment of protest now remember according to revelation 13 16 there's a refusal there is a refusal uh you know to be able to buy or sell if you don't take the mark of the beast and we've already identified the mark of the beast is to reject the spirit of god or the word of god to reject that it's all ready to take the mark of the beast hallelujah glory to god amen you got to choose which side you're going to be i'ma stay with what the words say look see so so a boycott is to refuse to buy or handle goods or as a punishment or protest uh to refuse to cooperate with or participate in a policy or event now i was looking at another definition the purpose of a boycott is to inflict some economic loss on the target a man to indicate a moral outrage and it's also to try to compel the target to alter an objectionable behavior oh my hallelujah now i'm going to tell you something when you're standing with the word and you're saying same-sex marriage is wrong you're gonna be boycotted one day amen they're coming against you one day but i'm gonna tell you when that happens it's because it was prophesied that it would occur and when when the pressure get too tight jesus christ will come for his pride but i'll tell you what until then we're going to stay with what the word of god says now let me go on a little further there was uh some some some fellas in scripture i was just you know just thinking to myself lord can we just go back in scripture and see where where your people were come against because of something that they stood for and as i was just kind of meditating on this on this sermon and i was you know going in different directions the brother sent me a little video last night and i knew that i had this you know thought in my mind say where where can we get you know uh somebody in scripture that might have been boycotted because they were standing with the words and i said lord i i the lord had given me uh two two boys down and i'm in two situations down in babylon glory to god and what i want to tell you is that the spirit that was in babylon that would force people to do things a certain way oh i hope we get this it would force people to do things a certain way amen and if you didn't do it the way that they were telling you to do it amen they would come against you i want to tell you that same spirit is living right now oh just let me let me just take my time to get there that same spirit that was in babylon is here today the media puts it out and don't even realize that they under the influence of the same spirit that was in babylon let me just let me read this let me read this uh just line me up uh on uh on the handwriting on the wall let me read this and i want to just kind of go into the story that was in babylon praise god just let me take my time that same spirit is here today church it's here it's here right now we are being conditioned for a boycott don't even realize it amen we hashtag it put it all over and don't even realize what we're doing to ourselves amen we got to be spiritual look at this handwriting on the wall he preaches the sermon he makes this statement says now i want you to notice as soon as the king saw the vision he saw this vision he made it he forced every person in his kingdom and his domain to worship the image he made an image and it's believed by scholars i do uh which i do believe that a spirit-filled person would see it see it that uh he worshiped daniel is is what he did and he made an image to daniel now there this is two different things kind of going on here even in this message you got people trying to have you worship brother branham we're not doing that here i will i will tell you what the prophet said i believe brother branham was god's prophet but we will not worship a man here we worship jesus christ praise the lord that's where our faith is uh our hope is in jesus christ amen so anybody come and try to i'm gonna just be honest we don't even sing songs in this church that don't glorify jesus we don't sing songs to uplift the prophet amen we said because the prophet told us he says if you read your bible i mean every scripture if you read your bible you don't see christ you need to go back and read it again amen he said the main purpose should be to glorify christ that's what we put our attention on jesus christ and what his what he has done for us amen i will re i'll quote a prophet oh hallelujah amen i i know i'm in the right spirit because the prophet prophet went to rome one time and when he went to rome they had they had an interview set up for him to go meet the pope and say yeah i would love to go meet the pope what do i have to do he says when you go you just gotta bow down and kiss his ring they say bow down and kiss his ring he said uh and when you when you walk out just walk backwards don't turn your back on the pope he says uh cancel my appointment can you imagine that you had an appointment with the pope right and you tell now the pope didn't cancel on you you canceled on the pope can you imagine somebody doing that he said cancel my appointment he says he say that is out i will not bow down to a man and kiss his ring at all if he want to be called brother if you want to be called reverend he won't this he want that i'll shake his hand but i am not bound down and kissing his ring so cancel my appointment and they canceled it too see i'll tell you what if a prophet wouldn't bow down and kiss a pope's ring and a prophet wouldn't buy it wouldn't wouldn't allow a man to be exalted in any other place hallelujah hide in christ then i believe i'm in the same spirit by saying i will not bow down and worship a prophet now you know what john tried to do that in the book of revelation john tried to do that and you know the prophet told say get up i'm of your fellow servants to brethren so you can't worship me worship god hallelujah and that's what we do here we worship god hallelujah glory to god man so don't don't get me don't get me wrong i might quote the prophet a lot but i'm not worshiping him amen my worship goes to jesus amen amen now the prophet the reason that i quote the prophet a lot is because uh it's just like in the days of moses when god gave moses a man the uh the word gaming the law as moses was taken off the scene god knew that the children of israel was going to get further and further away from what moses said as long as moses was there they stay they stayed true but as soon as moses left the scene they start getting slack even joshua's generation they got more and more slack this is why joshua had to stand before the children and say say uh uh uh uh me and my house we're gonna serve the lord right this is why joshua made that statement because the people were getting away from the word of god hallelujah our prophet's job is to bring the people back to the word of god that's what god used brother branham to do to bring us back to the word we don't worship him we will quote him to keep the people in line with what the prophet said just like joshua kept him in line with what moses said all right let's go i want to read this a spirit uh i do believe that a spirit-filled person would see it that uh he worshipped daniel it was what he did and he made an image today and he called it belshazzar he called daniel bell to cezar which was the name of his god and he made an image and forced every person to worship that image i want you to notice that the beginning of the gentiles when god dealt with them they got haughty in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man and the gentile age was issued in with that so here the gentile age is coming in like that watch this and it will go out the same way it says the same way a boycott of the mark of the beast that will force people to work worship images and to do this do the things that we've been taught that was contrary to the word of god now look at this a boycott hallelujah of the mark of the beast that will force people to worship images and to do things post and and and and and and and post things that you shouldn't post so or actually put uh hashtags in that you shouldn't put in do things that we've been taught that was contrary to the word of god brother it'll be so slick see that's why we need spiritual eyes it'll be so slick and sly until it will deceive the very elect if possible so you better purpose in your heart tonight and be filled with god's hope filled with god's holy spirit that you'll be able to discern the right and wrong thing when the proclamation is issued hallelujah i told you the spirit that was in babylon is in the world today the spirit that was in babylon was in the world today you know the hebrew boys as i was you know just meditating on the sermon and last night a brother sent me a little little clip and he said only about two or three minutes long and i said typically i don't be watching all the videos that everybody give me your phone just get inundated with so much stuff and you just can't keep up with all the information so this brother said it's just only two or three minutes i said let me watch it and as i watched it i saw all this you know they had all the people there on the video and they had the nebuchadnezzar standing there and they start playing the music and uh and and and the camera zoomed in on them hebrew boys and say all the you know they start playing the music and and as they're playing the music because the the edict was that you know if uh once you hear the music right once you hear the music then what we want you to do is bow down and worship amen this image that we just created right and uh so so here the hebrew boys are standing there and they know that they're not supposed to worship any other god but their own god right and here they're standing in a foreign land amongst foreign people not sure what would happen to them but they had a determination in their heart that they would not bow to this image and see here they standing there and and they say they say as soon as we play this music we want everybody to bow and on the video you can see everybody just falling prostrate everybody going down like dominoes they were going down but them hebrew boys were standing up their hands lifted up to god like this i said lord that right there is is is you know that's what we're coming back to this is where we have to find ourselves identified with people like that now let me tell you something when they got thrown into the fire first not only did they get thrown in and when you go back and read the scripture the hebrew boys were very important people in the kingdom they weren't just anybody's these guys were in in high uh positions of authority in the kingdom and so so so when they when they got called before amen nebuchadnezzar they said never connected and i heard that y'all wouldn't bow say i'm gonna give you another chance i'm gonna give you some grace i want you to bow when you hear the music he said look let me tell you something king he said if i said well we got a confidence that our god is able to deliver us that's our confidence i mean we ain't never seen no trial like this we never read about anybody going through anything like this but we got confidence that our god is able to deliver us but if he chooses not to deliver us we want you to know that we we we wanted to be written in your books that we did not bow to this thing that y'all set up before us nebuchadnezzar said we're gonna heat this fire up seven times harder than ever been ever ever been heated up so we we can't we can't stand to have this round heat the fire up seven times nebuchadnezzar sent men down to take the hebrew boys into the fire you know the men that they took down took the hebrew boys down those men died just by the heat of the fire his strongest men died through the hebrew boys into the fire and i love this because the prophet gives us this great picture he says when god was looking at this and heaven say wormwood stepped up said god i go out there and i'll throw some water on this fire it'll be blown out i mean it'll be drowned in no time god said no no no don't worry about it one more i appreciate you wanting to go and do that he said he said look at this look at this gabriel look at my boys down here look at him standing for me look at this look at this gabriel said god i go change this thing in no time if you just give me permission i go change i'll change the whole situation around because they standing for you i want to do something for them god said no no no no no no don't worry about it gabriel i don't need you i don't need to they say god what you're gonna do it's all i said god reached over and put on a robe he said he said i can't have y'all go because this is a god-sized job this is something that i'm gonna take care of myself they standing for me now i'm gonna stand with them and he entered as the fourth man into the fiery furnace praise god amen but notice the fourth man did not come until they got into the trial that's when they experienced amen in the presence of the fourth man is when they were in the heat of the trial sometimes you might not experience the presence of god until you're in the midst of what you're going through that's when he shows himself so strong on your behalf those those there they were just worshipping and their clothes were not burned the the the the the things that they bound with burned off but their clothes are not burned they didn't even smell smoke on them nebuchadnezzar looked down into the fire said now i thought i put three in what y'all tell me how full got in there he said the fourth one looks like the son of god brought him up out of the fire furnace fire cannot touch him this is what god can do when the boycott sets sin because the boycott was against those hebrew boys because they would not bow they wouldn't take the mark hallelujah we're gonna have to find ourselves in the same situation looking for god to do the great do do great things for us i want to just show you something here amen those hebrew boys was asked to bow but they refused to do so to enter a boycott people have to reach a boiling point people must get upset they're fed up you know we're fed up with some of the stuff that's happening we want to do something we want to we want to invoke change we want to see something different hallelujah and i want to just say this this has become quite acceptable today quite acceptable a protest a boycott it's it's very i mean people protest anything hallelujah you got to watch this there's a spirit that's that's underneath all this that's coming towards you the spirit has your has you are a target for this spirit you don't even realize it yet amen uh the one that one of successful boycotts a man here in in the united states was in selma alabama a man they they refused to ride amen in the back of a bus and they boycotted the buses and eventually they got to a point where they were able to ride amen just like everybody else was able to ride they refused to accept that behavior that was something that you know people could they go back and they draw from that say this is what they did now this is what we need to do but there's a spirit behind this glory to god i just want i'm preaching from a spiritual side glory to god now uh recently amen the past few years you all might have forgot about this but as i was reading this on last night you know target was boycotted target the store that everybody liked shopping at target recent was boycotted because of their transgender bathroom policy there are some sayings that say i will not shop at target amen because of the transgender uh bathroom policy now you know i i'm not here to tell you whether you should shop at target or not shop at target i'm not saying that i do realize that this these things are conditions that are happening in our world that's conditioning us for even a greater boycott oh glory to god amen whatever your conviction is on targets transgender policy bad bathroom prophecy that is your conviction amen i i do know a man that uh that that same sex marriage is wrong i do know that and i also know that i wouldn't want to send my little girl into a bathroom where i know men are praise the lord that just me amen glory to god that just i i don't want to sit my little girl in there amen and there's men in there now i know some nations they've been doing this for years there's no problems you know but that's not i i i'm not doing it amen that's just me glory to god hallelujah one time i went to the fair and there were some guys uh transgender guys i didn't know i didn't know i thought they were really women i thought they were and as i was going to the bathroom i saw these ladies getting ready to go and it's common somebody could a lady could go into the wrong bathroom you know so hey hey i just yeah hey hey hey and and when i was saying that the attendant looked at me and said no no no no no he i said what i said what walked on in the bathroom and found these were transgender guys that were in the bathroom they were in the right bathroom just dressed the wrong way praise the lord somebody they were in the right bathroom just dressed the wrong way hallelujah see this is this is count this is you know we've been conditioned we don't even realize spiritually being conditioned for a great boycott now watch this target was boycotted because of their trans transgender uh bathroom policy now we have a man a new movement that has come black lives matter amen and this is to raise awareness and to demand change to uh police brutality towards african americans we also have blue lives matter it's a counter movement uh advocating that those who are prosecuted convicted of killing law enforcement officers should be sentenced on the hate crime status sentence watch those terms sentence on the hate crime status you know when i preach that homosexuality is wrong now i'm i'm called that that i hate that i hate people i i know that's not true that's not true that's not i don't hate people i would tell a adulterer they're wrong that don't mean i hate them because they they committing adultery i'm just telling you that you will go to hell living like that that's all i'm trying to say and i'll read it to you out of the bible i am a christian and i won't apologize i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ right i don't hate you i love you enough to tell you the truth see it's very you know you go to church and you have to preach things like this it's not easy and i mean preacher get out here he's standing alone a lot of times we have to say things like this but it's the truth and how god still got some shad racks of meshach and some abandons on the earth that will not bow to these images all right i'm going further now i just want to ask this question could you just pull up john 3 16. because i know we got people standing on all kinds of sides but i just want to ask this question in light of scripture john 3 16 in light of scripture because i know it says this for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life in light of scripture which life matters yeah everlasting life matters that's true you can you can put that out there i'm telling you he died for the whole world right so all lives matter to him praise the lord amen as a christian all life should matter all right let me go a little further nowadays we have this thing especially start you know the pandemic has wiped out sports but now they're trying to resurrect it again but in the midst of uh resurrecting it they're doing all kind of things to show their solidarity praise the lord the wnhw nba teams walked off the floor when the national anthem was being played in basketball and baseball teams have now they start kneeling during the playing of the national anthem but we also find that there are a couple people that refuse to actually kneel they stand with their hand on their heart and you know this is what kind of gets me that a man standing with his hand on his heart in honor of the flag becomes an issue why is that news to be reported why is the media picking that out and trying to present that to people to try to create a problem it creates division not unity pray for it it was never a problem six months ago it was not a problem for people to stand with their hands on their hearts and and and sing the national anthem but now if you're caught singing a national anthem or with your hand on your heart and you're not doing what everybody else doing you stand out like a sore thumb just like the hebrew boys all right one brother one of the guys in baseball that did this they asked him why he didn't do it he says uh when he was questioning said as a christian i could not bow to any other god no this happened in baseball this happened in baseball and uh and then it followed up in basketball right but he said he says as a christian this man said as a christian i could not bow to any other god that's why i didn't do it now he used the term as a christian i want y'all to watch this i'm going to go a little further as a christian i would not bow now now when he said that uh i said to myself many people may disagree with his position but i can appreciate his conviction i need to read to you all something you know black lives matter is a separate movement but there is a group behind them that actually has their own website and they got some stuff on the website that i think most christians would actually differ with black blacklivesmatter.com i want to read just from their website watch this i i said how could two walk together except they'd be agreed hashtags and everything else how you gonna do it if you ain't really studied this you don't really know what you're getting yourself in there is a spirit underneath all of this watch this it's conditioning for a boycott because as a christian if christians gonna stand up and say are we not gonna bow christians gonna stand up saying we're not gonna do this christians we're not gonna they're gonna come against the christian religion at some point in time praise the lord all right watch this look at this statement i i got it right off the website we are unapologetically black in our positioning in affirming that black lives matter we need not qualify opposition to love and desire freedom and justice for ourselves is a pre-prerequisite for wanting the same for others keep going most people get that's that's right let's keep going we see ourselves as part of the global black family and we are aware of the different ways we are impacted or privileged as black people who exist in different parts of the world people read that oh that's right that's right let's keep reading we're guided by the fact that all black lives matter regardless of actual or perceived sexual identity now why where how did this get in here watch this now where'd that come from right watch this it says we're guided by the fact that all black lives matter regardless of actual or perceived sexual identity gender identity gender expression economic status ability disability religious beliefs or disbeliefs immigration status or location let's go on we make space this is blacklivesmatter.com we make space for transgender brothers and sisters to participate and lead go a little further we are self-reflexive and do the work required to dismantle dismantle cisgender privilege and uplift black trans folk especially black trans women who continue to be dis disproportionately impacted by trans antagonistic violence now there's a homosexual agenda in all these words that they're promoting underneath black lives matters a homosexual agenda that goes completely against what we as christians believe to be right in the word of god but yet we hashtag it all the time watch this i'm going further we build a space that affirms black women and is free from sexism misogyny and environments in which men are centered uh oh now i want you to watch that word misogyny because that's defined as being a woman hater and it's found in certain religious sex so you know when they read things about what paul wrote can we just pull up the scripture in first timothy too i'm just i'm reading the bible i'm reading the bible right now when we read the bible what paul wrote you know they actually changed these things in scripture this is why we we got rid of the king james version and we're using other scriptures that actually are more inclusive watch those words this is the devil this is the devil behind all this look at this now as a christian i read this in the bible and i choose to believe what i see in the bible first timothy chapter 2 verse 12 says but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence now that's in your bible that's in your bible for adam was first formed then even adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression now this was the reason that women were not able to preach because of what paul wrote in scripture of what happened in the garden of eden when eve got deceived that's what actually eliminated her ability to be able to preach it wasn't it wasn't somebody trying to put a thumb on women it's just this is what god established from the very beginning and we're trying to hold on to everything god said now you know what this new movement that has these underlying tones says they're you know they want to uh they want to free people from misogyny and what do you think misogyny is found with people that believe scripture the boycott is coming to you if you still believe scripture the boycott is coming to you right be careful because you've been conditioned for something that you don't even realize but the good news about this when it turns because i'm standing just like the hebrew boy stood i'm standing the way daniel stood down there before he went into the lion i'm standing the same way god delivered daniel god delivered the hebrew voice that same god is gonna deliver his pride in this hour let me just read questions and answers part two i want to show you these spirits church and i want you to understand that this is a spiritual battle that we're in this is not a natural battle uh you we we we allow these things to kind of catch us in our emotions but there's a spirit underneath this that is driving us to places that we never thought that we would be going even as christians god help us to remain true to the word of god questions and answers i want to say this here as i've often said i believe in the church here there's a role here like and here lives mortal beings and he's talking about where we're living at right now there's this there's a there's a above world there's spirits from an above world and their spirits from underneath the world and we're in the middle of it so even when you look at a scripture say god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son's like what world that god love i can tell you it's that world that's above that heavenly atmosphere because this world that we're in right now this is a sinful world god don't love it god gonna judge this world god gonna judge this world but there are some people caught in this world that he died for he needs them to know that he loves them watch this in here lives immortal beings and each one is in this great conglomeration of getty of blackness and darkness mortals living here now they are influen they're either influenced from this away or from that away as you read the media as you read the news let me tell you you're being influenced from one way or the other as you read the word of god i can already tell you where your influence is coming from your influence is coming from heaven stay with the word you cannot be here a spiritual being sinner or saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world if you're influenced from here you're from above your celestial body is waiting up here but if you're wicked and hypocritical and indifferent your celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think is up there because the fruit that you bear before people proves where you're from so you are here what you are somewhere else your life that you live here is just reflecting what your inheritance is when you leave here do you understand and all i'm saying here church is ultimately people are being conditioned to fulfill a prophecy they don't realize it but they're stepping right into a vision they're stepping right into what god told a prophet to pick up his pen and write about they're stepping right into it and don't realize it they're being conditioned be careful what you align yourself with be careful what you're lying stuff align yourself with the word of god amen god will god will stand for you if you'll stand for him i remember a story that brother branham told us about this evangelist that was on earth and man did a great work for the lord but when he got to heaven um he was told that he couldn't go in and he says oh mom i'm i'm evangelist so-and-so and i did this and i did that it was like yeah i realized it but he said your name is not on the list and you can't go in it's like what i can't go in he says uh he says there anything i can do he says oh yeah you can make your appeal you can make your appeal to the great white throne judgment and he says okay uh i'll make my appeal. and it says um it says he went over there and went stood in line waited the white great great white throne judgment and he said he heard the voice of god call his name and say did you ever steal while you on earth it says he thought he thought for sure that he had never stole on earth but but when he was in the presence of that great light he said he realized he'd done some things that he shouldn't have done he said yeah yeah i stole say uh so and so did you uh did you ever lie while you on earth it says oh i thought i'd never lie but when i when i got that great presence i realized that i i worked some shady deals and i lied i i i realized i i was done he said yeah i lied you know while i was on earth they asked him another question about something that he did you know while he was on earth he's like they thought for sure i don't think i ever did that i oh i said man i'm guilty of everything that they just asked me they say stood there before the the the presence of god at the great white throne judgment and then he heard a a voice just come out of nowhere and he said father father on earth this man stood for me he preached my gospel he he held to my truth he he did the best he could with what i had he says on on earth this man stood for me he says but now in heaven i want to stand for him see we we we need a god that's going to show up and be on our side when it really matters most i'm going to tell you what we're going through on this earth it don't matter because there's a life after this and we have to live for the life that's coming after this that life that we're living must be a life that's patterned with the word of god stand for the word we've been conditioned watch these spirits watch every movement because there's a spirit behind the movement i i i even watch where you know different saints just you know we get into arguments over these things that's a devil causing us to argue it's a devil that makes us do that right that's not the spirit of god you cannot say that's the spirit of god i'm gonna educate so and so educate for what educate for this world is not our home amen there i can tell you this right now it will never get better in this life until people come to a place of repentance if they can't come to christ they'll never be free from these things so just be one movement after the next movement and those movements will be tied and i'ma say this because this is what the lord told me being born a particular color is not a sin i'ma say that again being born a particular color no matter what color you are being born that color is not sin it is very natural but the homosexual agenda is sinful in god's eyes so i don't care how much people try to equate it it cannot be equated because in god's eyes one is a sin amen this last quote i want to read maybe last two and i'll close here do you now believe do you not believe the prophet makes a statement here in this message do you now but now believe he says and he's talking about when he went to finland and he prayed for these two boys and one both of them lived one was they were in a terrible accident god showed him years ago how this one boy was going to be raised from the dead he didn't show him where it was going to happen but it happened in finland it just gave him the vision and he saw saw they saw this boy race from the dead but when he got there god didn't show them that another boy was in the accident parents would call and said we saw you raise that other boy from the dead what about our boy he was in the hospital probably i don't know what to do i don't know what to do he said please you gotta pray for our boy so i'm just waiting on the lord i'm waiting on the word from the lord and god showed him so if you eat this this candy i'll raise that boy from the dead if you would do this i'd do that so so sometimes we have to stand in the gap and do things for others in order for them to receive life uh here the prophet you know it was was referring to this in the squad he says the other little lad i just haven't the time to catch that i will tomorrow night on what happened to the other little lad i remember one thing i would have time the second night from then i seen something sweet happen i was going into a place and coming down the road city uh six city blocks now where in finland also there was uh the russians and the finlands they were they were against one another there was some tremendous division in their midst but what brother brown is bringing out here is that when the power of god moved there were some russian soldiers that were there watching that boy raised from the dead they would finish people on one side russians on the other side when they saw that boy rise from the dead they say those those finish finish people and russian people just begin to embrace one another people just want to see a real god that's what lets down the walls when people see a real god look at this it says i seen something sweet happened i was going into the place and coming down the road for city blocks there was about 30 30 abreast and people standing in russia you can't leave your home place where you're born with over 40 miles you can't even go 40 miles from your house right in russia that's what he was saying at that time and it says uh without having a visa says now when they tell you there's no churches in russia that's wrong he says they got churches they they got the communist boy the communists boycott them and everything but they still got christians glory to god like this look at look at this statement what if you killed all the christians out of america you'd have no america same way in russia i'm gonna tell you if america want to stay america we christians gonna have to stay here do you realize that as christians we actually hold off the the judgment of god sometime just by being here god won't allow it to come because you're here oh that is powerful you actually hold back the judgment of god sometimes judgment would strike if the christians were not around sometimes your family be in a worse situation if it was not for you we don't realize the authority we had as believers but one day he's coming to take us home and then all all all hell will truly turn loose at that time praise god but we won't have to deal with it let me go back to this i'm bringing back the end of this quote this is out of programming church age uh just take me right to paragraph 175-2 and we'll finish it right here this is the prophecy the people don't realize that angel that told brother branham pick up your pen and write was writing a prophecy even for this day and if people don't realize that we're moving in the midst of it with all the things that are happening around us we don't realize we're moving right into the midst of a prophecy where we can't buy or sell because we won't take the mark because we're protesting we're standing against amen denominational teachings and and catholic teachers we're standing against that the great taught this but the great actually had children harlots the bible speaks that we stand against that we will not accept that we only stay with the word of god just like the hebrew voice look at this i believe according to revelation 13 16 the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach to be granted denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching i love this then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot so as the the pressure comes as the squeeze comes we have something to look forward to our our lord is coming to take us home this world is not a home it says i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also i'm looking forward to that church i don't know about you but i'm on the expectation that i'll be going home someday soon praise god shall we pray dear god lord just a thought that you've given me to what conditioning for the boycott it's prophesied according to the book of revelation 13. ordering just some of the things that we see in our world today god is certainly conditioning people and they don't even understand what's going on there's a spirit of underlying spirit behind all of this oh god and lord i just prayed it as believers that we could catch the vision your vision of what you have for us lord not get so wrapped up and caught up things that's where you told us to love not the world or the things of the world he said if we did then the love of god would not be in us lord we're gonna love you and we're gonna demonstrate and show your love to others we'll be bold enough to be able to tell people that no that's wrong that's wrong that's not what god is pleased with god destroyed sodom and gomorrh for some of this and i i recall your prophet even telling us that if god does not destroy the us or even the world today for the same sins that were committed in sodom and gomorrah then he would have to raise up sodom gomorrah and apologize to them forever doing it the lord because you're just god because you're a righteous god we realize judgment is on the way it's actually already begun and people don't even realize it god but as christians help us as the bride of christ help us to recognize lord what you've called us to in this hour not to be ashamed of the gospel for it is power unto salvation to everyone that we believe god we want to just stay with the word that's what we want to do keep our eyes mine

not from his presence god we thank you once again for the ability to be able to gather lord realizing the storm that was headed in this direction the uh weathermen the weather prophets were telling us lord to be prepared but god once again you have spared us you have uh kept us lord i'm i'm just one that believes that oftentimes you do these things because your bride is present lord god i i just believe that you love us just that much we realize that because of the sin that we're in that the world is in god that you do have to try to get people's attention and sometimes it comes through pandemic sometimes it comes through great storms uh god it comes to all kind of ways amen you try to get people's attention you got jonah's attention and a great storm lord you can get others that might be running from your presence and doing other things you can get their attention in a great storm not that you god you send it but you certainly allow all these things to happen for purpose and for reason you can stop it but you allow it to happen for a reason and we know god that you reveal it in your own due time so lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for this time to share the word of god and i pray lord that as as a as a group of people we would understand that you're calling us to a much higher place than where we're dwelling god help us arise amen and be seated in heavenly places with christ jesus seeing things lord through a spiritual lens not just through a naturalness but through a spiritual lens god and what it is that your lord that you're trying to forewarn yourself there's a great boycott coming according to scripture lord i believe many of these things that we see our conditioning of people or for what they don't even realize is about to happen god help us lord to keep our eyes on you jesus you're the only thing that matters in this hour bless us as we leave this place but not your presence keep us until we're able to come back together again it's in the mighty name of the lord jesus that we pray amen amen amen god richly bless you keep you until we're able to see one another again god bless you [Music] [Applause]
