[22:40] February 16th and go through March 8th,
[22:43] uh the corporate fast for the church
[22:45] that we usually do once a year. So, uh
[22:47] put that in your your calendar. Amen.
[22:50] And and and I want to just make mention
[22:52] as as we're kind of going to this time
[22:54] of fasting, uh one of the things I want
[22:57] to encourage us to do, and I'm not I
[22:59] don't want to say how we fast. Everybody
[23:01] got different ways in the way that they
[23:03] fast. But one of the things I want to
[23:05] encourage you to do um uh I had given
[23:08] you all a book uh for um uh just a
[23:12] little token of appreciation at
[23:14] Christmas time and um it was the book
[23:16] that brother Solomon had written and I
[23:18] thought it'd be very very good during
[23:20] our time of fasting to take time and
[23:22] digest that book. Amen. And it it
[23:25] certainly fits with the theme that we
[23:27] have this year as far as preparation for
[23:30] a manifestation. And uh with us kind of
[23:32] starting to fast at the beginning of the
[23:34] year, I thought it'd be good kind of go
[23:35] through that. There are some very
[23:37] practical things in that book that just
[23:39] kind of uh help you have a shift in your
[23:43] mindset. Amen. Because in order for you
[23:46] to see manifestation, you're going to
[23:48] have to have a paradigm shift in the way
[23:51] that you think about things. Hallelujah.
[23:55] Right? Because if if you if you think
[23:57] right, you'll speak right.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; If you think wrong, you're going to
[24:03] speak wrong. If you you think I'm broke,
[24:06] you're going to keep saying I'm broke.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; But if you you start thinking, I see I
[24:14] told you in the first sermon, I saw
[24:16] myself as a $50,000 man. I that was
[24:20] years ago. I saw myself as a 50. But now
[24:23] I I'm beyond that now.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; I see higher things.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. So, you got to
[24:30] release things out of your mouth in
[24:32] order for it to be manifested in your
[24:34] life.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let there be."
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; My God. My God. I tell you, let me get
[24:42] out the way. Uh but we uh Oh, I forgot.
[24:46] I I got my my daughter and my son-in-law
[24:48] here, too.
[24:50] Uh, brother Aaron and Sister Rebecca.
[24:53] Amen. I I heard her say, "Come on." And
[24:55] I forgot. I forgot she was sitting here.
[24:58] Amen. We thank God. Uh, so so uh, next
[25:01] Sunday we like I said, we got a lot of U
[25:04] ministers coming through and Oh, so next
[25:06] Sunday, Brother Dale Smith uh, is coming
[25:09] to us from Flagstaff, Arizona. He's
[25:12] pastors out there now and uh uh used to
[25:16] live in in South Carolina, but he's
[25:18] passing through on next Sunday and uh
[25:20] we're looking forward to having him. I
[25:23] don't know if y'all remember one time he
[25:24] came and preached a a sermon about the
[25:26] restoration of the dance and he was
[25:29] talking about how the the Indians they
[25:31] took their dance from them and uh and
[25:35] and they knew that if they could just
[25:37] get back to dancing uh victory begin to
[25:40] happen in their midst. So, say once that
[25:42] dance was restored, us and brother
[25:44] brother Dale preached it and started
[25:46] dancing a little. I said, "Hello,
[25:48] somebody." But, uh, but we had a
[25:50] wonderful time. Amen. I think it's my um
[25:54] I don't know what it is.
[25:56] But we'll we'll get through it. Kathy is
[26:00] coming uh on Sunday, February 1st uh
[26:04] from Kentucky area. Uh he'll be with us.
[26:07] Him and his family will be with us. So,
[26:08] we'll be looking forward to that. Uh, so
[26:11] I'm I'm getting a a little little time
[26:13] off. Amen. But I'll pick it up again in
[26:16] February. And uh the other thing that's
[26:18] going to happen in February that that
[26:20] I'm going to do a little different uh
[26:22] brother Keith Brown up in um
[26:27] uh St. Augustine, Florida. He does
[26:29] something every fe February that I just
[26:31] when I first was a partaker of it, I was
[26:34] like, man, this is pretty pretty I like
[26:36] this. So he changed the name of February
[26:39] to Faith. uary
[26:42] and uh and what he does is he have a
[26:44] minister every Sunday come to his
[26:46] church. He don't preach in the month of
[26:48] February on Sunday mornings. He has
[26:50] somebody come to his church and they
[26:51] always take a subject take the subject
[26:53] of faith and uh and they preach, you
[26:56] know, preach that subject. So, you know,
[26:58] I I I couldn't do it on Sunday mornings,
[27:00] but we're taking Wednesday nights in the
[27:03] month of February, and it's going to be
[27:05] different ministers that's going to come
[27:06] forth and preach on the subject of
[27:09] faith.
[27:10] Amen. Praise the Lord. And and I believe
[27:13] I got three of the four ministers lined
[27:16] up. I'm waiting on the fourth minister
[27:18] to get back to me. I sent him a message.
[27:21] Amen. And he has not got back to me yet.
[27:24] So maybe he'll check his message.
[27:30] Amen. But we thank God. We're looking
[27:32] forward to uh February Fuary. Amen. On
[27:36] Wednesday nights. So, Amen. And that'll

[34:44] Uh let's do as the woman of the uh
[34:47] adulterous woman.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; She said, "I found a man.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; I found a man.
[34:57] who told me everything that I did.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; When you come to worship the Lord in the
[35:04] presence of the Lord,
[35:06] &gt;&gt; you are blessed.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; That is if God has spoken to you.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; That if God did not speak to you,
[35:17] that means that you weren't blessed.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; We come this morning.

[35:31] &gt;&gt; Let us all stand
[35:34] &gt;&gt; as we read a few scriptures.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Exod
[35:40] Exodus chapter 23.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Exod Exodus chapter 23 verse 20.
[35:55] can read it.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll go ahead and read it. Exodus
[36:00] 23 verse 20. It says, "Behold, I send an
[36:04] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[36:08] way, and to bring thee into the place
[36:11] which I have prepared."
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessings to the
[36:18] word.
[36:19] Let us bow our heads for a word of
[36:21] prayer.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Blessed heavenly father,
[36:25] &gt;&gt; we thank you.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you allowed us to be here
[36:28] this morning.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you once again
[36:34] that we slept last night and we woke up
[36:37] this morning.
[36:39] We're not at the beach, Lord, cruising
[36:41] or hanging out.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; But Lord, we come this morning in your
[36:47] presence, Lord.
[36:49] Lord, for the purpose to be changed,
[36:53] Lord, to speak to our hearts,
[36:56] Lord, to get a closer stepper until the
[36:58] rapture.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; We ask you, heavenly father,
[37:02] &gt;&gt; take control of our
[37:05] the minister and me and the interpreter,
[37:10] all the beloveds who came this morning
[37:13] who made this service possible.
[37:16] Lord, speak to their hearts. Bless them,
[37:18] Lord.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, in the scripture that we just
[37:22] read,
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, the the same way you multiplied
[37:26] bread and fish,
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, you gave many people to eat,
[37:33] Lord, we take this eternal life word
[37:37] that this morning,
[37:40] Lord, that you can give the people the
[37:42] food that you want to give them food.
[37:47] Lord, the same way the disciples on the
[37:48] road of Mayas had said
[37:53] our hearts was burning within us while
[37:54] he was speaking with us.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, let it be that so this morning.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[38:01] pray.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[38:07] Uh the subject that we have this morning
[38:12] will speak of the angel of the covenant.
[38:16] We'll read reread that verse again.
[38:20] It says,
[38:25] "Behold, I send an angel before thee
[38:30] &gt;&gt; to keep thee in the way.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; And to bring thee in the place which I
[38:38] have prepared."
[38:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; In the place that I have prepared.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:47] that Jesus Christ has made a promise as
[38:48] well this morning.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; He said that he has gone to make a place
[38:53] for us.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; So that where he is, we will be there
[38:57] also.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you this morning.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[39:07] today, and forever.
[39:09] I put the Joshua back there as well.
[39:12] He's
[39:14] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you this morning,
[39:22] the the God that you have, that you
[39:24] serve has not lost strength.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; He is always alive.
[39:31] He's always powerful.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that is impossible
[39:36] with him.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what I come to tell you this
[39:40] morning.
[39:42] When the Lord said, "I will send an
[39:43] angel."
[39:46] &gt;&gt; It is he that came down,
[39:49] &gt;&gt; he's the one that came down.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Many people outside don't understand.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; John 3:16.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; They think that
[40:02] it is a old man with a long big beard
[40:04] that sends a young man
[40:06] &gt;&gt; to die.
[40:08] No, that that's not the way it's done.
[40:12] me that I'm speaking to you right now.
[40:15] I was in a house. I'm living in Miami.
[40:19] Midnight or so
[40:22] around 1:00 a.m.ish.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; I heard somebody begging on the door.
[40:26] Oh.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh,
[40:29] this person can help you pay the rent."
[40:35] I close the door.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't send Brother Henderson, my son.
[40:41] you know, he's a you know, he's a young
[40:42] man.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; You know, he wasn't married at yet at
[40:45] that time.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; No, I didn't send him to the door.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; I went outside to the door to go see
[40:51] that person.
[40:53] Are you going to help me pay the rent
[40:57] at 1:00 a.m. in the morning?
[41:00] Do you come to disturb my my sleep?
[41:04] My wife is right here. You can ask
[41:08] &gt;&gt; also the same way for the plan of
[41:10] redemption.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[41:14] God would not send nobody else.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; That God himself came down.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; God himself came down.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 35 said,
[41:27] &gt;&gt; he says,
[41:28] &gt;&gt; that I will come
[41:30] &gt;&gt; I will come. Amen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; That God will come and deliver his
[41:34] people.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; It is the blood of Calvary that was shed
[41:39] for us at the cross.
[41:41] It's not a blood of a man like prophet.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; It was the blood of God.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; That's why this morning you are precious
[41:49] this morning.
[41:52] This morning you are precious this
[41:53] morning
[41:55] &gt;&gt; the way same way brother Brandon has
[41:56] said
[41:57] &gt;&gt; that when you go to the marketplace
[42:00] &gt;&gt; the money that you give to buy from
[42:03] the the product is more than the money
[42:05] that you brought it with that is why
[42:08] &gt;&gt; that you are very precious of God
[42:12] just as san of Israel are
[42:16] &gt;&gt; that they were precious in the eyes of
[42:17] God.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Let me show you
[42:21] Exodus chapter 4.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 4,
[42:32] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Exodus 3.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Let us look at C
[42:38] and verse one.
[42:45] Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[42:48] father-in-law.
[42:50] the priest of the Median.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; And he led the flock to the backside of
[42:55] the desert,
[42:58] &gt;&gt; and he came to the mountain of God, even
[42:59] to Horeb.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord,
[43:06] &gt;&gt; appeared unto him in a flame.
[43:10] I'm going to show you who's coming down.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] out of the midst of the bush
[43:18] of verse three. And Moses said, I will
[43:20] now turn aside
[43:24] &gt;&gt; and see this great sight.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Why the bush is not burnt.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Verse four.
[43:33] And verse two, it says, "The angel of
[43:35] the Lord."
[43:38] &gt;&gt; In verse four, it says, "The Lord."
[43:40] &gt;&gt; So you see who came down.
[43:43] So, do you see who came down?
[43:48] &gt;&gt; God can take any form he wants to.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that is impossible with
[43:54] God this morning.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; He take any form he wants to.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; But the Brandham said in the time of
[44:03] Lot,
[44:04] &gt;&gt; what did God do?
[44:06] &gt;&gt; What did God do?
[44:09] &gt;&gt; He made three statues.
[44:12] And he entered into one
[44:15] &gt;&gt; and he made two other angels.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Gabrielle, Michael, who knows?
[44:23] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just a theophony.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; God made three different statues. He
[44:29] entered into one
[44:32] and the other two angels went to their
[44:34] own statues as well and they were
[44:36] walking towards Lot
[44:39] &gt;&gt; that it was not just in their theophony.
[44:41] Abraham
[44:42] &gt;&gt; because Abraham
[44:44] called Sarah,
[44:46] &gt;&gt; made food for them
[44:48] &gt;&gt; and they ate.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; You see the God that you serve
[44:54] &gt;&gt; at the cross when he came to save us.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; He came the little blood cell
[45:02] that came into the womb of Mary.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; That there's nothing impossible for God
[45:08] this morning.
[45:09] He can take any form he wants to
[45:12] &gt;&gt; to come and save you.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; The angel of the covenant is the Lord.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; The angel of the covenant.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Is that so?
[45:26] &gt;&gt; The angel of the covenant.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Israel had nothing else to do.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Just believe.
[45:36] Let's look at Exodus chapter 23.
[45:39] I don't want to tell you nothing else
[45:40] this morning.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; God asks you to believe his word,
[45:48] &gt;&gt; to obey his word.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; That's all God requires this morning.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Everything else that God will take care
[45:56] of that
[45:58] is only he asks you to believe obey
[46:01] &gt;&gt; and obey
[46:03] &gt;&gt; and submit.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:07] Exodus 23 verse 20. Praise God.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Behold, I sent an angel before thee to
[46:17] keep thee in the way.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; To keep thee in the way, and he will
[46:23] tell you how
[46:26] and thee into a place which I have
[46:28] prepared.
[46:31] Now, this is an exhortation that God
[46:33] gives.
[46:37] 21. Be beware of him.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Verse 21. Beware of him
[46:48] &gt;&gt; and obey his voice.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Provoke him not,
[46:55] &gt;&gt; for he will not pardon your
[46:57] transgressions.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Listen now carefully. My name
[47:05] is in him,
[47:08] &gt;&gt; an angel.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you this morning
[47:12] that angels do not forgive sins.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Angels do not forgive sins.
[47:22] Angels do not forgive sins.
[47:24] That means in the old covenant,
[47:27] &gt;&gt; there wasn't no grace.
[47:31] Once you sinned,
[47:34] &gt;&gt; they made their judgment.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; They destroy you.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Angel, angels do not forgive sins.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; God in that form of an angel did not
[47:47] forgive sins.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; But you will see later on the angel of
[47:52] the covenant
[47:54] &gt;&gt; because we say he is the Lord.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; That the Lord became Jesus Christ.
[48:00] Jesus Christ became a man.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Man can forgive sins.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to capture that this morning
[48:12] because
[48:14] when Jesus took the form of a man,
[48:18] he understands what you go through.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; The word said that he was tempted in all
[48:24] manners.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; He knows your problem.
[48:28] But the angels
[48:30] don't have no human feelings.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; That means
[48:36] the angels just destroy
[48:38] and condemn.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; But God
[48:42] in a form of a man.
[48:45] He understands what you go through. He
[48:48] knows your problems.
[48:50] He knows that your situations.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; That is why
[48:56] he came down.
[48:58] in our time
[49:01] &gt;&gt; to bring us deliverance.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says here.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; First of all, Israel should obey his
[49:11] voice.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Do not resist
[49:16] because he would not pardon your
[49:18] transgressions."
[49:22] Many times that you see
[49:26] that people put emphasis on signs.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Signs are good,
[49:33] &gt;&gt; but what's most important
[49:35] &gt;&gt; is the voice
[49:38] is the voice.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And if you look and see
[49:42] in the same Exodus chapter 3 that you
[49:44] see,
[49:46] let us turn back.
[49:51] Exodus 3, we'll see
[49:57] that the people believed.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Let's look at
[50:07] verse 30.
[50:09] I want to make this clear for you this
[50:11] morning.
[50:13] Exodus chapter 4
[50:18] verse 29.
[50:27] And Moses and Aaron went and gathered
[50:29] together all the elders of the children
[50:31] of Israel.
[50:35] And Aaron spake all the words which the
[50:38] Lord has spoken
[50:40] &gt;&gt; unto Moses.
[50:42] You see what what happened?
[50:46] &gt;&gt; They uh executed the signs before the
[50:48] people.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; They showed the people signs before
[50:53] them.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Verse 31.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Verse 31.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And the people believed.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; They heard that the Lord had visited the
[51:09] children of Israel.
[51:11] The people believed.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Later on, you will see
[51:16] &gt;&gt; that those same people perished.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; I come to tell you this morning,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; do not stop believing the word of God.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Don't choose what to believe.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Believe the entire word of God.
[51:38] The bride must be a word bride.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; So that's why God took us from all the
[51:46] different denominations
[51:48] that we were spread out all over the
[51:50] world.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; But God came down
[51:54] that he made this last exodus that he
[51:57] called us out
[52:00] &gt;&gt; to for us to be his bride
[52:03] &gt;&gt; that are from all traditions.
[52:07] from all cultures
[52:09] that he places in this message.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; You must be sure
[52:15] that you believe every word
[52:17] &gt;&gt; that you'll be realized
[52:21] that when a mighty angel came down
[52:24] that he came met the earthly angel
[52:27] he gave him a little book.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; You will see that
[52:32] John said you must swallow and eat the
[52:34] book.
[52:36] Not just eat and chew.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; When you eat and chew
[52:40] &gt;&gt; that you will taste,
[52:42] &gt;&gt; that you'll spit it out.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; But when you swallow it,
[52:47] &gt;&gt; once it comes from God,
[52:49] &gt;&gt; you must just swallow it,
[52:52] reason with the word.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; That means to say
[52:57] they seen the signs and they believed.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; But when the voice was speaking,
[53:02] &gt;&gt; which was the teaching,
[53:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:05] They they re rejected it.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; God didn't cause to just be a
[53:11] Pentecostal church.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; We believe in signs.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; That is part of the word.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; But the most important
[53:21] &gt;&gt; is the doctrine, the teaching.
[53:26] God sent brother Brandham
[53:31] to to manifest the latter rain
[53:36] that the latter rain
[53:38] that is teaching rain
[53:41] that is to say
[53:43] that as a bride of Christ that we must
[53:46] believe the signs of God but what's most
[53:49] important
[53:51] the signs must follow the voice of God.
[53:55] What's most important
[53:57] &gt;&gt; is the voice of God.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; What did God tell brother Brandham to
[54:02] you?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; That is the key.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Let us look and see.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Let's turn back to Exodus uh 23.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; To see what he says
[54:15] verse
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Exodus 23:22.
[54:21] Why?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; If thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[54:27] &gt;&gt; and do all that I speak,
[54:32] &gt;&gt; then I will be an enemy unto thy
[54:34] enemies.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Adversary adversary
[54:36] &gt;&gt; and an adversary to unto thy
[54:38] adversaries.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Did you guys hear?
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Did you guys hear it?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; What a great promise.
[54:47] What a great promise
[54:51] &gt;&gt; that I will be an enemy to your enemies
[54:55] &gt;&gt; and I'll be an adversary to unto your
[54:56] adversaries.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Don't you have any enemies?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; It's not your brothers your enemy.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; It's not your sisters your enemy.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; All the demons are your enemies.
[55:11] And brother Brandham says William and
[55:14] the greatest enemy is William Brandham
[55:16] yourself.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; That it means to say
[55:23] &gt;&gt; that God want you to obey his word.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; You can't be an unbeliever and manifest
[55:29] the word of God at the same time.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; No. No way.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; What you believe?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; That is what manifests in your life.
[55:38] What do you eat?
[55:40] That's will be expressed.
[55:42] That is why
[55:45] that God took us from all traditions
[55:47] and he brought us the revealed word
[55:50] because once
[55:54] Jesus Christ was a veiled word
[56:00] &gt;&gt; but in a time of Apostle Paul
[56:05] &gt;&gt; it was a time of partial revelation
[56:08] &gt;&gt; in the time of Paul
[56:10] &gt;&gt; in in our time today
[56:13] &gt;&gt; that we have a complete revelation
[56:16] today.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Revelation
[56:20] makes you serve God even more
[56:24] &gt;&gt; because the the will of God is a
[56:26] mystery.
[56:28] But when you know the will of God,
[56:31] it helps you to serve God better.
[56:35] That's why in our generation today,
[56:37] we have no excuses.
[56:42] The devil is completely exposed
[56:45] that he's naked.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; However, also
[56:50] through the ages,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; God also veiled
[56:56] that God was veiled through the church
[56:58] ages,
[57:00] but now he's unveiled himself completely
[57:05] that he showed himself, he revealed
[57:06] himself unto the bride.
[57:09] Why?
[57:11] &gt;&gt; So you can be just like him.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; But let's go ahead and return back.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; In verse 23,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; for my angel shall go before thee.
[57:26] Now who will lead you?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Was it Moses?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; No,
[57:31] &gt;&gt; it No, it was
[57:32] &gt;&gt; it was the angel.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; The angel. Hallelujah.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; That God was the angel.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; How can the angel bring me to the
[57:45] enemy's land?
[57:52] &gt;&gt; You see what direction the angel?
[57:55] The angel shall go before thee and bring
[57:58] thee unto the Amorites and Hittites and
[58:00] Persites and Canaanites.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; All those were enemies.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[58:08] It's not you that is fighting this
[58:09] morning.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; It is God is fighting for you this
[58:13] morning.
[58:15] It's not you fighting this morning.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; It's God that's fighting for you this
[58:18] morning.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; All he asks you to do.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Obey him.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; That's all he asked.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; All he asks is obey him.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Why they take a different road with
[58:32] them?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you this morning.
[58:36] that it is the overcomers that will
[58:38] reign with Christ.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; It is the overcomers,
[58:45] &gt;&gt; that people who overcome the enemy,
[58:48] &gt;&gt; overcome giants in their lives,
[58:51] &gt;&gt; those are the people who will reign,
[58:54] the people who go into Canaan land is
[58:57] not for the weak,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Cowardism.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] the people who overcome.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; That is why
[59:12] &gt;&gt; once you believe that you are a beloved
[59:14] of God
[59:17] &gt;&gt; in every situation you find yourself in.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; It is an opportunity for God to show you
[59:25] to that you can overcome.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the problem
[59:30] &gt;&gt; but look at the promise of the word.
[59:33] What does the promise that the word says
[59:36] that I will take you from Egypt
[59:38] and I'll bring you to Canaan land that
[59:40] is mean to say
[59:43] whatever obstacle that I found on my way
[59:46] that God uh reproached them rebuked
[59:49] them.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; He rebuked them.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Why
[59:54] they got before the Red Sea
[59:59] enmy?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; We have four enemies.
[1:00:04] First they had the Pharaoh behind them.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; They had the Red Sea before them which
[1:00:10] was another enemy.
[1:00:13] On the other side was a mountain. They
[1:00:14] could have overcome. There's another
[1:00:16] mountain on on the opposite side. They
[1:00:19] were before the Red Sea.
[1:00:22] But God told them they must go through
[1:00:23] that way.
[1:00:25] I want to say trust in God.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; He will make a way for you.
[1:00:31] Where there is no way,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; he will make a way.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And that way
[1:00:39] is only for the children of Israel.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh thought that it was their way,
[1:00:45] too.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no,
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; no, no, no, no, no. It was only for the
[1:00:49] children of Israel. They went into the
[1:00:52] Red Sea. They all drowned.
[1:00:55] Amen.
[1:00:57] that way
[1:00:58] is only for the children of Israel.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Trust in God this morning.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; That's what I come to tell you this
[1:01:06] morning.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Trust in God this morning.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Verse 24.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; More exhortations.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Thou shall not bow down to their gods.
[1:01:24] He means the god of the Amorites, the
[1:01:26] god of the do not bow down to those
[1:01:29] gods.
[1:01:31] No, nor serve them
[1:01:34] nor imitate or do their works
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; and their conduct and behavior.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; He says, "But you shall utterly
[1:01:44] overthrow them,
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; who will destroy them."
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; You
[1:01:54] before who said who would do that?
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; The angel.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That means to say
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; that God is with you.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; So why should you be afraid of?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; If God is with you,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; what are you afraid of?
[1:02:14] What is in us
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; is greater what's in the world.
[1:02:20] God is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:02:22] forever.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; But let's continue to keep going.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; That you shall utterly overthrow them.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; That is why.
[1:02:35] God has no other hands but your hands.
[1:02:38] He has no other mouth but your mouth.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; He came down truly,
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; but he needs a body.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:49] But the Bible said the Holy Spirit
[1:02:51] covers the earth.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit is looking for
[1:02:55] people to obey him.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; People who believe,
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; people who obey,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; to serve him.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; He came down truly.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; However,
[1:03:09] he can't do nothing
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; that he needs a body to use.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Moses must believe the message.
[1:03:18] But the people also must believe the
[1:03:19] message
[1:03:22] to go the same way
[1:03:24] that
[1:03:26] you shall utterly destroy them.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Let's continue
[1:03:33] verse 25.
[1:03:36] You shall serve the Lord your God.
[1:03:42] One thing I remind you this morning
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; that Israel had to do
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; was just believe.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; What does a person need to be successful
[1:03:55] in life?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Just to live in life.
[1:04:00] Do
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; you need food?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; You need water?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You need security?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; You need clothes?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:10] God promised he would do all those
[1:04:11] things.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Look and see here
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; in verse 25.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; He said he he shall bless thy bread.
[1:04:29] You are making your mind work just to
[1:04:31] find a way to eat.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:04:38] God will take care of you.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; That is mean
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; that he will bless your business.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; That he'll make a way for you.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; God is jealous of you.
[1:04:58] When when God sees that you're making
[1:04:59] you're trying to make a way to survive,
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; that irritates God.
[1:05:05] God wants you to depend on him
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; in everything.
[1:05:13] God wants you to depend on him on
[1:05:14] everything
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; in every situation.
[1:05:19] One thing he asks of you,
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; believe his word and obey him.
[1:05:25] You don't have to do three or four jobs.
[1:05:28] You don't have time to come to church.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; You don't have no time to come to
[1:05:33] service. You don't have no time to pray.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; All that time you spend in the world,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; you forgot about God.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; The power of God,
[1:05:45] the power that he has
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; to take care of you.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Food. Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; The the bill the the food bill wasn't on
[1:05:57] the children of Israel.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; The water bill.
[1:06:04] go to the city to to pull water from the
[1:06:05] city.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; It wasn't like that for Israel.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Are you here this morning, beloveds?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; The light bear wasn't on Israel,
[1:06:18] God in a pillar of fire
[1:06:21] that in the night.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That means to say
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; that they saw everything
[1:06:30] even though there was darkness
[1:06:31] everywhere else. electricity,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; but they had electricity,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; which was the pillar of fire.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; They wasn't paying bills for light bill.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; no way.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Today
[1:06:49] that as the times have changed,
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; the disposition have changed.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; That means to say,
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; you don't have to compromise.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; You don't have to sell your birthight.
[1:07:02] No, no way.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; God will take care of you.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; You don't have to sell your birthight.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; I will tell you something here.
[1:07:20] They they weren't going to the mall to
[1:07:22] shop for looking for clothes.
[1:07:25] The Bible says the clothes
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; the clothes that they wear never was
[1:07:30] worn out.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Every day that they wake up,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; the clothes got more newer.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Every day that they got up,
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; the clothes got newer
[1:07:44] that the clothes got newer every day by
[1:07:46] day.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; The shoes on their feet
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; was never worn out.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Shopping for shoes. They weren't
[1:07:53] shopping for shoes.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The Bible
[1:07:57] said they were never worn out
[1:08:00] for more than 40 years.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Their shoes were getting renewed every
[1:08:05] day.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; That is the God that you serve this
[1:08:08] morning.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday,
[1:08:13] today,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; and forever more.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:25] There wasn't no Red Cross or hospital.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Verse 25.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; You shall serve the Lord your God.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; He shall bless thy bread and water
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; and will take away sickness.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. There's nothing that man needs
[1:08:49] again.
[1:08:52] Man needs health insurance.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna tell you something here.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus said
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; that when I come,
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; will I find faith on earth again?
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that when he comes,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; will he find faith on earth again?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Or do you really trust God this morning?
[1:09:20] Will he find faith in you this morning?
[1:09:22] Not find church.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of churches.
[1:09:27] He find say find schools.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of schools.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; He said if I find science
[1:09:35] has evolved everywhere.
[1:09:38] He said will I find faith.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; The just shall live by faith.
[1:09:46] That was the word saying the just
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; not just by the eyes,
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; not by science,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; but by faith.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:10:02] that God came and rose up a president in
[1:10:04] this country right now. You know why?
[1:10:08] You know why? I believe
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; is to make the bride to to pick up their
[1:10:15] step.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; he cut off every social services
[1:10:25] program?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; You know the reason why
[1:10:29] to exercise your faith.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; There's a reason for that.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; It is the entire world.
[1:10:40] that is affected right now at this
[1:10:42] moment by the decision that Trump has
[1:10:44] been making. Reason why
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; God is trying to remove the thorns from
[1:10:52] the eagles
[1:10:54] so the eagles can fly. Isn't that right?
[1:10:59] So the just
[1:11:01] as the bride of Christ
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; that we can trust in God completely.
[1:11:06] Amen.
[1:11:11] Let us take a pause. Let us look at the
[1:11:12] mark that I want to show you something.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; You would you cannot be pleasing to God
[1:11:22] until you experience persecution that if
[1:11:25] you don't have a squeeze
[1:11:27] that you won't be uh developed,
[1:11:31] you won't grow.
[1:11:34] You won't be able to exercise your faith
[1:11:37] once you in uh
[1:11:40] that you everything that you
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; that you won't be able to develop your
[1:11:49] faith.
[1:11:51] Isn't that right?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, show you an example
[1:11:56] from the Bible
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; and I'll show you what I say. Let's go
[1:12:00] to the book of Mark.
[1:12:04] There's a reason
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; that the social assistance that we get
[1:12:08] from the government
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; that they're being cut off,
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; you must depend and know that God can
[1:12:18] heal.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; How would you be able to manifest the
[1:12:25] third pool?
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; That if you're not squeezed,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; that means to say
[1:12:34] when you can't see high or low.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; You see how God came down in in the days
[1:12:40] of children of Israel
[1:12:43] that they got to the point where they
[1:12:45] just couldn't do nothing for themselves
[1:12:46] again
[1:12:47] children of Israel in Egypt. They were
[1:12:51] crying out.
[1:12:53] God said, "I heard their cry. I saw
[1:12:55] their oppression."
[1:12:57] Let me show you that verse.
[1:13:00] Let me check
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; in Exodus 3. We were just in
[1:13:11] verse
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; verse 7.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Exodus 3 verse 7.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; The Lord said, I'll surely seen the
[1:13:21] afflection of my people
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; which are in Egypt,
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; and I've heard their cry.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:13:30] They were oppressed.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That they were not comfortable.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; They were not comfortable.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; As long as you're comfortable,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; then you can find all that you need.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; You won't be able to be pleasing or be
[1:13:51] developed before God.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; You won't be able to exercise your
[1:13:55] faith.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Look what he says.
[1:14:00] and I
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; verse eight. And I come down to deliver
[1:14:05] them
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; out of the hand of the Egyptians.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; There was a woman in the Bible,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; the woman of the blood issue.
[1:14:23] There's something sometimes we miss to
[1:14:26] capture.
[1:14:27] I will give you
[1:14:32] book of Mark give you
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; there's something that she said
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; that God want us to completely depend on
[1:14:43] him
[1:14:46] Mark chapter 6 no five
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Mark 5
[1:14:53] of verse 24 and
[1:15:10] He's giving you the history that the uh
[1:15:12] Jarius had a uh daughter who was sick.
[1:15:17] This woman here,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; her faith
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; that just did not came through the area.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Her faith brought Jesus to the area.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Because she didn't have enough strength
[1:15:35] to go anywhere else to worship him.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; She didn't have no more strength.
[1:15:43] The Bible said that all her money, her
[1:15:46] funds were used to doctors and
[1:15:47] physicians offices.
[1:15:50] Now
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; she has no money insurance.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; She don't have no health insurance.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; She don't have no health. I mean, she
[1:15:58] don't got no job. She
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; look at verse 26.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; What do you see here?
[1:16:12] that the doctors took all her money and
[1:16:15] gave her no solutions.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Is that what you see here?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Now you see
[1:16:24] she has no money and she can't go to the
[1:16:27] doctor's office
[1:16:29] but but she need to do something
[1:16:31] but her faith at that time now she put
[1:16:36] her faith in action.
[1:16:40] She she pulled Jesus into the area
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; while Jesus was going to go heal
[1:16:46] somebody else.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And she said,
[1:16:50] "If only."
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; That was her faith.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; That if only
[1:16:57] that I can see him
[1:17:00] and I will touch the hem of his garment
[1:17:02] that I will be healed. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:17:05] Amen.
[1:17:09] What? What happened to know that she had
[1:17:11] a revelation of that?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; When did that revelation come?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; When she had no other help.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Are you guys here this morning?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; we need
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; we need persecutions.
[1:17:38] Brother Brandham said
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; persecutions at Pentecost
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; that what makes the third P to be
[1:17:48] active. There was a lot of healing many
[1:17:50] miracles.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:17:54] Because the church was being oppressed.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I will show you that
[1:18:01] I'll show you. I'll read this quote unto
[1:18:02] you.
[1:18:06] in the message returning Jubilee uh
[1:18:11] November 22nd, 1962 where
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; paragraph 25,
[1:18:16] we need to go back to a power of God.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Something that can do the same thing
[1:18:24] today.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Something that can do the same thing
[1:18:29] today. Although in our numbers,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; persecution always gives strength to the
[1:18:37] church.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; To the church.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; What? What gives strength to the church?
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; What gives the church strength?
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Persecution.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Persecution.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Persecution.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; It's not being uh comfortable. Relax.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. True. persecution you
[1:18:57] for
[1:19:00] persecution gives you a strong assurance
[1:19:02] of faith
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; okay
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; I'll show you a biblical example before
[1:19:06] before we read the quote
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; David
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; when David was persecuted
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; he was very spiritual
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; that he was very inspired that he wrote
[1:19:16] many songs he wrote many songs
[1:19:20] he was very close to God but when he got
[1:19:23] to the palace
[1:19:27] that he got comfortable.
[1:19:29] That's why he fell
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; and also
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; he should have went to battle.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; But he said in the palace,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; God didn't call to be in a picnic this
[1:19:44] morning
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; that he called you to be in a
[1:19:46] battlefield,
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; battle against the world,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; battle against sin, systems,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; battle against all these systems.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] that God called us to be in a battle s
[1:20:01] when he got to the palace he got too
[1:20:03] comfortable
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; and that is where he fell
[1:20:08] by the truth.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Persecution always gives strength to the
[1:20:14] church.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; What gives the church strength?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Persecution.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Persecution. We've had it too easy. You
[1:20:22] see, that's it.
[1:20:24] We got it too easy.
[1:20:28] And that way we don't really trust in
[1:20:29] God anymore
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; because we find everything.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; No, it shouldn't be that way.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; We should depend on God,
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; trust in him
[1:20:42] that God can heal
[1:20:45] without any surgery.
[1:20:49] Yes, sir.
[1:20:51] That means when you're sick,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; the first thing that you must do,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; pray to God.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; First thing that you should do when
[1:21:01] you're sick
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; just to go because it's a hospital.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; However,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; that if God tells you
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; to go to the hospital,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; you will see that
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; that God will enter into the doctor
[1:21:18] temporarily.
[1:21:20] that God will operate on you.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; There won't be no medical malpractice.
[1:21:27] People leaving items in
[1:21:30] body
[1:21:32] or or giving you medication that gives
[1:21:34] you side effects.
[1:21:36] You pray to God first
[1:21:39] because God can do miracles.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; But God can heal in different ways.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; There's divine healing. There's
[1:21:47] miracles.
[1:21:48] miracles,
[1:21:52] you know, no medical device to be uh,
[1:21:53] you know, be to be healed.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; But, however,
[1:21:59] God can't want you to go to the doctor's
[1:22:00] office to get a
[1:22:03] but however, in any way,
[1:22:06] there is promises in the word of God.
[1:22:11] He said by his stripes, we are healed.
[1:22:14] That's why this morning
[1:22:18] Don't say that. Oh, you have a sickness.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; I heard a radio show on one time
[1:22:22] broadcast.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; And the doctor said
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; who was doing a radio broadcast, a radio
[1:22:30] show,
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; he had a patient of his that said,
[1:22:36] he said, "How are you with the diabetes
[1:22:38] this morning?"
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; How are you with the diabetes this
[1:22:42] morning?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Person said,
[1:22:47] Me and the
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; my diabetes
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; diabetes are the best of friends.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; That is a means to say
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; that I take my little pills. I do my
[1:22:57] diet.
[1:22:59] I do everything here that it don't
[1:23:01] bother me anymore. Christians don't
[1:23:03] speak that way.
[1:23:06] Christians don't speak that way.
[1:23:09] Sickness this morning that God cannot
[1:23:11] heal.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Whether it be cancer
[1:23:16] What is kidney problems,
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; heart problems,
[1:23:21] what any kind of infirmity
[1:23:25] God can heal all sicknesses.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; I shouldn't be okay with, oh, I have a
[1:23:33] sickness. I'm okay with my sickness. No.
[1:23:35] No way. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
[1:23:37] No. No. No. No. No. You must have faith
[1:23:41] this morning.
[1:23:43] But when I say if you don't have faith
[1:23:44] to be healed,
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; how you be have faith to go into the
[1:23:47] rapture?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; How will you have faith?
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; I come to tell you this morning
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; that God heals again
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; that he saves again and he will deliver
[1:24:00] again.
[1:24:02] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:24:04] forever. Amen.
[1:24:12] I get it.
[1:24:14] Thank you.
[1:24:16] Okay.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's look at this quote.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; We get sloaf.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; We get to a place where we don't want to
[1:24:28] move on
[1:24:32] because everything's just handed to the
[1:24:35] uh to us.
[1:24:39] It takes sorrow.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Listen carefully. It takes sorrow.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; It takes It takes what?
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; It takes It takes sorrow and tears
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; and sweat
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; and prayer
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; and faith
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; and promise to move forward in the power
[1:25:00] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That is what God expects for you this
[1:25:06] morning. Easy.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; It's not an easy life.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; That we will be raptured.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; That it must be a bride that has faith.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; What kind of faith?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Perfect faith.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Perfect faith.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; I'll repeat again. Perfect faith.
[1:25:36] I'll show you an example of perfect
[1:25:37] faith.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Some people think that they have faith.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:25:48] the 70 disciples said they could have um
[1:25:51] faith as well.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; That they shake the kingdom of hell.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I Satan coming down as a
[1:26:01] light.
[1:26:03] that when they get the report of the
[1:26:05] missionary trip
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; and one time Jesus was preaching a
[1:26:11] sermon
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus said if you don't forgive your
[1:26:16] brother
[1:26:19] 70 times seven
[1:26:22] how many times in one day
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; now the disciples thought they had faith
[1:26:32] They said, "Lord, we're not ready for
[1:26:33] that yet."
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; They said, "Lord,
[1:26:37] help our faith. Help our unbelief.
[1:26:39] Increase our faith.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Increase our faith."
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; That is why.
[1:26:46] The third, the third pool walks with
[1:26:49] faith and forgiveness
[1:26:52] and grace.
[1:26:54] that if you say to this mountain
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; be thou removed
[1:27:02] but if you don't doubt
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; and it continues though
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; that he said also as well
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; when you pray
[1:27:11] make sure you have nobody in your heart
[1:27:13] that means to say
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; the third pool is connected directly
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; with forgiveness
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:27:26] is connected with forgiveness.
[1:27:29] That's why brother said that that is
[1:27:31] perfect love that will get you there.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; People who manifest perfect love.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I'll even go even farther.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[1:27:44] to forgive
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; to love your enemies.
[1:27:50] Even the brother in your own church, you
[1:27:52] can't even love them and forgive them.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And you want to forgive your enemies.
[1:27:57] Huh?
[1:27:59] You can't forgive your wife
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; or your husband. You can't forgive your
[1:28:03] husband, the people right next to you in
[1:28:05] church. You can't forgive them.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; And you want to forgive your enemies.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. Listen. Work on that some more.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Work on that some more.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Work on that some more.
[1:28:20] The disciples realized that forgiveness
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; that it was a dimension of rapturing
[1:28:28] faith
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; uh forgiveness is a dimension of faith
[1:28:35] of of a higher level faith.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; You can have faith to cast out demons to
[1:28:43] do miracles,
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; but you can't forgive.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:28:48] the bride of Christ.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; There's no barrier.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Faith has no uh obstacle.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Faith has no obstacle.
[1:29:00] Faith to forgive.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Faith can to uh cast out demons
[1:29:07] because love and faith walk together.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Love brings faith.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:29:16] That is why
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; that the bride must be a br a forgiving
[1:29:22] bride.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Let us go back.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; I'll read this again.
[1:29:29] It takes sorrow
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; and tears
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; and sweat
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; and prayer and faith and promise to move
[1:29:43] forward in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; I always say in my home church,
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; don't uh make fun of Christians who are
[1:29:56] crying.
[1:29:58] when they're going through certain
[1:29:59] situations,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus cried al as well.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Did you guys read that
[1:30:07] when he got to Gethsemane?
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I think maybe Hebrews 12 that Jesus also
[1:30:12] cried as well.
[1:30:15] But as a bride of Christ,
[1:30:17] we can't cry all the time.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; They just got before the tomb of
[1:30:23] Lazarus.
[1:30:25] His friend had died.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; As a human, he cried.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; That is a a human compassion.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; But as he was crying,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; a revelation came unto him.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; What are you doing?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; What are you doing?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; That you are God in flesh.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Speak. He said,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Lazarus,
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Lazarus,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; come out.
[1:30:51] You might have times of weakness where
[1:30:53] you're crying
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; that you're sad.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; It's also in your spiritual walk.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Also, the prophet said here there's
[1:31:02] sorrow
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; and tears
[1:31:06] and sweat and prayer and faith and all
[1:31:09] those things. But however,
[1:31:12] we can't spend all of our time crying.
[1:31:15] We that we are a revealed people
[1:31:18] that we know how to approach God.
[1:31:20] We know there's nothing impossible
[1:31:22] without God.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible with God.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:31:31] I see the time is moving. I'm going to
[1:31:32] wrap it up some.
[1:31:35] Give me five to seven more minutes.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I'll read one more quote. Yes.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Uh gifts and callings are without
[1:31:43] repentance.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I forgot. You see,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; listen to what he said.
[1:31:49] doesn't have the paragraph uh preach uh
[1:31:52] March
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; I think 1950.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; It says Moses did nothing.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; It was the angel of God.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; What did it look like? The red led
[1:32:10] Israel
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by
[1:32:15] day. I believe he's still leading on. We
[1:32:20] know that was the angel of the covenant.
[1:32:22] Is that right? It was the logos or the
[1:32:25] Christ. He's still the same leading the
[1:32:28] people today as he was then.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Who did he say was the angel of the
[1:32:34] covenant?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Christ. Yes, sir.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:32:41] that the pillar of fire became a man.
[1:32:44] You will see
[1:32:47] Matthew chapter 7
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; that he said that that what the angel
[1:32:52] said before
[1:32:54] that he will repeat the same thing all
[1:32:55] over again.
[1:32:57] Uh let's go to Matthew chapter 7
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; and we'll uh get ready to close.
[1:33:08] Matthew 6.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6 verse 25. Matthew 6 vers 25.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Therefore I say unto you, take no
[1:33:20] thought for your life, what you shall
[1:33:22] eat, or what you shall drink, nor yet
[1:33:26] for your body, what you shall put on. Is
[1:33:30] not life more than meat, and the body
[1:33:32] than reignment.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; You see what he tells you here?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; He told the same thing to children of
[1:33:39] Israel.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:33:43] because the angel of the covenant is
[1:33:44] Christ.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; He's here to do the same things.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? He's here to do the
[1:33:50] same things.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse
[1:33:55] 31.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Therefore, take no thought, saying,
[1:34:00] "What shall we eat or what shall we
[1:34:02] drink?" Or what with all shall we be
[1:34:05] clothed?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; For after all these things do the
[1:34:09] Gentiles seek. For your heavenly father
[1:34:12] knoweth that you have need of all these
[1:34:14] things.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Who who worries about those things?
[1:34:23] Gentiles. Gentiles are the one that
[1:34:24] seeks after those things.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I don't believe if I have my kids
[1:34:33] that I have to pray to give them food.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Responsibility. It is my responsibility.
[1:34:41] Isn't that right?
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; That every day that they have
[1:34:46] accessibility,
[1:34:49] it's my responsibility to give them
[1:34:51] food.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; But he says also in uh 23
[1:35:01] before I read that verse 23
[1:35:04] that I'll read this
[1:35:11] I want you guys to leave with this
[1:35:12] before I close.
[1:35:23] Uh
[1:35:30] uh he says the angel of the covenant
[1:35:33] which which was Christ the son of God.
[1:35:40] Okay.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:35:43] uh the angel of the Lord uh July 18th,
[1:35:47] 1951, paragraph
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; 49
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; 49
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; in the middle he says
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; and I believe
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; is leading the church today
[1:36:03] and it's the same Holy Spirit.
[1:36:06] Same Holy Spirit.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Remember, same Holy Spirit.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; And anyone knows the angel of the
[1:36:13] covenant was Christ.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; This same angel that I'm speaking of
[1:36:21] here isn't five feet from me right now.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That I don't believe when brother
[1:36:29] Brandham left that the angel also left
[1:36:30] with him as well.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; The angel is right here
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; to take care of you.
[1:36:36] to deliver you.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; What happened at Pentecost
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; in the disposition of of our time?
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; which is the Holy Spirit
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; and separated itself in multiple peoples
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; and it came into the 120. That means to
[1:36:59] say
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6 verse 23 or sorry 33
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; 33.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; This what you look must look for.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:37:18] and his righteousness
[1:37:20] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:37:24] you.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; What is the kingdom of God?
[1:37:28] It is the Holy Spirit in you.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; It is the power of God in you.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; The creative power of God in you.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; It is the healing of God in you.
[1:37:41] Is a comforter of God in you.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; That a brother doesn't call you on the
[1:37:46] phone.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; That nobody calls you on the phone.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; But you still have a a spiritual booster
[1:37:51] inside of you. You still have a
[1:37:53] comforter inside of you.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; You have your songs inside of you. Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; That you always are happy.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit of God,
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; it is the angel of the covenant that in
[1:38:10] our dispensation
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; that it works in different individuals.
[1:38:15] Not the same way it was in Israel
[1:38:18] where Israel was under the same uh
[1:38:20] light. But today,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; individually,
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; this morning,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; this morning,
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I say look for the Holy Spirit this
[1:38:30] morning.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit of God.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; It is the kingdom of God.
[1:38:38] It is the righteousness of God.
[1:38:41] If you have the Holy Spirit inside of
[1:38:42] you, you also have the creator inside of
[1:38:44] you. If you don't have no food,
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; what do you do? that when you go to the
[1:38:50] marketplace that you write, you know, uh
[1:38:52] uh
[1:38:55] one day a sister rose up, she had no
[1:38:58] money,
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; you know, she did what she used to do
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; and when she go to the marketplace and
[1:39:04] she made a list and she prayed over the
[1:39:06] list,
[1:39:08] before that day was over with
[1:39:10] what she put on the list that everything
[1:39:13] came to her.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; That is the God that we serve.
[1:39:17] Don't sell your birthright.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; God is alive and forever more.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; He is powerful this morning.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; He's also here this morning
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; and he's the one that's leading the
[1:39:30] church.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You are his church
[1:39:34] that you must be in security.
[1:39:37] He owes you all these things
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; and every material blessing
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; that you need that he will give it to
[1:39:46] you.
[1:39:48] The spiritual blessing that you need
[1:39:51] to go into that place he prepared for
[1:39:52] you which is the rapture.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; He will give you all those things that
[1:39:56] you need
[1:39:58] but you must be using by faith.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; He gives you faith
[1:40:03] and not just by grace you're saved
[1:40:06] but the way of faith
[1:40:09] and he gives you faith first.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; That faith will call virtue. They call
[1:40:14] patience or temperance
[1:40:18] until you reach until adoption.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And I believe this morning he's the same
[1:40:24] yesterday,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; today, and forever more.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Continue to keep battling.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Resist temptations.
[1:40:36] Resist against all those things
[1:40:38] because you are the angel of the
[1:40:41] covenant which is the Holy Spirit. It is
[1:40:44] in you this. May God Jesus Christ bless
[1:40:46] you this morning. May he watch over you.
[1:40:50] Whatever need that you
[1:40:53] whatever need that you need, if you're
[1:40:55] sick,
[1:40:59] if you don't do like other people do it,
[1:41:03] but through the preaching of the word
[1:41:05] that us Gentiles,
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; we only people to really lay hands on
[1:41:10] us,
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; we just seize what we need during the
[1:41:15] preaching.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? this morning.
[1:41:19] If you're sick this morning,
[1:41:22] put your hand wherever you're sick at,
[1:41:26] whatever need that you have.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Because the word said, "By your
[1:41:30] confessions,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; that will be your possession.
[1:41:36] What do you what do you say with your
[1:41:37] mouth? What you say with your mouth?"
[1:41:41] What you said with your mouth,
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; what you said with your mouth.
[1:41:46] Someone say, "I am healed this morning."
[1:41:49] Isn't that right?
[1:41:51] If you have a need this morning,
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; if you need money this morning, say,
[1:41:56] "Lord, I need money in the name of Jesus
[1:41:57] Christ.
[1:41:59] We have light bills.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; I show the angel of the covenant.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; He took care of all their bills.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; The angel of the covenant.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Whatever you need,
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; grab it this morning.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Receive it this morning. In the name of
[1:42:14] Jesus Christ, may I richly bless you.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:42:29] Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:42:41] praise.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need cash.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Lots of cash.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:42:59] My my my my I'm blessed church.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Absolutely blessed.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Woo. My God. My God. My God.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Certainly appreciate brother Medalist.
[1:43:13] Amen. On today just allowing the Lord to
[1:43:16] use him.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; You know th this this this quote that he
[1:43:20] brought the first quote that he was
[1:43:22] reading. Um, I was just, you know, just
[1:43:26] really processing that one. Uh, it
[1:43:30] talked about persecution
[1:43:33] having to it's necessary in order to
[1:43:36] strengthen
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; the the church. Uh, the prophet said
[1:43:40] persecution always gives strength to the
[1:43:44] church.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And it goes on and says, "We've had it
[1:43:48] too easy.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; We get slothful." Come on.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; This ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; We get slothful.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; We get slow in the way that we serve
[1:44:03] God,
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; right? And and so he says we get to a
[1:44:06] place where we don't want to move on
[1:44:10] because everything's just handed to us.
[1:44:13] And then it goes on to say it takes
[1:44:16] sorrow.
[1:44:18] It um it takes tears,
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; sweat.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Come on y'all. This and that's when it's
[1:44:29] not it's not easy. You know, that was
[1:44:31] the right quote. But it that's when the
[1:44:33] thing, you know, you start questioning
[1:44:35] your experience when you're going
[1:44:37] through moments like that. Like, Lord,
[1:44:39] what did I do wrong?
[1:44:41] You ain't did nothing wrong. This just
[1:44:44] this just amen. the the growing pains of
[1:44:47] grace,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; right? And we got to be willing to go
[1:44:50] through this. And you know, it it says
[1:44:52] to take the tears and sweat and prayer
[1:44:55] and faith and and promise to move
[1:44:58] forward in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:00] And and I say, Lord, I I mean, I I know
[1:45:03] that many of us have come through
[1:45:04] processes like that and uh some might be
[1:45:07] still in it, but I can tell you if you
[1:45:09] just remain faithful and obedient to God
[1:45:12] in times like that, you will see God
[1:45:15] move on your behalf. He never fails. He
[1:45:20] never fails. This is all a part of the
[1:45:23] Christian experience. You know, it
[1:45:25] reminded me of a sermon that I preached
[1:45:27] some years ago. Pressure produces power.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; It's only when you go through things
[1:45:34] like this that that the that the
[1:45:37] attributes of God can be expressed in
[1:45:39] and through you. Right? You'll never see
[1:45:41] God in these ways unless you had some
[1:45:43] trials. You'll never know him as a
[1:45:44] healer unless you were sick.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; You never know him as a deliverer unless
[1:45:50] you were bound.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Right? You have to you have to be in
[1:45:53] some situation in order to experience
[1:45:56] one of the attributes of God. I tell you
[1:45:59] what, I just I just appreciate it. I am
[1:46:02] encouraging. And I don't know, I mean,
[1:46:04] um, you know, often times, like I say,
[1:46:07] whether you're a Christian or not a
[1:46:08] Christian, everybody going to have
[1:46:10] trials. Everybody going to have
[1:46:11] something they're going through. It
[1:46:13] don't matter. Uh, people that don't
[1:46:14] serve God end up in hospital rooms.
[1:46:17] People that do serve God end up in
[1:46:19] hospital rooms, right? People that don't
[1:46:20] serve God end up sick and people that
[1:46:23] don't serve God need money sometime. I
[1:46:25] mean, it's I mean, and no matter whether
[1:46:26] you're serving God or don't serve God,
[1:46:28] you're gonna have some trials. It's just
[1:46:30] good to have God on your side when
[1:46:31] you're going through trials.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And you also have his promises.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; What was that? Say, I mean, he went went
[1:46:40] all the way back to Exodus.
[1:46:44] say, "I'mma I'mma I'mma I'mma I'mma
[1:46:46] bless
[1:46:48] your your water.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; I'mma bless your bread." Now, see, you
[1:46:59] got to you got to watch that because,
[1:47:02] you know, in in scripture, we understand
[1:47:04] he would have been talking about their
[1:47:05] food there. You know, you weren't going
[1:47:07] to be without food.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; But we live in a society where bread
[1:47:11] means different things.
[1:47:16] Hello somebody.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Bread has a dual meaning in our society.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Come on somebody. So when I read that,
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about the food on
[1:47:28] my table, but I'm talking about the
[1:47:30] money in my bank account. I will bless
[1:47:32] your bread.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I receive it in Jesus name.
[1:47:42] I receive it in Jesus name.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you, as believers, we we have
[1:47:48] these things we go through, but God
[1:47:51] gives us promises and and even in the
[1:47:53] midst of whatever we're facing, he told
[1:47:55] us to count it all joy. Amen. Count it
[1:47:58] all joy. Don't don't be discouraged.
[1:48:01] Don't be downtrodden. God is in control
[1:48:05] and he's never lost a battle.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he won't lose yours. Let's
[1:48:10] give the Lord another hand of praise.
[1:48:14] Praise God.
[1:48:16] All right, let us just bow in a in a
[1:48:18] brief word of prayer. Amen. Father,
[1:48:24] we uh just thank you for your word,
[1:48:30] Lord, how you have uh ministered to our
[1:48:32] hearts today. And thank you for brother
[1:48:36] Mealis just getting himself out of the
[1:48:39] way that you could use him to say
[1:48:41] something to strengthen and encourage
[1:48:44] this portion of the bride of Christ.
[1:48:46] Thank you for the saints that have come
[1:48:48] Lord with him just to be in service his
[1:48:51] family brother Paul and and and sister
[1:48:55] Debbie Lord the family Lord we just
[1:48:57] thank you father for for them being with
[1:48:58] us. We ask oh God Lord that you would
[1:49:02] bless us as we leave this place but not
[1:49:04] your presence. And we ask oh God that
[1:49:06] you would just help us to meditate on
[1:49:09] the things that we heard here today that
[1:49:10] it won't go in one ear and out the other
[1:49:13] but Lord that we'll really really focus
[1:49:15] and hone in on what you were trying to
[1:49:17] speak to us. Not complain about the
[1:49:20] trials and tribulations but to realize
[1:49:22] that it takes this type of persecution
[1:49:25] in order to bring the best out of us. So
[1:49:29] Lord, we count it all joy and we rejoice
[1:49:32] in the midst of all that we are
[1:49:34] enduring. We ask God that you would keep
