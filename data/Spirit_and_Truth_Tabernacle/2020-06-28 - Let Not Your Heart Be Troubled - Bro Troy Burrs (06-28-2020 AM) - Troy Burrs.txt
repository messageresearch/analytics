you can be seated in his presence amen good to be in the house of the Lord on today and amen how we just thank God for just watching over us through another week and he has stayed the hands of the enemy a man from us and we're very very grateful for that as we are discovering daily our city here is becoming a hot spot for the kovat 19 it's spreading like wildfire the hot the hospital beds are full and a man running out of room for people and understanding putting tents and parking lots and just trying to treat some of the cases but we thank God for just keeping us a man and in a time like this we really really thank God for for watching over us I wanted to just mention that we do have a ordinance here in our city where they are saying that all of us we go in public that we are to wear our mass a man as an ordinance that has been passed this week in the city so thank you all for just abiding by what they are asking us to do and I know that if in public and I was told that if you get caught outside without without it in public there could be a 250 dollar fine issued to you so they want you to really take this seriously and and we all you know should do so but let's just continue to do what we can to keep our each other safe amen as well as ourselves a safe and I want to encourage that while we're going through this if there's ever a time where you're just not feeling well a man certainly called for prayer but we would want you to just just think about what you want to come to church or not because it might be better to stream a service if you're not feeling well that way we don't spread anything you don't know the others that around you what their bodies can take and what their is what their bodies can't take so please we don't want to spread anything in the midst of the church and let's just do all we can just to handle this season with as much wisdom as possible a man thus far God has been good to us and we know the enemy's just looking for some little crack that he could get him to create a pandemic a real pandemic a man so just let's just let's just be sensitive a man to to where we are this is a time that we have never it's what I call unprecedented I don't feel like it's like a normal flu or something like that I know sin produces sickness and things that nature but I know also that sometimes man can get inside the laboratory and they can do some things a man in the laboratory and it just seems like something here is just a little a little different and you know and granted I mean the way I feel is that we might not be able to stop it all but we'll just buy and what come our way praise the Lord and then we'll just buy what come our way a thousand may fall at thy side and ten thousand at their right hand but the Bible declares it shall not come nigh thy dwelling a man it didn't say it wouldn't stop it all over the world but it said it would not come nigh thy dwelling so we're just gonna believe God a man for that portion of the word to be fulfilled a man for us so a praise the Lord we just wanted to just make mention a couple of things a man here to you in the form of our announcements and then we're prepared to receive the word of the Lord a man on today I did want to mention that uh we had started collecting some funds for upgrades in our audio/visual area and I want thank God for those that have responded rather swiftly to the need and we were able to purchase one of the cameras actually two of the cameras we only got one install right now but we got two cameras amen that was purchased already and thank God for that a man and so we got we got some some things that we want to put put forth also we we got a new project it's not installed yet but the Lord blessed with a new projector as well during this time so that you always see some upgrades and changes there and God is leaving God is moving a man I just had to stop and just thank God for just you know just this season all these blessings that he has given us and we're just we're just believing that he's gonna carry us right through this time just we're gonna continue our Virtual Amen services on Wednesday night so keep that in mind a service start at 7:30

in your prayers this morning amen we can just grab our Bibles and we'll take a scripture this morning I have several scriptures but let's take this one here from John the fourteenth chapter twenty fifth twenty seven first and and we can exceed it already go thank you Jesus John 1425 27 these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Lord whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave you I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid a man made all law that a blessing to the reading of his word by title this message I would say this morning let not your heart be troubled a man let not your heart be troubled a man on a couple of weeks ago last time I had the privilege to stand before you I was speaking on be not afraid amen and I sort of just kind of took a little text from the disciples there being in the ship and the the sea began to rage and the sails were torn and the ship was battered waterlogged the scripture says and their oars were gone and they were in dire trouble and behold they be they were they was experienced seamen experienced seamen they they made that nude order no doubt that they have come had come into trouble waters before but this time seemed a little bit different this time it seemed just like this storm or this trouble was going to be the one that take them out they will afraid even though Jesus had just told them to go to the other side Amen Jesus that just gave them a commandment but along the way of fulfilling of the commandment trouble came and naturally the human response was that they were fearful and they began to scream I mean these men barely strong sailors begin to hold one another and scream in fear and they even compound their fear they saw something in the distance walking on the water now like I said this compounded that refresh they are afraid fearful that the end is coming surely this is it we can't even navigate the ship sails gone oz but we are at the mercy of the situation so they begin to look out over the water and they cease what is this off seeing no something walking on the water not a very thing that came to save them they were even afraid of it she fear had took over everything he had went out the window everything that they had been taught everything that God had told him had just gotten went out the window because he fear affects you I was I was went back a while 2017 and precious pastor here preached a message on fear not a man a midnight message he sort of broke down some of the things that how fear sort of effects the body so that fear is an anxiety caused by an expectation of evil fear is not now we'll get into something except about this fear but we're going to stay with me we're going to go somewhere fear is a learned behavior second Timothy the first chapter the seventh verse God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind that all right the spirit of fear right fear is a spirit we all familiar a man with Adam and Eve in the garden there was no fear until seeing kami then all of a sudden the body begins he that was a prop that was a curse there that this thing I began to die we know by medical science that fear brings on stress and one of the biggest things to our physical health distress right so now that they're beginning to feel it here's the sphere it begins to weaken their bodies fear weakens you amen now fear a man is a human emotion triggered by a perceived threat they're with me it is a basic survival mechanism that signals our bodies to respond to danger with a fight-or-flight response amen such as it is an essential part of keeping us safe now I want you to underline that in your brain there it is an essential part oh that is to keeping us safe Saeko that's two kinds of fear because it has a good fear there's a good fear but the paper but let you stand with this line of thought here we want to look at this fear and how how a prolonged fear amen Oh uncle Sextus physically it brings on sickness it prepares the body to receive the very thing you are afraid of in my line of work a lot of times it is the fear that hurts you you'll find yourself maybe on a venomous situation maybe on a ladder or in a bitter in a situation and something happens arc or Sparkle something blows and your natural response through fear causes you to fall and hurt yourself in most time oh my it's good to know that you have the comforter on the insides in those times of trouble in those times of crises that comes and catches us amen and our body responds maybe you need a car driving in a man I've just recently listening to the Bible studying brother jacking brother Willie oh my was in the car driving the church all right and his testimony was that he sold a car yeah and brother Willie was in the passenger seat and he said Jack look he's saying yeah brother I see it brace yourself he said that was the calmest in the car there was a piece in the car that they did panic now even though Satan was trying to to destroy the gift whoa trying to take out two ministers they white ministers day in st. so these guys here they gonna be trouble down the road [Music] to take out stars of God purpose was their protection [Applause] [Music] just like these disciples peak told him to go to the other side their purpose was their protection cut fit in because God said no oh God not even realizing me not even being able to see right away what God is doing but there was a supernatural paint come down in the car hey man it gave them a piece would not let fear take over they fear how to came in maybe he's a jerk the wheel a certain way and it would have been deadly could've jerked the wheel went off into a denture head-on into a pole but because the calmness of Christ came in they took the brunt and they were talking I'm reminded he said when are you all right and he looked over he saw will his feet climb an actor wouldn't let me say well if he could get out to the witness I can get out through the woman and I believe the testimony was but they stood there both had a scratch Oh both pinkies that was it he'll take care you in the midst of a crisis a man your protection is your purpose purpose your protection just don't it you got an angel amen you're not just anybody you're the bride of Jesus Christ no matter what comes Oh hold me [Applause] Maximus already God even we look at Joe Jesus said had you considered my servant job he said okay I'll move the hedge but don't touch it so that was the commandment do what you want to do but that's over all God they're all seeing eye watching the whole thing when the children of Israel was trapped by the Red Sea Amen Pharaoh's are becoming on the back in amen that all-seeing eye look down with anger and said look at addressing with this angry eyes it caused the sea to spread a man he's a protector in the time of trouble amen now we go on and look at this fear if slows shuts down I don't need it survival such as our digestive system fear weakens your immune system fear a man and can cause cardiovascular damage amen fear can impair your formation of long-term memory and caused damage to certain parts of the brain fear amen this can make it even more difficult to regulate fear you see and can leave a person anxious most of the time to some in chronic fear the world looks scary and their memories confirm that example if somebody go through something and then every time they get in that position again that's what comes back and causes an anxiety how many times people come to the prayer line and brother Brett up say oh you just got an anxiety I remember hearing the message about the young lady who a man was over she was a little child a dog chased her and she carried that fear throughout her entire life and it caused anxieties and the Prophet a man being a seer was able to go back all the way down to her childhood Switzer it's this whole bottom line though it was affecting her body it was affecting her health she could see when he take it out he'd take it out from the room amen the initial cause of that family amen so we're going to look at a few things here we see how fear can cause problems but that's a good fear as I say amen the Bible says in Proverbs amen to the first chapter the seventh verse that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction amen and psalms says the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgment of the Lord is true and righteous altogether so fear a healthy fear of healthy fear it's a fear god it's difficult see the problem is my wife and i was just having this conversation was having a conversation with her a dear friend and and he said it well she was speaking about his father and had some issues and he said well I don't know I'm not afraid you know because I know my father's going to heaven well that sounds good amen and I pray that your father goes to heaven but there is a fact you know if we would be honest with ourselves I have been to a funeral yet where they preached nobody inhale but the Bible says hell has enlarged its mouth and let me tell you something everybody ain't going to heaven you can't live like the devil and expect to go to heaven that is a requirement for that reward everybody not going so he did the world today see this that were God in such a loving God that he will I beg your pardon I beg your pardon he is a just God and if you don't come God's provided way there is a Hellfire way don't you know that's just that's just flat but it's right Amen I was talking to a president and he said well what will your preach conviction what do you mean we don't preach conviction if you don't know the Lord I hope the convictions all over you the only thing is not going to get back and you find yourself on the right side if you find yourself on the winning side imagine that conviction turns the joy Amen that sulking turns to shouting Amen not sadness turns to joy in your heart Amen because you know a man that he has called you a man that you have not only called you but you've heard to call not only have you heard to call and made but you believe the call not only did you believe because it made but you applied to token not only did you apply to token but after you apply the token you find rest Amen you find rest Amen and knowing Amen that absent from this body present with the Lord no matter what calm are no matter what go there's a certain rest there's a certain peace he said I give you peace my peace amen the world know nothing about us right everybody he's scared Amen we have a certain societal group that isn't afraid that they're losing their grip on America we have a certain societal group that's steering that all I'm a fan oh I'm afraid of what might happen to me if I go out in the dark here you have another group that's afraid oh my god I'm gonna lose all of my money the world is take it on that spirit of fear amen don't want to get ahead of myself let me read a little something here you love the Lord amen amen bear with me here for one second I have a quote here brought a prophet if you can put this up here let me make sure I get it right help me Lord Jesus amen you know the prophet of God says that he says when the supernatural comes in amen he says that's the mind of Christ you become so far away from your own thinking till in your mind Amen this I said I don't want to let me try to explain that because I can't so what is happening my brothers and sisters what gives you and courage what gives you that that's something immense special it is when the preaching of the word is going forth you accept the way the prophets say is that supernatural Amen that come down he said that is the mind of Christ that is the mind of Christ when you hear the word of God see a lot of times we need a Sabbath because you get caught up in looking at the man a lot of times we can't receive from God because we're busy looking at them and say well that's just this person but knowing the preface say when a minister is under the anointing of God a man is no longer that man amen but it's the supernatural mind of Christ amen amen so you're looking for the Holy Ghost say amen to the word you're looking for freedom you're looking for deliverance say Amen to the word a lot of times we think we're dissecting we're busy we're busy trying to pick through the food but if you come amen prayerful and under expectation Carter speak to you person goddess speak personally to your situation amen and just like headed right amen she received that word she responded he said that's nothing but the truth and automatically amen he say asked what you will he was pleased with her response he was replaced a man at how she accepted and received the word Amen but it came through a man it came through a man now looking at this a man go to the Seventh Seal message if you will I want to show you a man we look at Deuteronomy go to do this the the the the Seventh Seal 203 the Seventh Seal 6303 24 paragraph 203 a man Thank You Laura I just want to bring this out you know I had some other quotes here that I that I doubted that I had here on you know the Bible says here and now Israel that doeth the Lord that God require of thee but to fear the Lord thy God to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve him serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all that soul see so I want you to look at there's a healthy fear amen there's a fear of the Lord a man that would as I said before that is there to drive you to safety so so so not to get confused that that there is a healthy fear amen but that other fear we see a man that causes damage a man causes you to stumble causes you to fall it'll bring things on you hey man I just want to look at this because I was talking about the problems that of the day is everybody just want to put everybody in heaven that God is he's such a loving God that he's not also a Jessica Amen and the Seventh Seal 203 he says here paragraph two or three here is why they were missing now if you watch you know say with me here it's a little bit lengthy but I'll go dressed as a can here now it's watch now read I want you to read with me now go over to Deuteronomy to 29th verse in the twenty ninth chapter rather the tonight wrapped around there is a reason for these tribes not being there everything has got to have got a reason for it amen Deuteronomy we we want to take the twenty ninth chapter of Deuteronomy now the lord help us that we can understand now now we want to start and do the right number 229 that the 16th verse now listen Moses speaking for you know that for you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came through the nations which we pass by and you have seen the abominations and their idols of wood silver stone go which were among them everyone cared a little something or other a little statue or a saint silicone you know something like that see less therefore Notley says listen lest there should be among you a man a woman or a family or a tribe whose heart turns away this day from the Lord our God to go serve there go serve the gods these nations lest there should be among you a route that beareth gall and wormwood and it came to pass where he heareth the word of him of this curse and he that blessed himself in this heart and say I have peace through though I have walked in the imagination of my own heart see see right right there I have peace though I have walked in the imagination of my own heart and you know there's no fear there's no fear that's not a healthy fear so people not looking I see what's going on oh let me get to the house of God let me let me examine myself and make sure let me change my ways you know what they believe that they're going to heaven you see how to see the devil has got people they truly believe not only you did good person good person amen they are walk in the imagination of their own heart penny said and it came to pass that he heareth the words of this curse and that he blessed himself in his heart that's what the prophecy amen yes sir he says I have the root that bears and they come to pass I have peace magic my own heart let me get back to our world see people say oh he blesses himself you know what a little cross or something like that you know how did what they do they like to do you know read between lines here same thing you see it's the heathen tree it's like that heathen he blessed himself in his own heart his own imagination in his own line to add drunkenness to thirst and this is why they have no fear that healthy fear now they got some fear it is killing them but see if you if you're able to rightly divide the word of truth it will put away that spear it off here a man and direct you to that healthy fear of the Lord that will cause you to call on him that will call you that will cause you to seek safety amen and not only safety a man is in the bosom of the Savior Jesus Christ amen that healthy fear would drive you to your knees at night and say Lord forgive me that healthy fear a man would drive you that every time the dogs or the churches open I can't wait to get down amen that healthy fear amen that when you when you're found watching Amen by the Word of God amen when that wouldn't that mind better come you yoyoyo shoot out mind out of the way I'm going to the altar that healthy fear amen I'll make you want to come to prayer me we're talking about that healthy fear now we saw what that unhealthy fear does but there's a healthy fear as well Amen that have caused you to do things a man to change your ways it'll cause a man you to put God first in your life it'll cause you to wake up a little early in the morning a man to get down on your knees it'll cause you a man to spend more time with healthy Oh it calls you to love you brothers and sisters it calls you a man to make sure Amen at your anchor holes grips of solid rock amen amen talking about that healthy fear amen as we read on here amen he says here they drunken thirst just drink that don't make any difference as long as you go to church you are right then the Lord will not spare him but the anger of the Lord his jealousies shall smoke against that man and all and of all the curses that are written in this book don't take one word from it or add one word to it sea shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name under heaven that's why he's here on earth under heaven remember last time I was talking about that preacher a man who just got so discouraged he just got so fed up a man he just said I quit and he went and he got up a case of beer and he drank that case of beer and within a week God had took him home blotted out his name from under heaven amen so we read on that while he's here on earth see under heaven and the Lord shall separate unto him evil out of the tribes of Israel according to the curse of the Covenant that's written in the this book of law therefore if any man serve an idol or keep an idol on him and bless himself in his own imagination of his mind and serve idols God said man woman family tribe his name will be completely blotted out from amongst the people now is this right purpose says a man how true idolatry did the same thing in the church years ago and does today and I noticed watch how the Antichrist tried to make an anti move how you know that the devil types and patterns after God thinks what is a sin is the right thing perverted what is a lie is the truth misrepresented what is an adultery the right acts legal act done wrong why now now in trying to do this blot out a name did you notice in the church age the same beasts Amen that serves the event that the images of dead people and so forth tried to block out the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and give titles Father Son and Holy Ghost did you catch that yeah amen that the same thing that he did the devil look and say okay gonna blot out some names he says I'm that the plan of the devil was to blot out the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by deceiving the people and taking the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and replacing it with titles amen this is what the date Satan amen was doing he was watching God and seeing how God does think and he took perverted amen let's go on amen so we see Dan and Ephraim did just that under a hypocrite of the king of Israel and imposter Jeroboam so we see that a man people like to try and say that God is not a Jessica but I beg to you to different Amen he is a loving God he's a righteous God but he's also a Jessica amen and once you begin a man to understand and have a revelation of that a man maybe you have a healthy fear because he was keeping people in the world a day from having a healthy fear is that he only feeds them killed one one side of the story only one he's a loving God he loves everybody if God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son and all I got to do is be good to my neighbor feed the poor and half of me doing that and still think they going to heaven ain't doing nothing but chasing money I mean when it comes down to it that's all most people doing is chasing they wake up in the morning chasing money come home late chasing I been there I can't go I got overtime Oh God what you skip watching need

sudden you've got conflict coming to church is it really well oh is it pyrite Fool's Day Chason fools go a lot of people like that in the streets protesting for equal rights and mobile money to the glass ceiling that fools go amen fools go when the wealthy man he said place yo-yo-yo-yo treasures on heavenly things that's true wealth amen so let us go on we see here that people hearts are selling them because of fear yes and that's Bible and we see science has confirmed that that unhealthy fear a man will cause trouble now I want to look at a little story here in the Bible a man go to John the fourteenth chapter a man and swear I took my reading from a man John the fourteenth chapter twenty fifth verse and we're just going to look at something real quick and then we're gonna let you go a many-many man says here in 22050 citing things that i have spoken unto you being yet present with you 26 says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost mine see the comforter which is the Holy Ghost see the Holy Ghost is the same Lord Jesus in another form amen coming listen now coming in by teaching of the word and spirit okay having a conversation with someone not long ago I'm talking on the evidence that our Holy Ghost and I say the problem I say a lot of people believe that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost I said now that's not true it is a gift it is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen said that the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Holmes a man you could you can have the Holy Ghost even on your flesh Amen that's emotion that's good that's good but but see the problem is you can't stop there a man you can have a change of attitude you can have a change your countenance and oh you can do good that's good that's wonderful happy for that but you can't stop there amen it has to go further amen he says dad I think you said my spirit he says I'm sorry says a new spirit that I will give you and then I'll give you my spirit see he has to change your raggedy spirit in order to be able to put his spirit in you he say you mean as a spirit still like cussing folks out and putting all talking about you guys speaking in tongues come in church speaking tiles get out the parking lot dad ain't no holy go you got a good feeling but that won't do it that won't carry you through that won't carry you through in a crisis amen you must go all the way tonight listen that what he said wasn't here what I've loved they said he said it comes by teaching of the word I'm going I'm gonna show you something here if you just bear with me a little bit we're going to get into something whom the father whom the father was sin in my name now I read from the 26th when the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you Amen so now if there's no teaching there's nothing to bring remember what are you going to draw from in the time of Chris in the time of a crisis what are you going to go back to what is he gonna bring to your remembrance me tell you something if the only time you open your Bible are looking to the word is when you come on Sunday you missing it why did she go a lot of times when revelation calms scripture identify Scripture he said out of the mouth of two or three let everything to establish on the earth and then a lot of times I can be studying at home and I run across something and then come right to church of his confirming from the pulpit that's what it does that thing on the inside and then I can be looking somewhere else oh alright work or just go through the day and then something else comes and just hit that thing again I said lord I know that you I know it's you and it ain't cuz it into my soul but if you just hear it from the pulpit you just hear from a man you say I don't know rock made me off on that one this little bit retro I don't know he might he might not be quite right on that see but if you you better if you if you if you if you big time with God yes you spend time in the world I walked with my handphone I'm not listening to music constantly listening to the Word of God I even got my Bible app listen to a scripture they're gonna go from Scripture to Scripture oh I got a prophets message old and it's gonna do the fragment oh I'm listening to it all servers from right here and I will hear something reading the prophets message and stopped and said well let me go back you just listened at that in the Bible right what am i doing you got two dogs at war I'm feeding my white dog you got a white dog you got a black dog and they both at war and which one is gonna win the one you feed the most I'm feeding my white dog hey man because the mind is a battlefield and Manning them two dogs of war and all of the time Amen you let that white dog get a little weak that black dogs on camera and what got happened with that white dog so to eat that blood started tearing up that white dog fear sexy because that's what their black dog is he bring all of that kind of stuff fear envy strife jealousy see that's that black dog but you begin to feed on the world ago Amen that white dog hey man I we used to watch the rest yeah but they had you know they had a good side and a bad side and we just cheered for the come on dusty road Briscoe Brothers and all of them boy way back go to toilet in Washington and your favorite fighter he seemed like he died and the man kind of and all of a sudden he left but all of a sudden from the chair of the crowd you'll see dog [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen then alright so we look at all into this and then he said the peace I leave you my peace I give you that the world giveth that know that has my peace I give you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth unto you see in times of trouble the world may try to give you peace by certain means but jesus said that he would give us a peace but a different way and by different teaching that you that of how the world would do it and that it would be his own peace being transferred into you not on you being transferred into you my peace that's the comforter if there's anything that we should desire and more than anything in these trying time is the baptism of the Holy it'll bring you a piece it'll bring you a comforter amen let's go on Luke the twenty-fourth chapter 25th amen verse then he said unto them it meant all fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophet has spoken these two men on the road to Emmaus a man hadn't been very except hadn't been very experienced a lot of peace in their hearts at the time a man they was walking in their hearts were troubled they were saddened that countenance was down amen and all of a sudden as they begin to tribal a men are down this road a man being so we see a correlation between the unbelieving heart and the troubled heart amen and behold two of them went the same day to the village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs now my wife and I was in the high glass place and I'm sitting here looking at this and she leave me alone I'm trying to share with her what the Lord is forgiving me and she was saying like you showed her prophet said all that I said well baby I'm gonna look there monk I won't make show tonight so I looked up this three school and three school is six comes to six three school and a furlong is about an eighth of a mile you know and so I begin to look at it you know I said well a furlong is the eighth of a mile so you go seven miles then you need my motor have a you know 7/8 one more to have a whole mile that's that's a whole mouth so in and threescore - 6:00 it meant one more before seven so I begin to just kind of look at that a little bit and now we see Jesus was walking with these guys amen emmaus on this road to emmaus amen I don't leave it this way so that cause any confusion a man he traveled this distance and I believe that through these seven churches but we are doing the same thing down through several Church ages amen well we're traveling down the road amen now I wanted to look at something he says and they talked together and all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they could meal together a reason Jesus himself drew near and with them amen how many know if we start talking about him he'll draw near amen but their eyes well holding that they should not know him a man did I needed a little grease Proctor said when you when you sleep your sleep and you wake up you get all of that in your eyes and you just can't see see they needed to look cool Greece in Revelation the third chapter xviii first he called it though I say right that I may see he said that counselor they buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayst be rich and white raiment that thou may us be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness not be not appear and anoint my eyes with eyes that I may see see so he had about a revelation i'ma tell you he said they didn't know him they couldn't see him you know they they stay solemn but they couldn't see him you understand what I'm saying they saw him with their physical life but they just couldn't they didn't understand they didn't have a revelation of who he was amen now and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one among another as you walk and I said Amen and the one of them whose name was Cleophus and said unto Him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things that which have come to pass haven't you watching been watching the news mandus all kind of stuff going on Cobra ok I'm so rioting in the streets people scared all over the place who are you that you don't know what's going on people can't see ok that desert God made a promise he made a promise in the showers not bad with me let me go on and the one of them whose name was Cleophus answered and said are you a stranger here and has not known two things which have come to pass in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto Him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people now and now the chief priests and the rulers delivered him up and said condemned him to death and to have crucified Him but we trusted that it had been he which would have redeemed Israel mine and besides all this today is the third day since those things were done amen ye-yeah being a certain woman also of our company made us astonished when were early at thus approaches a man and when they found not his body came saying that they had also been seen a vision of angels which said that he is alive and a certain of them which were with us went to the supporter and found it even so as the woman had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken you see because over over over in Matthew the 17th chapter in the 22nd verse the Lord told him what they expect he told him what to expect now let's take a look at that and while they abode in Galilee jesus said unto them the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of man and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and he was not a man and they were exceedingly sorrow amen he was not talking to them in parables a man he was speaking to them in plain clear language that left no room for misinterpretation amen so what was their problem he told them exactly what was going to happen you see the prophet of God came and he preached a message called Martin and it's made clear by prophecy see and if you get thrown back and look through the message this is Martin the day Vince made clear by prophecy we had a prophet in this day that told us that these things were going to come to pass he told us that these things was going to pass but I have you to know that seems we looked at this time back through Jesus that when he had revealed he's walking on this road to Emmaus and about the seventh hour about the seventh mouth amen he began to reveal himself he began a man to expound on the word Amen he said from Moses all the way to show that the process of spoken and he began to too slowly reveal himself through them as they made this work and just like we are on this journey about the seventh time we had a revelation he began to reveal himself amen in this time of trouble and men told us that these things were gonna take place that there was going to be wars and rumors of wars there was going to be pestilence that was going to be all of these things take place amen now in Jesus time looking at this these things came place it took place after the first and the second pool of his ministry now he's coming to his third pool of his ministry what revealing himself to them it was a secret I got it right here I'm gonna just preach I'm a quick read he said he said it was a secret that was only for his followers amen there was a time that the Pharisees and the different ones they had heard these things too so they went and they made sure that the tomb a man was sealed it was sealed the rap was in front of it and they stood guard because they was afraid that the disciples would cut him steal his body sort of had made sure that the thing was sealed up see so when the time of the third day when the time take time for him the third day when he resurrected amen if the seals were broken amen they found the seal broken so once the seal is broken amen at any time amen for him amen tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu manifest himself amen to his believers they were running around scared they had barricaded themselves in the house from fear tell you a fool slow of heart to believe all that the prophet has spoken they believe part of it they knew that this day would come to me he said and he said we thought that he was gonna be the Redeemer but they killed him but he told him he and Matt did exactly what was going to take place but in the time of crisis he said he'll bring all things back to it remember he said I have to leave you but I will send you a comforter and that comforter is to do what it's there be the thing that's gonna bring in time of crisis it's gonna bring things to your remembrance it's gonna bring things to your remembrance to hold to God's unchanging hand amen because he's teaching you how one way of the Holy Ghost we can receive the whole ago we feel it on our flesh Peter but by the teaching right teaching when we get it into our soul we have to hear it believe it apply it and rest on it rest on it amen so we go on and they we go on and on eroded and and he begins more to expound and man him and reveal himself amen and once they caught the revelation a man of who he was they were exceeding great joy just like in this hour amen Christ came back the seal was broken a prophet through the lips of a prophet told us amen these things that would come to pass and but the Holy Ghost he will bring things to our remembrance the prophecy when these things start happening watch that third pool watch third pulled in amen I like to read a little something in closing seven seal a man to 84 seventh seal to 84 a man yes he says in Sabino King sitting up there that morning I had my hands up and the wind had blow my old black hat down when I was sitting or I'm sorry when I was standing there with my hands up praying I said Lord God what does this mean I can't understand it Lord what am I to do if it is my going home time let me go up there go up here is where they'll never find me I don't want nobody to be mourning around if I'm going I want I want just the family to think that I just took a walk and they won't find me hide me away somewhere if I'm going to go away why let me go maybe Joseph will find my Bible laying here someday and let him use it see if I'm going away let me go Lord and I had my hands out and all that once something hit my hand I don't know I can't say did I go to sleep I don't know or did I go into a trance he says I don't know was it a vision I can't tell you only thing I can say is just the same thing like them angels was and it struck my hand and I looked at it it was a sward and it had pearl handle real pretty and it had a guard over it and with gold and the blade looked like something of a chrome like silver only it was real shiny and it was so fetters feather edge sharp oh my I thought isn't that the prettiest thing just it just fit my hand I thought that's awful pretty but I said hey I've always are always afraid of them things a sward I thought what will I do with that and just the inner voice shook down through there the rocked and that rocked the rocks and said it is the sward of the King and then I come out of it the sward of the King now if it's if it said the sward of the King but it said the sward of the king I'm sorry go back because I missed that and he said a swarm of aching but it said the sward of the King and there is only one the king and that's God and he has one sword that's his word what I live by and that so help me God standing over his holy desk here standing over this holy desk here with the holy word laying here it's the word Amen oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and the secret of third the secret the third standing there when this left me something just came to me and said don't fear now I did it here no voice like on the inside of me it spoke I have to just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said don't fear this is the third Pole amen so I say that my brothers and sisters we see these things we see that Satan is roaming truly like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour we see that the deceitfulness of the world today is causing people to have a bad fear but also causing them to not have a healthy fear we see as believers sometime we have to have bring things to our remembrance that God has has unveiled himself in this hour told us the secret things amen there's some things that the world know but they're things amen that that through the message of the hour that amen he only speaks to us in secret let not your hearts be troubled in this hour hold to God and changing hand don't let fear overtake you this is the time this is a glorious time watch that third pool amen our musicians call himself me thank you Lord Jesus no matter what we're going through no matter amen what the devil may bring I shall not fear amen I've had the song on my heart amen thinking maybe if my

your heart be troubled a man before we leave just if you would just grab a scriptwriter Psalms 91 and put it there verse 5 we certainly appreciate brother Troy and just getting himself out of the way I thought that was very timely and a real good reminder a man if there was understand if I'm not mistaken I think the phrase fear not is spoken 365 times in the Bible right and so God's really trying to get a message to us especially at a time like this if there's any time that we should be a real answer nice to devil trying to bring down these spirits and you're coming from various angles they come with a pandemic then they come with something to divide the nation right and you know just just just things from everywhere and it's just a spirit of fear if we don't if we're not careful we'll fall for the spirit all right it will fall for we don't even realize that we are anointed by the spirit of fear amen amen amen God gonna take care of your loved ones right God gonna take care of each
