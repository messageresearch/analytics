Father we be careful to give you the praise and glory that you alone are worthy of and the bride says amen amen God bless you Saints always good to be in the house of the Lord turn with me to Ephesians chapter 6 we'll have an opening script there and then we'll spend most of our study our lesson in First Kings chapter 22 I always uh appreciate the opportunity to be here it's a lot of uh um it takes a lot for our pastor to just open up his pulpit and so there's a great deal of respect that I acknowledge just standing behind this sacred desk so I don't bring my own thoughts I just bring God's words to you amen so appreciate brother Jack in the assembly here we always feel welcome we always feel at home so Ephesians chapter 6 Ephesians chapter 6 this will not be our essential part of of our lesson but just wanted to kind of use it as a foundation so Ephesians 6 verse2 it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefor take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand in the evil day and having done all to stand amen verse 14 stand therefore having done all to stand hold your ground amen having your loins gir about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness now let's jump over to First [Music] Kings it's a scripture that we have made reference before but as I when I study something and a little bit more just gets opened up to me I just feel like I just want to revisit it so First Kings chapter [Music] 22 say Amen if you're there amen all right we'll read the first five verses and I'll let you have your seats and it says and they continued 3 years without war between Syria and Israel and it came to pass in the third year that Jehoshaphat the king of Juda came down to the king of Israel and the king of Israel said unto his servants know ye that rth and Gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria and he said unto Jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramth Gilead and Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I am as thy art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today may the Lord have his blessings to the reading of the word you may enjoy the Comforts of your seats as o preacher says as I remain standing amen amen you know we're we're living in a a moment now where we need to take a stand yes sir yes regardless of what we are confronted with regardless of what we are faced with yeah we need to take a Gallant standard and if there's ever a time um there's never been a time like this time now where your faith as a Christian will be tested what you believe right why you believe the way you believe the purpose of why you believe the value of what you believe and that testing is going to come in many forms and Fashions sometimes might be in your face other times it might be really subtle right so we must be very wise and understand the trickery of the devil because remember the devil is not some ugly thing with the two-headed with a with a with a with two horns and you know that that's what the world would have you to believe the Bible says he comes to you as an angel of Light so he looks good he looks attractive sin feels that way praise the Lord and uh so we realize that we're in a battle and so we must be guarded because the devil he doesn't come at you as uh he doesn't approach us as a peanut butter spread but he approached all of us as individuals so one thing that might be a fault for you might be a strength for somebody else something that might be a strength for somebody else might be a fault for someone else so we must be always uh uh we must be always guarded around our weaknesses and say Lord you know my strength and you know my weaknesses and the devil knows your strength and he also knows your weakness now it's not a shame to fall don't get quiet but it is shameful to stay while you're falling down because we were built to get back up you were built you were conditioned not only to take a punch but to withstand any storm that comes your way and the storms will come your way I'm not talking about a wind that's blowing here and there I'm talking about a hurricane five storm but whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger the fact that you're here this morning only proves to the devil that God has given you the victory you could have sat there and laid in bed but you chose by God's grace to come to church and that in itself is a victory hallu take a stand and so we find and I'm not going to keep you too long but I love this lesson right here because there's just so many thoughts there between the story with Ahab and let me give you some background to First Kings and we we spend a lot of time the whole chapter mainly on First Kings 22 but to give you some background Ahab was married to uh uh Jezebel and uh he wanted nebo's a Vineyard and so cuz the vineyard that was in chapter 21 The Vineyard was right next to uh ahab's uh Palace and so Ahab looked at the P looked at the vineard like that's a beautiful garden I could really I could it would be nice for me to have that Garden so he goes to naboth and he says hey naboth um can I have the vineyard in naboth being a God-fearing man he says look I prayed about it and uh this is my uh inheritance and I can't just give it to you you know The Audacity Of The Devil he just want to take things from you right and sometimes we willingly give it up but we got to pray about if God gives you something it's your inheritance the devil has no right to what God has given youen thank you Lord amen and so Ahab didn't like uh nebo's response so he was down in the dumps and he was kind of all you know he wouldn't eat bread and you know he was just kind of the wowy Woos as brother Drew would say and so uh Jezebel gets home and looks at her husband it's like what's wrong with you and he's like well you know I went to naboth and I wanted the vineyard and he says no and she looks at him and and she says well aren't you the king of Israel like you could do whatever you want to do right that's the attitude of the devil all right the devil feels like he could just walk all over you but you're God's Property let me say it again the devil thinks he can walk all over you you got to remind the devil that you're God's Property you're not just anybody's property you're God's Property God has authority over you God has watchful eye over you and through some uh uh through some cunningness and through some uh um trickery um Jezebel forges Ahab signature and orders the death of naboth yeah Elijah gets wind of this and the Lord spoke to Elijah the tishbite and says go to Ahab and uh he prophesies over Ahab and says Ahab God has seen what has happened within your household death has been pronounced and the Bible says when Ahab heard these things he rent his clothes and put on side cloth and fasted and he prayed said Lord forgive me now there's more that I'm leaving out but I'm just laying the foundation here bless the Lord and God told Elijah saying look I have seen that Ahab has humbled himself and because he's done that I will not bring those evil in his days but in the days of his son will I bring those evil Lord so their judgment was laying at the door of Ahab right he was death has been pronounced unto him but because he has repented of his ways it moved upon the heart of God and so we get to verse chapter 22 where we just read there had been in Prior chapters there have been a longstanding war between Syria and Israel and Syria had captured Routh Gilead and so Jehoshaphat which uh was King over Judah because there was a split between Israel and Judah there was uh he was the king over Judah and he represented a lineage that was usually in favor with God and then you had Ahab that represented Israel the king over Israel yeah so they were of the same bloodline if you will but they had two kings that ruled over them were together and so and it came to pass in the third year Jehoshaphat just kind of meandered down and and just said let me go have Fellowship on my brother Israel and the king of Israel was probably sitting there reflect and he says you know ramoth Gilead really belong to us and so when he convinced his servants that we need to go get the territory after three years of Peace he's like you know what I'm going to start some trouble with Syria I'm going to go and take this land that belongs to me and and he probably had good intentions I'm sure and Jehoshaphat happened to be visiting at that time and and he looked at Jehoshaphat he says Jehoshaphat let me uh let me ask you a question you ever thought about rondra the oat probably said no it never occurred to me and let me tell you something be careful who you align yourself with right now right now this Christian walk is an individual Affair it doesn't mean you can't pray for your brother it doesn't mean you can't pray for your sister but the Bible didn't say to them that overcometh the Bible says to him that overcometh the Bible says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling because the Lord reveals something to you doesn't mean that I have something to do with [Applause] it be careful who you're lying yourselves with Saints yes sir and so God spoke to so Ahab believed that he had a a a vision and not necessarily from God but a vision of what he wanted to do and Jehosaphat he says you know we are the same people we of the same message Believers all right we say Amen to the same gospel let me tell you we all need to go through the blood of Jesus Christ just because we sit underneath the banner of this message doesn't mean that we all are saved that's the truth that's the truth I'm not putting I'm not putting anybody in and I'm not taking anybody out I'm just saying you got to walk the line that God has shown to you sir not to someone else your salvation is not dependent upon somebody else being saved God didn't call me for my opinion about you being saved your pastor's obligation is to preach the gospel not to tell God if you can make it or not that decision has been decided by God not now but before the foundation of the world so Jehoshaphat got into it because it sounded like a sound argument you know the devil knows how to make a good argument to persuade you yes Hees you may not have even thought about something and the devil kind of put presents all forms of arguments of why you should do something and why you shouldn't do something and why you should go there and why you shouldn't come to church and why you shouldn't do this the devil knows how to put on a good argument he's been putting an argument from the very beginning yay did God had say all right and Jehoshaphat said my people are your people but Jehoshaphat was a little bit wise too he says now before we get beside ourselves because I like where you're coming from I I can understand where you're coming from you want to go get this land that belongs to you he says but let can we just at least pray about it yeah sints let me tell you don't make a decision on impulse wait on the Lord be still and wait on the Lord even when someone's whispering in your ear just make sure that that whisper is of God don't make a decision on the carnal ways don't make a decision on just your own fleshly desire make a decision on thus sayith the Lord when you know that you've made the decision because God has blessed it not even the Devil Himself in flesh can stop it amen amen amen prise God so Jo Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel inquire I praise at the word of the Lord let's pray about it this is a big deal no matter what decisions you have to make in life whether it's a big decision or small decision consult God that's right we talk to each other all the time but the last person we talk to is God and that's the first person you should be talking to exactly right trying to make a decisional job talk to God a home talk to God your next move in life talk to God sir praise the lord it's not anything you just just reminders of things you should already know because in that moment you get caught up and you just want to make a fleshy decision and sometimes you know sometimes the the cares of Life pressure you where you feel like you got your deadline is tomorrow be patient because if fits for you it's not going to go anywhere if it's for you it's going to be yours if it's for you no one can take it if that's your seat no one can have it amen what's yours is yours amen if God has given it to you no matter how many people come no matter how many people go that is what God has given onto you and when he's giving it to you it's for you to [Applause] keep Don't Be Afraid about losing something you haven't had if God wanted you to have it you'll have it don't try to get ahead of God be patient hallu let God be magnified in all of this Hallelujah sometimes we don't even know what we want God just put it in front of you oh my Lord this is what I've been looking for God knows what you need more so than you know what you need yourself that's right brother praise the Lord amen then the king of Israel gathered 400 prophets can you just imagine so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat sitting on the throne and Jehoshaphat looks at uh AB that you know do you have anybody here that we could consult with can we get some preachers kind of get some spiritual guidance around this me at least I'd like to know what thus said the Lord has to say about it so Ahab like I got you I know 400 men they've been this they've been a Ministry uh uh they've been a a Ministry School for 30 plus years between 400 prophets and so many years you talking about like 500 years of experience I mean they they know what to talking about they never preach what against what I believe everything they say I say yes and amen now there is some degree of Truth to that because not all the time there were false prophets right and I'll get to that in a moment right and so they said unto him so you know a have you know when you know you got your fre favorite preacher that's going to come people get all excited I am right and so Ahab was all excited right and so they began to preach hollering screaming renting raing all right and Ahab was say amen he was shouting toing back flips cartwheels he's like I love this type of preaching they said go the Lord has given you this land he's delivered into hand Jehoshaphat just sit there just watching all right all right praise the Lord you got to be listening to what God is saying to you you got to make sure it's according to the word of God don't get caught up in a moment you got to say is this part of the Bible is this what the message says and listen to this Jehosaphat was uh Ahab was so happy and the preachers were so happy because they made Ahab happy yes let me tell you a true Minister that stands behind the GOP the the the pulit here is not interested in making you happy they're interested in making your soul saved yes sir it might tear you to pieces it might break you up but God brings the healing to get you back on that path yes he does brother amen go up prosper and so Jehoshaphat says after all the preaching was done Jehoshaphat says um he let me ask you a question um I now I appreciate those 400 prophets and I listen really intensively to what they said I couldn't really find it in the scripture I was looking through I was looking at Genesis didn't see it there I was looking at the prophets I didn't see it there I even looked at Revelation and there was nothing there I looked at the message couldn't find a thing where those prophets saying I mean they shouted really good they they danced pretty well their voice was fantastic and they were so eloquently spoken come on you got to see through all that facade and say I need some gospel truth am may not agree with my belief but as long as it's tied to the word of God I'm going to hold to it am and jehos says is there not one now and the king of Israel said unto him there is one a shading that that's that's very shady think about it because Jehosaphat probably looked at Ahab and says you brought 400 but you left one of them [Music] out you brought 400 of your best but you left one out right oh my and the one that I want to see that's the one that you didn't want to bring amen bring him I want to hear from him right I want to hear some gospel truth from him I want to be delivered I want to I want the chains broken I want to know the raw truth I may not like it the flesh may not like it the caral Mind may not like it but as long as my spirit can say Amen to it I want to receive nothing but the truth and the king of Israel said unto Jehosaphat there is yet one man Micah the son of imla by whom we have we may inquire of the Lord but I hate him I hate him not not like I I dislike him not that he gets me gets on my nerves I hate him and if I I could only imagine if I was there in the presence of those two King talking I would have heard the gut of Ahab rumbled hate you laugh but that's how the devil feels about you the devil hates you every time you get up in the morning the devil hates that every time you come to church and you say praise God the devil hates that every time you praise God and give him your best the devil hates that whatever whatever the devil hates that's what I do more [Applause] of if the devil don't like praise I praise them more if the devil if the devil doesn't like me being in church I'm at church [Applause] hourly praise the Lord hallelujah if the devil doesn't like me singing I sing the loudest whatever the devil doesn't like I do more of it cuz I'm here to torment the devil hallah you're not a pushover God has endowed you with spiritual Powers Hallelujah speak the word of God hallelujah don't let the devil rule over your house you're the head of your houseen amen that devil hates you every time he sees you he just sees when you're smiling that makes him the worst it's like every time she knows she's sick but she's smiling through it there's a God that she believes in she knows what the doctor just said about her house but yet she's praising God praise God in the storm praise God when you don't feel well praise God when you're sick so that way when your healing come you have even more reason to praise God am oh yes ab ab say he does not prophesy he doesn't preach anything I like it's as if he's in my home it's as if he's in my CL it it's as if he's in my job like like he's just everywhere I go I just don't like his preaching just make me feel uncomfortable that's why you know that's why I just don't like coming to church but you know I I just I want people to think otherwise right like I got to be in the church cuz I want people to think differently you're not impressing you sister you didn't show up for your brother you proven a point of God Amen that's right my God I hate him he does not pro prophesy good concerning me but evil the Bible says woe to them that call evil good and good evil that's the day we're living in people don't know the difference they're calling evil good and good evil they don't know the difference they're so deceived amen and Jehoshaphat being the the the the wiser of the two says let not the king say so let's just here amiah you never know let's just terma and so the king of Israel called an officer and said hasten hither Micaiah the son of imla I'm sure as uh the officer came to Ahab Ahab summons him come here officer runs yes sir go get Micaiah snorting because he's all upset Joseph probably picking up with those exus is like I don't like his attitude but now I'm really interested in by hearing what this preast is say I'm really interested in what he has to say I'm going to be comfortable for this service cuz he's going to preach some good work especially if he doesn't like it oh I know I'm going to love it and Ahab says go fetch Micaiah and he looks at the officer and he gives him a win you know what to do so he goes and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne having put on the robes in a void place in the entrance of the Gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesies before them so they're just waiting for Micaiah to come and ahab's looking at those 400 prophets just smiling away thinking about ramoth Gilead and feeling blessed feeling special josephat just like you know something just don't feel right about this just something just ain't right you know sometimes you you know sometimes you'll find yourself in a situation where you may not find a scripture for something but you just know it's not right you may not find a quote but you just know it's not right trust what God is trying to tell you it may not you may not find in the scripture but your spirit is tied to God's words God is protecting you the Bible says shun every appearance of evil shun every appearance of evil it may not be evil but the fact that it looks like the devil I'm going to stay away from it I'm not going to tempt God can we say praise the Lord Lord amen and zedekiah the son of chia made him horns some beautiful horns and he said thus sayi the Lord now I caught this for the first time he says thus say the Lord he didn't get a word from the Lord blasphemy Dangerous Grounds using Lord as an opportunity to confirm his position oh my God Amen with these horns Thou shalt push the syrians until thou H ha consumed [Music] them and all the prophets prophesy so saying go up to rain with Gilead and prosper and for the Lord shall delivered into the king's end you will prosper and the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him saying listen now Micaiah the king want to see you now we know that uh how you preach we're not always in full agreement with the way you you preach the word but this is an important occasion the king is wanting to go because the King has made up his mind sometimes people pray about something but they've already made up their mind God look at you just kind of Chuckles you made up your mind and you come go God should I do this and in your heart you've already decided to do it so no matter what God says you've already decided it when you confront God when you approach God about something you got to have a clear heart say Lord whatever you decide that's what I'm going to do amen you want to hold God accountable for what he puts in your heart when you if you decide to if he tells you to do something or not do something because you're following the leadership of the holy spirit amen amen and so no matter what a preacher preaches a minister preaches if you've already made your decision you haven't consulted God there's no good that this word's going to do for you you got to be willing to yield yourself to the Holy Spirit say Lord whatsoever the whatsoever you desire that's what I'm going to do and so they go to Micaiah and say look I want you to listen now they've already preached this gospel they've said it's okay they they're giving Micaiah The Cliff Notes they're giving Micaiah these uh these notes to compare but Micaiah is not anyone's puppet right right Micaiah didn't fall for their trap and here's the thing Micaiah he wanted to seek God Revelation behind what he should preach I can't even begin to tell you and I and I'll just maybe open up a little bit because I've been find myself guilty and I've been a little bit more cautious and over the years you gain a little bit more wisdom and maturity around these things but you get caught up in the moment and you quote some you quote some something a preacher says and and it say brother Braham said and you you get caught up in a moment and I say brother Bram said and one time a brother caught me and just you know just a good Fellowship like can you show me the quote where brother Bram said this that and the other like yeah I'm all jealous and all happy I'm like I I can't wait to show you I'm like I'm going to get right back with you this was before like the age of where we had the real good instant communication so I went back and I looked went back and I looked went back and I looked looked again called another brother I'm like hey bro let me ask you a question uh you know the quote where the brother brother says X Y andz they're like yeah he all excited with me I'm like that's a good quote a it's like yeah show me where it's at he's like yeah let me call you back waited uhhuh waited uhhuh waited uhhuh the brother called me back he like Hey Brother Jean um I I couldn't find the quote I couldn't find a quote so we start rationalizing maybe he meant to say this and that and so finally I realized the quote was never there and what happened was that there was variations of that quote it's like when you whisper something to somebody on one side by the time it gets to the in person it's a completely different message that's the reason why you just don't quote something that because somebody else says it you got to look for it in the scripture you got to the Bible says prove all things and hold fast to that which is good sir yes sir and I learned that the hardware I said Lord thank you for giving me that lesson next time I know I'm not going to be just somebody else that's just going to quote something I want to be able to say there it is in the word be your own person don't quote just because you hear the quote you got to go back and look for it and say I see it in the message I see it in the word yes sir amen and Micaiah understood that he's like I'm not going to just say what he says just because he said this thus say the Lord we just saw where zedekiah says thus sayith the Lord and it wasn't really thus sayith the Lord it was thus say [Music] zedekiah you got to know where you stand because the devil throw all kinds of stuff at you and Mah was not concerned about making Ahab happy right because the good thing Mah knows he says you know what I'm not on ahab's payroll right amen I'm not on ahab's payroll he does not write my check he does not write my money he does not give me a paycheck I can preach whatever I want to preach the Bible says that the borrower is servant to the lender amen yes sir the borrower is servant to the lender for any of us who's paying mortgage that's what the very root of that word is death yeah Mor that's the very root of that word you go to a morchary that's what mortgage is that when you get a loan you're tied to that all the way till you're that's right amen the borrower is servant to the lender and the devil understands that concept he tries to put you in a position where you're constantly a servant to him that's the reason why I could look to the blood of Jesus Christ that has paid all my debts so you're no longer bounded by the devil that's the reason why the Bible says he who the son has set free is free indeed you're no longer servant to the devil the chains have been broken and God has prid all your debts Jesus amen the devil realize that but some of us don't don't realize that and we still pay interest to the devil we still pay interest to the devil and God telling you stop paying interest I paid all of that there's nothing for you to do all I need you to do is worship me when you get in the bill in the mail and it's from the devil just rip it up say God's already paid for that check your records check the database something's wrong cuz God paid my debt he paid the debt I did oh I owe a debt I could not pay that's the that's what I believe in he paid the debt for you Lord don't walk around believing that you're servant of the devil that you're bounded by him that you're committed to him that you're imprisoned by him amen I might have shared this before but there's a story of a they often use this in business of a of a baby elephant that was tied to the tree and they chain this baby elephant to the tree and every time the baby elephant kind of tries to go can't really go anywhere so he felt like he didn't have any strength he tried it again felt like he didn't have any strength over the years he was getting bigger but over the years because he was tied to that tree he was getting less discouraged making forth an effort because in Prior years experience he had been unsuccessful and when now he had matured into his full potential he had stopped trying completely because he's relied on his past experience that he has not been successful so even though he had the ability to just break the tree and set himself free his mind binded him binded him all the way to the Past I'm telling you the devil's holding you to your pth when God has forgiven you of your past break the tree and be free of the things of the [Applause] past God that's why I like the story of Rahab she had a history boy she had a history God came on the scene killed everybody everybody as a brother said God erased her history Somebody went through it says I heard you said I heard you did this I heard you did that all have says show me one show me one her past was gone her history was no longer around God has taken your history and put it underneath the blood you have no past sins God has blessed you thank you Lord hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Lord God praise God let Thy word I pray thee be like one of them and Micaiah said as the Lord liveth yes I want you to follow this as the Lord liveth yes Jesus what the Lord saith unto me that will I speak as the Lord liveth as long as God is alive yes yes I'm going to serve him as long as he's alive I'm going to say what he says as long as he's alive I'm going to preach this word as long as he's alive I'm going to Echo what the word says but if there isn't a true God then my purpose doesn't make sense but as long as he's alive yeah he started with that yeah he wanted to preface and let the officer know when you get back to Ahab I want you to let him know if God's Alive I'm going to say what he says right so that way when you get back to him before he sees me he's not too upset right amen can you just imagine you walk differently when you know God's with you there's a degree of confidence when you know God's with you you can approach a situation knowing that God's with you and not only God all the host of Heaven stands with you amen when Abraham was outside of the will of God when abrah was in the will of God he was able to defeat five Kings five Kings easy right he was in the will of God he was able to defeat five Kings when he was outside of the will of God he was afraid of one king the difference between that when you when you're in the will of God you know that there's not a devil that could comee before you thank you Lord but when you outside of the will God you're the most timid and cry Lord cuz the devil's put that over you right right and Jesus himself he came on the scene the first thing he says fear not little flock because it's not in your nature that's not meant for you it was never meant for you to have fear the reason why the Bible says in Genesis when Adam fell and when God went looking for him Adam Where Art Thou and finally Adam comes out the Woodworks and he says he says I heard your voice and he says a word that God never taught him I was afraid and God was like afraid we you never been afraid before we've had Fellowship all the time you you and I we talked all the time we like why would you be afraid now because he was outside of the will of God the moment you're outside of the will of God that's when fear begins to set in so if you're anxious about something if you're fearful about something say Lord help me get my life right what is not in order cuz I should not have the spirit of fear you've given me the spirit of overcoming power amen right so my guy walked up the Bible says he came to the king can you just imagine aab inting there just looking at him just grinding his teeth just seeing him come walking in just seething and upset and just his heart rate's going up if you were to take his blood pressure it just would have rose up like he was just every my didn't even say a word he's already upset he's huffing and puffing like I just know he's going to the moment he opens his mouth he's going to say something and meanwhile just watching this he's like okay well okay he seems like a servant of God to me all right he a show Bold and he he's not all out there he's just kind of humble I like the way he's presenting himself he's all excited he's like I'm getting ready to hear the word and so he came to the king and the King said unto Micaiah Mah you heard what the prophet said all 400 of them eloquent men that went to the best schools in the nation they know what they're talking about they know exact they didn't even stutter micaa unlike you I don't know where you came from I don't know where you got your education I don't know who your God is but what j i here want to hear from you and I want to ask you Mah now we've already decided this because we were we heard from the prophet shall we go to RIS Gilead to battle or shall we forbear you know it's just kind of like that and should we go should we not go you trying to tell me better not tell me I shouldn't go and Mak is like you know what let's go go go Prosper the Lord shall delivered into your hand woo that got the king really upset and the King said unto him how many times shall I adure you that you tell me nothing but the truth quit mocking me quit making fun of me m the head of a Nation you got people all around watching how you treat me I don't like this tell me the truth I'm a man I could take it all righta gted up his loins okay cracked his neck stretched his back he's like y this is what the Lord told me I'm getting ready for this and then he begins to preach the gospel Oh my he didn't even hold back he immediately started with the punch line I saw all Israel scattered yeah yeah he didn't even tell him not to go none of that he just that's all Israel scattered you read between the line you want to go you could go but that's all Israel scattered M didn't even hold back when God is preaching the word of God sometimes you might think it's personal to you which it could be especially from a pastor perspective I'll give you this perspective especially from a pastor perspective he may it up there he start he may have counsel counsel with the pastor and then he gets up there the next Sunday or a couple of Sundays and he start preaching on things and next thing you know he start going down a path that you know he start hitting on things and then you start back there listening and you start squirming in your chairs like I know I just talked to the pastor about that he's probably talking about me I know that's where that storm is coming from and you you can say Amen you can say hallelujah you can say praise the Lord cuz you all huffing and puffing because you like I had a counsel with that Pastor and I know this is all about me and you trying to I try to see if you could get gauge eye contact with the pastor cuz you want him to see you on you just want him to see you like cuz you don't like it but what you don't know it's not even the pastor himself because he's standing behind the P since I'm telling you this from experience he's standing behind the pulpit he's transfixed he's brought into a dimension he's entered into a channel when now he's preaching under a certain anointing and he sees the spirits that are roaming within the church and it's no longer about you but the spirit that's dealing with you is now looking to look for someone else he's not preaching about you he's preaching at that spirit because there's somebody else that could be vulnerable to that same spirit so he's preaching to the spirit to depart from this place so that way that person that become a victim like you are victim amen that's it brother praise the Lord hallelujah so whenever you're hearing the word of God preach and it starts going right into your household right into your bedroom right into your closet right into the rooms whatever is going you say Lord so be it according to Thy word am my God Amen and as if that wasn't enough sometimes God will bring a preacher from another location could be me somebody else and start preaching about the very same thing and you're looking that church you can't wait till after church to tell somebody I know he talked to that brother about me that Pastor didn't say nothing about your business it's God that's dealing with you accept that and say Amen to it quit criticizing the ministry and start accepting when God is dealing with you amen now let me tell you something I didn't't talked to brother Jack so I don't know what's been preached this is all just brother Jee under the anointing of the holy spirit so I want you to sitting there with the devil in your mind I wonder if he talk to brother Jack I didn't talk to brother Jack I talked to the Lord Jesus himself everything I'm telling you is under the anointing of God hallelujah amen sometimes you get amen sometimes you get the oh my that's all right it's still part of the gospel God Amen when you feel good like amen when you know it's hitting on oh my Lord Jesus bless me Lord help me it's still the truth nonetheless amen and he says I saw all Israel scattered he says I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills as a sheep that have not a shepherd and the Lord said these have no master can you just imagine the people watching this and just listen say that yep that's exactly what he preached last time that's exactly what he preached last time the prophets are all upset because they contradicted their preaching and meanwhile Joseph as like this is praise the Lord I knew there was something to this and meanwhile Ahab man his heart's racing like 100 miles and hour and he's looking at Micaiah he's trying to give him that eye just you better stop saying you just stop right there but micai was full force because he was anointed of the Holy Spirit and there was nothing that could hold him back hallelujah amen praise the Lord now and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat listen to this now the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat now keep in mind these are two members in the assembly one shouting and rejoicing saying that is nothing but the truth and the other one seething and upset because the word is being truth and you know what Ahab tried to do triy to steal jehoshaphat's Joy yep the devil looks at you seeing you shouting praising God in Hallelujah said what you shouting about it's like one brother told me he like a husband and wife was SK into an argument coming go coming to church I heard that that coming to church and they were arguing arguing and they was fussing and so finally the the they get to church and the husband's all praising the Lord and he's shouting and he's screaming and he's and the wife's in there looking at him just like all upset knowing that good and well they had to got into an argument right before they came to church after church the the wife goes up to the husband and says aren't you ashamed and embarrassed of yourself that you were shouting and praising God and hollering and screaming you know we got into an argument and the brother looks at his wife and says let me tell you dear I was upset with you but I wasn't upset with God have your priority straight when you come to the house of the Lord it's all about you and your maker it's about you and your creator it's about you and God yes amen Joseph had Ahab looks at Jehoshaphat says I told you he doesn't preach any good Jehoshaphat probably looked at Ahab like I don't know everything he said I can see right in the in Genesis I saw it there I saw in the book of kings and Isaiah spoke about it and so did the revelations speak about it he's like I see it in the scripture I like what he had to say verse 19 he said hear thou therefore the word of the Lord now this is one of them rare Glimpse that that we often don't read about in the scripture but it brings you into a realm where you can see what is happening behind the scenes are you with me yes sir so we will introduce prophets coming out preaching false Doctrine lying in favor of Ahab right how could it be so micaa says let me explain to you you why this is happening and listen he says Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord I Saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of Heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left he's bringing you into his vision so if you could imagine this the Lord is Seated on his throne exalted watching all these things and the host of Heaven All Surrounded him and the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that's what the Bible says yeah there was a conference now can you just imagine that Saints I want you to pay attention like this is in there for our examples yes sir they were having a conversation about Ahab all the host of the Lord good spirits bad spirits that all came and God's like well how can we persuade Ahab they're talking about Ahab God talks about you you in God's conversation you're in God's conversation that's how important you are even though Ahab hadn't done what he' done yet they're trying to persuade him because he's already made a carnal decision that that's what he's want he's going to do so and the Bible goes on to say this listen and one said on this manner and another said on that manner they're offering God suggestions and ideas on what can need we do can you just imagine that the whole horse of heaven and they have had no idea he just mind on his business and he's like yeah I'm going to go get r with gillad I'm going to do this I'm going to do that I'm going to do that and so a conference God calls a conference and so you see they're saying well you could persuade him this way you could do this way and and and I you could imagine every Spirit saying well I know ahab's weakness I know he could if you get him to do this he'll do it I know if you get the devil knows your weakness they they're talking they're like you know no no try this n that ain't going to work because we tried that last time remember he went to his knees and praise and God God mess up with us now we can't do that again because we we we God tormented us when we tried that let's try this one that's a we this I don't know you think he's going to fall for that we could try that when you're sleeping the devil's communica came to each other what are we going to do tomorrow I don't know mean today was really a bomb I mean we messed up big time I mean he got the victory over and over and over again we can't let tomorrow that he has a victory what's tomorrow Sunday oh we're in trouble why you say that well he's going to go to church we got to stop him before he go to church what we're going to do let's get him and his family to get into an argument you guys may not you you you you you you may not you may have such a blissful week loving each other everything go good the kids saying Daddy such a beautiful day and everything's just fine Saturday night rolls around everything fine Sunday morning wakes up some random things come up next thing you know you just an argument pop up and you trying and find the mind of the Lord while you come to church the devil let me tell you Saints this is not accidental the devil is constantly battling with you he's trying to take you out the game but God has called you to overcome the Ws of the devil let me tell you the way the reason why you know that in the will of God you're constantly in the battle you're constantly in the battle you're constantly in a trial you're constantly going through something you know you're in the will of God praise the Lord when you're in the battle because you know you're doing something that's [Applause] right amen amen and somebody in the host shouted out from the back say I got an idea and they all parted ways and the Bible says and there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord and everybody just watching this this is all unfolding in heaven yeah and he says I will persuade him God's watching this he's like all right well how you going to do this now because I mentioned those 400 prop may have at sometime at some point preached the truth a lot of the Gospel that's preached sometimes there's 99% truth but it's the 1% that brings destruction amen I don't mean to discuss you but bear with me don't mean to discuss you but bear with me if I had a box of cookies some of your favorites you put it in your mind whatever your favorite hazel nuts chocolate chip you name it you can't res this I'm like well my dog just kind of had a mess and I didn't have really a towel and cleaned it up and not a whole lot that got into the batter now y'all looking a certain way would you still take that [Music] cookie it's it's just a small amount would you still take that cookie cuz you're thinking about something else he didn't wash his hands talking about 1% man that 1% is as equal as 99% yeah right yeah that's how the devil works we will notd and say oh that is disgusting but the devil shoves that stuff through our thought every day if we looked at this the same way spiritually we would say devil that's enough I'm not going to take that from you I'm not going to put that in my mouth I'm not going to say Amen to that I'm not going to not agree with that the Bible says man shall live by shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God amen amen I don't know I just thought about it one time and I thought about it like if somebody offer me like as you know you know cuz we all have weak moments whether whatever sweets it is and somebody present you they say well it's just one ounce of X Y and Z and you're like oh man no no like you're you're your desire for that thing no longer exists your interest no longer exists it may look good but I know what's on the inside I know what it's made of if you could look at the Devil when he's presenting you attractive things you can say I know what that's made of it's of the devil and I don't want nothing to do with it people might look at you crazy let me tell you you have a revelation if I told you it and I didn't tell somebody else can you just imagine somebody come out you got some cookies that looks really good that would be your reaction you like oh Lord Jesus cuz you have a revelation that's the reason why Revelation is important because people are eating things of the devil and minding your own business and you're looking and you're saying that is nasty why because you have a revelation praise the Lord for a prophet that's the reason why you could act the way you can and they have the audacity to look at you and I like we're the ones crazy I know what went into the batter to make that cookie that you just ate that you're rejoicing over they say I got a weak tooth for this candy it don't matter you know what went into it that's the reason why prophecies above everything cry for Revelation because if you didn't know you would have been just as guilty as the other person that just grabbed a whole box of cookie giving it to their kids yeah you can react that's appropriate that's how you should react because you need to think about the same way when the Devil comes to you and start feeding your children things not my children if you won't eat it my children won't eat it if you won't have it my children won't have it amen praise God Amen but when you look out there in the world and they're giving their children filth they're giving their children garbage they're looking at you and having pity on you it's really you having pity on them because you have a revelation of what's in that stuff praise the Lord hallelujah and the Lord said unto that Spirit how you going to do this he says I will go forth and I will be a lying Spirit and the the mouth of All His prophets so in their defense they probably thought they were preaching the truth they were anointed but they were false anointed ones amen and they were preaching this Prosperity message to Ahab go get rth Galia this for you God's given it to you and Micaiah stood on the word of God yes sir and can you just imagine those can you just imagine those prophets M's like well there was a spirit that came and talked to God and say I'm going to be a lying spirit and amidst all those prophets and those 400 prophets listen to them being preached about can you just imagine looking at one of I think he talking about us I know is he talking about he's talking about you he's talking about us all 400 of them just listen to Micaiah preach and listen to this now therefore behold the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets and the Lord has spoken evil concerning thee and zedekiah he went from preaching the gospel of prosperity to punching him dead in his face yeah that's what the Bible said I read it zedekiah smoke M I don't think he smacked him a g I think it was a punch he went from preaching Prosperity God bless you oh he can't he can hurt a fly and he would and punched them dead in his face you could tell he didn't have a he didn't have an anchor that held him and Makai was preaching and preaching and he got punched jaw messed up probably all bloodied did micaa run no no M got to his feet got on his knees yeah he didn't stay down there cuz he was in done preaching and as weak as he was I don't think he got on by got up by himself God probably picked up his shoulders stumbled back a little bit he looked at zedekiah he told zedekiah you're going to be in the chamber hiding he was still preaching in his hurt in his pain in his bloody face he was still preaching the gospel he was not on payroll you may not like what I have to say you may not like how I dress you may not like how I talk but I have an obligation to preach to you the undeniable word of God it might pain me it might cause me Affliction but your soul is more important Hallelujah I am not here to compromise on the word of God your soul is more important [Applause] Lord and let me tell you Bea was not only preaching to Ahab but he was preaching to all of ahab's followers sir right that's the reason why he started off his sermon he says I saw Israel scattered like a sheep without a Shepherd Ahab this isn't about you it's about your nation it's about your people yes that's right he was bloody this gospel is a bloody mess don't think you goingon to be all looking good going in heaven like you haven't had any battle wounds like you haven't had any scars like you haven't been any fights let me tell you st hey we going to go in there we're going to we're going to talk about our battle School Battle Scars our battle wounds remember brother BR when was it the king you know he had all these he wanted to kind of really showcase a the the the men that were in battle that were where where their shields were all messed up and they were bloodied it proved that they were in a battle this is not a this is not intended to be an easy walk Paul says we cannot even compare the sufferings that we receive here with the glory that should be revealed over there if we could just endure for a moment Hallelujah every punch that you take is worth it every time you stumble Hallelujah but you get back up it's worth it like I say my Haitian tongue we take a hit we hit back cuz I don't know about y'all I mean I mean if we're in a fight you just not going to sit there and let the devil punch y'all in the face you got to fight back you got to take him to you got to take him to prayer and say Lord I know I had a challenge new day yesterday but I'm not going to give up I believe you called me for this I'm back on my knees amen because the devil's trying to he's trying to quench your thirst he's trying to stop you from talking to God but you got to be persistent yes Lord and M said behold Thou shalt see in that day he's talking to zedekiah when thou shalt go in the inner chamber to hide yourself bear with me Saints I'm almost done and the king of Israel said take Micaiah and carry him back to amam the governor of the city and to joash the King's son and say thus sayith the king put this fell in prison and feed him with bread of Affliction and with water of Affliction until I come and he had the audacity to say this until I come in peace oh people could man people could be so so stubborn in their ways tempting God defying the word of God until I come back in peace he just told you you're not going to come back much less come back in peace oh I see what you talking about come back in pieces I got it okay I don't know if that was a mispelling but maybe that's what he meant but he sure ain't going to come back because you're not going to make a lie out of God when God speaks to you can make a lie of God people might look at you and look at you differently and say things and do things as long as you know you have a strong conviction of God God will not make you a liar God's reputation is on the line your reputation is the line God will not make you a liar God will prove to the world that his word is true yes sir amen that's the reason why when you are in your sin when you were in your sickness when you were running with the wrong crowd had a foul mouth God looked at you and said I made the right decision about you and that was even before you started serving God and now that you're sitting here you're not going to prove God wrong praise God Amen am Hallelujah Andy didn't let that go no when aab says you know when I come back in peace I'll deal with him gu say listen here if thou return if you come back in peace like he had the same he came right back as as if the Lord just anointed him just shook him say if you come back if you come back the Lord has not spoken by me and he said Haren our people every one of you this is not just for Ahab this is for you for you for you this gospel is not just for brother Jean it's not just for the ministers it's not for the deacon it's for everyone five more minutes is that okay five more minutes I'm racing and uh so they Carri M away you know he's holding his mouth he's like well you know what I I preach the truth I don't care I preach the truth you got to be bold when you stand on God Dr Bo I preach the truth it's nothing but the truth that's the last voice they wanted he wanted them to hear was the Cry of Prophet Hallelujah sometimes as ministers we don't know if the word reaches the people we just lay the word we put the seed there God God and uh the king of Israel say yeah so jeos I know that was kind of a scene totally unexpected and uh so we still going to go to Rond gillad Joseph is like I I don't know man like I mean you heard what he said I mean God s the L Spirit to talk to 400 prophets and you're going to die and you ain't worried about that right you're not worried like cuz he ain't say nothing about me like that that that was definitely for you like cuz I mean that would be the conversation I'll be having with him I mean I feel like I might be okay but and so the key's like well you know what you might have a point there okay so here's what we're going to do I'm going to disguise myself it's in the Bible he's like you bring up a good point so um I'm going to disguise myself something was there something was there he left church service he probably was like what what if he what if he serious this time cuz yeah I'm going to disguise myself they ain't going to see me in battle I ain't going to die today I told him I'm going to come back in peace and he told Jose he's like look this was really about me you don't need to disguise yourself you can just dress in your robe you know that's the thing with people you can't hide from God no no no no no the prophecy's been spoken you can sit in the backseat you can't hide from God all right you could be in the auditorium 10,000 people God knows you he's like he'll bypass people and come directly to you I see you I see you God sees you you can't hide from God two people in the garden of Heen they they hiding from God two people in the garden of out of the entire world two people and they hid themselves it's like me when I was to play with my kids at when they were two they play hideand-seek right it was so cute and God looks at you when you trying to hide side look at that that's so cute he sees you where you're at you can't hide from God the Bible says even though I make my bed in hell I still see you you cannot go too far that God can't reach you that's the reason why you're sitting here this morning you are hiding from God and he says I see you come here God sees you wherever you're at you're open you're you're an open book to God and thank God that he could see me cuz I was hiding like this he says that's so cute and I thought I was good too like God can never see me he sees you that's it brother he sees you when others don't see you God sees you when others you God sees you when others say oh she's quiet God hears you God sees you no matter where your at Saint people may forget you but God will never forget you the Bible says I'll never leave you nor Forget [Applause] You Lord I praise God thank and the king of Syria now listen to this the king of Syria Comm amended 32 captains that had rued over his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only the king of Israel that's a big deal yes sir as if they say it wasn't sufficient of that the foot soldiers go did the bidding he picked he handpicked 32 of his best Elite captains these were the top Warriors within his uh within his military the top brass 32 captains and not only that these were the ones that rode chariots that mean they operate with speed and efficiency yes sir and they were identified to Target no one else no one else I don't care if they're popular I don't care if they're great I don't care if they're small don't Target no one else but Target that one person oh my [Music] we talking about Ahab but I'm saying Saints the devil treats you that way he has some of his best Elite Fighters oh my chasing you down yes that's why it's so hard in this battle that's why your that's why the Bible says he is my strength when I am weak because there are moments where I say Lord I could stand here but there are moments where I need you here because the devil knows your weak spot in he punches you there he kind of goes back to it and he makes you feel like you can't overcome he makes you feel like you're not anything he makes you feel like you're not a Christian that you're not a son of God that's the role of the devil when you get those thoughts shun those thoughts from your mind amen now Israel the king of Israel was the target yeah right and it came to pass when the captains of the Chariots saw Jehoshaphat I'm done Saints I'm done when they saw Jehoshaphat Saints let me tell you something be careful who you keep company with thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord be careful who you keep company with right be careful who are your friends am amen amen don't make it difficult for the devil to not know who the target [Applause] is the Devils starting chasing Jehoshaphat right because he dressed just like Israel like Ahab there were buddies they kept the same company so those Devils started chasing Jehoshaphat and let me tell you Ahab was nowhere to be found Jehoshaphat started to run yeah he cried and it was not a Battle Cry he cried it was not a battle cry when you got 32 captains on chariots chasing after you you would cry too Ahab I know Ahab must have seen him you let me tell you you got to know who your friends are you got to know where you stand with God because your friends can be the one in the distance looking because they know they're the target yes yes yes and they see how this thing unfold why they they come help you they see what's going to happen to you I've been there before I've had some friends I thought they had my back oh they meant it way back right way way back when right here me and my boys and they're way over there I realize it's me by myself true be careful who you be careful who you have company with be careful who you associate yourself with that's why at work I don't have friends I'm not getting on your besties I'm not if you got that I just you work out your own salvation with friend I just don't got that I don't have that many friends amen amen come on I've had too many experiences I've matured along the way you've we've been through some stuff I've know I've come to a point where I just trust God it's me and my family against the devil and God's with me amen Joseph I cried can you just imagine what what went through his mind the moment he saw 32 captains chasing after him he's like this was a wrong idea he probably wish he was home right now but he's in the thick of battle with King Ahab chasing after ramth Gillan after he heard a sermon that was preached yes sir you hearing the sermon preach the devil's not in this building right now but he's right outside he just he's like service is a little long today man they should have been out of church by now should have been out of church by now he's just right at the door waiting for you cuz he he's waiting for you cuz you're right you're in the presence of God you're in the presence of the Angels he can't dare come in here so he's waiting for church to let out my God just waiting for church to let out looking to himself it's like it's 12:28 preacher already lied he said he wouldn't be that long he's taking all the time of the world the devil's waiting but that's the reason why you got to be so guarded with the word of God that joy that you receive the moment you walk out the door punch the devil in the face and said I'm taking this Victory to my house I'm taking this this Victory to my job I'm taking this Victory to my home to my family praise the Lord am amen and the Bible says so when Ahab saw Jehoshaphat got away and the Kings the captains realized wait minute this ain't Israel they're like we're chasing the wrong person the devil don't like to spend their energy on what's not the target it it Jehosaphat was not the target when Jehosaphat cried a he's like no that's not him that sound like so they spun their chariots around they went looking for Ahab and Ahab probably was breathe a side of a relief he's like praise the Lord he probably left he's like you know what I'm going to go home they can finish this battle by themselves and Ahab was hiding and the Bible says a certain man God knows where you're hiding the Bible says a certain man Drew out a bow from a certain Venture this is in the midst of all this battle chaos ensuing people fighting everywhere everybody looking for Ahab he's disguising himself and the Bible says a certain man drew a boat out of venture just do it just cuz I'm going to help somebody let this Arrow fly my God that Arrow was flying that Arrow was looking for its distance let me tell you people must have been in the battle raging when that Arrow was coming out people moved out the way not realizing that they were moving out the way because the arrow had a purpose God was looking for it Target that Arrow was coming in and people's ounding him moving out the way and ahab's looking around cuz he's looking for somebody not something he's looking for somebody he's like I'm looking for the third two kings and not realizing and an arrow hits him unexpected God knows how to catch you unexpectedly you can't hide from God when he has a Target on you he's going to find you no matter where you're at it may not be a preacher that comes to get you it may not be a deacon that comes to get you but something is coming to get you amen that Arrow hits the side of Ahab unexpectedly the word of God comes to fulfillment he sat there bruised he was not expecting that he was not expecting that as we stand to our feet the Bible says and the battle increased that day and the King stayed up in his Chariot against the syrians and he died at evening he tried to hold on he tried to hold on he died at evening going back to naboth there was a prophecy that was over him that God had pronounced but because he had asked for forgiveness and repented of his ways the Lord held back but because of his ways the Lord went back to that prophecy and it was fulfilled here so the king died and was brought to Samaria and they buried the king in Samaria and one washed the Chariots in pool of Samaria and the dogs licked up his blood and they wash his armor according unto the word of the Lord which he spake Saints I Shar this with you these are trying times sir if there's ever a moment that we need to display who we are this is the critical hour things are unfolding in many many many ways whether we're talking about politics Society environmental yeah things are happening the moments are becoming more and more obvious where there's going to be a distinction a differentiation between you and the world where some of the things that the world is introducing it's just going back to the my example is just it's gut-wrenching they're eating it up but thank God for a revelation that we have where we can say there's death in that pot yeah amen we have a revelation yes sir this gospel is nothing but the truth and if we hear for another 10 years it's still the truth be like the Hebrew boys they were so convicted they say God will bring us Deliverance out of the fiery furnace and they had the boldness to look at the king he says even if the God doesn't we still will not bow down to your image amen even if the Lord sh ter I know the world is wrong and God is right we won't bow down to the image of the Beast you love the Lord amen hold your ground amen hold your ground hold on to your inheritance it might be difficult along the way but you stand on that word of God stand on the Promises of God let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father
