appreciate them a man and certainly did they have everybody in the house the Lord want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas a man a very Merry Christmas and before I get into the word just something I just want to share real quick but before we do that I want to just I always always have to say I appreciate a man Pastor Jamison a man for being here [Applause] and I always have to give credit because it was that his church he was pastoring they meant a timers that his church that I walked in one night to see this movie and said they had burning hail the burning hell was gonna be showing at this church and everybody was you know it's trying to encourage everybody to go so we were attending another church at the time but we heard about this movie and we want to go see the movie at the church a man and he played that move in my god the way they depicted people being in Hell at a young age it really did something and I say I whatever I do I don't want to go to hell whatever I do I don't want to go if it's gonna be like that and imagine that in the movie they only they only actually are given their imagination as to what hell would be like you can't even imagine yeah your imaginations don't even go far far enough to understand what hell is like and also your imagination don't go far enough to even understand what heaven is like all right a manga God got so much in store amen for for us if we live right if you live right I want somebody a man you I got turned down just a little business but it's if you live right you can make it and when we talk about living right let's not just talk about being good anybody could be good amen but we're talking about following the Word of God amen and since this God's heaven a man then we're gonna have to come his way in order to get entrance all right but on that night he he played that video and and I I watched it and really impacted my life and that night I give him my heart to the Lord now I didn't I didn't maintain my walk with Lord after after I gave my heart that night the life has a way of just kind of tripping you up and causing you to go into you know I mean you thought you were saved right and you know it might it might have been something that happened on your flesh right but uh but the real commitment to keep going with the Lord throughout whatever your trials and tribulations are in life

spirit of true Tabernacle family thank you for all of your thoughts prayers and many acts of kindness you helped make this a celebration of my mother's life instead of mourning her death may the Lord continue to bless you abundantly from the family of mrs. Tommy s Baker and this is coming from her door to the theory of Baker's you just want to thank the Church of the prayers of just everything you did as a service that we went to a few weeks ago when we will be left Sarasota but this was a lady Lord blessed in a sea 93 years here on earth and we had an opportunity just to kind of sit with her in her home and and just go through Scripture and sing songs with her you know during her life journey and she was that wasn't able to get out and go to church so me and my daughters and my wife and we would go to her house take a little keyboard we sing and we would just have service there in the church in her house with her and it was just a real blessing amen to be able to do that and the Lord called her home here at 93 years old and we had an opportunity to go and just be just offer prayer for the family there on that day of her home horn service and and the door to just want to send her send a thank-you card just to tell the church thinks a man for all of the support over the years so Amen we thank God for that praise the Lord Amen well I won't I'm gonna try not to take too much of your time because I know how y'all is but nonetheless become the church to hear the word of God a man in 1/3 certainly thank God for everything that happened I heard it's either one or two specials I can't I'm not really sure but I know I heard something and and I'm grateful for that the worship was certainly a blessing and but now we want to try to take our attention to the Word of God if you would just stand with me we'll read a scripture and I'll just read this and then I'll let you will have a word of Prayer and I'll let you be seated a man here at Luke chapter 1 a man verse 37 we read this so last week and man and I'll read it again on to date Luke 1 and verse 37 says for with God nothing shall be impossible a man for with God nothing shall be impossible let's just pray over what we've just read father we thank you for the ability to read scripture but God help us to really capture what is is really being sane and what's spoken to us so take control over this portion of service we thank you for your spirit that has led us here already and we've just enjoyed the time of worship but now God let us enjoy the time of listening to the words of Jesus then we pray amen god bless you praise the Lord so just again we were using our subject of nothing shall be impossible a man we started down this journey on last week and and I want to just kind of keep going amen and this in this endless thought here you know it is it's Christmas and you know there'll be many programs that have put on at various churches you know many that'll happen today and all through you know all the way up into a Christmas Eve service and and many are reflecting a man on what happened here some 2,000 years ago when our Lord and Savior was was born now now again we we do understand we do understand clearly that Jesus was not born on December 25th we do know that a man because being the Lamb of God lambs are not born during the wintertime lambs are born during the springtime right so we know that he would have been born in the spring he was died in spring and born in the spring but nonetheless a man have Christmas it's here to stay it's not going anywhere so a man I'm just one that I'm very happy to see because I love my lord so much I'm so happy that everybody is forced to think about him during this season a man and and and when we put up Jesus is the reason for the seed season you can't argue that you can't fight that right you you not you're not celebrating Christmas because of Buddha you're not you not celebrating Christmas because of you know somebody else right you a man that you're celebrating Christmas because it was the birth of the Lord Jesus amen so so in nonetheless you are forced to at least think about them right you're forced at least talk about them just a little bit and with the with with society being the way it is today we're almost limited as to when we can mention the name Jesus a man I mean people don't want you to say that in public anymore but but but and even even you know if you notice I try to put people on the spot a man when I when I'm out shopping and everything and and I sigh they say Happy Holidays I say Merry Christmas I put them on the spot right Merry Christmas it said loud and say it proud right I don't want to put merry xmas I'm crossing Christ out right but I want to keep Christ in the center this Merry Christmas we're celebrating with the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ right and so so it's a very a menace to me it's just a time where everybody has has to reflect on the but you know when I when I think about it in order for crisp Christmas to occur and I just my thoughts were just kind of centered around this this season in order for Christmas to occur it took a miracle Christmas would not have happened a man had not a virgin conceived right it took an absolute miracle it meant to celebrate his birthday it took a miracle I was reading you know uh about a few things and and even married her mother's name was and right she was the daughter and and from my understanding from some of the history Mary's father was already passed before she was born hallelujah and not only that amen her mother was so convinced that she was going to have a son she was preparing for a boy Oh glory and and a mother was was a little older in age by the time she conceived Mary the mother mary's mother had to experience a miracle just to have Mary oh my god right mary's mother had to have a miracle in her body in order to conceive and produce Mary then that just goes to show me something that if God has orchestrated if God has predestinated but some things that happen and look God went looking for a man if he if he chose Mary in his mind he was not looking for Mary Ann come on somebody hey man he was not looking for Stephanie God said Mary in God's mind it was gonna be Mary when he gave the promise that a virgin shall conceive and Isaiah 7:14 and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel they did this is this is important because first of all it got to be a virgin amen and then secondly if a virgin conceived and had a daughter that would have been the word but had to be a virgin that will conceive and have a son Oh hallelujah so so here mary's mother has gone through all these things she can't even have children and finally God blesses her and gives her child she thought was going to be a bore but God gave a girl and in that girl that God gave me that came through a miracle it was the same girl that God was going to use to bring forth Christ Oh what I mean you just think about all the miracles that were happening just for us to have Christmas I think it's something that we would like last week I say Karl timeout right Amen before you get so involved in all the shopping before you get so involved and all and all the opening of the presses and what you got do you realize what just occurred here it took a miracle for you to celebrate this hallelujah right so you know we were we've been in this this this disdain and let's just read the story a man from Luke chapter 1 let's just read it out and read the whole thing last week but let's let's read the story amen and we're not even a man we haven't even got to the part where you know where where he was actually born we just talked about the conception part you you realize the conception could not have happened unless Mary believe the impossible I mean and what I mean by that and the word impossible means incapable of occurring in other words cannot be done when you say something's impossible that means this cannot be done and when when I think about you know Mary situation if there was ever anything that could not be done it's impossible for a virgin to conceive now that's something that ain't gonna happen that I'm sorry we know how children are born it is impossible for a virgin to conceive and have a baby impossible butBut but when asked as marriage having this conversation with the angel my god she said how can these things be right the angel respond back say the Holy Spirit girl over shouting you and with the Holy Spirit over said that's what's gonna make this thing happen so so what what occurred is that God had to kind of get through all the thoughts go ahead to take his word and make that make it weenus way through all the thoughts and then settle down into a spirit where she could just say be it unto me according to thy word and when that occurred when that occur Mary got pregnant hallelujah it's just powerful to me big yes cuz I want to go a little further with this today because uh-uh uh-uh I'm getting way ahead of myself we know that with with with God nothing is impossible we know that however we also need to know that with you nothing is impossible and what we're trying to do is work through the your mind and and all your your your your your memories and your reasoning in your Amen and and everything that the devil is using you they're using against you to stop you from believing that with you nothing is impossible well we got the part with God but with you all right let's read let's read this let's get all this amen out from Luke 1 and in the sixth month the angel gamer's 26 is where I'm at in a sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God it's a city of Galilee named Nazareth verse 27 to a virgin a spouse she was she was to be married a man to man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the virgin Virgin's name was Mary the Virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Dow that are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and just imagine her talking to this angel right and when she saw him the angel him amen when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and casting her mind what naina of salutation this should be let's get it amen and the angel said unto her fear not and I not just fear not but when he called her name it brought a peace and when God is able to call your name fear not fear not near my eye fear not just the Laura you're not just a Mary right fear not brother Josue when he calls your name like that it just kind of brings a piece that that settles you hallelujah right since the search says and the angel senator fear not Mary for thou hast found favour with God now I want you to understand Mary at this time that what history says she was only about 16 17 or 18 years old now that's important to me a man being a virgin at this age and in and preparing to get married amen but it's important to me because God sometimes is able to speak certain things to the young people right where where their minds are not as messed up or cannot use the word polluted Amen that it sometimes it's very easy for younger people to say things like be it unto me according to thy word they not working through a lot of nonsense Oh hallelujah right there if I could put it this way their mind is still virgin and when you're walking with God when you're when you're dealing with God right when you're at when you're having relationship with God your mind has to be virgin to the things of God you cannot mix doubt with the word of God it has to be pure if God promises something in his word all you have to respond with this with a Amen you only have two acts how can this be no God said it hey man let's go on let's read this verse 30 and the angel said to her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and the hold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus which meant yea yahweh is salvation right he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of his father David right and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end listen it says then said Marian's an angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man right and they ain't you answer to set in earth the Holy Ghost I told you all on Friday night this is new language they had never heard anything about the holy ghost but here you know here but the Angels uses the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of these they shall be called the Son of God now look at this and behold Ock and I love the way that the angel does this because it's still probably in Maris mind you got to read between the lines of their mind like I ain't never heard of the Holy Ghost how's the Holy Ghost got overshadow me when I'm not too experienced imma what's gonna happen here I mean what is what is this all about so so while she's going through that in her mind the angel counting stops it gives her testimony hallelujah because you know a testimony can actually settle you like cannot can I put it this way a testimony can make you believe for the impossible a testimony has a way of igniting your face and they say if God can do it for them and God has no respect of persons then I know the same God is gonna do it for me testimonies do that hallelujah that's why I don't ever let the devil take your testimony don't let the devil tell you well ain't nobody else talking so you need to stop talking no don't you don't know who need to hear what you need to say don't let the devil take your testimony the devil to give you the testimony so don't let the devil take the testimony hallelujah look at the testimony he says him behold my cousin Elizabeth now the angel knows this behold our cousin Elizabeth she had also conceived a son in her old age that marason I know she never had no children you mean to tell me Elizabeth is pregnant now now see you got you got a there's a reason for this God has connected to impossible situations here's the thing when Mary hears that Elizabeth can have a baby and I have to use it in today's terms oh this is you not know you you said Elizabeth you do you know I oh she you say she's pregnant ain't you saying behold our custom Elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her listen who was called barren she was called barren the CEO you're not wearing that name no more see I mean you can call me bear when I ain't got no children but when I bring forth a child that title is dismissed hallelujah amen I don't know what the devil been trying to call you but when God delivers you that title has been dismissed maybe the devil tried to call you broke but we've got put money in your pocket that title is dismissed leave the devil trying to call you a cancer patient but when God brings healing to your body their title is dismissed [Applause] hallelujah somebody no no that's what you used to call me but God has done something impossible can't be done we talk we talk about God and when you when you're using the word God you cannot use the word Kate you can't do it I told there's only one thing that God cannot do God came live and you know when Mary got pregnant Mary was the fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14 and God said and I've said throughout this prophecy the Lord himself shall give you a sign to hold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel when God spoke that some virgin somewhere had to receive that because God could not lie I'm going on in this story I'm gonna try to go a little further here today if I can look at this verse verse 36 again and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren and loves what the angel says for with God for with God Mary Mary I want you to get this mayor we're not through you ain't got nothing to do with this Mary that's why we're not worshiping Mary Mary was just a barroom see how to borrow room and he had to borrow two there's all just bone and where he using you he just borrowing you he can do this all by himself but once he use it he's just borrowing you god but he borrow a womb to be born in and there was a purpose for that the reason that he had to have a womb to come through is because in order to redeem fallen man oh my god this is what we're seeing this whole story of Christmas a man was God being made flesh because you know when Adam sinned in the Garden of Eden God came down now remember God can't go against his word hallelujah God can't go guesswork when God told Adam the day you either out the day you die that's what that's when they're saying it as soon as they partook of that tree amen I'm trying to be good if I could just go look further I'm gonna try to go too far but everybody in here know ain't no way Eve ate an apple and got pregnant come on now you tell me a story like that when I go to church and I hear a story like that you are insulting my intelligence it's impossible now that's what that's something impossible ain't no way somebody ate a fruit in the beginning whether it's an apple or an apricot or whatever you want to call it banana ain't no way to eat that and got pregnant because if they did then they should be still doing it now and we know it has only been two forms of pregnancy in the Bible - two forms one of them is what Mary's going through the Holy Spirit overshadowing her and she bring forth the son only child ever born like that through pregnancy because Adam won I mean well actually what I said this is that's deep Kanaka I can say it this way in God's mind he was pregnant with Adam before Adam came forth God had the thought in his mind who Adam was gonna be but God then carried in his in a physical wound God just made him right and then he took a rib out of even I mean out of Adam and me it made Eve from that but now the only other way people get pregnant is the same way you come here how you got here through a daddy and a mama come on somebody me man so I'm gonna tell you that Cain got here through a daddy and a mama Seth Abel Abel got here through a daddy and a mama Seth got here through a daddy and a mama the only mystery here is we need to know who was Kings daddy because the Bible declares that came was of that wicked one Oh some of y'all know your Bible in here well we know Adam one wicked because Adam was a son of God and even in his fallenness state he was still [Applause] so we we need to we need to find out who Keynes daddy is can I go back to my subject matter if you still got questions keep coming to church I will answer them for you through the preaching of the word amen so here in verse 37 says for with God nothing shall be impossible we talk about God we talk about God with God I mean a virgin can actually have a baby through God now now now now we're not looking for somebody else to jump up you know that's a virgin and say well you know what I'm pregnant now what would be the purpose what scripts are you fulfilling that's not what we're looking for there was only we only needed one virgin to bring forth Christ and that's already happening amen but but I want you to understand when you think about Christmas when you think about what happened it took a miracle and-and-and-and and at Christmas can I tell you something you might be facing something right now in your life and you stop trying to figure out how in the world I'm gonna get through this I mean I don't I don't know I don't know I I can't see your way out you might be you might be saying that to yourself right now whether it's a financial thing with us a physical thing whether you know what no matter what it is you might be saying if this is just impossible I want to tell you according to the Bible with God that's there now that's a key key statement sit with God because if you try to do this without God it is impossible but with God nothing that can I put the jacked up version nothing absolutely nothing shall be impossible oh my god I love that I don't care what you facing it's not it's not impossible Amen when you when you talk about working with God ain't nothing impossible and nothing he can heal the sickest of the sick not not only can heal the secrets I said even if they die if they God he can raise them I say with God nothing is impossible Jesus let's go on and Mary said after she heard all this from the angel of Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her so once it reached through a man heard it settled in her mind and finally you know she's accepted us in the womb of her spirit now this promise can go a man into a thing and let's see what happens here verse 39 and Mary arose Mountain this is what when a thing settles then you get the revelation of what God has done and what is gearing to do for you Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste look at that into the city of Judah and entered into the house of Zechariah and saluted Elizabeth right so here married knew exactly where to go and so she's going to talk to you Lizabeth her cousin and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary the babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost oh wait a minute we got now Mary's being overshadowed with the Holy Ghost of nine Lizabeth being filled with the Holy Ghost just by hearing from Mary look at this and she spake out with a loud voice oh my god my god that's why they don't come to church with just sophomores come to church were still out but if God done done something for you you ought to give him your loud voice hallelujah glory to God it says and she speak out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and and whence is this whence is this to me that the mother my lord should come to me for slow for lower suitors divorce of my salutation sound in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for Jordan you had to be able to read between the the lines on that one right because the salutation was probably Mary telling Elizabeth I heard you was pregnant I didn't even but before this you got to read a few verses point Elizabeth wasn't hiding she was in hiding nobody nobody would have known this her husband knew it all right and as they say but but but Elizabeth I mean she was in highness Oh Mary Mary sir now I heard you was pregnant not married a minute Mary well my marriage what you mean you heard I was pregnant and I heard in your old age that you was about to have a child and now now now now you stay with me here you stay with me because Elizabeth this thing in herself I am pregnant but this baby ain't moved I'm pregnant you're right about that but I'm having some problems my pregnancy and I can't tell nobody about it because you know I don't have so many problems over the years I can I just talk to y'all this way I don't have so many problems with so many pregnancies and maybe maybe Elizabeth I've lost this baby and lost that baby maybe she's thinking to herself again I'm about to lose another one hallelujah somebody so I can't say nothing I don't know what to do but I am I am pregnant but but I don't want to get too big too minute too many people excited but Mary I mean mayor say I heard that you was pregnant that you were expecting Mary how did you hear about an angel came to me and he told me that you is expected and it is like not now for angel Tori that did everything gonna be all right but anything got strange to say an angel tomia Elizabeth I need to tell you some good news cuz you know sometimes women a man can I just talk to you today women love to be pregnant together somebody say man they like to experience things together they like to talk over these things together hallelujah somebody amen but but but but they're saying you know I'm also expect to say you expected you mean you and Joseph God Mary said no we're not married Oh Elizabeth's saying that it's gonna be real bad Mary do not beaut you're not man you're gonna lose Joseph if you if you're telling me you're pregnant what man did this hallelujah somebody Larry say ain't no man do it no man could do nothin like this but I can talk in here I can hear Mary tell Elizabeth with God no one man can do this but but I want to tell you something little quiz guys all things I possible know what you mean by that I mean I know mine oh I know what my situation but what you may say say the angel told me that the Holy Spirit would always shadow me and I was gonna bear a son you don't have a son okay and you know what he gave me his name he lives me you've already got the name yes the name is gonna be Jesus and as soon as she said the name Jesus [Applause] oh my god what'd you say his name is again Jesus and this is why we read this in the scripture this why we read this in the scripture oh my god my god I love God's words amen verse 43 and which Winston is this to me that the mother my lord should come to me below as soon as divorce and our salutation sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy remember she was there six months and John had not moved in six months but as soon as John [Applause] there's a lot I need to say right there y'all y'all making me say light in your household daddy you got to make sure you taking care of mama when she pregnant because the child can hear the child can hear what's going on in the room the child can hear the arguments that the child can hear the discussions the child can not only hear but the child can feel whether you love mama don't love and sometimes the child might Amen you might be saying things a certain way in the children start acting a certain way even in Mama's room they act in a certain way because they hear how things are happening in the home come on somebody that's why you got to be careful how you handle things in the home the children can hear as soon as I heard your salutation the babe leaped this is why I wasn't telling anybody and now you say with God nothing's impossible I mean old as I am I'm about ever baby Mary why don't we set you up a baby shower and then Mary might might say Elizabeth won't we set you up a baby shower and everybody get invited to these baby showers and wonder what in the world is going on but but but but because they both are experiencing the impossible they can share and feed off each other's testimony I'm beating on what you say and what you experiencing and you don't think of what I'm saying what I'm experiencing oh my god I can just imagine disconnected and here Elizabeth say yeah he'll eat that even he been Steven Steve do you want to move anyone doing nothing but as soon as you said cheese something happened to this baby on the inside of it verse 45 says in verse 44 lo as soon as the voice without salutation sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and verse 45 says this not this is for you I'm trying to work this thing through the womb your spirit and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord can I just tell you you you ought to get ready for this you getting ready to go into a new season and what brother brother Jared took was it was it was a season amen to prosper a man and and and with you entrance a new season there shall be a performance of those things that were told you by the Lord and I'm telling you right now I want to make it so clear nothing nothing absolutely nothing shall be impossible nothing and and and you know we've seen some some some things that we we've been up against when you just sit back and just reflect on Christmas just just stop and think about this nothing church if a virgin can have a baby virgin no serious anything like this happened I was just reading a few things you know I'm I'm not gonna get to where I want to go over that's fine I wanted you all to just kind of catch a couple statements here this is a sermon Jehovah of miracles Jehovah of miracles let me just catch a couple things and then I'll bring it home I'm gonna start at paragraph e28 Jehovah miracles just let me read this and and will will will depart this is not angel Gabriel six months later had had visit married and told her that her cousin was going to have a baby also so Mary knew that would be a miracle of that old woman well stricken an age having a baby but she said to the angel I said and I love that God had to use Elizabeth in order to be able to help Mary believe cuz had she not believed this would have never happened Amen God will not God will not limb for this with God as a gentleman he has to be invited in he won't force himself on nobody so God will not go he worked up himself on Mary that would be considered great so God wasn't gone raped marry spiritually because this was not a physical act this was his whole spiritual act and God will not rape you spiritually you have to heal yourself together Mary knew that that would be a miracle of that old woman well stricken an age having a baby but she said to the angel how shall it be with me seeing that that I do not know a man and ask and you shall receive he said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you the holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the son of God that's how it's gonna happen Mary never talked back to the angel she never discussed it in any way the only thing she said was behold the hands may the Lord be it unto me according to thy word did you think even the priest Zacharias had questioned him being an old man at her ode to his wife Elizabeth sakurai-san Elizabeth say how this would be done and a priest who should know the word and know what God did but this virgin was just a child and she had no husband she had to believe the Impossibles something that had never happened before me but she never argued she never questioned anymore his word was enough for her oh my god and and I see there's another state me say he said to Mary the word was sufficient for her and what I want to ask you are you sufficiently impressed with the word in your mix if you are sufficiently impressed with the word in your mix then you know it's also not impossible cleaning the fulfill for you nothing's impossible for you it's the word of your missus bringing you back to that alright alright listen listen listen it says oh if this church could just get like that the word settles it if God said so that's all we need to know how is it going to be I can't tell you but if God said so it's gonna be that way because God's that so oh that's what I want the church to know if there's anything I want you to stink faith in is in what God said it has to be true look at this did you notice she had to believe the Impossibles she could not go back like Zachariah could he could have went back to Sarah and Sarah I was almost a hundred years hundred when when she had the baby Hannah at the temple she was an old woman too and they had plenty examples of that where they had husbands but Mary had to believe something that never had happened you got thousands of examples divine healing looking at people been healed with cancer blindness dumbness deafness all kinds of sicknesses and diseases we've got plenty of that to look at as an example but this little girl didn't have nothing but just his word and that was the fishing his word was good enough for her and I want you to notice she didn't wait till she was positive it was going to happen she started testifying about it right away she didn't wait to feel life she didn't wait till she felt life so she so she could be positive she was going to have the baby just as soon as she heard his word she took him at his word and she started testifying and praising God for the baby before she felt anything leave you with this one give us mo Mary's give us more Mary's Lord and at Christmas give us mo Mary's give us mo Mary's around here that can take God at His Word and praise Him whether you feel anything or not now you know you got you gotta praise them when you feel good you can praise them when you fit back in actually that's a better priest oh come on somebody you can praise them when you ain't got nothing that's a better priest than when you got something because that's a priest of sacrifice to give us more mary's around here that can take God at His Word and praise them whether you feel anything or not take him at his word God's trying to find somebody who would take his word I don't care how you feel someone say well I don't feel any better I went to the meat and I was grateful that don't have nothing to do do with it God said so and that settles it a man somebody who would take his word that's what pleases him believe his word that's what pleases God that's the only way you would ever find favor with him see remember the scripture that that said blessed art thou marry thou has found favor with God if you want to find favor with God then he says that that's what pleased God that's the only way you'll ever find favor with him his believers weren't and say God knew God knew that this marry a man even even the Prophet told us how she went to church that day and maybe the priest was already reading scriptures you know in church today maybe reading Isaiah 7:14 and maybe even reading Isaiah 9:6 for unto us a child is born to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace maybe she heard those things written in church that then she said mine's just something about the word that she was talking with Joseph she just discussed no scriptures and and say why she was talking about it that's why the angel came upon it hallelujah amen God give us some more Mary's that just when you hear God give you a word what was his word nothing shall be impossible that's God's word to you and if you just hear that and apply it to your situation at like Mary start testifying find somebody that has already been done for and start talking to them don't talk nobody never happened to them the phone they can't encourage you they never seen God make away but you go find somebody that this one happened to you befo tell me what happened tell me a little bit about the process and as they share with you it annoys your thing and you know what you begin to do believe God for the impossible can I tell you something if you're gonna use the word impossible you have to include the word tell your neighbor if you're gonna use the word impossible you have to include the word possible do this cross they cross and Christ out of Christmas watch across the I am offer possible if you're gonna use the word impossible you have to include the word possible I'm announcing it again I said it before but I must say it again nothing absolutely nothing shall be impossible with God musicians y'all can come in and let me just read one scripture for ya I didn't get a chance to hit this maybe the Lord will let me do it at a different time but I'll just read this Matthew 17 sees everything and in Jesus life was a miracle his birth was the miracle his death was a miracle he died and rose again that was a miracle throughout his life and just so many miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle just full of miracles but it wasn't just his it wasn't his purpose just to come and just kind of demonstrate and show all of his miracles he was trying to show us as men and as women of God what we were restored back to what Adam and Eve lost in the beginning Jesus came to give it all back to us and this is what he said even while he was here on earth if they had a little problem with the disciples let's read this a man in Matthew 17 verse 14 I'll read this now I'll close it out I won't be able to go too deep in it but it says and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sore vexed for all times he falleth into the fire and oft into the water and I and I brought him to that disciples and they could not cure him amen so did these people they knew they had a problem and they need to get to a particular place to get that problem solved I want this church to be problem solvers oh gotta be able to bring there there's there situations here and have them dealt with and we're we're equipped to know that yeah you don't have to be a Christian to get a miracle but if you want to keep your miracle you need to become a Christian hey man listen he says and I brought him to the other cycles they could not cure him then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long should I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to me Jesus when running from nothing amen and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came two disciples to Jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out I notice they did that privately hallelujah even want to embarrass him they did that they asked a question properly why could we not cast him out and Jesus said unto them so there's not for everybody but y'all included in the devil jesus said of them because of your unbelief that's why we got to get this thing through the womb of your spirit amen because of your unbelief for verily I sent you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed and y'all got mustard seed with y'all Bible if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove there it is Jesus is teaching us nothing shall be impossible unto you we know nothing is impossible into God but now we need to take it up another notch nothing is impossible unto you he said howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting and in fact it just get one other thing I mean just one thing to you Christmas oh my god y'all don't deal pulling all this side of me I got one more cool deity of Jesus Christ this give me that yeah imma imma read this Oh Lord Jesus the YouTube Jesus Christ notice this brother sister the deities in you a little while and the world seeth me no more that's what Jesus said yet ye shall see for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but we but Christ in you the hope of glory of the hope of life hallelujah the Creator God Himself dwelling and the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we'll see him as he is for we be made like him no room for him right so what we're trying to make room for him in the in the manger of our hearts let him work through our all of our intellect and all these other things I mean man I never heard it like that before let them work through all that all about doubt all of our you know just negative everything just let God get through all of that and we get to the place that Mary can give us some more marriage they can just stop tie them out be it unto me according to your word God that's what I want that's what I meet amen amen let's pray or this this Christmas season is upon us and yes we have understanding and revelation that you did not come from December 25th that's that's a pagan tradition that was introduced a number of years ago when God is here to stay no way that will get people away from it but what I'm grateful for O God is that we get an opportunity to talk about you the world has put you out they have excluded you in so many things we can't talk about you in the workplace certain places that we go we can't mention the name Jesus God here amen at this time everybody gets an opportunity to say something and oh god help us Lord to just be able to share the light of Christmas and what it's all about a virgin actually conceived and bore child it took a miracle for Christmas to occur it was nothing short of a miracle and God if we look at that we look at it father Lord we can take faith and take courage and have our faith anoint it to believe for the impossible things that Satan told us it'll never happen that can't happen that that I mean you can't have that job you can't do this you can't do no no no we don't have to listen to any of that but with God there's nothing impossible and now that we know that you're also dueling on the inside of us Lord there's nothing impossible that's either that's what you just why you were you on earth let us walk according to this God let us come to this place where we would no longer doubt but we will stand like Mary regardless of our impossible sounds will stand and say via them to me according to thy word and not just saying but really mean it with all of our hearts Lord we love you we thank you for your birth we thank you for
