[2:09] lord jesus precious name we commit the
[2:11] service into your hands amen
[2:14] amen
[2:15] you may be seated amen uh
[2:20] just want to take
[2:22] amen for scripture if we will
[2:25] look at a few scriptures i want to start
[2:29] amen that's saint luke
[2:32] for
[2:34] a man in 18
[2:38] amen saint luke 4
[2:41] and 18.
[2:50] amen
[2:53] i originally had something
[2:56] altogether different
[2:58] but the lord kind of just
[3:00] changed it
[3:02] and uh
[3:04] when we go this this direction
[3:08] so
[3:16] amen i'm trying to
[3:18] okay
[3:24] i think luke 4 and 18 is breeds
[3:28] amen and um
[3:30] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[3:34] because he has anointed me
[3:36] to preach the gospel to the poor
[3:40] he has sent me to heal
[3:42] the brokenhearted
[3:44] and to preach deliverance
[3:47] to the captives and
[3:49] recovering of sight
[3:52] to the blind
[3:53] to set at liberty
[3:55] them that are bruised
[3:57] amen and i thought this scripture you
[3:59] may be seated because i got a lot of
[4:01] scriptures to read
[4:02] amen you know a lot of add a blessing to
[4:04] the reading of his word
[4:05] you know just kind of led me to this
[4:07] when he's talking about heal the broken
[4:08] heart and the series that our pastor was
[4:10] doing on um hurt people hurt people
[4:13] amen i kind of just went back to that
[4:15] amen to see that jesus came to heal the
[4:18] brokenhearted
[4:19] amen but if you look deeply on that it
[4:22] says a number of things that he came to
[4:24] do heal the brokenhearted
[4:26] amen uh he came to uh
[4:29] preach deliverance to those that are in
[4:32] captive amen
[4:34] he also uh came to recover sight to the
[4:38] blind
[4:39] and i want to just mainly this this this
[4:41] aft this evening kind of just focus on
[4:43] sight to the blind
[4:45] amen if we look over here at um
[4:49] corinthians
[4:51] 2 corinthians the fourth chapter
[4:55] amen second corinthians the fourth
[4:57] chapter the third verse
[4:59] it says
[5:02] but if our gospel
[5:05] be hid
[5:06] it is hear to them that are lost
[5:10] in whom the god of this world hath
[5:13] blinded the minds of them
[5:16] which believe not
[5:19] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[5:21] christ
[5:22] who is the image of god should shine
[5:26] unto them
[5:27] for we are for we preach not ourselves
[5:30] but christ the lord
[5:33] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[5:35] christ for god who commanded the light
[5:39] to shine out of the darkness has shined
[5:42] in our hearts
[5:43] to give
[5:45] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[5:47] of god in the face of jesus christ
[5:50] but we have this treasure in earthen
[5:54] vessels vessels
[5:56] for the excellency of the power
[5:59] may be of god and not of us
[6:02] amen so we see two different scriptures
[6:05] there we see one that jesus said he came
[6:07] to give sight recovery sight to the
[6:09] blind
[6:11] amen and we see here that uh paul is
[6:14] preaching and he he said that if our
[6:16] gospel be hid
[6:19] amen it is here
[6:21] uh uh to them that are lost amen seeing
[6:24] that the god of this world amen has
[6:27] blinded them
[6:29] amen so uh uh we see two different
[6:32] contrasts there where where where where
[6:35] he is he's come to open the blinded eyes
[6:38] and give sight to the blind
[6:40] amen but the god of this world is doing
[6:42] just the opposite right
[6:44] amen but we see here in in in second
[6:47] corinthians the fourth chapter that the
[6:51] giving sight to the blind uh uh it goes
[6:55] with shining the light in this age amen
[6:59] shining the light on the gospel and we
[7:01] want to kind of just focus on that
[7:03] this evening real quick and we won't
[7:05] hold you too long
[7:07] amen but i want you if you will to let's
[7:09] take a look at the scripture
[7:11] amen in matthew 25
[7:14] matthew 25
[7:16] amen is talking about those uh those
[7:19] those foolish virgins there
[7:21] and he says
[7:23] the kingdom of god the kingdom of heaven
[7:27] uh
[7:28] be likened into ten virgins
[7:31] when they took their lamps and went
[7:34] forth
[7:36] to meet the bridegroom
[7:38] five of them were wise and five of them
[7:41] were foolish
[7:44] they that were foolish took their lamps
[7:46] and we see that uh
[7:48] the lamps a man um
[7:51] is is is associated with something
[7:54] that's giving light amen
[7:56] amen so uh we see that we have to uh god
[8:00] likened us to lamps in this hour amen so
[8:04] the five wives that took their lamps
[8:07] while the bridegroom tarried
[8:10] they all slumbered and slept
[8:14] amen they all slumped slumbered and
[8:16] slept
[8:17] and uh we see that the the message of
[8:20] the hour amen uh
[8:22] came to do three things it came amen to
[8:25] get us prepared for a rapture amen and
[8:28] in getting us prepared amen for or a
[8:32] rapture amen it had to first he had to
[8:35] wake us up
[8:37] amen because we were we were sleep we
[8:40] were we were we were lost uh
[8:43] uh in denominational ideas and and and
[8:46] things like that and uh uh we just
[8:49] didn't have a clear understanding of
[8:51] things
[8:52] amen and in order for him to to to
[8:55] reveal to us the things that decide what
[8:57] we first amen had to be woke
[9:00] we go on the bridegroom tear it and some
[9:02] slumbered and that midnight cry
[9:05] was made behold but made behold the
[9:09] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[9:13] then those virgins arose and trimmed
[9:16] their lamps
[9:17] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[9:20] us
[9:21] your oil
[9:23] amen i don't want to rush through this
[9:25] because
[9:26] uh uh uh
[9:29] we have a lot to say on some of these on
[9:32] some of these things
[9:34] and man we know that we are in uh
[9:37] an age
[9:38] amen the prophet called this age of the
[9:40] flying eagle
[9:42] where we are at this time under a
[9:44] prophetic anointing
[9:46] amen that eagle age a man where that
[9:49] eagle was able to fly to soar high
[9:52] amen and he was uh to to look uh uh far
[9:57] amen he was able to look uh down the
[10:01] road he's able to look behind and see
[10:04] things more clearly amen
[10:07] so if we see here in revelation 4 1 and
[10:10] he said uh and we also found out a man
[10:13] that he said come up hither
[10:16] amen we we ought to to come up hither
[10:20] into the teaching
[10:21] amen revelation 4 and 1 is also uh
[10:25] connected to the isaf is the teaching of
[10:29] the word for this age that we apply to
[10:33] our understanding that we will be able
[10:36] to see clearly amen that's the teaching
[10:40] of this age now
[10:42] amen uh matthew 25 it goes on to say now
[10:45] at the midnight the crowd was made
[10:47] behold the bridegroom
[10:50] cometh go ye out to meet him
[10:53] we know that the cry was the message of
[10:55] the hour
[10:57] amen the crowd was the the messenger
[10:59] that sounded to call those to call the
[11:02] bride to a marriage
[11:05] amen see the wedding supper the rapture
[11:08] the the marriage takes place long before
[11:10] the wedding supper
[11:12] amen these things take place long before
[11:15] the wedding the wedding supper actually
[11:18] there is a union going on right now amen
[11:22] there is a courting ship there's a
[11:24] courtship that takes place where amen
[11:27] you get to know your husband
[11:29] amen and we just kind of want to focus
[11:31] on the light of this hour because uh
[11:34] when you talk about light being a lamp
[11:37] amen uh it's talking about basically
[11:40] it's twofold amen you being a light amen
[11:43] to those that you come in contact with
[11:46] those around you that you you may show
[11:48] them the way amen but the light that
[11:50] shines into your heart is to actually
[11:53] the revelation that is revealed to you
[11:56] amen because what it is is it gives you
[11:59] a basic understanding of a number of
[12:02] things who you are
[12:04] and who he is so you can't have a
[12:07] complete
[12:08] rapturing faith
[12:11] revelation until you fully understand
[12:14] who you are
[12:16] amen we'll get into that a little bit
[12:18] more down the road so these went in and
[12:20] then all these virgins arose and trim
[12:24] their lamps
[12:26] lamps are to do with being able to see
[12:29] in the dark
[12:30] amen and how many know that we're in the
[12:32] dark out
[12:33] amen so thank god for those lamps of
[12:37] amen that we are able to see in this
[12:40] dark hour
[12:41] uh
[12:42] and the lamp also refers to the spirit
[12:47] of a man
[12:48] if we look here in proverbs the 20th
[12:52] chapter the 27th verse it reads the
[12:55] spirit of a man
[12:57] is a candle
[12:59] of the lord
[13:01] the spirit of a man is a candle
[13:05] lamp
[13:06] unto the lord and we know that the
[13:09] spirit of a man
[13:11] consists of conscience
[13:13] memory imagination reasoning and
[13:16] affection am i right
[13:18] so the lamp
[13:20] is your spirit
[13:22] your mind
[13:24] where
[13:25] your comprehension
[13:27] is coming from
[13:29] amen so the oil
[13:32] of the holy ghost
[13:34] spirit
[13:35] that would cause your human mind to be
[13:39] illuminated by the revelation of the
[13:42] word
[13:43] had run out
[13:45] for these five versions
[13:48] for the foolish versions let me say that
[13:50] again the oil the holy spirit
[13:53] that would cause your minds to be
[13:56] illuminated
[13:57] amen by the revelation of the word had
[14:01] run out for these
[14:03] ten virgins amen but five got up and
[14:07] trimmed the lamps
[14:09] and made sure that they had oil in their
[14:12] lamps
[14:13] so they're consummated of having the oil
[14:15] in their lamps that they've got they
[14:17] flame the fire would not go out into
[14:20] their heart
[14:21] amen now understanding that that flame
[14:25] amen is what gives them amen the
[14:28] revelation of this hour
[14:31] amen because without that flame you
[14:33] can't see
[14:36] you're following me
[14:38] you you stumble in darkness but jesus
[14:40] said i come to give sight
[14:42] to the blind
[14:44] how did he when he was saying this he
[14:47] was saying it by accident he knew that
[14:49] there was a there was a holy ghost
[14:50] coming
[14:52] amen that was going to be able to amen
[14:55] keep the fire
[14:56] kindled in your heart
[14:58] and that is the very thing let me tell
[15:00] you something
[15:02] revelation
[15:03] oh my god
[15:05] is a supernatural event
[15:08] when the
[15:09] sometimes
[15:10] i believe that
[15:12] we
[15:13] and i can read it where the prophet even
[15:15] said it well sometimes we we we sort of
[15:18] take these things for granted
[15:20] we we we we cons we don't see the
[15:23] greatness of god
[15:24] because it's so simple
[15:27] he preached his message now that's
[15:29] ironic i was just studying this he
[15:30] preached the message god he didn't
[15:32] reveal the simplicity and revealing the
[15:33] same just before he preached the seals
[15:36] why because it was going to come so
[15:37] simple it's going to be so simple to the
[15:40] those that are so that are looking so
[15:43] deep and so highly educated and things
[15:45] like that and without
[15:47] let me say this
[15:49] without the oil
[15:51] without the lamb
[15:53] it's just words to you it's not going to
[15:57] illuminate you by revelation
[16:01] because there is nothing there amen to
[16:04] be illuminated
[16:06] amen
[16:07] so we see here
[16:08] amen uh
[16:10] let me go on
[16:14] revelation
[16:16] amen
[16:17] is is is supernatural
[16:21] thank you brother i i had it but i must
[16:24] have left it in there on the desk i had
[16:26] my blue rag yeah thank you
[16:30] i get i swear walking so
[16:33] amen
[16:37] if we look at the seals when the prophet
[16:39] preached the seals thank you brother
[16:41] he uh
[16:43] he said
[16:44] when the revelation was coming to him
[16:48] that angel
[16:50] came into the room
[16:52] and revealed to him
[16:54] the truth
[16:56] he said he was all he was going to come
[16:57] out and man it was all together
[17:00] different from his traditional thinking
[17:04] it was supernatural
[17:06] and in order for you to get it
[17:09] when you understand when you get a
[17:11] revelation when something comes and it's
[17:14] illuminated to your mind guess what
[17:16] it's a supernatural
[17:19] it's not just well i'm smart
[17:22] no the supernatural angel came down and
[17:25] revealed it to you
[17:28] amen
[17:31] i don't care how smart you are smart man
[17:33] can't see this
[17:35] many of them are blind in this day
[17:38] have no idea why because you can't get
[17:40] this by book just
[17:42] he the prophet said you can't get this
[17:44] by comparing scripture with scripture
[17:49] he said
[17:50] you can't get this by just comparing
[17:51] scripture with scripture it has to be
[17:54] amen a revelation from god
[17:57] a supernatural event amen
[18:01] but the wise answered and said no
[18:04] the foolish virgin said give us your oil
[18:07] for our lamps have gone out am i okay
[18:09] brother you still hear me
[18:11] amen
[18:14] unless uh the why the wise virgin answer
[18:18] said no not so
[18:21] there be not enough
[18:24] for us in you
[18:27] amen
[18:29] oil
[18:30] is the holy spirit
[18:32] and the scripture
[18:34] is showing us
[18:35] that even the wise
[18:37] didn't have an oversupply
[18:41] of the holy ghost
[18:43] they only had enough revelation of the
[18:46] word for themselves to be able to see
[18:49] their way
[18:50] in the darkness
[18:53] of that midnight hour he said but go ye
[18:57] rather to them that buy and sell for
[19:00] yourselves
[19:01] amen
[19:04] and then while they went to buy the
[19:07] bridegroom came
[19:09] and they
[19:10] that were ready
[19:13] went in with him
[19:14] to the marriage
[19:16] and the door was shut
[19:19] amen and
[19:21] for a title
[19:22] i'm gonna title this message they that
[19:24] were ready
[19:27] they that were ready
[19:29] so we see that there were five wives and
[19:32] there were five fools foolish virgins
[19:35] amen all good pure virgin mean pure
[19:39] amen but the difference was five had oil
[19:44] and five did not
[19:46] all being a representation of the holy
[19:48] ghost
[19:49] amen and uh uh uh uh
[19:53] the other five did not have a revelation
[19:55] of
[19:56] of the gospel
[19:58] i can't understand
[20:00] how
[20:03] in this hour
[20:06] a person can have the holy ghost and not
[20:08] a word of god
[20:12] and deny the word of god
[20:15] see because in our
[20:17] traditional thinking
[20:21] we thought that the evidence of the holy
[20:23] ghost was maybe speaking in tongues
[20:27] you know back in my day they would
[20:30] you come to the church and they would
[20:31] pray for you
[20:33] and have you praying and tearing on the
[20:34] bench
[20:36] and they beat you in the back and say
[20:38] say jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus
[20:41] and until you started frothing at the
[20:43] mouth
[20:44] and you sort of got out of yourself
[20:46] emotionally that's when you got it
[20:49] that's just on your flesh
[20:52] i'm not that's that's fine to feel the i
[20:55] love to feel the presence of the lord
[20:59] some said when i was coming up in the
[21:01] baptist church you put they put the
[21:03] chairs out
[21:05] and you come around and you come up and
[21:06] you you you enjoy the service and you
[21:09] just want to be a part of church and you
[21:11] come and you sit in the chair and after
[21:13] that all of the mothers and the
[21:14] preachers line up and you go around and
[21:16] shake their hands and that's as far as
[21:18] they can take you
[21:21] but we have to go further than that my
[21:23] brothers and sisters we have to go all
[21:26] the way to the baptism of the holy ghost
[21:30] see i have a very good quote i don't
[21:31] know if i'm gonna get to it today amen
[21:34] but uh the prophet was talking about how
[21:39] amen
[21:42] that the tent was the uh tabernacle
[21:45] amen so he says on the outside of the
[21:47] tabernacle like the gate of the
[21:48] tabernacle
[21:50] amen you you can feel pretty good
[21:52] because you're getting close
[21:54] amen to to to to to the presence of the
[21:57] god amen see the the the the ark of the
[22:01] covenant was
[22:02] it was in the inner court behind the
[22:04] veil
[22:05] but as you get close you begin to feel
[22:07] the presence of the lord
[22:09] but see you say sometime in your life
[22:11] when you begin to get close you'll have
[22:14] rainy days and sometimes you'll have
[22:16] sunshine so in the sunshine days you
[22:19] feel good but also when the rainy times
[22:22] come you just don't know how to handle
[22:23] yourself
[22:24] amen and you go a little bit further
[22:26] into the into the inner court you still
[22:29] uh are subjected to sometimes rainy days
[22:32] and the sunshine
[22:33] the sunshine days you feel pretty good
[22:36] hey man you're on top of the mountain
[22:38] but when the rain stops and when the
[22:40] when the sun goes down and the clouds
[22:42] come and the rain stops amen now all of
[22:44] a sudden you you just you're not saved
[22:46] no more
[22:47] amen when someone uh i'm when someone
[22:51] in the church
[22:53] hurts your feelings all of a sudden you
[22:56] don't i'm not coming back no more
[22:59] all of a sudden when the pastor says
[23:01] something that you don't like all of a
[23:04] sudden you you claim you're saved but
[23:06] you're not coming to church anymore
[23:09] but see when you get on the inner side
[23:11] in a court
[23:12] amen there's no more gloomy days
[23:15] amen
[23:16] the light of the gospel is shining on
[23:18] the inside hey man you don't even know
[23:21] what's going on outside it could be
[23:23] raining and storming and no sun at all
[23:26] it doesn't matter to you because you're
[23:28] on the inside amen where the light of
[23:30] the gospel is constantly shining so no
[23:33] matter what your neighbor says no matter
[23:35] what your friend says no matter what
[23:38] your brother or sister does amen you
[23:40] have enough light amen to see beyond
[23:44] that and keep your eyes on the glory of
[23:46] the lord and don't let that stop you
[23:50] that's because you're in the inner court
[23:53] where the light is constantly shining so
[23:55] this is why the oil in your lamp is so
[23:57] important
[23:58] see what happened to those five foolish
[24:00] virgins they all the light went up and
[24:04] when the light get out you just don't
[24:06] know what to do with yourself
[24:08] amen you begin to stumble in darkness
[24:10] but i say
[24:12] this evening my brothers and sisters
[24:15] it is
[24:16] important to keep your oil in your lamp
[24:21] amen
[24:22] it would be a shame
[24:25] to come here
[24:26] week after week
[24:28] and to realize
[24:30] amen to let your oil get low
[24:33] amen and you know what it's not
[24:35] emotional
[24:37] it's not emotional
[24:40] i'm reminded i had i was thinking about
[24:42] it earlier
[24:44] and you know the scripture
[24:48] to uh uh uh says
[24:50] uh
[24:53] they that are
[24:54] hungry and thirsty shall be filled
[24:58] you must stay hungry
[25:02] the song says
[25:04] don't you let this gospel we have become
[25:07] common to you
[25:09] to where we're no longer
[25:11] hungering and
[25:12] thirsting amen because see
[25:16] if i may do a natural comparison when
[25:19] your natural body gets hungry
[25:22] hey man there are many things that you
[25:23] can go eat
[25:26] many things mcdonald's is on every
[25:28] corner
[25:29] burger king
[25:32] what's that new place wah-wah
[25:35] and all of these different things
[25:37] but is it what your body really needs
[25:41] so quite naturally
[25:43] you'll eat it
[25:45] and it'll do you some good
[25:48] it'll sustain you
[25:50] amen but it's not
[25:53] every it's not that what your what god
[25:57] wants you to have
[26:00] junk food i could go to the and get
[26:03] potato chips and soda and different
[26:05] things like that this food it may
[26:08] sustain me for a while
[26:11] amen but what is it going to do to the
[26:13] growth and
[26:14] and what my body really needs
[26:18] so you may hunger
[26:20] and you may thirst for righteousness you
[26:23] better look for what your body really
[26:25] needs
[26:28] i hope i'm speaking to someone today
[26:33] don't take out a convenience
[26:36] out of convenience well i'ma just go
[26:38] here and eat
[26:40] my spiritual food
[26:42] is it what you're really hungering for
[26:45] and the sad thing about it it'll satisfy
[26:47] you for a while
[26:50] it'll satisfy you for a while but you
[26:51] find yourself up and down
[26:54] up and down
[26:56] because you're not eating the right
[26:57] thing
[26:59] amen
[27:00] let's go on
[27:04] amen the prophet here made he says
[27:07] excuse me
[27:10] it was like the group amen
[27:13] had something in noah's day
[27:16] they had something that was revealed to
[27:18] them in their day that the rest of the
[27:22] world
[27:23] was blinded to
[27:25] the difference was that they had uh had
[27:28] anointed their spiritual eyesight
[27:32] of understanding by the message amen
[27:35] that that day of that day
[27:38] god has sent through a prophet
[27:40] sent them to enlighten them
[27:43] of their understanding to be able to see
[27:47] the darkness and the confusion of the
[27:49] time
[27:50] amen
[27:52] corinthians first corinthians two second
[27:55] chapter
[27:56] amen says
[27:57] but as it is written
[27:59] eyes have not seen
[28:02] nor ears have heard
[28:05] neither have it entered into the hearts
[28:07] of man
[28:08] the things which god has prepared for
[28:11] them
[28:12] that love him
[28:13] but god has revealed them
[28:16] unto us
[28:17] by his spirit
[28:20] for the spirit searches all things yea
[28:23] the deep things of god
[28:25] for what man knoweth the things of man's
[28:28] save the spirit of man which is in him
[28:32] even the things of god knoweth no man
[28:35] but
[28:36] by the spirit so you see that you must
[28:39] have the spirit of god in order to be
[28:42] able to understand the things of god
[28:46] you must have the spirit of god to be in
[28:49] order to be able to understand the
[28:50] things of god it goes on and says now we
[28:53] receive we have received
[28:55] not the spirit of the world but the
[28:57] spirit which is of god that we might
[29:00] know the things that are freely given
[29:04] unto us
[29:05] amen
[29:07] we see that that you'll hear a lot of
[29:10] times when when we're preaching here you
[29:12] hear
[29:13] amen things about the message
[29:16] and things amen about the prophet
[29:20] why because there was a message that
[29:22] came forth to wake us up out of our
[29:25] slumber
[29:26] there was a message from god that came
[29:29] forth amen to open the eyes of our
[29:32] understanding amen to do what we as
[29:35] ministers say it's not our job to dress
[29:37] you because see the bride has made
[29:38] herself ready but what we come to do
[29:41] amen to shout is hold a mirror up in
[29:43] front of you amen the mirror of the word
[29:46] of god amen and you it's yours
[29:48] responsibility amen to look into that
[29:51] word amen and
[29:53] and make changes as you see changes are
[29:55] needed
[29:56] amen because we all want to be ready
[29:59] want to be ready at that time amen the
[30:02] prophet preached a message be called
[30:04] preparation
[30:05] amen and in this time we're making
[30:07] preparation
[30:09] we don't want to be not making
[30:11] preparation like those foolish virgins
[30:13] in the bridegroom coming we have not
[30:14] made ourselves ready
[30:16] amen
[30:19] hallelujah
[30:21] so the uh uh
[30:23] we see in john
[30:25] 14
[30:26] 16 and 18
[30:28] amen he says i will pray for
[30:30] the father
[30:32] and he shall give you another
[30:34] comforter that he may abide
[30:38] with you forever
[30:40] even the spirit of truth
[30:43] whom the world cannot receive
[30:46] because it seeth him not
[30:50] neither knoweth him
[30:52] but
[30:53] but ye know him for he dwelleth
[30:56] with you
[30:58] and shall be in you you see
[31:01] amen the spirit of truth
[31:04] is the spirit of god
[31:06] that would come into in into you so that
[31:10] you will be able to understand the word
[31:12] of your day see
[31:14] the oil
[31:15] in the vessel is the holy spirit
[31:18] that causes you to be able to see
[31:22] a man the word of god for your day
[31:26] amen to see the word of god for your day
[31:30] says in 18 here it says and i'll not
[31:33] leave you comfortless amen
[31:36] remember that
[31:40] it was the word that brings
[31:42] comfort to us
[31:44] he says i i will come
[31:48] to you
[31:50] look at that in 18
[31:52] i will not leave you comfort comfortless
[31:54] i will come to you amen
[31:57] we look on here and say uh john 16 says
[32:01] i have yet
[32:04] i have yet many things
[32:06] to say unto you
[32:08] but ye cannot bear them now howbeit when
[32:11] the spirit of truth come
[32:15] when the spirit of truth is come he will
[32:18] guide you
[32:20] into all truth
[32:22] so we see here that the spirit of truth
[32:24] amen the spirit of truth
[32:29] is in you
[32:32] and he will be your god
[32:35] he would guide your mind
[32:37] to the correct understanding of the word
[32:42] by the message
[32:44] by the message of the hour now i want to
[32:46] i'm finna say something here
[32:49] the god
[32:51] will guide your mind
[32:55] in your heart
[32:57] to the message
[32:58] for your age
[33:00] the god will guide your mind and your
[33:04] heart to the message of the age
[33:07] he will also
[33:09] guide your life experiences
[33:14] so that when the time comes
[33:17] amen that will cause you to have an
[33:19] understanding of the things
[33:23] a man a deeper knowledge of himself
[33:27] the god will guide your life experiences
[33:32] to cause you to understand things to
[33:36] bring you into a deeper knowledge of
[33:39] himself
[33:41] so it is often the experiences of our
[33:44] life
[33:46] the things that we go through combined
[33:48] together with the word of god amen that
[33:52] will grow you in the grace and knowledge
[33:55] of our lord and savior
[33:57] so we don't we don't with all the things
[33:59] we've been through
[34:01] amen i i appreciate god for the journey
[34:05] amen because what what look at joel
[34:08] it was out of the things that he went
[34:10] through that he was able to see some of
[34:13] the things that he was able to see
[34:16] amen so the life experiences the good
[34:20] and the bad and everything else it is
[34:22] the guy guiding you amen so that it when
[34:26] the time comes and the life experiences
[34:29] that you have and the word of god coming
[34:31] together amen to shine a light well this
[34:34] is why i was going through those things
[34:36] he was preparing me all the time
[34:40] amen he was preparing me all the time
[34:44] first john 4
[34:46] 4 chapter
[34:48] the fourth verse
[34:51] ye are of god little children
[34:53] and have overcome them
[34:56] because greater
[34:59] is he that is in you
[35:02] then he
[35:03] that is in the world
[35:06] they are
[35:09] of the world therefore speak they
[35:12] of the world
[35:14] and the world heareth them
[35:18] we
[35:19] are of god
[35:21] he that knoweth god
[35:24] hears
[35:25] us
[35:26] he's
[35:27] uh that is not of god here is not us
[35:31] hereby we
[35:33] hereby know we the spirit of truth
[35:37] and the spirit of arrow
[35:41] so we hear
[35:43] the evidence according to john
[35:47] was being able to hear
[35:50] the word of truth
[35:54] that they were speaking of in that day
[35:57] amen in other words amen the evidence of
[36:01] a person
[36:02] with the spirit of god
[36:04] in the where they were able to hear and
[36:07] understand the correct interpretation of
[36:09] the word
[36:11] man we understand
[36:12] amen that like i was saying earlier that
[36:14] years before our pentecost
[36:17] different denominations had different
[36:18] understandings of what the holy ghost
[36:20] really was amen but we thank god for a
[36:22] profit in this hour amen
[36:28] in the church ages the revelation of
[36:30] jesus christ
[36:32] the prophet says here
[36:36] he knows that if the people
[36:41] get a true revelation
[36:44] of the true church
[36:48] and what she is
[36:50] what she is
[36:53] what she stands for
[36:56] and that she can do
[36:58] the greater works
[37:01] she will be an invincible army
[37:06] if they get a true
[37:08] revelation
[37:11] of the two spirits
[37:13] within the framework of the church
[37:17] and by god's spirit discern
[37:21] and withstand
[37:23] the antichrist spirit
[37:28] satan will be powerless
[37:31] before her
[37:33] he would be
[37:34] as definitely throtted
[37:38] today as when
[37:41] christ withstood his efforts every
[37:43] effort to gain power over him in the
[37:46] desert
[37:48] yes
[37:49] satan
[37:50] hates revelation
[37:54] amen
[37:57] but we love it
[37:58] with true revelation in our lives
[38:01] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[38:04] us
[38:05] but we prevail
[38:07] over them
[38:10] you will recall i mentioned at the
[38:12] beginning of this message mr proud
[38:14] speaking this book we are studying is
[38:16] the actual revelation of jesus christ
[38:20] of jesus himself he says
[38:23] in the church
[38:24] and
[38:25] his work in the future ages
[38:29] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[38:32] spirit
[38:34] to give us revelation
[38:36] or we will fail to get it
[38:39] bringing these two thoughts together you
[38:42] will see
[38:44] that it won't take just ordinary study
[38:48] and thinking
[38:50] to make this book real
[38:52] it's going to take the operation of the
[38:56] holy ghost
[38:57] that means this book cannot
[39:01] be revealed to anyone
[39:03] but a special class of people
[39:06] it would take one it would take one with
[39:09] prophetic insight
[39:12] it will require the ability
[39:14] to hear from god
[39:16] it will require
[39:18] it will require
[39:20] supernatural instruction
[39:22] it will require the okay supernatural
[39:25] structure not just a student comparing
[39:28] verse with verse
[39:31] though that's good
[39:33] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[39:37] the holy spirit
[39:38] it never becomes
[39:41] or it never becomes clear
[39:44] how we need to hear from god
[39:47] and lay ourselves open and become
[39:50] yielded to the spirit to hear
[39:53] and know
[39:57] my brothers and sisters here in this
[39:58] ministry
[40:01] i believe i can speak
[40:04] amen
[40:06] in the past of his absence
[40:09] and say
[40:10] uh
[40:12] that
[40:13] that is the most important thing
[40:16] here that we are trying to do
[40:18] in this ministry
[40:20] is get people
[40:23] to the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:27] to the baptism it is the most important
[40:29] there will once say revelation
[40:32] is important
[40:34] but you can't have true revelation
[40:36] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:39] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:42] amen
[40:43] it is something we have a lot so we have
[40:46] different
[40:47] levels
[40:49] we have different levels we
[40:51] brother willis said something that he in
[40:53] the last time he preached here
[40:56] when we came to this message
[40:58] amen
[41:01] he said that we are looking for
[41:05] he says a holistic gospel
[41:08] amen and he was talking about he said
[41:10] when he was asking how when he got mad
[41:13] how we was we we were pretty clean
[41:16] we we looked good we were dressed well
[41:18] hey amen
[41:20] and uh so the problem was
[41:23] we had
[41:24] different ministers fighting over quotes
[41:28] is this right
[41:30] seals and thunders and
[41:32] tents and all these different things and
[41:35] back and forth
[41:36] but
[41:37] failing
[41:40] this group of young people
[41:42] because see what we're doing now is
[41:43] getting ready for a marriage
[41:46] and the holy ghost who is the teacher
[41:48] teaches us
[41:50] how to prepare ourselves
[41:53] how to prepare ourselves for this
[41:54] marriage that we are embarked on amen
[41:58] see so but but but a lot of times there
[42:00] were holes and there was gaps in that
[42:02] preparing
[42:04] because it was like the ministers were
[42:06] so big like he said arguing over quotes
[42:08] and different things they sort of forgot
[42:10] about the true purpose
[42:12] am i right is this right is that right
[42:14] you got a congregation of people sitting
[42:16] there
[42:17] unprepared
[42:18] for marriage
[42:21] unprepared for marriage
[42:24] and then when the when the struggles and
[42:26] of life and the different things come
[42:28] amen we wonder why so many has fell away
[42:32] because they wasn't prepared
[42:34] for marriage
[42:37] wasn't wasn't truly prepared
[42:40] amen and the only way to be prepared is
[42:43] to stress i would always stress it's the
[42:45] baptism of the holy ghost it's good to
[42:48] come to church
[42:50] it's good to be a christian but you got
[42:53] to go father
[42:55] it's good to come into the church
[42:58] he has to be in you
[43:01] he has to be in you and man we're not
[43:04] saying that it's a big emotional thing
[43:06] you don't have to come and slobber and
[43:08] cry and it's not coming out your nose
[43:10] and this that in the other
[43:12] because the mystery of this age is to be
[43:14] able to receive the holy ghost without
[43:15] sensation
[43:17] amen amen but i tell you what i love to
[43:19] have a god that i can feel sometimes
[43:22] amen my wife would get pretty mad man
[43:26] i don't come give her a kiss on the
[43:27] forehead or something
[43:29] come put my arms around and let her i
[43:31] know she go to get pouting around the
[43:33] house
[43:34] something ain't right
[43:36] any woman
[43:37] any woman would want their husband to
[43:40] come put their arms around you
[43:42] show you that i love you
[43:45] come and hold you when you say that
[43:47] sense of security
[43:49] amen same thing with our heavenly father
[43:51] sometime i need you to come and hold me
[43:55] let the word let the word of god just
[43:57] wrap all around me

[44:01] encouragement say thank you lord

[44:24] door entering into that door what
[44:26] happened i was beginning to enter into a
[44:28] different level
[44:30] everybody was here and everything and
[44:32] they're saying and different things but
[44:33] i was in a whole nother level i had
[44:36] entered into something different
[44:39] amen well i did i wasn't even concerned
[44:41] with the people around me i wasn't even
[44:43] concerned with what was going on i had
[44:45] entered into something i had went into
[44:48] another door
[44:51] where it was just me and him
[44:54] me and him
[44:56] don't be afraid to go under that door
[44:59] amen don't be afraid sometime my
[45:01] brothers and sisters sometimes we get so
[45:03] mechanical amen i don't know why i'm
[45:05] going this way this wasn't even a part
[45:06] of it sometimes we get so mechanical in
[45:08] church
[45:10] amen that this got to happen at this
[45:11] time and this happened at this time and
[45:13] this happened at this time and we just
[45:14] like robots and everything we get up and
[45:16] we sing and we sit down and we listen
[45:17] and we go and we had a good time but
[45:19] we're not really entering into that door
[45:23] we're not really allowing ourselves to
[45:25] just we didn't come to see each other
[45:28] i love seeing my brothers and sisters
[45:30] but i tell you what i want to just see
[45:32] him
[45:36] amen
[45:37] i want to go beyond the outer court hey

[46:53] amen take the parameters from around us
[46:56] amen but you enter in
[46:58] you come in the song service and all of
[47:01] those things are designed to to get you
[47:03] into an atmosphere that you can receive
[47:05] from god amen there's more than one way
[47:07] you you receive from god by the word
[47:10] amen the word something strikes
[47:12] something in you sometimes it's okay
[47:15] amen for you to praise the lord
[47:18] don't disrupt the preacher now the
[47:19] deacon gonna have to come into escort
[47:21] you out the hallway
[47:22] you keep praising him out here because
[47:23] we can't interrupt the word
[47:25] amen because nothing comes before that
[47:28] amen but during the services and after
[47:30] service allow yourself a man to enter
[47:32] into that place with god
[47:36] consecrate yourself
[47:38] don't be so mechanical my brothers and
[47:40] sisters
[47:41] oh we came and we had a real good time
[47:43] that ain't enough
[47:46] that ain't enough we have to make sure
[47:48] we're ready
[47:49] and the only way to make sure that we're
[47:51] ready is by the baptism of the holy
[47:53] ghost
[47:55] amen
[48:02] amen
[48:10] i'm passing over because i hit a lot of
[48:11] this
[48:14] hey man
[48:17] you see here
[48:19] uh
[48:26] amen bear with me
[48:30] you love the lord
[48:44] amen
[48:46] in the feast of the trumpets
[48:49] amen i'm sorry so it's the 64
[48:53] 0719
[48:56] 1964
[48:58] july 19 on the morning service uh
[49:02] paragraph 2 45 he says
[49:06] when finished that lady you'll see an
[49:08] age according to revelation 10
[49:11] the mystery
[49:12] of all the bride
[49:15] would be node
[49:17] to the bride
[49:20] he said is that right
[49:23] listen close now
[49:25] the bride called out
[49:28] by the word
[49:31] christ himself calling out the bride
[49:34] amen
[49:38] i just want to interject here so after
[49:41] the seals opened in 1963
[49:44] we'll see that
[49:47] the same pattern
[49:49] of our understanding of the word being
[49:52] completely changed around
[49:55] as the sermons of the prophet continued
[49:58] to be preached to us
[50:00] and all the mysteries of god continue to
[50:02] be made known to us by the ministry of
[50:05] the messenger's hour
[50:07] and so
[50:11] this also directly applies
[50:16] with this subject amen them that made
[50:20] themselves ready so my question is
[50:23] is is is is is that i asked what is the
[50:26] evidence
[50:28] i'll put it this way
[50:30] the evidence of the oil in your lamb
[50:34] a lot of people ask that question it's
[50:35] been natural question what's the
[50:36] evidence of the holy ghost but what is
[50:38] the evidence of the oil
[50:40] in your lamb
[50:42] amen the evidence of oil
[50:45] in your lamb amen is the ability
[50:49] to be able to recognize and see the word
[50:52] of the hour for your day
[50:55] the evidence
[50:57] that the oil
[50:59] is in your lamb
[51:01] amen that she'll say amen to every word
[51:06] amen she's no longer stumbling amen in
[51:09] darkness
[51:10] amen but see the word of god
[51:12] continue to unfold even into eternity
[51:16] amen the evidence of the oil in your
[51:19] lamb amen is is is as i go back to noah
[51:24] and and and and noah's day see they had
[51:27] to have an understanding
[51:29] a revelation
[51:31] amen that uh uh uh to get into the ark
[51:37] but it had to go beyond just the
[51:39] understanding and actually get in the
[51:40] yard
[51:42] it's okay to just have a revelation
[51:45] but if you don't actually do
[51:48] amen the word amen
[51:52] then do you really have a revelation
[51:55] or do you have uh uh what was are you
[51:58] just following the cry a lot of people
[51:59] just following the crime
[52:01] i do what they do
[52:03] but you don't have a real understanding
[52:05] for yourself
[52:07] you have to have a real and that's the
[52:09] evidence of the oil in your lamb
[52:12] amen
[52:14] amen i feel
[52:16] amen check the clothes i don't know what
[52:18] time is it brother y'all rem keep me
[52:21] keep me honest on those things
[52:24] amen
[52:27] but my brothers and sisters
[52:29] as the ministry if we don't stress
[52:34] amen in this hour
[52:37] the baptism of the holy ghost we have
[52:39] failed to people
[52:41] if we don't stress in this hour
[52:43] amen because that's the only thing
[52:45] that's the only way you're going to be
[52:47] able to get ready
[52:49] amen
[52:50] god's chosen place of worship he said
[52:53] notice that when you are truly baptized
[52:56] into him
[52:58] the true evidence
[53:01] is that you believe him
[53:04] the word
[53:07] god's chosen place of worship 1965 oh
[53:10] the february 20.
[53:14] paragraph 88
[53:20] notice
[53:21] and when you are truly
[53:24] baptized into him
[53:27] amen the true evidence
[53:30] that you believe him
[53:33] the true evidence is that you believe
[53:35] him
[53:36] the word
[53:38] amen
[53:40] the true evidence
[53:43] so my brother um um you don't have to
[53:46] follow me on this one sister i know it's
[53:47] a lot of typing i got a lot of quotes
[53:48] and things here he said in one place the
[53:50] submerged church age amen if you're a
[53:53] true seed you will hear the word the
[53:56] spirit will baptize you into the body of
[53:59] christ filling you and empowering you
[54:02] and you will receive the word for your
[54:05] day and age
[54:07] see how clear the true evidence becomes
[54:10] when the word is revealed to you
[54:13] amen
[54:15] so these are different quotes and
[54:17] different things that the prophet has
[54:19] said amen to show us amen
[54:22] what is the actual evidence of the oil
[54:25] in our lamb
[54:27] the actual evidence that we that that we
[54:30] have what we claim we have now i'm not
[54:31] saying that that that that you don't
[54:34] that the ever not
[54:36] the holy ghost is not guiding you
[54:37] leading you and guiding you
[54:39] but you have to continue to follow the
[54:42] guide
[54:44] continue to follow the god amen because
[54:47] uh uh uh the bride is made there were
[54:49] five wives and there was five foolish
[54:51] virgins
[54:53] not before being under me to say who
[54:55] going to heaven and who not i'll never
[54:57] do that
[54:58] that is that is up to god ain't nothing
[55:00] to me
[55:01] i hope everybody make it
[55:04] but i ain't never been to a funeral
[55:05] where somebody didn't make it
[55:07] never
[55:09] in all my life been to a funeral where
[55:11] the person didn't make it to heaven
[55:13] everybody made it
[55:17] but we know better than
[55:18] that we know better than that
[55:22] the bride is making herself ready
[55:25] amen to go into a rapture
[55:27] amen by having the evening time light
[55:31] shining in a heart
[55:32] amen shining the light of understanding
[55:35] and revelation it is a supernatural
[55:37] event my brothers and sisters
[55:39] it is a supernatural event my my my
[55:44] plea
[55:45] this evening in closing
[55:48] amen is to uh
[55:53] say
[55:55] come in a man with a
[55:59] desperation
[56:01] now a lot of us been saved for many
[56:03] years
[56:04] we've been around the fire for many
[56:06] years
[56:08] but sometimes when we're around it for
[56:09] many years we we we be
[56:12] how should i say sometimes we get a
[56:14] little complacent
[56:16] we get it it just gets a little common
[56:18] to us
[56:19] oh that's just the ocean
[56:22] we live on the ocean say one man came
[56:24] from the forest and he passed by the
[56:26] other man and he wanted to get to the
[56:28] ocean so bad he says oh my god never
[56:29] seen the ocean i want to get into the
[56:31] ocean and he passed by a man leaving the
[56:32] ocean
[56:33] and it's just just the ocean
[56:36] because he just lived on it all his life
[56:40] but it's a special thing we have here
[56:42] amen and we should want more and more
[56:45] and more and more and more feel me and
[56:48] refill me
[56:50] with the holy ghost lord
[56:52] there's a lot around us that i don't
[56:54] even i i i don't know if they had an
[56:57] original baptism of the holy ghost
[56:59] see we have different different
[57:02] you know levels
[57:04] some been here for something in the
[57:06] church for a long time
[57:08] i received it back in 88 that's
[57:10] it 88.
[57:14] see because as you go out into the world
[57:16] your lamp burns out
[57:19] i was going to really break down i had
[57:21] some different quotes and different
[57:22] things and different of of what the lamp
[57:24] really is to define the lamp amen
[57:28] one place to prophesy the wick is you
[57:30] but then again he said another place you
[57:31] say the weak is your faith
[57:33] amen so your faith in the word
[57:36] amen it's the wick that actually burns
[57:38] and the holy ghost we know is the oil
[57:40] amen in your earthen vessel a man is the
[57:43] actual body of the lamb and sometimes a
[57:46] man you we when that ant lamp burns and
[57:49] burns it produces carbon so something
[57:51] every night then we got to come to
[57:52] church and trim our lambs
[57:55] amen
[57:56] get the carbon cleaned out of us
[57:59] amen so that we could see clear
[58:02] because if you carrying a lamp that's
[58:04] all carboned up
[58:06] it it slowly happens and you see a
[58:09] little less but you don't realize it
[58:10] because it's happened so slowly
[58:14] you don't realize that wait a minute a
[58:16] person that that that that that has
[58:18] problems with their eyes it sometimes
[58:21] happens gradually
[58:23] gradually gradually sometimes it happens
[58:26] so slowly that you you you find one man
[58:29] all of a sudden when they say well they
[58:30] starting to see you do this you start
[58:32] doing this and things like that you
[58:33] don't realize how far you have digressed
[58:37] and see and sometimes that maybe they
[58:39] have to take off the cataracts and
[58:41] things that nature
[58:42] hey man but it's just getting a little
[58:44] damn
[58:46] sometimes we have to come into church
[58:47] and say lord i need my lamps trimmed
[58:51] amen i just need a touch from you lord
[58:54] lord i need something no father god to
[58:57] just knock the carbon off the glass of
[58:59] my lamp so that i can see my way clearer
[59:03] amen
[59:04] i appreciate uh the testimony from
[59:06] sister nelly in closing
[59:08] amen uh uh
[59:10] and and just kind of explaining how
[59:12] sometime i land our sight just gets a
[59:15] little dim
[59:17] we get so caught up in the things of the
[59:18] world and and surviving and
[59:21] and and sometimes we can't see just
[59:24] really see we get we get it gets cloudy
[59:28] and then she was uh
[59:30] talking about how she's preparing for
[59:32] retirement
[59:34] and uh
[59:35] she was considering taking another job
[59:38] and and you guys remember the testimony
[59:41] and how the lord told her not to take
[59:43] that job he said haven't i taken care of
[59:45] you you know and and and and i know she
[59:48] by her testimony she said lord fought
[59:50] her with giving that testimony
[59:54] but little did she know that
[59:56] i too am trying to prepare for
[59:57] retirement
[1:00:00] and
[1:00:01] in doing so
[1:00:03] just kind of looking at finances and
[1:00:05] different things
[1:00:09] i begin to
[1:00:11] i don't know is it panic the right word
[1:00:15] um
[1:00:16] just get with just a little concern and
[1:00:18] we should be concerned about those
[1:00:20] things
[1:00:22] but i began to
[1:00:23] to allow
[1:00:26] you know on my job i just
[1:00:29] i need more money i need more money i'm
[1:00:31] trying to get this together i'm trying
[1:00:32] to make sure i'm ready and then when
[1:00:34] things don't fall into place like i
[1:00:35] think it should fall into place
[1:00:38] now i'm getting angry
[1:00:41] and it's causing me to have a whole
[1:00:42] different spirit
[1:00:45] see
[1:00:47] but when she gave that testimony thank
[1:00:49] the lord it just
[1:00:50] opened the eyes of my understanding
[1:00:54] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:00:55] minute wait a minute relax
[1:00:58] god is going to take care of you
[1:01:01] so as i begin to just look at that and
[1:01:02] different things i'm just saying i say
[1:01:04] just don't let this stress you
[1:01:06] don't let it because these kind of
[1:01:07] things will stretch you and stretch you
[1:01:09] i'm getting angry i'm angry with the
[1:01:11] boss and angry with the people and
[1:01:12] things like that and one all upset and
[1:01:15] find myself upset all the time carrying
[1:01:18] it
[1:01:19] but the lord came through that testimony
[1:01:22] and just gave me a word
[1:01:25] oh thank you jesus okay
[1:01:28] okay
[1:01:30] what he did just came and knocked a
[1:01:31] little carbon off my limbs so i could
[1:01:34] see a little clearer
