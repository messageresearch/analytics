to have back home amen we thank God just turn with me in your Bibles we'll just go right into the word of the Lord today we want to uh we're going back to Joel chapter 1 and two I want to thank all the saints that were able to make their way up to Orlando on yesterdays we celebrated the life of uh sister s and uh had a a wonderful service there so many came to support uh the family and I think it was somewhat over whelming that they got all the support that they got uh but it was just so good to see it and you know both brother and sister SJ have always been Staples and um you know we we appreciate them both and uh but you all again keep Brother s in your prayers most may not know but this is the second time he's actually had to bury a wife uh so please you know keep Brother s in prayer uh the Lord would just help him uh during this season God gave him strength on yesterday just to be able to have words and and uh we just trust that God would give him strength from day to day amen so please continue to keep him in your prayers praise the Lord um we will go to Joel 1 and amen in verse uh 4 um and then over to Joel 2 the Bible says that which the palmerworm has left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust ha left hath the canor eaten and that which the can left hath the caterpillar eaten and then over in chapter two uh we pick up at verse 25 amen here um says I will restore unto you the years that the Locust ha eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you uh and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that dealt wondrously with you and my people should never be ashamed ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and and none else my people should never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the Great and the terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered from Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be delivered shall be Deliverance as the Lord has said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call amen thank God for his word amen let's pray uh father we thank you for the reading of the word and we also thank you God that uh with these scriptures that have been read you have given us a a journey uh through scripture and and just through the message just to see Lord a little deeper into what has been promised here by Joel I realizing that we are actually living in the time where this promise is being made manifest uh This Promise of restoration uh God we're living in it and help us to find our place and uh Lord just get under an expectation to see a manifestation of what you have written before we were even born you wrote about us God let us know that we were always a part of your thoughts and uh we were a part of the Eternal thoughts of God so Lord we pray that you would bless uh our gathering here May the Spirit uh continue to unfold to us the word of God we take control over every Spirit that's against the spirit of God and may Lord you just have your way in this place make yourself real to each and everyone it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated Amen in the house of the Lord amen amen amen amen we certainly thank God for um this journey that he has us on um We are continuing with our our thought on get back in step and we also come to the inspiration of I will restore saith the Lord amen this is not a promise from Brother Jack uh but this is a promise from all oh mighty God Amen and and and and whatever uh the devil's taking from you you ought to be looking to get it back Amen in this season Amen in this season L lay claims on everything God promised you amen hallelujah hallelujah uh but I I want to you know we we've been focusing a lot amen with this third section uh from the restoration there's four parts to it there is uh when you know we we brother random talked about the four death Messengers uh which you know we we realized that's the Palmer worm uh the uh uh Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar all those are the death Messengers but then he said um man it just it blesses my heart to know that a prophet could go deep into this and and then he says four life Messengers brought it back into the church and and his uh the four life Messengers he said was uh was Luther with the message of justification the just shall live by faith amen and then Wesley came with a message of sanctification and that was Life coming back into the church and then he said the uh third part of that was the restoration of the gifts which came through um um I I want to use the word Pentecost but not the denomination okay there it is it came through the Pentecostal experience hallelujah hallelujah but not the denomination and this is where the the people get all mixed up because they they when we when we use the word Pentecost they think we talking about the denomination no the denomination got started from an experience right and and and and I was mentioning to you all how you know when you go back and you see what happened on AUA Street and before I get too deep in there the fourth part of that was the word being restored uh but but but but you know when when a soua street hit uh I I gave you all just a some of the history and this is not me making it up you can go read this you know on your own uh but you know they had there was people believing that God was going to move in the gifts they were reading it in the Bible and they said God I mean this was not just something for the day of Pentecost a historic day uh because the scripture actually say in the last days that's pluralized in the last days I'll pour out my spirit right so so I I if if they're reading this and they're starting to see this like wait they start praying and and seeking God and there were men teaching and you know back in those days it was segregation so you had William Seymour which was a black man uh going to Charles Parham which was a white man and and Charles Parham was teaching this already William Seymour heard that he was teaching he said man I I want to sit in he actually he couldn't sit in the class because of because of segregation he couldn't sit in the class but he was so desperate he says I sit on the outside of the class and hear what is being Tau my God right and from there he went to uh uh uh Los Angeles California he got invited to go there and preach and and when he got there and preach he start preaching about these gifts right out the Bible then people got so upset they kicked them out the church said you not coming back to preach that no more that's false Doctrine all right but he stayed there in prayer Glory to God and as he stayed in prayer God heard his prayer and before you know it a a Revival broke out the souu street Revival and and here come the the gifts coming back into the church the experience of Pentecost now here's the problem when the denomination of Pentecost came and here's where the problem cuz everybody even param came to soua Street everybody was coming and and experiencing what was what God was doing there in souan street but what happened is that then some kind of way uh politics or racism got involved and then you had these two different groups broke up from there Hallelujah and they're still broke apart today amen the the blacks went with one side and they started the Church of God in Christ hallelujah amen and then the whites went another way and they started the assemblies with God both Pentecostal churches but one is run the blacks one run the right and let me tell you something the holy ghost that we talking about it don't bring that kind of Separation amen the Pentecost experience that we talking about it brings a Unity it brings a togetherness it brings a Oneness Hallelujah if if we see Division coming in the church something wrong with that glory to God Amen so we're in expectation to see a a the real genuine Pentecostal experience yes sir amen amen amen God promised it here I want to just kind of catch a few things and and now you you you'll see that I I'll read a lot of quotes and um we know that there's nine spiritual gifts um that that Pentecost that and we brought this you know we've been bringing this for the last couple weeks and I'll REM mention again today we realize this non spiritual gifts and the gifts of tongues is actually the eighth of the ninth the nine gifts but for some reason tongues has been attacked more than anything and I know tongues the reason it might be attacked is because the Pentecostal Church went to seed on that and they they they they told us that you did not have the Holy Ghost unless you spoke in tongues so then people just start making it up and now folks speaking in tongu and ain't living nothing living nothing Hallelujah I mean and and then then the other thing we got is that uh that you have people speaking in tongues and then after they finish speaking in Tong then they go to cursing somebody out and what the Bible says you blessing and cursing out the same mouth we we don't want that amen we want the real thing all right but but tongues has been attack but but yet we got to watch this because uh uh uh we can we can actually take something out of the church that God meant for us to have amen I think I was just listening to a quote where brother brand was talking about dancing in the church and he said you know what happened devil took the dance and perverted the dance but God gave dancing to the Saints yes he God gave dancing to the Saints oh let me let me get out of that let me let me get out of that dancing dancing is a it should be a part of our worship dancing is a sign of [Music] Victory when when when when when Moses in the children redro came cross that Red Sea and looked back and saw all h a taskmasters drowned in the Red Sea it put us hallelujah it it it put a it put a move in their feet and when you look back and see how many Devils amen been defeated come on Church you ain't got to be ashamed to give God a dance Hallelujah and and and look we all made different so we might dance a little different and it's okay yes it is amen my moves might be a little different than the next brother's moves but but I'm still doing it for the Lord all right just let me let me let me let me get out of Hallelujah I we don't we done went through so much church over the years just just so so many comments made here and there and you know I I I've been recently just kind of talking to people say you know you got to for one person it's too far but for another person it's not enough right so so which one we going to go by whose opinion is it going to go going to be the one that rules we not going to go by no man's opinion we're going to use the word of God we're going to let the Holy Ghost be in control that's it all right yes sir amen amen amen hallelujah I've been you know every everything we that many times I've tried to do things and man just criticize you and your flesh you and your flesh well part of that is true I am in my flesh but let me just I'm doing this for God just let me do this for the Lord amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah and I have to say things like that because somebody get started in a gift the first thing they do is get criticized and that's we got to to break that Spirit we we don't want that we I mean we want to invite we want to encourage we want to create an environment where people are welcome Amen to to to to to to actually use the gifts that God has given them I want my singers to use their gifts I want my musicians to use their gifts Hallelujah but I also want them non-spiritual gifts to be made manifest right here in our midst I want those that have tongues to be free to speak in tongues I want those that have interpretation to be able to give an interpretation amen I want those that got the gift of wisdom to be able to give the gift those that work miracles in our midst I want all of that amen all of it amen amen here let me read just something here brother Brandon makes this statement out of the message questions and answers on Genesis um he um there's a brother here criticizing tongu so brother random makes a statement on it says and your Sudan missions said we have no place for a man that would speak in tongues and and now I'm I'm reading this quote but you know there's there's message churches that kind of feel the same way we have no place for this we we got the word no let's see what the prophet said right it says we have no place for a man that would speak in tongues and he come to me and said somebody speaking in tongues why why I said they now look at what brother R say it says they have no place for Jesus Christ for Jesus Christ spoke in an unknown tongue and died speaking in unknown tongues that's what he said now amen he says they couldn't accept Paul's teaching Paul spoke with tongues more than all of them one said to me yesterday said I'd rather speak five words with understanding see they trying to go back to the scripture I rather speak with f SP five words with understanding but Paul's teaching said covet prophecy yes sir it says and then then here's this other part we going to read this in a second covet prophecy and forbid brother yes sir Hallelujah forbid not to speak with tongues amen forbid not he says and they are forbidden to speak with tongues many churches are forbidden I mean for but but the but but when we go back to the Bible Paul say forbid not to do that right Hallelujah I'm going to read it for you in a second amen let's go on he says speaking in tongues is a Divine gift of God which belongs in the church just the same today as it was back there in the beginning he says that's exactly the truth yes indeed that's the Bible teaching it's a Divine gift and you deny that just to same as you deny the new birth you deny everything that Jesus taught when when you try to cut that out let me go on he says now you can go wild on that and that's where we got to keep this Amen in check we got to keep it in B and I'm going to help us with that I'm going to read some scripture to make sure that we got this really lined up I'mma just I'm going just keep on talking amen I'm going just keep on talking amen now now I want y'all to catch what the prophet says cuz I I quoted this a few few weeks ago but I didn't read it to you he says he says um he says now you can go wild than that many of them have Pentecostal church has gone wild on it he says but I'm saying that has its place it's just like a pair of shoes when you buy a pair of shoes the tongues are in them can I can I put it this way don't give me a pair of shoes that actually don't have the tongues right it's not a complete shoe if it don't have the tongues in it and don't just give me a shoe only with tongues because it's not a complete shoe I want the whole shoe hallelujah amen glory glory glory glory look at what he says now he says when you buy a pair of shoes the tongues are in them and that's right when you're when you're into the body of Christ God has the whole table set full there he has love he has joy that was those were the seven I mean the nine uh uh gifts uh fruit of the spirit which we read out Galatians we read that last week that's the nine fruit of the spirit but also the nine gifts of the Spirit all of that go together and then you know another thing that's on that tree I ain't even got to it yet but another thing on that tree is the is the virtues from the statue of perfect man all that's on this tree that God planted at Pentecost all right look at this he says if I went to your table and sat down there and you said preacher come eat with me I believe you love me and you had beans and potatoes and carrots and fried chicken uh-oh the prophet like fried chicken I believe you love me and you have beans and potatoes and carrots and fried chicken and pumpkin pie and ice cream everything said in there well I believe I'd be just as welcome to the potatoes as I was to the beans the only thing I believe I just I'd be just as welcome to the chicken as I was to the pie it's all on the table and the one thing I have to do is say would you please pass me some pie right Hallelujah my God I believe with a good free heart you your love to me would you say certainly my brother have a nice big piece of it is that right says would you pass me potatoes well certainly my brother here it is and every Redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ died for and purchased in his atonement at Calvary is sitting on the table and every believer setting before it we're sitting before it this morning Hallelujah if I need healing I say father pass me some healing my God Hallelujah whatever you need God's got it on the table just ask God to pass it along to you H says if I I pour it out on my plate and eat a big now if you want he said now if you want to starve to death and a table full of food you want to St the death he say go ahead and pretty much he say I tell you what you go ahead and starve I'mma eat my part that that's the way I feel I'm I'm I'm I'mma eat everything God got for me every gift that he promised I want it and I this is just I mean this just for spirit and Truth Tabernacle we going to have it all yes cuz God promised to restore it all Hallelujah we going to have it all he says yes sir prophecy is speaking in tongues now I I I mentioned this and I'm going to there's a yeah I I want to line up a scripture here in a second 1 Corinthians 14 um remember God planted this at Pentecost and this uh tree produced the nine gifts of the Spirit the nine fruits of the spirit we read a quote last week where David I mean brother Brandon said David saw the tree in Psalms 1 and um and and and and David pretty much said they they couldn't kill that tree they couldn't kill this tree that God planted at Pentecost they couldn't kill it because it was planted by the rivers of one water amen uh and and and and he said the uh the other thing David said there is that the tree would bring forth fruit in his season and brother random told us it's his fruit which is God's fruit God's tree God's fruit coming from his tree and it says it's it's his fruit in the season that the prophet is bringing it so the word is restored through the prophet the restoration comes through the prophets it's he says he says it's his fruit it's God's fruit in the season the prophet is bringing it it'll be in the prophet season God's fruit and God's Time by The Prophet season so we know that we're in the right season we know we're at the right time for these fruit to be coming forth from God's tree we know that and and again so we talked about the fruit of the spirit being love joy peace longsuffering goneness goodness faith meekness Temperance those that Denine fruits of the spirit according to Galatians 5 the spiritual gifts the fruit that are on the tree is the word of wisdom the word of knowledge it's the Bible said Faith Gifts of healing working of Miracles prophecy Discerning of spirits diverse kinds of tongues interpretation tongu all these things are supposed to be on this tree this is God's tree amen so we look for all these fruit now what the Holy Spirit just wanted me to do is to kind of go back and just make sure cuz brother brand say we don't we don't want to go wild on this so in order not to go wild we got to put it back in scripture yes sir is that all right yes sir amen let's go to First Corinthians 14 now all I'm doing is just setting this up um for uh for God to do what he going to do but but but here's the thing by us knowing scripture and knowing the message it won't get out of control cuz you know we can go right back to the tapes y'all remember it was taught brother brother Jack read the quotes and he read the scriptures it was taught we know how to keep these things in order even when I'm not here right amen truth brother amen because when I'm not here God can still move and something might just start get taken off in church and now I'm going be uh watching the video I'm going be like Lord you waited till I was gone but no I'm going to be happy that God moving in the midst of the people but I I but but I got to set it just right so that even when I'm not here the church knows how to operate according to the word hallelujah amen let's let's look at 1 Corinthians 14 I'm going to start reading at verse 23 amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah all right look at this now um it says if therefore the whole church become together into one place and all speak with tongues and there coming those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that they are matad so so one thing that we're not trying to do is get everybody to do it cuz cuz Paul even asked question do all speak with tongues no everybody got a different gift everybody got something don't and don't be trying to covet somebody else gift don't no come on don't make this up now don't just come up with jiba no no we talk about God God has giving you the gift you use that gift that's right all right now amen amen amen amen so he say he says but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all amen it says and thus are The Seekers of this of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in God is in you of a truth now I have seen amen or I've heard testimonies of people coming maybe into a service or even you know like maybe uh uh somebody would call somebody on the phone say hey don't do what you getting ready to do the Lord telling me to tell you don't do what you getting ready to do like what you mean what the Lord told me to tell you don't do what you getting ready to do and sometime God might not say the whole thing right but but but but but the rest of the Tes like this person was get just getting ready to go kill somebody and they got stopped just like that because of a word of knowledge that came to him yes sir God can do things like this in our midst right amen he's still the same yesterday today and forever right he says he says uh uh verse uh uh 26 how is it then Brethren when ye come together every one of you haveth a song haveth a Doctrine haveth a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation and and and you know this is this is really really good there's a lot here and when we come to church everybody ain't going to have a song to sing hello we going and you actually got people out there that uh that that they might have had a s in their heart but today not your day somebody else on the schedule hello somebody right right this is what keep things in order sometimes amen you can be be burning with something hey I know what I'm talking about you burning with a special but we got some somebody else on the list today and don't you be scheming uh you you really want to sing today cuz the lord gave me something no no no no what you got to learn how to do is just kind of uh subject your gift I'm going to keep reading in a second but you got to learn how to subject your gift to other gifts now that's just in singing but you know even in speaking in tongues your gift got to be subject yes sir oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord we're going to read in a second just stay with me I'm I'm going to read it I'm going to read it but but but you got to learn and sometime God just kind of gets you to a spot preachers got to learn how to subject their gifts yes sir I'm burning with a message I can't wait to preach my me you just got to wait glory to God that's right amen you just got to wait but God God takes us through that in order kind of keep us humble yes sir let me keep reading let me keep reading I'm at verse 26 let all things be done unto edify it says if any man speaking an unknown tongue now this is this is this is where I say it's got to be subject watch this Let It Be by two or at the most by three and that by course let one interpret now let me just make sure we understand what what this is now and I'm going to read a quote in a second but if tongues go forth in the church now there's a there's a proper time when tongues are supposed to go forth and it's after the word is going for the tongues do not um Let me let me let me let me say it too the tongues don't go forth before the preaching Minister step up to preach and have you turn your turn scripture and then you go off in tongues no no that ain't the way it Go the tongues go forth after the preaching Hallelujah and here's the other thing that happens only two or three people so guess if you the forth just like I just gave an example that everybody can't sing guess what you the fourth one and you feel the spirit all over you getting ready to to to let you speak in Tong now you got to hold it this time right oh Church am I reading you the Bible yes sir and if any man speaking unknown tongue Let It Be by two or at the most yes sir by three and that by course let one interpret let's go on to verse 28 let's go on to verse 28 uh come on y'all I'm I'm I'm trying to teach come on I'm I'm reading some more now but if there be no interpreter let him keep silent in the church and let him speak to himself and to God now now what happens there and and the other thing now I didn't read it yet but uh but if if God anoints you amen to speak in tongues the other thing you're supposed to do is be pray that God will give you the interpretation and if God don't give you the interpretation Lord anoint somebody here to give the interpretation so if if if you don't get the interpretation now it didn't say that you didn't have a gift right that's right it didn't say you didn't have a gift it simply said just keep silent I mean just hold it God you didn't let nobody speak I'm going just hold this Lord and you might be feeling so anointed to speak in tongues again nope nope just hold it that's right to yourself and to God hello yes sir amen we cuz I'm I'm I'mma tell you another thing that I've seen in church sometimes you got people that are very free that have accepted their calling with the tongue part but then there's others that have not accepted their calling with the interpretation part and they are here we got to wait for everybody to kind of catch up all right I'm I'mma keep reading I'mma keep reading amen it says verse verse 29 let the prophet speak two or three and let the the other judge if anything be revealed to another that sth by let the first hold his peace for you may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be confident now watch this one watch this one and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets so when I when I when I spoke early about you know uh uh uh hear the minister coming out to preach the word and you can't interrupt him you can't do it during his sermon and you can't do it before his sermon but after his sermon is it's free Hallelujah now let's let me clarify that one too if he having an altar call yes sir you don't jump up and speak in tongues during the middle of an altar call God is cuz cuz the spirit of the prophet got to be subject to the prophet and who's the prophet the minister standing in the pool at the time is the prophet Hallelujah all right all right we just we going back to the word I'm telling you I'm saying these things because even if I'm not here and Gifts start taking off we need to know how they're supposed to be conducted yes sir amen cuz I'll be watching it according to the word all the word now I'm not saying that to buy nobody up I'm saying that to keep us in order amen amen how many would like to be in a church say in order we just we just bringing it back the Corinthians got things out of order we bringing it back in order Paul was dealing with a church that had things out of order yes sir amen amen hallelujah we trying to get it started and keep it in order yes sir true all right let me keep going let me keep going all right verse 30 uh uh 33 for God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the Saints now watch verse 34 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also sayith the law now let's just make sure we got this clear now this scriptures Paul is not telling the sisters that they can't speak in tongues that's not what Paul is saying here what Paul is referring to here is a woman preaching yes sir Hallelujah you got to bring that back in order too because sisters are not supposed to preach the gospel but as far as operating in gifts yes the sisters can have all nine spiritual gifts they can operate in that in that area amen amen yeah a sister can have a gift of healing yes sir amen I get very shallow on that I'm might have to go back to the quote remember the sister uhhuh that was in the meeting that's right and she saw a little baby yes sir with a mother and and and she said I'mma just get the mother my seat and and and she said I couldn't get that burden off of me God kept telling me pray for the baby she said no no no brother Brandon going to pray for the baby and brother brand say like like that had anything to do with it what does it then I'm pray but no God put that burden on that sister to pray for he say he say her being a mother would be able to understand what the other mother going through that's right they give her a burden for so so she prayed for the baby when and sat down in the balcony come on through the prayer line the Mama come the baby brother man him say the baby has already been healed yes sir and then told him exactly what had happened the other sister up there pray for your baby and God healed the baby right there right brother bradam didn't have to pray because God had already worked the healing so gift of healing which is a gift of the spirit a sister can have that gift TR brother amen amen I'm I'm reading on I'm reading on I want to make sure that we got this covered verse uh 35 and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church now he's not talking about speaking in tongues he's talking about preaching okay it's a shame for a woman to to to to speaking church now I know a lot of churches don't got away from this They Don't Preach this no more they act like this scripture a't even in the Bible and actually they got new Bibles nowadays where they taking things like this out of the Bible look God God God has a order God has a plan God has a place for all of us we just need to get in God's plan and just do it the way he said do it amen this ain't this ain't my this ain't I ain't make this up I I'm reading it from the Bible and this was written before I was born amen amen and my job is to make sure that we stay in line with what God wrote in the scripture and this is not Paul didn't write this because he hated women that's a lie from the pits of hell if you look in look in the scripture Paul went to certain cities it was women that was actually uh uh uh letting them stay with them and and you know and just and taking care of he's y'all y'all be a blessing to these sisters y'all do this I mean Paul Paul it wasn't that he hated women he had a mama praise God right but it wasn't that they they they said the same thing about brother brand because he hate women no no no no no no no that that ain't that he just trying to make sure everybody is aligned according to the word all right now let me go on let me go on he says what came the word of God out from you or came it in came it in uh came it unto you only he says if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord we're not getting away from this watch this now he says but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant that's right and watch him go right back to the gifts watch this watch this wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and there it is and forbid not so he wasn't talking about speaking in tongues to the sisters cuz he just sit right here forbid not to speak with tongues hello somebody let all things be done decently and in order I I I think we laid it out just right let me let me give you a little statement here from pergami and church age I I told you and now I'm going I'm going to prove to you that according to the message uh I I just made a couple statements and I'm going to prove it to you this one quote one of those statements is that the proper time in order for gifts to go forth like that the other thing I'm going to prove to you is that a sister did this and she actually was not rebuked she was encouraged let's read let's read this out of pergan church age uh I me um brother brandham is is making a statement now I want you to just notice what he what he what he says he says in the second chapter of the Book of Revelation and the second Church the Third Church age began and notice he is getting ready to he's in the pull pit he's telling the church to turn to their their in in the scripture and when he tells the church to turn to the scripture a sister speaks in another tongue and brother random says pardon me so he pauses and so when somebody speak in tongues we don't oh Lord when we don't all get all worked up when a tongue is going forth everybody gets quiet yes sir can I say this again young people that's not the time to go to the bathroom that's the time you got to hold it and you start praying Lord let me hold this Lord Tong come Lord Oh Lord let me hold this right here don't be moving around at that time right and brother Ram say pardon me he actually stopped reading the scripture and let this sister go forth in tongues now watch what happened there was if you listen to the tape you'll find that nothing came forth so what brother Brandon did when nothing came forth he started praying and this is his prayer Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven we ask you to be with us father and bless us and help us to be wise Master Builders listen to the prayer wise Master Builders in this hour of great distress among the people now he's saying a lot in this prayer because he realizes that the people are just so mixed up and messed up from some of the teaching that he has to be a wise Master he's not trying to amen break this lady Spirit yes sir sir amen God help me to be a wise master builder that's right not a a demolition yeah I'm bringing in a bulldozzer to demolish this no I want to be a wise master builder watch it now watch it watch it a wise Master build in this hour of great distress among the people when confusion and all is being carried on help us to be our best Lord amen to be your servants through Christ's name amen now I said that first that you might know did you notice the interpretation didn't come to the word now watch this he says our sister was anointed with the Holy Spirit no doubt but she had but she had gave the message after the word had been come into that means he was actually telling the church turn to the scripture we getting ready to open up the word she gave the tongues at the wrong time her timing was wrong her gift was right yes sir her timing was wrong right yes sir we we we're not going to demolish the sister's gift because she missed her timing right right right right right amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah look look at look at what he say here now he says he says uh did you notice interpretation didn't come to the word our sister was anointed with the Holy Spirit no doubt but she had gave the message after the word had been come into you see it just a little bit from the order of the thing now that was all right sister dear encouragement encouragement and just so in love and I mean I mean just just my he not trying to tear down not trying to break a spirit he says uh that was all right sister dear ever Who You Are Holy Spirit upon you oh it's so hard to hold it like that I know oh when you say uh when when you when you be saying something other and see but it was all right but but you probably felt felt it even before that we started see you see and that's the reason see it comes back when the spirit's working the spirits of the prophesy are subject to the prophets you see that's you that he telling and he just took her right back to the word right to 1 Corinthians 14 now look at this he says now maybe maybe the Holy Spirit anoints you again I hope he does just after the services of made the Holy Spirit come back on you again look he says he says and and watch this oh my if it's done at the right time come on yes sir this what the prophet said he said he said he says and you watch the interpretation come see because it should be right straight in order then you see but we're just approaching the word you see in here so now that was really of God it really was I believe it and I feel it with all my heart because I felt the back come to it you see but the Holy Spirit it wasn't time he's got a message to the sister for the church but but but but here here's where he's working his message now you see he won't confuse himself God is not the author of confusion he won't confuse himself he puts all things in order I'm sure everyone understands you see that's just right now notice what he said there he says if we would do this thing in order he says watch the interpretation come this is what I'm going to ask the church to do this cuz we land this out according to the word and you you all are listening you know and you're sitting here listening and hearing hearing this go through the series if God anoints somebody with tongues I want everybody in here just start praying God you told us to watch if we done these things in order you said watch that the interpretation will come God we're sitting here please anoint somebody to give them that interpretation because we know that we not trying to do this in chaos but we want what your word said we're supposed to have so everybody Lord just Lord you said watch that the interpretation come Lord we're waiting on you we're watching for you father and we're not going to try to make this happen but whoever you anoint let them let somebody just yield to what you're trying to do in here oh I know I know I know I know I know I know this is right I know this is right brother brandom he didn't he let me put it he corrected the sister but he did it in so much love yeah that she'd be wanting to use her gift again in that church but we a got churches nowaday somebody do something just the slightest little thing they miss it they off my God we just whack them and don't want them get up we don't want you to get out now and we done we done put the we done pin the gifts down so low that we don't even see anything manifested in our midst anymore you go to a Pentecostal Church they just stay all over the place with it and we got more than what they have I said we have more than what they have we got the truth that has been restored to us and and we ought to see God manifest himself to right the Pentecostals are to be able to come in our midst and see how it's done correctly exactly right amen amen amen hallelujah all right let me go on I I thank God for this okay uh I'm I'm going to back to Restoration of the Bri tree and I want to I want to just hit a few things here um brother brandom makes a statement he says and then at Pentecost where the church for the bride tree he set in order on Pentecost remember he planted a tree at Pentecost it says um then at Pentecost where the church for the Bri tree he set in order on Pentecost the tree that was predestinated to bring forth his fruit in the season now going fine the fruits is being done just fine it bloomed out on the day of Pentecost so the tree was planted and it bloomed out on the day of Pentecost he says let's see what happened on the day of Pentecost uh uh Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also they heal the sick now on the day let's see how it started on the day of Pentecost a few days after the resurrection 50 days after Easter there come a rushing Mighty Wind Out of Heaven now uh I'm skipping down to paragraph 179 but I want to just kind of focus our attention on this what did Pentecost have for us to be restored back to it uh the question is what did Pentecost have for us to be restored back to and I'm talking about the day of Pentecost what did the day of Pentecost have amen for us to be restored back to it let's read this brother random says and here they come acting like drunk people the Bible said they did they said these men are full of new wine but Peter the spokesman the minister in in in the group stood up and said these are not full of new wine as you suppos sing is just the third hour of the day but this is that glory to God now now when when when Peter put the experience back in the scripture can I tell you something when you begin to see God move we're taking it right back to the same scripture that Peter took it to right back to Joel because that was a promise for this day look at it now it says and it shall come to pass in the last days amen saith God I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and I'll show wonders in the heaven now now look at that scripture look at that scripture your sons and daughters will prophesy now we also read in 1 Corinthians that a sister was supposed to speak well what do it not preach but it didn't say she wouldn't prophesy amen all right says and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved brother brand say now Peter preached on P cost after the same Prophet that I'm preaching today and talk about Joel today about planting this tree and that's where he planted it oh it's done fine they went out and had spiritual gifts they healed the sick they preached they was throw in jail they were willing to suffer for the word's sake now my question is what did Pentecost the day of Pentecost have for us to be restored back to it here are some things that Pentecost had brother brandham just made a comment here says because they were thrown in jail they prayed for boldness to speak the word and that signs and wonders would be done by the name of the holy Child Jesus right and after they prayed in the book of Acts said the place was shaken we are praying church right yes sir amen the place was shaken Paul and Silas prayed in the Philippian jail and God shook the foundations with an earthquake right Peter was delivered by an Angel when he was placed in jail so there after Pentecost yeah they had a lot of Believers that was thrown in jail but God shook the place while they were in jail am some of the other things that we found that Pentecost had that we need to be restored back to one of the things that Pentecost had was Oneness yes sir that's it oness amen and and the Bible actually said that they were in one mind and in one Accord and other thing that we've learned in this journey is that the Palmer worm he ate the Brotherly Love from from the church amen but when this comes back it brings the brotherly love right back in so it brings us Oneness Pentecost had Oneness yes sir we're going to have the same thing that's why it's been preached like this amen the other thing they had was a was a sudden sound like a mighty Russian wind now I want you to get this because it was a sudden sound nobody knew when it was coming M but it came and and and now I'm not going to say we're going to sit here and a wind going to come no no no but I will tell you this it going to be sudden and you you ain't going to know when it's going to come but when it does come you already have been taught to know what to expect and what to do when it does come right it's okay we all worshiping and praising God but if you hear somebody start speaking in tongues you know what you do let your praise go down just just just go down don't start yelling and screaming over the tongues God trying to speak to us yes sir we don't want confusion but let your praise go down oh and now you start turning your praise to a prayer God speak give somebody interpretation Lord we want to hear what you're trying to say to us father and then you know and then next thing know somebody else that got the gift they take off Lord give give us what you're trying to say next person they have a gift they take off Lord give us what you're trying to say then the next person they got they they got the gift and they take off no no no don't take off you're the fourth one you're the fourth one you're the fourth one that's right no no no no no no no you hold it now you start talking to yourself and God is that what I just read in the scripture hey Church no and you can no no no no no uhuh hey hey hey hey you you must not have been counting we were I'm keeping it in the word yes sir it won't go into confusion if we do things by a word they had Oneness they had it was a sudden sound like a a Russian Mighty Wind that came into the midst of the people other thing that I like that that Pentecost had now this one is this one this one's really good Clover tongues of fire sat on each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost now I don't know on the dead p and because if everybody that was in the room wanted to be there I don't know I assume they want to be there and I don't know somebody might a 10 days up here it's time to go brother I mean ain't nothing happened they somebody's probably ready to leave I'm sure somebody's ready to cuz these people are just like us but I want to say this you might come to church one day and you were not expecting to come to church and and have an encounter like this amen hallelujah but I'm telling you that when we're all in one place and one mind and one Accord suddenly things happen amen and and just by you be in here yes amen a clothing tongue of fire which actually look like a a tongue a clothing tug of fire come sit on you and when it's sitting on you it's not just sitting on you to be sitting on you it's going to change you from the inside out Hallelujah I like this this part they were all F oh glory to glory glory to glory to glory to glory everybody in the upper room was filled with the Holy Ghost my expectation Hallelujah my expectation everybody in the house would be partakers of this he might say brother Jack my life ain't up to par my life ain't up to par I I I've seen God give some people some pardons he he know your life ain't up to par there was a time that the children of Israel they really shouldn't have been offering sacrifices they were trying to uh uh do something there for the temple and and Hezekiah prayed a prayer I'm going to pray it right now Hezekiah prayed a prayer he said Lord because they say say Hezekiah we not ready for this we got to we not we you know our lives are not where it should be we not ready to do what we're supposed to do we need some time say he said no no no we got to do this sacrifice right now he so he prayed said Lord pardon the people hallelujah hallelujah and this the the tap the tape this week is pardon so I'm praying the same prayer that hezeki Lord par pardon the people you know what they did last night you know what they did yesterday pardon the people Jesus Hallelujah don't don't let their sin stop what you get ready to doing here but and I pray that while they here don't let them leave and go back in sin they in the right place at the right time some of some of us just need a little bit more strength from God to overcome the devil done through in our life and let me tell you God got power the the Holy Ghost is what gives you power to live right the Holy Ghost is what gives you power to talk right the Holy Ghost gives you power to walk right exactly right brother amen that's right the scripture say after the Holy Ghost had come upon them they received power yes amen they were all filled they were all filled with the Holy ghost the Bible says that they spoke in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance these are the things that Pentecost had that we're looking for and here's the other thing I want to talk about in this miracle Pentecost when they spoke in uh in unknown tongues the miracle is that they the people understood them in their native language right right and I said this we we got multiple languages represented in this church English is a native language Creole is a native language Spanish is a native language shaa is a native language Africans is a native language TW is a native language so God can do the same thing that he did at Pentecost right here in this midst that's the truth brother amen one of y'all take off and speaking in shonah don't even know what you speaking in Shon and then brother Simba sister Ruth have to tell you no that was straight Shona sir you speaking twe don't even know it's twe and brother Quake we have to tell you that's twe Hallelujah right glory to God look look look look look look look look at what I'm GNA give you a couple quotes here I want to be certain of God brother brandom brother brandom went through this in his in his own Ministry he he was his native language was English but he was praying for a sister she heard him in Spanish look at this this is the miracle of Pentecost says well I asked her a few questions and she began answering me through The Interpreter then all of a sudden the vision come and I said I see before me a little girl with little platted hair hanging down her back she's sitting by an old fireplace eating yellow corn from a cob that's been took from a kettle which hangs over the fireplace and watch this now and she's eaten too much of it too much corn she eat too much of it amen she falls violently ill and she's taken to the bed by her mother and is thrown into epilepsy and then the vision left and little girl turned to The Interpreter and said in Spanish I thought he couldn't speak Spanish and The Interpreter said you spoke English did you not brother brandom I said I did he said well she said you spoke Spanish I said stop the recorders all along the road and they stopped and we played it back and every word was English [Music] Hallelujah and then we had to repeat what I we had her to repeat what I said and as long as the vision was going on she heard every word in English she speaks Spanish and only speak Spanish but she heard while brother Brown speaking in English underneath the vision your your old men of dream Visions young men you know see visions and old men dream dreams I mean come on y'all this is the scripture yes right here brother Bram is is under vision and in the vision a not just I'm just I'm just telling you it's powerful yes sir in the vision it broke the language barriers am hallu amen yes sir do do we get that it actually when they got into the spirit and brother brandom began to call out what this young girl's condition was it broke the language barriers we can get into a high real yes sir oh my my my my the Holy Ghost got to take us there he says this he says uh every word in English how he says why how hear ye how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born God is still God now when I begin to say words within myself she didn't understand that at all but the Holy Spirit speaking English was interpreted to her in Spanish God is good God is a good god and all robber places it certainly is true so that was the exact same thing that happened on the day of Pentecost cuz when they spoke in tongues the all these people around heard them like you know what how we hear these people in our own native languages how do we hear that that was the miracle of Pentecost God that's what we want to see you do right here in our midst Lord yes Lord amen amen now this is one where God and let me let me I'm I'm read you another quote cuz I don't want us to put God in the box the box is not I'm going speak in English and they going to hear me in their language God can do that but that's not the Box you know what God could actually anoint you to speak they language am amen let's read another one questions and answers now look at this one now I want y'all to get this one I read you a quote earlier Jesus himself spoke in tongues while he was dying on the cross so don't tell us tongues not for the church and I and I said this and I'll say it again tongues has been the thing that's been beat up so much that I got to keep saying it in order to try to no no that's part of one of the gifts that God had on this tree and we got we want to see it all y'all everything but here brother brandom we're going to see in this quote brother brandom himself spoke in tongues amen look at this now it says here some time ago the last time I spoke with tongues I'm I'mma just I'mma just pause just for a second I I want my own testimony I want to be able to tell somebody here some time ago the last time I spoke with tongues hello I mean some of us ain't had that teston in a long time we don't we don't know the last time we spoke in tongues we the last time we shouted we don't know the last time we danced in the spirit we don't know nothing God we just want we want God to be so free in this place that we can have our own personal testimonies amen here's some time ago the last time I spoke with tongues as I can remember it's been about 3 or 4 years ago I was in Illinois and Billy come after me for to go uh for the prayer line up at Zion City and I was burden on my heart and I knelt down and started to pray now notice how this came on him he's got a burden in his heart and he gets down to pray and sometime God will just do that just give you a burd you don't even know why and there's times that I I'll wake up and I cannot go back to sleep I know anytime that cuz I'm a hard sleeper y'all I'm a hard [Music] sleeper I don't mind it I need it when God wake me up I know it's God waking me up so I just go ahead and start praying and and if it don't let me go back to sleep fine I just I just start praying I don't know why I'm praying I just pray and and I'll tell you do the same thing God just wake up you can't back just go to praying just just start praying whoever come to your mind just start praying for them amen just start praying you don't know why God do that for you but here brother brandom got a burden he just start praying he just start he couldn't and sometimes when God give you real burden you can't even get released from it until you pray over it right true watch this now it says I was burden on my heart and I knelt down and started to pray and while I was praying I heard Billy coming up and knock at the door and I said Billy I can't go now and he went out there and he sat down and I was praying my heart so burdened I couldn't go to church like that and see usually sometimes he give me a vision uh show me something's going to happen but he didn't do it then and as I was just praying away in the room there and I heard something talking I quit praying I listen and there's somebody at the door it sounded like a foreign language like somebody or low Dutch or something it was so fast chattery I listened again I thought well somebody's come up there talking to that that Motel Mot tell man in German maybe he'll answer him back and I just quit praying so now he's praying but he can still hear what's going on around him right hallelujah amen amen you I'm I'm saying this because I'm taking this right back to what I said originally if three people speak in tongues the fourth one don't do it and you heard what just happened in the church don't oh I was just so caught up that no you was that caught up that you broke the word of God amen you don't get that caught up that you break the word cuz the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets all right and said he said now now look brother Brandon brother brand say sound like a foreign language like German Little Dutch says or something was so so fast and chatter I listen again I thought well somebody come up there talking to that Motel man in German maybe he'll answer him back and I just quit praying leaning over a chair like this listening listening listening and he just kept on talking now brother the random listening but they keep hearing something talking watch this now I thought well wonder why there's somebody don't answer back now all this going on in his mind watch this now and I listen I thought well now isn't that strange I'm I'm I'm beat y'all to the punch he was listening and he was the one actually doing the talking he was the one Speaking In Tong didn't even realize he was doing it oh help me Lord Jesus then he was listening he didn't even realize he was in that channel like that I want some Lord pass me some pie pass me some of this there was a weight scales down the road and I heard that fell down there hollering drive off you know drive on I turned around looked out that way and I did I felt out of my mouth come to find out I was the one doing the talking it was me and I just kept real still now remember he had this bird and all he did was just get down in prayer and somehow he called into this channel this was minutes y'all this was not no two-hour prayer this was minutes he was already in this Channel and he's listening and he hear another another conversation going on he don't even realize he's the one interceding on behalf of somebody else and doing it in their language look just just kept real still not knowing one thing I had no more control of what I was saying than nothing see this is this is this is I I've been yeah I've been wanting to bring this one for weeks I told y'all when brother Smiley was there at sister uh my bab's house we went to pray me brother Troy and and brother Smiley and brother quu and I mean brother Smiley lost control he he he was sitting there trying to hold it trying to hold it trying to hold it and and the Holy Spirit just took off in tongues amen there uh and and and while while we were getting ready to pray and and you know when God does something like that that's not a time to well we want an interpretation that was a different setting yeah yeah in in the church when we all together yes the interpretation but if you at home and somebody take off and tongu don't be sitting there we want an interpretation no just flow with what God is doing at the moment Hallelujah Church flow with what God is doing we just flow with it we just we we felt the presence of the Lord and and I and I I like the fact that brother Brandon Mak this I had no more control I'm going tell y'all something we've had too much control we've had too much control and this is why we don't see God doing what he wants to do he planted a tree and he going to get fruit off his tree and you know when it's going to come forth in his season it's his fruit coming forth in his season and it's the season that when the prophet is bringing these truths to us I'm telling you the word has been restored yes sir here we go let's let me just finish this I was one doing the talk and it was me and I just kept real still not knowing not one thing and I had no more control of what I was saying than nothing not not one thing I was saying not a thing my mouth was moving I was speaking some kind of language I just held real still after a while it quit and when it quit oh my I felt like I could scream out just so happy I don't he went from from having this great burden to not being so happy says I don't know why but the burden all left me he says so I went on to the church then called Billy I got to the church Mr bam was the manager of the meeting and he'd been singing waiting I was I was over a half hour late and I told him that uh that I was just late and he he he's seen I've been weeping he said what's the matter I said nothing and I went on in just about 10 minutes a woman come in at the back of the auditorium and she was about to take the the place back there and and when we checked up with the woman to find out she was on her Road Twin Cities St L St Paul in Minneapolis somewhere one of those cities uh one of those and she was so bad with TB to the ambulance would not dare to bring her her lungs were in such a condition uh just just just gel and and so a couple of Brethren got an old Chevrolet car and took the back seat out and fixed her a c in there some way this just remind me of the brothers uh with a cop bringing their friend to Jesus yes sir amen glory to God they were bringing that man to Jesus got there to the house and the house was full of people and that man said y'all ain't bring me all the way here for me not to be able to get inside the house and and get get a piece of this pass me some pie amen yes sir he told him go up to the roof and tear this roof off and drop me down into the presence of God and that man received his healing the service was interrupted that man got his healing from Jesus sir amen look at this it says um uh they they they they Brethren got an old chevrol car and took the back seat out and fixed her cotton there some way and or bed and laid her on it and was bringing her to the uh to the meeting she wanted to come the doctor doctor had give her up and on the road over they they told her uh the least little bump she'd go into hemorage and uh and that's and she went and and she went into Hemorrhage and they had taken her out and laid her on a grass a plat and the Saints was standing there praying over the woman and uh and and every time she breathed just gurgling the blood would blow out of her mouth like that all of a sudden she was instantly healed and she jumped back back I mean she jumped up from there and started rejoicing come on to the church and there she was back there testifying back in the back I said what time was that and when she gave the time of what time it was it was the very same time that the speaking was going through me well what was it it was the Holy Spirit making intercessions for that woman there see what I mean hallu and let me tell tell you when he start speaking in this language that he didn't know he was actually speaking that lady's language l interceding in her language for her look look look look look this God did not die when the prophet died and I don't I'm I hate to say it like this but nobody going to be able to shake me from these things being in the church I I I believe brother brandom shared these testimonies with a purpose sir and and and and he show laid it out just right for us so all we got to do is just align ourselves according to this he he took us right back to what Paul said and we align ourselves to what the scripture said what this message is saying we're going to be just fine it won't get out of order it won't go into chaos because we know what to expect and I wouldn't have to get up here and rebuke people now you know you did too much I wouldn't have to do that because you already know what the word says and the spirit of the prophets subject to the prophets all I can tell you suddenly when this G to happen brother Jack and when it does you'll be ready I know you'll be ready Oh Glory to God I'mma stop there for the day I got more but I'mma stop let's pray father we are we're doing our best to be wise Master Builders taking what your Prophet said taking what the scripture has said and just trying to align the church with this Lord we're we're not going to manufacture anything but we'll certainly wait you God to manifest yourself this is your promise we read it right there in the Book of Joel Peter could pick it up and when he picked it up he could identify this is what the prophet Joel spake about Lord we pick up the same exact scripture because you said in the last days you would pour out your spirit Upon Our flesh so God we we know we know father what to look for we know what to say our hearts on and God the the uh uh uh This Promise is unto us and to our children those that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call and we don't know what day you'll you'll drop down in this church and God we pray that when you come because the fruit come forth and it's your fruit coming forth in the season that the prophet brings these truths it's your fruit coming forth we know that when that happens Lord God that whoever whosoever God is is in the house they will be impacted by what is happening even it wasn't just the people in in the upper room that were impacted but the people that were outside of the upper room were also impacted by what happened there we want our families to be impacted by what happens to us right here we want our neighbors to be impacted by what happens to us right here we want Lord our friends to be impacted by what happens to us our co-workers will be impacted by what happens to us right here God we're we're we're we're under expectation continue to elevate our faith Lord that we would just believe you for every promise that you've made to us every promise that you've made is J and amen and not one not one will fail father it's in Jesus name that we pray amen amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise I'm not sure if

what we received this morning a teaching on balance on how to yield and allow the spirit to move as he desires to move takes us all to be sensitive takes us to be in Oneness I was thinking his brother Jack was saying suddenly that when will come there was a message that brother brandom actually preached once and it was called Oneness of unity and in that sermon the wind came in the building you could hear it come in and then there was a voice that came out of that wind said I am God the literal voice of almighty God capture audio and the people was not in Oneness or God could have really did something at that time brother Brandon was trying to break through to get the people to realize that the Living God was here how much more can God come in here with his his presence just Sweeping in here coming across everybody that's in Oneness people that believe and not bucking against what the prophet is teaching God wants to move move in our midst he's not a mute God he has a lot to say we're all dealing with different things and sometime we need help sometimes we need a little more encouragement just to break through and overcome what we're going through and he needs yielded vessels
