and you know um some might have walked in this morning morning and my what is going on in here well all I can tell you is that you have to go back to last week's service if if you weren't here I I wasn't here last week but I make it my business that every service I'm not there I go and watch the service to make sure I'm in line with what's going on in church but last week we heard about an encore sir God did something special amen right here in our midst uh precious sister Tanya brother Troy gave a gave the testimony last week so if you didn't hear it um uh I'll let you go back and hear it amen and that way you'll understand where the church at but uh the Lord touched our sister Tanya let's put it that way amen amen amen and all I know is he does all things well amen so go go back if you don't if you haven't heard the service go back and listen to the service you can find it on Facebook you can find it on uh YouTube and you can also find it in Twitter or X amen uh but uh just listen to the service and you'll see why everybody feel the way that they feel amen amen amen amen I I I feel good myself praise God uh so I uh bring you greetings from uh brother Bel Church there in South Carolina also brother Armstrong's church we were there on Friday night not ministering just there attending the service and then we had to do the youth I'm sorry the um ministers meeting um on um morning and we used the topic of empowerment uh for adoption and you know had a wonderful time and then on Sunday morning there brother belon and uh we ministered on their Rock it's not like our Rock and and uh after the service um sister belon just was feeling the anointing and she just began to speak in tongues and and also just uh um you know just giv words of exhortation but a real mighty presence uh come into the sanctuary just as um a real mighty presence came into this Sanctuary amen uh but it was it was just a a joy after I finished watching the service on last Sunday here I I couldn't help but uh think to myself I'm so happy that God has allowed me Amen to be a part of spirit and Truth Tabernacle amen amen amen you know people people get bumper stickers and they put on their cars I love my church and and I say I would get a bumper sticker but I don't like put them bumper stickers on my cars don't mess up my car like that but if I had a little sign or something I put it in the window or something but I love my church amen I thank God for my church praise the Lord praise the Lord but while we were away amen I was just uh the sermon that brother chore brought on last Sunday I was just so blessed by it the transform uh transformative power of love and uh I just thought just the way he he brought it out and some of the quotes that he used uh he was talking about how this um uh man was in the hospital I believe it was and uh there was really no hope for him but the church had gathered at the hospital and began to pray we don't do things like that no more but uh but but we need to right the church had gathered there began to pray and they I believe brother brandom showed up and the Lord didn't give brother brandom nothing they were looking for a vision God gave him nothing and then all of a sudden it change and and brother brandom say the reason that this man is going to walk out this hospital is because the love amongst the people their love has been demonstrated the love of the people touched the heart of God and brought healing to that man I tell you what that's that's some trans transformational power in love and the devil's job is to try to keep us divided amen but uh we got to fight that spirit and just stay in love with one another amen amen praise God so brother Troy thank you so much for the sermon Amen on on Sunday that was that was a wonderful sermon and then um Wednesday night um I brother brother Mark came and uh he he said it's time to fight [Applause] and and I was um at the time um at wedding rehearsal for a wedding there in uh in in New York that I that we attended uh brother Gideon and sister Olivia got married and um and I when I saw the title I said I got to get I got I got to listen to this and I was I was just up trying to make sure I I got a chance to to listen listen to that because of you know uh the title meant a lot to me amen some sometime there's a message in the title and uh and then there's substance underneath that but brother Mark you did a wonderful job and uh we thank God for you certainly appreciate you praise God Amen but uh but I just I just thank the Lord for for all things uh and um and I I want to just ask the church just please continue you to uh keep me in prayer uh I have been trying to find just the uh the will of God and uh in a number of things and one of them is with um uh the invitations that I receive I was just listening to a tape here um brother Brandon say he had 1,000 invitations and there ain't no way he can do all of them and he says he just needed the Lord to just give them Direction on where you want me to go what you want me to do and and I don't have a thousand but but I do get a lot as a pastor and uh and and and I I'm grateful for it but I I want to find the balance in making sure that um spirit and Truth is not neglected amen so y'all please keep me in prayer amen and I was I was very happy just to see that even though the pastor not here the Holy Ghost was present and and that that meant more to me than anything right and Cu uh it just I just like seeing I like seeing God I like seeing God this is I have to confess this is his church it's not mine amen this church belong to the Lord I I got my part that I play but this is God's church amen and he's dealing with his people in his own special way so I just I just like being a part of it that's all so I thank God but y'all keep me in prayer amen as the Lord would just direct us amen um so I got a a a a a a Sunday school lesson this morning if I can just call it that way I got one little scripture uh brother Mark the their last two sermons I have to say have been going into a certain direction you mentioned a scripture in the sermon before on U be still and uh that scripture was a scripture I had been meditating on and waiting to preach on and then you came and uh you preach it's time to fight uh there's a uh uh I think you read Ecclesiastes 3 uh there's a time and season for everything and uh there's a time of war and there's a time of peace and praise God I believe we in a time of War amen and you can look at it in the in the in the natural there's a there's Wars going on but what about in a spiritual amen there should be a war going on we we got to recognize and like brother Solomon said we not on a picnic right now we'll do that tomorrow but in here is war and if the devil got any of your family members praise God locked up and messed up and and and destroying their lives you ought to declare this means This Means War and you can't have my family you can't have my increase you can't have mine you can't have mine that that mean you can't have nothing that glory to God but this It This Means War so I want to uh take our topic today from a little scripture and our our thought today is I forgot to give it to y'all brothers I'm so sorry going on the offense amen going on the offense praise the Lord amen let's read a scripture just one verse musicians thank y'all so much specials appreciate the specials Amen brother Troy and sister Bernice amen we thank you all uh this is coming out of Matthew 11 and verse 12 praise God it's a very short scripture but we just want the Lord to have his way and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force amen let's have a word of prayer father we are grateful for the opportunity to gather here in the house of God uh we have certainly uh felt the presence of the Lord in this place and God how you are moving in the midst of your people uh something that uh triggered last Sunday and still carrying through today and and Lord we we can never have enough of a presence like this so we pray God that you would just have your way uh hide us all behind the cross that none of us would be seen but may Christ be on display we uh trust that the spirit of God would be pleased amen uh with all that happens here from this forward this this uh point forward thank you for uh the anointing and the in the in the worship the anointing amongst the musicians the song I mean the singers the congregation and God as we come to the most important part of the service the word of God May the anointing strike the thought that has been given uh and may you get Glory and Honor out of we take every spirit that is GI against the spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even right now and father may you have your way in this portion of the service in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated praise the Lord um you know the devil was fighting me over there I usually like to bring out my um my iPad to preach from on Sunday morning but for some reason this sermon um did not transfer over to my iPad I don't know why it didn't sink but God knows uh but it's okay amen uh we we we got back up amen going on the offense is our title today now man these brothers throughout the week have been firing off quotes powerful quotes and um uh brother brother Jerry put one out the other day about you know um and brother Solomon just uh uh quoted it how you know when we take God at his word that delivers a death stroke to the devil brother Solomon put out a quote a few few days ago and shows said something like uh because we're starting to recognize who we are as Sons and Daughters of God uh is causing the devil to get scared praise the name of the Lord and do you realize when the devil is is getting scared of you that the position has changed sir hallu there used to be a time where you was running from the devil but then when the position changes you begin to chase devils and the Bible declares that one will not run from a thousand come on somebody but the Bible declares that one of us will chase a thousand and if I could just get two praise God the math don't even add up to me but if two of us would stand together praise God then 10,000 I got one that'll stand with me will'll put 10,000 to a flight brother it's time to change po positions put the devil to a flight we tired of the devil holding down the Sons and Daughters of God praise God we're tired of seeing him buying the children of God it's time to put the devil to a flight yes sir glory to God I even stopped doing the math when it said one to put a th to a flight and two 10,000 I didn't know what three or four or five or six of us would do but I know this much if we we got everybody on the same page we put the devil out of business but you know we were we were listen I mean just fellowshipping around these quotes and you know the brothers just kind of putting it out there and I say my I could add that to the sermon I could add that to the sermon but I was just saying amen and then you know one of the responses that uh uh brother brother uh uh Solomon put out there he just put a word he just put one little word and when he put that word out there I said let me go get that quote so putting on the whole armor of God come on somebody let's look at this um this this this this this this quote here hallelujah yes all right brother the other day said he had a dream he seen a little bitty Old Devil standing out there that's all he is is a little bitty Old Devil now I'm going tell you something your responses to the little little bit devil is what gives him life your reactions to the little B devil is what make them get bigger but also your actions Amen to the to the to the little B Old Devil can actually put them smaller and smaller it depends on how you react to them come on Church glory to God so so this brother say he had a dream and and and and I I you know I I just one of the things I like about this is that people used to have dreams like this and it would encourage the church amen but but but we need to bring that gift back into the church too where people have dreams of defeating Devils glory to God he say he's seen a little bitty Old Devil standing out there and the little little devil was all jumping up and down he said the devil said boo and when the devil said boo the brother jump back all right now you had understand when I'm jumping back I'm in a defensive position come on somebody I'm I'm and see a defensive position I used to play cornerback some of y'all brothers know about football amen but but when you're in a defensive position your position's always like this it's always going back the only time the defense can go forward is when they intercept or get a fumble praise God but they always moving back always moving back but when the offense comes onto the field praise God it ain't no going back like this the offense goes forward always goes forward praise God and see when we're moving on the offense we not moving back no more we're going forward now come on Church amen when we're shifting positions he says uh he said boo and he jumped back every time he jump back he get little and the devil get bigger so every time you run from that devil the devil get bigger but you get smaller come on now now remember he was a small a little itty bitty devil but because he was jumping back he allowed the little itty bitty devil to become a big devil yeah right how many y'all done allowed that little itty bitty devil Amen to control certain areas of your life hey you can't control my finances you can't control my family you can't control nothing that belong to me it's time to fight brother it's time to fight that little bitty devil come on Church sh yes come on now he says he jump back every time he jump back he get little and the devil get bigger and every time he holla boo he jump back and the devil would get bigger and he know he had to fight him amen so he thought I got to find a chair or something brother give me something I'mma fight this devil I'm

we are and it's time to fight it's not time to run anymore it's time to fight thank you Lord Brother Brandon makes a statement in the message adoption we need to know who we are amen he says now this may choke you to death he says this may choke you to death he says but did you know that men that are sons of God in the message adoption men that are sons of God are amateur Gods yes sir men and women yes sir that are sons of God are amateur Gods sir it says how many ever know that how many knows that Jesus said so the the the Bible Jesus said didn't not your law say itself that you are gods and if you call them Gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were Gods because they had full domain over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his domain and Satan took it over look at this now but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God Romans 8 we're waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back now Watch What Happens what they do now when they come back they take it over again yes sir and that mean the devil not going to just give it up to you sir but you're going to have to do something in order to take it over again and this is why the scripture said the kingdom of God has suffered violence but the violent praise godu take it by force Lord glory to God let's go back into that Amen in a little bit but I just just just just just just just he said we're waiting they're waiting for the sons of God to come and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will and will and will take I like that brother sister I like that will take every Power that Satan got away from him yes sir belongs to him now now we seen our Lord do this yes sir our Lord amen uh during the time of his his crucifixion amen and uh brother brandom gives us a a better scene like when he went into the grave he actually went down into the pits of Hell amen and he described these three different regions down there right you know region of loss and Hell itself and you know there was one other I can't think of the name of it right now but but it described three different regions but when when Jesus went down there he didn't go and ask the devil for no keys he took the keys of death hell and the grave sir so so when I realized that these keys are in Jesus hands anything that ever happened even when it comes to death it's not the devil that's why that's why the prophet could tell us that death was just a buggy yes sir come on somebody amen it was just a buggy amen a tool in the hands of God to pull the believer right into the presence of his maker yes sir amen so we don't even give amen we don't even give the credit to the devil even in death we look the devil in the eye like Paul all de death where is your sting grave where is your Victory because we know who owns and who conquer death Hell In The Grave Hall you got the keys to it and he took those keys yes sir brother brandom say he he he took them from him then he gave Satan a kick man can you imagine that somebody coming into your house taking the keys to your house but that's the god that we serve that's that's who that's who our savior is he took it from the devil we taking it from the devil we taking it back we taking it back glory to God glory to God let me go on here amen uh this is out of the sermon my angel shall go before thee glory to God I just like dropping some of these things in we we're going on the offense now I I want to just just mention to you what this looks like there's a couple things when you're go on an offense that you that you're going to do one is you're going to use the word of God to fight the devil and let me tell you something you don't need no Supernatural power to fight the devil brother brandom told us that Jesus himself used it is written Amen in order to defeat the Devil with those three wild attacks that Satan gave him so we got to pick up amen pick up the word again and start using the word only quote the word in your circumstance only quote the word over your body only quote the word over your family yes sir come on somebody only quote the word quote the word over your finances when when you know you're a faithful tith payer ain't no don't you don't you be up late at night worry about how this bill going to get paid no he gives his beloved sleep yes sir not when you're a faithful TI PA you don't worry about that I don't care if they put a notice on your door talking about they coming to take your house you can't take what God done gave me and tell that devil I don't know how but I know he'll make a way out of No Way say say this is this is my red seed but the God that I serve is already opened up a red sea he's proved it to me already amen so don't don't don't just take anything the devil throw you away open up your mouth and use the word the other thing that you're going to use is prayer and we're going to find out how powerful prayer is look at this amen and and the message my angel shall go before thee he says now long this journey he has promised to supply everything that we have need of anybody got a need this morning where God has promised you that he will supply all your needs not just some of them every need you have God Will Supply sir am he's promised to supply everything that we have need of Sir amen whatsoever you will ask the father come on in my name yes sir so when you pray in the name of Jesus come on don't get cute with your prayer in the name of your son no no no no that you got to use his name you can't use his title but you got to use his name if you want to get a check cash you're going to have to have names on the check not titles on the check in order for you to get your prayer answered you got to use the name and he tells us in his words whatsoever you ask the father in my name yes sir that will I do yes sir he says whatsoever things mark 11:24 whatsoever things you desire I need to know if you got some desires yes sir amen man I was yesterday and I might as well put this on record I I want to go and record CU we on the offense yes sir we a on the defense praise God I was you know I I mean um uh just a busy busy week last week and went to one wedding there on Thursday flew back home Friday cuz I had to do a wedding on yesterday and when I got there to that wedding I I I I saw uh brother Solomon and sister Naomi there you know uh doing doing their part doing what they do their business you know there and I said well praise the Lord I'm happy to happy to see it but other thing that that bothered me is like I know they got to leave here they got to go back home and then they got to drive all the way back up to be in service on the next morning and then I know they got other things that they got to do I said said Lord we we we we we we lord we need a house in West Palm Beach for the Johnson's I I I wonder if some people would go on the offense with me now I'm I'mma go out there a little step I'mma take a step I'mma take a step we got to go on the offense yes sir brother brother Solomon made a statement said brother we might have to put some fasting around this amen we got anybody that go on office now brother tro just preached hello about about a group of people that came together oh y'all ain't talking to me amen a group of people that came together and they begin to pray for a brother that was in the hospital and when they prayed for that brother in the hospital God Amen it touched the heart of God till it caused that man to walk out the hospital based on the love that the people had yes sir now I know y'all got a picnic tomorrow and I know y'all want to eat y'all ribs and y'all chicken and I ain't going to call for a fast tomorrow but what about Tuesday can we fast till 12:00 some 3:00 for others 6:00 for others specifically for the Johnson's to get a house in West Palm Beach sir Hallelujah I wonder if we all go on the offense I wonder what God will [Music] [Music] do whatever we ask the father in Jesus name we can have brother random goes on says whatsoever things you desire and my desire is for them to have a house in West Palm Beach yes sir am that's what y'all desire is all right I don't want to be praying against y'all desire whatsoever things you desire When you pray now now when you fast put some praying with it now make sure you just take a little time and just just offer prayer and and when you pray put the scripture back in there God you said that what everything we desire when we pray yes sir God you said we could have it now and here's the thing Lord I'm not even coming for me this ain't for me God but but but but we need a house for our faithful song leader faithful musicians we need a house hallu look at what the prophet say now it says what the things you desire When you pray believe you receive it glory to God you shall have it now he gave us the strongest weapon that there is and all the world and that's prayer prayer is what changes things the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what power that is if the people could only realize that what is given right unto them anything glory to God God anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for God's words God's word is true I like that I like that here's another one here's another one there's some more to it now God's word that's why you got to know the word so you can use the word but God's word will defeat Satan come on Amen you don't need Supernatural power you need the word I want to encourage you read the Bible so you know the word of God you know what to stand on when the devil's saying boo to you that's right you know how to say boo back with a word yes God's word will defeat Satan anywhere any place anytime I like that I like that I like that cuz sometimes we find ourselves in some difficult places find ourselves amen with biopsis and pet scans come on somebody and you know the we we we just got this powerful testimony how God um did an encore for for sister uh Tanya and then here come the devil right behind that and attack sister Bernice but we want to just tell the devil God's word will defeat you anywhere any place any time Hallelujah so we expecting an encore and sister Bernice's life yes sir we ain't taking de feat nowhere praise God he says now when Jesus was here on Earth I believe he was well he was Immanuel God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself so all the great qualities of the father was in Christ Jesus the son when he was here on Earth all the father was all the father has was his and all the fine gifts that's in God and all that was was was in Christ but when he met Satan he never used any of those gifts he just uh he he just to be your example he brought it to where the very weakest of Christians he had the power right then to rebuke Satan and send him away but what what he did he never referred to his own to any of his power Satan said if thou be the Son of God there is always a question mark across God's word by Satan so J so so he said uh so now Jesus said it is written in the father's word man shall not live by bread alone he taken him up on the temple and and uh the top of the temple and said to to hold him to cast himself down he said it is written right back to the scripture then he taken sat Satan up to a mountain showed all the kingdoms of the world said I'll give it to you if you Bow Down and Worship me Jesus said it's written so constantly it's written it's written it's written that's right Hallelujah and this is this is this goes with what brother Jerry said when you can hit Satan with the scripture hell hello yes sir that's right brother Hallelujah when you can hit Satan with the scripture he's just as powerless as he can be we going on the offense we going to rise up and start using our weapon we're going to use the word of God and we're going to watch that little itty bitty devil get smaller and smaller and smaller he say boo we say boo back my God this theme for this year's restoration and when I first came out I'm going to the restoration of Bri tree when I first started the year off the Lord just gave that to me we started with this sermon restoration Bri tree and and in in that first sermon I said uh this is a year here that we'll go on the offense I mentioned something like that and and I said I had a I was just a little um in my heart I just didn't know which way to go with that first sermon do I preach uh the the the get back in step or do I preach going on the offense and I just made a few statements about going on the offense but the Lord just kind of saved it until now where we can actually preach it but I want to show you where I was getting that inspiration from out of restoration of the Bri tree praise God now look at this brother brandom just to uh reiterate some things that we've already learned but it's is there's there's there it's always good to uh reinforce it because I think sometimes it starts settling down in the people do y'all realize that ever since we took this theme on restoration that's what God been doing sir are y'all seeing it right in your midst yes sir I know I've been seeing it I I just I just been I've just been seeing a lot I was telling one sister say you know you know sis I was asking she had uh relocated from Miami back to S said do you realize you part of the restoration and and since her relocation me him would come to church a lot more frequently Hall you're part of the restoration sir sir and because she come it caus her sister to come you part of the restoration yes sir yes sir true we started Sunday School in this year hello and I had no idea that when Sunday school started that restoration was going to be coming kids and grandkids and do y'all I hope y'all getting to read between the lines in in people's Health on cuz he said I'll restore Health unto thee yes sir and God did he's been doing that we only 6 months in not even not even six months in what else is God going to do we we we we watched we watch coming here for for for for for communion feet washing our second one the first from church was packed I'm like where only God could do that second one just a special visitor showed up somebody we wern't even expecting but when they come in taking communion feet wash now you realize what you're doing right and and and and there's a restoration happening without people even knowing it and I'm going tell you something powerful things happen in quietness TR brother amen when the sun rose this morning did you hear it no but you sure felt this raise when you was walking from the parking lot into the church you a't have to hear the sunrise but something powerful happened this morning without you even hearing it and sometimes when the word of God is going forth and and the seed is being planted into the hearts of the people powerful things are happening without you even feeling it last weekend you got a little taste of it they say want to dry eye in the place tears everywhere see that that take me back to when I was a young lad in church and we would go around and do that in church and hug our brother and hug our sister and and and if we had something in between us we make that thing right let me also say this I was so apprecia to brother brother Solomon standing here and apologizing to brother Jimmy publicly some of us need to do that privately but he was willing to do that publicly what he's doing he's actually clearing out the amen clearing out anything that the devil could try to use against us but we used to do that we would go and just Slob on each other's shirts and dresses and blouses and I mean you you you you had to go put it in the cleaners but we really meant it from my heart brother I'm sorry sister I'm sorry I just don't want nothing to hinder amen the the the spirit of God in this place I don't want the devil to use me but I want God to use me but all that was part of the restoration you know a few weeks ago I was preaching on brotherly love being restored back in the church what you think came rushing in here on last Sunday amen what you but but but the seed had to be planted amen and now you see you see what's coming and God ain't finished like brother Mark said God ain't finished yet oh y'all ain't heard the gifts yet you might as well get ready cuz the gifts are going to come forth Hallelujah and you might be one that God [Music] uses get your life right keep your heart clean get the sin out your life God wants to use you some of y'all got the gift of tongues some of y'all got the gift of interpretation those gifts are here they ain't coming they here amen amen praise the Lord amen y'all just get ready get ready brother Randon makes a statement in the sermon the restoration of the Bride tree says to restore means to bring back I just told you things that have been lost they coming back but to restore means to bring back now you can't call it a restoration if nothing don't come back but if God gave us that thing for the year then we got to see restoration all around us Amen to restore means to bring back to restore a claim can be enforced now right to bring back to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and look at this now can wander around anywhere now y'all know this this the prophet telling the truth you keep up with people on social media they leave the message and can't find nowhere to settle their feet they in this church this month then they in that church the next month and then they they wander over here and then they wander over there can never find any satisfaction amen good God Almighty amen because the message brings you satisfaction yes right amen the the revealed word is what brings you to satisfaction amen right it says but they can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to who it really who really owns it amen or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time bring it back into its natural condition in order to do this now in order for the restoration to happen in order to do this we have a right to enforce let me go a little further with this cuz that word enforc y'all going y'all going to need to use that one that's that's got to become part of your your prayer oh my my I'm here to enforce my claim when I'm on my knees and praying I'm here to enforce my claim sir hallu hallelujah look at this now he says um uh uh we have a right to enforce it if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration enforce this right rightful condition of restoration that means if they're doing something that that God did not call them to do the devil got them out there doing that that's that's not where they belong the rightful conditions that they belong right here amen amen hallelujah oh my God watch it now watch it the rightful condition of restoration to restore he goes on like if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces enforces this person to restore this property back to his natural owner to his first estate enforcement now look at what he say he says oh what a text I like to have two days on that inforce and when I thought about I said now we going to end up getting two sermons out of this I'm going to let you know that I'm not going to get through all this today but but but this enforc me a lot now watch he says enforcement oh how what a what a text if I I'd just like to have two days on that inforce now I want to just give you real quick that word enforce it's to compel um uh compel observance or uh compel observance of or compliance with I mean we're going to compel observance of or compliance ience with and I'll just use an example when you when you you know in your house you set certain rules certain regulations one of those regulations we going to go to church in this house sir and I got to enforce it is my house we going to go to church in here ain't going to be no drinking that's right ain't GNA be no smoking not in here hello somebody exactly right brother you have to enforce certain claims in your own house and when when the children I don't care how old they are they could be 60 that's right in your house but if they in your house it's still going to be the same rules and you going to respect the rules of my house if you don't want to respect this house go get you won't pay you don't pay no mortgage you don't pay no rent you going to live by the rules of this house it's enforced like that sir ain't going to be no questions asked amen you if you break the rules you might find your stuff out on the side of the roads and the locks change so compel observance or compliance with that's inforce another one and they they use an example that the role of the police is to enforce the law amen now another definition they give in this word enforce it means to cause something to happen by necessity or by force to cause something to happen by necessity or by force and remember the scripture the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by brother and sister glory to God we you know that when you when you're taking something by force there is no no no compromise there is no no no no we're not we're not going to sit and talk this over no we ain't talking nothing over I I I'm claiming my right as a son and as a daughter of God and I'm enforcing my claim amen I'm taking it by force by necessity or Force Amen brother random goes on to say this in the message the restoration of rapture he says enforce then says uh we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is his law is a law and God in his word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right I like it to force these claims it's got to be of necessity you got to real this is of necessity I'm tired of this amen man amen amen I mean when shamard got the fight and he it was of necessity I'm tired of my family being hungry man I done work the field for for for the whole year and I've been doing this for years I get the field all and I been I be telling my wife we're g to get this crop we going to get this crop and and and all of a sudden when it come to fruition here come these Soldiers the Philistines sold take everything that I got Shing said no not this year he told his wife he told his wife no no no no and and you you got to get to y'all y'all use this y'all use this saying sometimes but you got to mean it not today Satan not today I mean when you get to using words like that your head go to shaking uhuh uhuh uhuh I am tired of of of this condition Shemar said no not today uhuh not this year y'all ain't doing it and and Shemar a have nothing the Bible say he had a ox gold just a little something just move the animals on ox goat man walked out there with an ox goat and here come these Philistine Soldiers with all their equipment beat down 600 of them sir I'm going tell you something there's an anointing that comes upon you when you ship positions when you when you stop operating in fear and jumping back but when you say boo back to the devil there's an anointing that comes upon you the Bible say if you just resist the devil he'll flee the devil start running if you just resist I remember my daddy told a little fell cuz this fell was trying to overcome cigarettes and my daddy had overcome it by the grace of God smoked for a number of years but but when he really came to Christ my daddy uh uh defeated the cigarette demon and uh and the little fellow was asking how did you overcome these cigarettes how did you do it my dad looked at him say now he says okay young man let me just share something with you say you know you you bigger than me he says but if I was standing here and you were standing there and I was I was trying to when he asked my dad a question I had never heard his testimony I wanted to hear how he overcome it you say you bigger than me say you stand there and I stand here say now with you being bigger than me you just walk over to me and just push me he says and most likely you probably pushed me down with you been bigger than me he says but if I could just put up just just a little resistance just a little resistance then you might not be able to push me over that easy and what we need to come up with is a strategy not to back up but just just plant yourself amen and once he push just push back a little bit and here's what the Bible say if you just and you ain't got to use all your strength don't don't don't hurt yourself just a little resistance if you just re resist the devil just a little just I'm not talking about like this just all that just just just a this or just a this just just a little something just just just if just a little that will cause the devil to take off running and the prophet told us when the weakest Christian hit their knees oh hell begin to shake yes thank you Lord that thing you going through have you prayed about it I'm toing about got on your knees and prayed about it this word is true yes it and all we got to do is just follow the word we'll see God manifest in our lives let me just keep reading here I want we we got to enforce some things upon Satan we have a privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us the next paragraph says God has a law and his word is a law and God this in in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back he has to do it he has to do it no choice he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and see this is where our power amen comes for us when we're on our knees go right down on our knees and say it's thus sayith the Lord he's got to give it up and that's all cuz the holy spirit is there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce is by the land for the land but the law of the spirit of God is is to force Satan man I tell you I like this the law the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal right rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon them take it by force church now this is where brother brandom gives us um this going on the offense this is where the inspiration comes from this next this next quote the and and and um what what had happened and I I'll just let me just let me I'm going just uh I won't read this one but what had happened in the next part of this quote he's talking about the story of uh brother Evans brother Evans was a brother he was very faithful he would drive roughly 750 miles one way to go to church now most of us and especially nowadays y'all y'all y'all y'all streaming brother Evans wasn't thinking about streaming brother Evans would get in his car with his family and drive 750 miles just to get in one Sunday morning service turn around and drive 750 miles to go back home so he can get to work and this man was doing this faithfully and and one time he comes to church he gets there and you can imagine the sacrifice this man made all his luggage in the car everything in the car and he get the church and out of all the cars in the parking lot the devil decide to take his car brother brother Evans you know a little distraught brother Brandon say now what he did is he went to the police to try to get the police to do something about it but they said you know what there there's a racket going on in this area and what people doing they stealing cars redoing the titles and doing all kind of stuff and and it's hard for us to find these cars now the police might not be able to get to it but brother Evans knew he had something higher than a police officer that he could go to and we can get this situation solved so the brothers was you know uh crying and and doing all kind of things and then finally they got to brother brandham say brother brandham you know brother Evans had his car stolen we just feel so sorry for the brother and and brother brandham said that what they did is that you know he just begin to to think about scripture even before he prayed he began to think on certain scriptures glory to God and you know uh uh let me just give you one of the scriptures that they was thinking on here my my my my one of them that that that just kind of came back to his mind was um if you abide in me uh John 15:7 put that up on the screen John 15:7 and this is one that that I want to give you since you're going on the offense sir glory to God glory to God you can't be wishy-washy in God and expect this scripture to work for you can I tell you another thing you can be wishy-washy with the revealed word of God with the message of the yah and expect these scriptures to work for youth amen hallelujah look at what the scripture say Jesus say this now if ye abide that mean I ain't going nowhere and some of y'all have proven that you ain't going no M nowhere no matter what people done you had to prove your testimony some of y'all say if if if if if if my mama don't go I'm going if my daddy don't go I'm going if my sister don't go I'm going if my brother don't go I'm going if my husband or wife don't go I'm going you have proving your testimony if you abide in me and here's the one now here's the other one my words my words and the only way you going to get to get the word in you got to eat the word you got to read the word you got to study the word praise the Lord I don't care if you can only if all you can do is read Proverbs or Psalms read that but get the word of God in you in the Book of Psalms it say Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against you just get the word in you right now I'm going tell you another thing what the prophet told us he said if you want to get closer to God what did he say he said read your Bible and pray every day now I'm I'm not going to add to it because that's what he said that's what he said and I believe that and I'mma say it in two ways that's what the prophet say that's what you should do if you want to get closer to God now I'mma take tell you another thing he didn't tell you to listen to his tapes but I think it' be good if you did amen read but read your Bible let me let me let me just please help me just bring that home I know some only listen to tapes and when they only listen to tapes they actually miss the understanding of the Bible okay let me let me let me break this down the message that we believe it came from here the only reason I believe this message because I can find it here if I couldn't find it in here I wouldn't be believing it but I I found it here yes sir Malachi 4 Revelation 10 St Luke 17 uh Matthew 11 is all over the Bible sir deuteron omy where is that in Deuteronomy Moses said the Lord your God going to raise up a prophet like unto me sir and brother Jack that's Christ it is but the Bible has duel manifestations and the same way God Called Moses out to deliver people from a desert he called a prophet out today to deliver people from a desert condition right right thank you Lord if you abide in me and my words abide in you now this is this is important you got to First abide in him and then his word got to be inside of you then and only then you shall ask what you will now I'm going to tell you why Jesus put it that way abide in me and my words abide in you if his word is abiding in you you won't ask anything outside of his will that's well how do you know his will his will is his word and if you don't know the word you don't know the will Lord if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you brother brandom took this scripture and prayed for a brother to receive his car back they got down on their knees father we come you told us if we abide in you and your word abide in us we can ask what we will and it'll be done unto us God we need brother Evans car back soon as he said amen a vision came and he saw the man a backslider had stole the man 's car he says your car going to be found I think in a city near Bowling Green you're going to get halfway halfway back here and it's going to be found over here it's going to have half a tank of gas but everything will be in it brother the way they went on the offense is when he went down on the knees yes sir cuz it's so much power I said there so much power when a Christian goes down on their the devil don't know what to do with you when you get to that position hell just begin to shake and you realize the devil be doing everything he can he wear you he wear your body out all throughout the day at work and all kind of other stuff all these other activities just where you at where you can't hit your knees but when you get there good God Almighty things begin to change brother Brandon went on the offense and they begin to cry out and he use that scripture if you abide on me my words abide on you you can ask what so he start asking for that brother's car and I just thought to myself I thought to myself you mean God is that concerned about your car you know you know your car depreciates your your car breaks down your car got all kind of problems and and eventually you get to a point where you just can't drive that car no more but God is concerned about it I mean he's so concerned that that he had a a man come up with an idea to build a car that you got he put the seats in a certain way and and certain uh uh things inside the car that he knew that you would enjoy the car was specifically designed just for you whatever car you want to drive if it's a Cadillac if it's a BMW whatever a a Chevy a Ford whatever car you want to drive it was designed specifically with you in mind right God allowed them to do that yes sir but if God will bring a man's car back if you abide in me my words abide in you yes Lord you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I I believe God actually has um I I I I say this he probably puts more value on things that are more eternal so if you got a loved one that has somehow wandered away it's time to go on the offense for your loved one when you hit your knees take take this scripture keep it up there the people need to see that scripture I if you ain't wrote nothing down today write this one down take a picture of it but this is what you want to pray God you told me yes sir if I was to abide in you and your words were to abide in me that I can ask what I will and you said oh my God my God ain't no maybe in there ain't no possibility no no it shall be done unto me amen I'm tired of the devil running rough shot in my family right I'm tired of seeing the devil just do whatever he want to do I I get tired of hearing some of the stories that they tell me I know amen I didn't raise them for that amen I ain't raised them for that God I I I'm looking for you to do something if you can change me then I know you can change them Hallelujah yes sir amen I released the Holy Ghost to go after my son I release the Holy Ghost go after my daughter I I release the Holy Ghost to change this situation if the Holy Ghost can go out the car then the Holy Ghost can bring back my loved ones and let me tell you something when they went on the offense it didn't take a week or two weeks or 3 weeks or a month or a year before that man got his car back the every same day they went down is the same day the car came back it's time to fight we going on the offense the devil has said boo but we saying it today boo back Hallelujah we laying claims on what is ours and everything God promised you you lay claims on him he's the Lord Our God that health all our diseases praise God he said he rebuked the devil and open up the windows of heaven and pour us out blessings where we had room not enough to receive whatever you need Hallelujah lay claims on it than you Lord this this is what going on the offense looks like this is what it looks like church well you know it's the will of the Lord and whatever no no no no no no no no no how no how long is it going to be like that on and I think sometime God want to see how we going to respond to things and what and what I see especially with a sickness in your body don't tell me that's the will of the Lord that that ain't the Bible ain't the Bible it it it's the will of the lord it's no no I read something different what I read is that it's his will for me to be in good health and no no no brother be poor be humble brother be humble brother be poor you know look brother I I got a quote for that being poor now you know it's more more the Christian people more the Christians are more poor people in scripture you know that but if you want to receive that walk in it for me what that Psalm say sister sister Brown what's your what's your scripture out of Psalms wealth wealth is that in the Bible wealth and riches shall be in my house it is his will for me to be in good health and prosper even as my soul prospers so my soul going to prosper based on what I'm eating at church but after I leave church in in in the in the nether Springs I'mma still prosper amen thank you Lord you think David had a and Solomon had kingdoms that didn't Prosper what about when we go to the new city have you seen some of the contents right of the new city you got to live down here like a peasant amen we don't have to do that church that ain't that ain't that that that that might be I'm going say like that that might be your will but that ain't God's will for you if you want more you can have more now now let me say another thing you ain't just going to speak more you got to get out there and work for more [Applause] right you get character through those things amen but your business can be blessed am we got entrepreneurs all over this place and and God the one gave you that business and we ain't going to let no devil come and try to take it from you let me let me let me wind down but I I remember brother you know um was sharing brother Ron ly sharing the testimony how he lord gave him a really really really really good business they're very prosperous and um and he was um he got into something some deal and uh end up getting into a major lawsuit when they were suing him and and this brother looked said ain't no way I can pay this lawsuit there ain't no way I can do this I don't know what to do about this I'm Lord but God gave him that business so he just going through and going back and forth to court and just realize the case that was against him like he just needed God to intervene somehow praying one day he goes to court and it's it was a big big court day while he at court his daughter's at home the phone run daughter picked up the phone and um she said God bless you said yeah God bless you sis um this brother Isaiah Brooks and I was calling um he said okay God bless you brother Brooks how you doing say you know sis I don't I don't know why I'm calling but last night I had a dream and uh in the dream I saw this man and this woman and they were really really uh distraught about some things they was going through and brother brandom came to me in the dream and he said uh that family look really discouraged don't he he said yeah he says okay uh when you wake up call this telephone number and tell them it's going to be all right brother brother Isaiah Brooks didn't know them people from nobody but in the dream he saw the the the the 10 digits wrote down the 10 digits and just by obedience called the telephone number he called and told the sister the dream told her brother brandom told me to tell you in the dream it's going to be all right and you see God had to do that that way way you got to understand things God had to use the prophet even in the dream because he knew Believers over here and Believers over there they had something in common right there so when he used that then it settled their spirit and and and and and and and the father and the mother come back home from court they oh my God we don't know what we're going to do the daughter had fixed up a nice meal my nice nice dinner and says uh Daddy sit down and and Mama just sit down and I said what you why you so what you going it was a rough St in court just sit down daddy you want here you want you want some tea with that Daddy you want this you want what are you doing Daddy just sit down and eat well Daddy start eating and enjoyed the meal and say now I need to tell y'all what happened today while y'all was in court told him about the dream that brother Isaiah had and uh and how the prophet told him call told him to call his number and it was their number you think they went back to court discourage when God moved Supernatural like that brother they went on the offense I'm telling when God begin to speak to your situation you ain't backing up no more no I don't know how I'm coming out of this but I know I'm coming out God done shoot it I'm coming out before you know it they they they went they won the case and did not lose the money that they could have lost now I don't know who the devil might be trying to fight in business or whatever it is but I'm here to tell you the devil is a liar and I'm I'm also here to tell you don't you be one crying like brother Mark told us they just crying I mean Israel just crying crying everywhere you turn around they crying and crying another cry stop that it's time to fight it it it's time to go on the offense and the way you do that is on your knee with the word of God you fight that devil think brother brother brother brother brother Solomon bust out you fight on y'all heard that this morning see how the Holy Ghost just kind of lining all these things up we're not here just having Church no no no we here enjoying the presence of the Lord but hear what God is saying to you and and and now

Jack was speaking said he played cornerback from the time I was little to the time I I graduated I played quarterback and as a quarterback you're never on a defense my first year playing little leag football they let me play defense after that they never allowed me again when you are a quarterback your main objective is to score you can't stop me your mindset is I don't care who you put in front of me I'm going to defeat this person cuz we have a goal and that is to finish amen my brothers used to tease me a lot because as a quarterback back and we master that triple option they said Mo ain't never going to pitch it he's always going to run it so they had to root for me but they without us cannot be made perfect until we finish so we got to March we got to press we got to fight we got to finish this race amen we got to get on the offense you cannot be stopped you're an invincible Army amen when you recognize who you are Satan's in trouble amen God Bless You Soldiers god bless you Hallelujah I'm so grateful I could be fighting with you amen God saw something in each one of you that he put you at the end right at Satan's Eden when Satan had mastered everything he had he had confidence that you would overcome amen let's bow our heads almighty god father we thank you for your visitation this morning Lord whenever you come on a scene it's never in vain father God you put your people on the office this day Lord Jesus the word was preached a mindset was created and then right here at the end of the service Lord you put your soldiers Lord the men of God that come and stand behind the sacred desk you allow them all to come forth and get on the offense to pray for your believing children Lord because of the needs and the afflictions that the enemy tries to put on your people but father God he can't stand before the weakest of us Lord Jesus you have given us some something to fight with so father as we go throughout this week May we as the Sons and Daughters of God recognize this is the hour for the manifestation of the sons of God lord you have given us your word to live by now we must speak oh Father we want to March forward according to your will according to your word so I pray almighty God that you would anoint every vessel Lord God to move forward in you oh Lord Jesus May Satan Lord not get the upper hand in any place oh Father I believe it one of the prophets Isaiah Ezekiel one of them said when we finally see Satan we'll look at him with narrow eyes and say is this the man this little bitty Old Devil is this the man that destroyed kingdoms overcame them but father God we are the ones that say boo and he gets smaller we are victorious Lord with the word father so may this word continually be in our our hearts in our minds as we meditate on it upon our lips Lord Jesus that Victory Lord may be won in Jesus Christ name we ask that you go before us as we leave this place Lord bring us back at the appointed time father bring energy and strength back to your servant restore it to him Lord Jesus we pray we thank you for this hour of restoration it's in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen amen God bless you you may have your seats and our brothers will come dis dismiss you at this time God bless you [Music]
