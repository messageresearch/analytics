[42:57] the decision to allow us to be able to
[43:00] get together he said church was
[43:01] essential I've been praying it well we
[43:03] want to see less cases in Florida then
[43:07] more cases and I think a lot of people
[43:09] love to prove that he was wrong but I
[43:11] say Lord working a miracle on this man's
[43:13] behalf and show him that because he
[43:14] opened the churches that things got
[43:17] better humble themselves and pray turn
[43:22] from their wicked ways then will I hear
[43:24] from heaven then I will heal the lane so
[43:28] we want to see the Word of God for feel
[43:30] amen underneath his leadership so we

[43:42] man here on the scripture reading for
[43:44] today but I pray that the Lord will just
[43:46] bless amen our journey amen
[43:49] thank you thank you sister Rachel a man
[43:52] praise the Lord praise the Lord I want
[43:56] to read from Acts chapter 7 on today and
[44:00] we'll start at verse 17 and then I'll
[44:05] let you be seated
[44:06] oh Jesus lord help us have your way a
[44:11] man here in this service acts 7 verse 17
[44:17] and it says but when the time of the
[44:21] promise true 9 which God had sworn to
[44:28] Abraham the peoples grew and multiplied
[44:31] in each so when the time of the promise
[44:33] drew 9 which God has sworn to Abraham
[44:36] the people
[44:38] and multiply in Egypt till another king
[44:42] arose which knew not Joseph the same
[44:46] dealt subtly with our kindred and evil
[44:50] and treated our father so that they cast
[44:52] out the young children to the end they
[44:55] might not live so there was a this is
[44:58] really a time of persecution that is
[45:01] happening there and in the days that
[45:04] Moses is actually coming to be born
[45:07] there's a time of persecution also we
[45:11] know that the same thing happened in the
[45:12] time of Jesus let's go honest verse 20
[45:14] says in which time Moses was born and
[45:17] was exceeding fair and nourished up in
[45:19] his father's house three months when he
[45:22] was cast out Pharaoh's daughter took him
[45:24] up and nourished him for her own son
[45:27] Moses was learned and all the wisdom of
[45:30] the Egyptians and was mighty in words
[45:32] and in deeds and when he was full forty
[45:38] years old it came into his heart to
[45:40] visit his brethren the children of
[45:43] Israel and seeing one of them suffer
[45:47] wrong he defended him and avenged him
[45:50] that was oppressed and smoke the
[45:52] Egyptian for he supposed his brethren
[45:55] would have understood how that God by
[45:57] his hand would deliver them but they
[46:00] understood it not and the next day he
[46:03] showed himself unto them as they strove
[46:05] and would have set them at one again
[46:08] saying Sergi a brother and why do you
[46:11] wrong one to another but he did but but
[46:15] he that did his neighbor wrong thrust
[46:17] him away saying who made the ruler and a
[46:20] judge over us
[46:22] wilt thou kill me as thou didst
[46:24] Egyptians yesterday the Egyptian
[46:28] yesterday then fled Moses at this saying
[46:32] and was a stranger in the land of Midian
[46:35] where he began two sons and when forty
[46:39] years were expired there appeared to him
[46:41] in the wilderness of Mount Sinai and
[46:44] Angel Lord and a flame of fire in a bush
[46:47] when Moses saw it they he
[46:50] under at the site and as he drew near to
[46:53] behold it the voice of the Lord came
[46:55] unto him saying I am the God of thy
[46:57] father the God of Abraham and the god of
[47:00] Isaac and the God of Jacob
[47:02] then Moses trembling and Durst not
[47:03] behold then said the Lord to him put off
[47:06] thy shoes from my feet for the place
[47:08] where thou standest is holy ground I
[47:11] have seen I have seen the affliction of
[47:14] my people which is in Egypt and I have
[47:17] heard their groaning and come down to
[47:20] deliver them and now come on
[47:23] and now come I will send thee into Egypt
[47:26] this Moses whom they refused saying who
[47:29] made the rule in a judge the same that
[47:32] God seemed to be a ruler and a deliverer
[47:34] by the hand of the angel which appeared
[47:37] to him in the bush my god let me just a
[47:41] couple of more verses you brought them
[47:42] out after that he had showed wonders and
[47:45] signs in the land of Egypt and in the
[47:46] Red Sea and in the wilderness 40 years
[47:49] this is that Moses which said unto the
[47:52] children Israel a prophet shall the Lord
[47:55] your God raise up unto you of your
[47:58] brethren like unto me him shall ye hear
[48:03] a man the Lord had a blessing to the
[48:06] reading of his word let's just bow and a
[48:08] brief word of Prayer father we thank you
[48:11] for the ability to read the Word of God
[48:15] thank you for being able to gather once
[48:17] more in the house of the Lord thank you
[48:20] for the time of service that you're
[48:22] given us though God and Lord as we just
[48:25] continue to pray for our governor Lord
[48:28] him just making the decision to allow
[48:29] churches to gather he said it was
[48:31] essential we pray God that it won't be
[48:34] any additional cases but Lord that
[48:36] things will change that even somebody
[48:38] might be at the brink of leaving here

[50:34] into division we'll use a different
[50:36] title for today the title for today will
[50:39] be peculiar bursts amen peculiar verse a
[50:43] man but we're still in that channel of
[50:47] stepping to the vision and I was so
[50:49] blessed by the sermon this morning
[50:51] because brother Troy walked right into
[50:52] that channel and everything he was
[50:54] saying this fit was just connecting
[50:55] right with with the with the inspiration
[50:57] that Lord gave us and I was just so
[50:59] really really blessed by that so we want
[51:02] to just kind of continue down that path
[51:03] and and just bear with me here as we
[51:06] just kind of look at this we're still
[51:08] trying to comfort you with the words of
[51:10] God
[51:10] all right here I want to just
[51:15] opened up with just a quick here from
[51:18] the profit out of the message why I
[51:19] speak a man we're talking about peculiar
[51:22] bursts peculiar bursts says Moses was
[51:27] born with a gift of faith a man great
[51:32] faith Moses had we see it after a while
[51:35] coming out in him and this is beautiful
[51:40] you know the thing of it is is that a
[51:43] lot of times we are born with specific
[51:45] gifts but it take a certain amount of
[51:48] trial and tribulation to cause those
[51:51] gifts to come out of us glory to God it
[51:54] it takes a little pressure a man
[51:57] front from the enemy and and actually
[51:59] the devil thinking he's squeezing you
[52:03] and and maybe gonna put you in a
[52:05] position where you about to give up or
[52:07] whatever but he doesn't realize when he
[52:08] squeezes you there's something else
[52:10] about to come out a man there there's a
[52:13] there's a gift there's an anointing
[52:14] there's a revelation there's an
[52:17] understanding there's a faith there's a
[52:19] it meant my boldness that will come out
[52:22] in the midst of your trial hallelujah as
[52:25] Christians were not afraid of trials
[52:27] glory you know when when Goliath was
[52:30] there faced him a man of children of
[52:32] Israel he could go for forty days just
[52:35] posting like crazy that's because he
[52:37] hadn't ran into the right one
[52:39] hallelujah it's time for the devil to
[52:41] run into the right one
[52:43] hey man and I claim that you are the
[52:47] right one hey man and it's only when
[52:51] David saw the pressure that the peoples
[52:54] under he said don't don't nobody need to
[52:56] be afraid anymore I will fight this
[52:58] Goliath if nobody else will go I will
[53:01] stand toe-to-toe with this guy my David
[53:04] was not speaking that to be arrogant
[53:07] David was speaking that because he said
[53:09] a God that delivered me from the lion
[53:13] and the God that delivered me from the
[53:15] bear is the same cover that will deliver
[53:18] me from
[53:19] this uncircumcised philistine holy amen
[53:23] we got to know who we are and where we
[53:26] stand and nothing will be able to stand
[53:28] before us blessed be the name of the
[53:31] Lord it takes pressure to pull these
[53:33] things out of us hey man so look at what
[53:36] he says here it says we see after a
[53:37] while coming out in him and he was born
[53:41] in a great family as we know how that
[53:43] his father and his mother and come from
[53:46] a family of Levi which the story here
[53:49] prevalences to this in the book of
[53:51] Exodus says so beautifully gives the
[53:54] life of this great character and he was
[53:56] one of the greatest characters of the
[53:58] Bible for he was strictly tight of the
[54:02] Lord Jesus he was born in a very odd
[54:05] birth like the Lord Jesus he was born in
[54:09] the time of persecution like the Lord
[54:12] Jesus he was born to be a deliverer like
[54:16] the Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah amen he
[54:20] says how he was he was he and of his
[54:23] parents away from the enemy like the
[54:27] Lord Jesus oh it's just blesses my heart
[54:31] i'ma keep reading but you know I was
[54:34] early this morning when we heard the
[54:36] sermon there our brother Troy went back
[54:39] to Psalm 27 and and he finished up on
[54:42] that last verse because brother Brandon
[54:44] preached a raptor message from the book
[54:45] from some Psalm 27 which was very I
[54:48] would say very unique for him to take
[54:51] that angle but in verse 5 of Psalm 27
[54:53] verse 5 and and and I want you to I want
[54:56] you to catch this because I think it
[54:57] just fits real closely
[54:58] Moses was hit a man from that from the
[55:03] enemy
[55:04] Jesus was hit from the enemy can I tell
[55:08] you what's gonna happen to you you are
[55:10] also going to be heat from the enemy hey
[55:14] man even if they tell you to go on
[55:17] lockdown they don't realize they helping
[55:19] you out
[55:20] you're being heat from the enemy because
[55:24] the me in his pavilion in the secret of
[56:05] his Tabernacle silly hot me and he shall
[56:09] set me up upon a rock and as brother
[56:13] Troy told us that rock is a rock a
[56:15] revelation
[56:42] that's the word of the Lord that's what
[56:45] we have ourselves in that's what we wrap
[56:48] ourselves in hey Moses was here Jesus
[56:55] was here now the bride is being here he
[57:02] will hide me let's say be the name of
[57:08] the Lord
[57:09] a man church Saint Manny Manny man we
[57:14] gotta know the Scriptures not just there
[57:17] just to be there when the Prophet
[57:19] preached that I mean everybody brothers
[57:21] in high could he preach the rapture from
[57:23] here and then what he's trying to say
[57:25] I'm a no sense of me trying to keep it
[57:28] all together I might as well just let it
[57:30] flow right but the purpose right brother
[57:34] Brandon with tusk us in at the time of
[57:37] the rapture we can expect trouble
[57:41] trouble right so when you see all the
[57:43] trouble all around you got to go back to
[57:45] the scripture that he gave us as it's
[57:47] time I'm gonna hide you not only that
[57:50] not only am I gonna hide you I'm gonna
[57:52] keep you in the hour temptation huh I
[57:54] mean we got all these promises - no no
[57:56] it's gonna be all right
[57:57] glory to God Church nothing to worry
[58:00] about
[58:01] hey man it's gonna be alright it's gonna
[58:03] be alright if God kept Moses at that
[58:06] time a man God will keep you at this
[58:09] time God kept the prophets and God gonna
[58:14] keep doing this thing the reason that
[58:16] God is keeping you because you are a
[58:18] part of a vision
[58:20] a man and you must step into your place
[58:23] in the vision the reason Moses could not
[58:27] die because God had him as a part of the
[58:31] vision and there came a day that Moses
[58:33] had to step into the vision the Bible
[58:37] said I ain't tried it now after for 40
[58:40] years he tried it but he got you only
[58:43] got one dead Egyptian after this for 40
[58:46] years then he had to go to the backside
[58:47] of the desert for another 40 years
[58:49] hallelujah can you imagine God using a
[58:51] man at 80 years old 80 80 80 80 before
[58:57] he can actually move on to his ministry
[58:58] and many of us cannot just many of us
[59:02] have actually gotten ahead of the vision
[59:04] we're trying to step into the vision but
[59:06] sometimes you can get ahead of the
[59:08] vision hallelujah the Prophet told us
[59:11] this he showed us this how he was uh he
[59:14] went to the person Houston he Hannah
[59:16] that God had already showed him I'm off
[59:18] my notes
[59:19] God had already showed him that this boy
[59:22] was gonna be healing God already showed
[59:25] him say now this is what's gonna happen
[59:26] when you get there this person got to be
[59:29] here this person got to be there this
[59:31] person over here and say say that boy
[59:33] gonna be healed when you pray for him
[59:35] brother Brandon was so excited
[59:37] the father pulls up to the house and
[59:40] it's a brother Brandon minority been
[59:42] serving the Lord but do you mind coming
[59:43] to my house and pray for my son
[59:45] you know I know god I hear your prayer
[59:48] of your mind he says hey brother I don't
[59:50] mind I'll go with you right now and say
[59:51] brother it's your house like this and do
[59:54] you have that and do you have this in
[59:56] the house the brothers say yes women
[59:58] when did you ever come to the house
[59:59] brother Branham I've never had you at my
[1:00:02] house how do you know these things he
[1:00:04] said brother Jeff
[1:00:06] praise God I just left your house God
[1:00:10] took him and transported him in a
[1:00:13] different room to go
[1:00:14] amen and he saw the brother's house that
[1:00:16] he was in the vision spiritually in the
[1:00:19] vision but when he when he come out he
[1:00:20] said it's a brother who got this she got
[1:00:22] fans we got this and he didn't tell her
[1:00:24] brother so you know give you pretty son
[1:00:25] I mean he just say brother let's just go
[1:00:27] it encouraged his faith that something
[1:00:29] can happen here but when he got there he
[1:00:31] got ahead of the vision he got there and
[1:00:34] in here you know he took the baby and
[1:00:37] pray for the baby the baby had more fish
[1:00:39] than it ever had and he couldn't
[1:00:41] understand what was going on then God
[1:00:43] showed say look the reason that this
[1:00:44] term happened because you didn't wait on
[1:00:46] the vision Oh see and the reason a lot
[1:00:50] of stuff happening cuz people not
[1:00:52] waiting come on church hey man you got
[1:00:55] to learn how to wait hey man God God
[1:00:58] God's Word can not fall to the ground in
[1:01:01] return for but we must learn how to wait
[1:01:04] hallelujah we're too busy trying to make
[1:01:07] it happen on our own but wait on the
[1:01:09] Lord and be a good courage wait I say on
[1:01:16] the Lord he should've waited he said the
[1:01:21] only thing missing was this old lady
[1:01:22] coming to the house and everything god I
[1:01:25] got in chaos bro see I got to go to work
[1:01:27] I can't stay here no longer and brother
[1:01:29] branham say now if that man leave I'm
[1:01:31] have to stay here til tomorrow till he
[1:01:33] come back because he's a part of the
[1:01:35] vision hallelujah he's a part of the
[1:01:38] vision so I gotta wait for him to come
[1:01:40] back he say any and he couldn't he
[1:01:43] couldn't go tell brother Graham don't
[1:01:45] leave he couldn't tell him that he can't
[1:01:48] tell nobody nothing just had he had to
[1:01:50] sit there and wait just wait just wait
[1:01:52] so so why he waiting a man he saw
[1:01:55] brother Graham a man getting ready to
[1:01:56] leaving and right before brother Graham
[1:01:59] get relieved here comes this old woman
[1:02:01] walking a man behind the house come in
[1:02:06] through the back door and brother
[1:02:07] branham saying the vision she was wiping
[1:02:08] the glasses hollering she come and she
[1:02:11] had to sit in a certain chair
[1:02:13] glory to God our God
[1:02:16] perfect can I tell you sitting in the
[1:02:19] right chance to get chopped listen you
[1:02:25] are sitting in the right chair to get
[1:02:34] blessed Santa wait for the to come in
[1:02:40] and sit in that chair right them glasses
[1:02:42] and then sooner she did it he stood up
[1:02:44] he said my brother do you believe me to
[1:02:46] be God's prophet so yeah brother Brennan
[1:02:49] say brother I got ahead of the vision
[1:02:51] the last time I'm so sorry I did that
[1:02:53] I got ahead of things but if you bring
[1:02:55] your son to me
[1:02:56] I guarantee God with healing this time
[1:02:58] brought that boy prayed for them and and
[1:03:02] and and and he was ready he jumping out
[1:03:04] the hands of the of the daddy daddy I
[1:03:06] want to get down I want to go play
[1:03:08] brother Rams are gonna take three days
[1:03:09] here get better in three days but I
[1:03:12] guarantee he's gonna be perfectly fine
[1:03:13] and when I'm gonna come back in three
[1:03:15] days and he gonna tell me brother bill
[1:03:17] I'm all right now the vision was
[1:03:20] fulfilled but he got ahead of it and
[1:03:22] that's why now let me say two things
[1:03:25] there we get ahead of it
[1:03:27] we hinder it but we don't stop it even
[1:03:36] though he got ahead of it he didn't it
[1:03:38] didn't stop God was still gonna manifest
[1:03:40] himself in that way through the Prophet
[1:03:43] all right Church glory to God glory to
[1:03:46] God let me let me let me go on in this
[1:03:48] code I got two lines let's go on a
[1:03:53] little further here in this quote he was
[1:03:56] born in a very odd birth okay I see I
[1:04:01] see that he was born to be a deliverer
[1:04:03] like the Lord Jesus he was hit of his
[1:04:06] parents away from the enemy like the
[1:04:07] Lord Jesus and it come to his time of
[1:04:11] service like the Lord Jesus he was a
[1:04:13] leader like the Lord Jesus he was a
[1:04:15] prophet like the Lord Jesus and he was a
[1:04:18] lawgiver like the Lord Jesus and we find
[1:04:21] out that he died on the rock when he
[1:04:24] must have rose again and everything
[1:04:27] because 800 years later he
[1:04:29] standing on Mount Transfiguration
[1:04:31] talking to the Lord Jesus see angels
[1:04:34] packed to my weight
[1:04:35] no one knows where he is bear talking
[1:04:38] about Moses no one knows where he's
[1:04:40] buried buried even the devil didn't know
[1:04:42] that frankly I don't believe he was ever
[1:04:45] buried he ever was buried I believe that
[1:04:48] God packed him away and he died on the
[1:04:51] rock that he had followed all the days
[1:04:53] of his life oh I like that brother if
[1:04:56] I'm gonna die my down the rock
[1:04:58] what rock am I died knowing this
[1:05:00] revelation ain't man that God sent us a
[1:05:02] profit i'ma die on the rock when God
[1:05:05] called my aunt T home he called her home
[1:05:08] on a day to testify of what she was
[1:05:12] believing she died on the rock God
[1:05:15] called home October 7th what is that the
[1:05:18] tenth month and the seventh day
[1:05:20] hallelujah and God sent her revelation
[1:05:23] ten and seven she died on the rock and
[1:05:32] she left us with some good songs right
[1:05:35] hey man she finished a course in fact I
[1:05:38] put it that way
[1:05:39] she she she left it's gonna take a
[1:05:41] stronger wind in this my god my god
[1:05:45] hallelujah amen what church doors are
[1:05:49] closing
[1:05:50] what's that other one people all through
[1:05:53] the gonna take a stronger wind in this
[1:05:55] and it's already done right I mean all
[1:05:58] kinds of things the more that I
[1:06:00] surrender all of this auntie left us
[1:06:03] with some good stuff glory to God
[1:06:05] the church all over the world is still
[1:06:08] fellowshipping around the sons that she
[1:06:10] left us amen if I'm gonna die my died on
[1:06:13] the rock glory glory glory glory glory
[1:06:17] amen look at this he says he died on the
[1:06:20] rock that he fell all the days of life
[1:06:22] and he was a perfect type of Christ he
[1:06:24] was a king over the people he was a
[1:06:26] lawgiver
[1:06:27] he was a sustainer to the people he was
[1:06:29] everything and type that Christ was my
[1:06:32] lord my lord
[1:06:34] now this Moses had a very peculiar birth
[1:06:40] and I want to just go
[1:06:43] back and look at this in Exodus chapter
[1:06:45] 2 and as I you know I was just kind of
[1:06:49] meditating on this and I can't I won't
[1:06:51] read the whole thing but just a little
[1:06:52] bit as I was meditating on this it just
[1:06:57] I was just imagining what was really
[1:06:59] going on here glory glory glory let's
[1:07:02] just work with it just a little bit
[1:07:03] Exodus chapter 2 says and there when a
[1:07:06] man of the house of Levi and took the
[1:07:10] wife a daughter of Levi now as I was
[1:07:13] just imagining this a man I was just
[1:07:15] maybe thinking about this couple and how
[1:07:18] they got started out I can see Moses
[1:07:21] father and it's just my imagination
[1:07:23] right maybe being a little shy and man I
[1:07:27] don't really want to approach no sister
[1:07:28] I don't know what's he gonna say I don't
[1:07:31] I mean she might tell me no and I'm
[1:07:33] afraid to kind of approach her I can
[1:07:35] just see him being a little shy about
[1:07:37] this I can see maybe Moses mom was
[1:07:40] saying I got my mind on Jesus and I
[1:07:43] don't need no man of the tribe of Levi
[1:07:46] bother me right now come on somebody
[1:07:49] y'all work with me maybe there was all
[1:07:51] kind of things playing into this
[1:07:53] relationship but but no matter what
[1:07:55] their feelings are the emotions wasn't
[1:07:57] maybe who knows maybe the relationship
[1:07:59] might have went for a little bit and
[1:08:01] broke up and then they got back together
[1:08:03] again and the reason that they would get
[1:08:05] back together again because God had
[1:08:07] ordained through this relationship
[1:08:11] through this man and through this woman
[1:08:15] I'm gonna bring Moses oh I don't care
[1:08:19] how many Amen difficult times she might
[1:08:23] have had in her first two pregnancies
[1:08:24] because Miriam was born before Moses and
[1:08:27] Aaron was born before me I don't care
[1:08:30] how difficult those pregnancies were God
[1:08:32] had ordained that he was gonna bring the
[1:08:36] deliverer through this family through
[1:08:38] that boom praise God through that womb
[1:08:41] he was pregnant
[1:08:42] and somehow someway covered touch
[1:08:44] somebody and here comes Moses I'm just
[1:08:49] looking at this there went a man of the
[1:08:52] house of Levi took to wife a daughter of
[1:08:55] Levi now look at this and the woman
[1:08:58] conceived and bare a son and when she
[1:09:02] saw him that he was a goodly child she
[1:09:05] hid him three months now you know we
[1:09:08] want to just kind of Lord just help me
[1:09:10] God we want to just kind of look at this
[1:09:12] a man because what was going on here at
[1:09:16] this time and in in biblical history the
[1:09:19] the the the children of Israel were
[1:09:22] there in Egypt and and I can't I think
[1:09:26] it yeah it was a quote that I was
[1:09:28] reading for the random sentence he said
[1:09:29] seem like in the households where the
[1:09:32] children of Israel were what we're
[1:09:35] living they were giving birth to
[1:09:37] children maybe one household would have
[1:09:39] 20 kids another I also have 17 kids he'd
[1:09:45] say but down in Egypt they'd only having
[1:09:47] one or two kids so now they've got a
[1:09:49] problem saying now wait a minute because
[1:09:51] uh you know he really got one or two and
[1:09:53] they got they got a 17-2 one he said
[1:09:56] this they're starting to grow so we
[1:09:58] gotta come up with a plan in order to
[1:10:01] minimize what these people can do for us
[1:10:03] so they began to put them in hard labor
[1:10:05] if I say persecution came upon the
[1:10:10] people glory to God and they were they
[1:10:12] were so concerned about how these people
[1:10:14] are outnumbering them and what they were
[1:10:16] and maybe they rise up in a revolted and
[1:10:18] all this and why they're trying to snuff
[1:10:20] out the plan here goes by Moses father
[1:10:23] praying to God every day Lord we meet a
[1:10:26] deliverer
[1:10:29] the persecution god with tyler going
[1:10:32] through this and we're tired of going
[1:10:33] through that father we are your people
[1:10:35] we need a deliverer and God not only
[1:10:39] answered his prayer by sitting on the
[1:10:41] liver God did better than that
[1:10:43] he made the deliverer come through his
[1:10:46] loewen's bless his household were the
[1:10:52] deliverer
[1:10:52] so here Moses finally comes on the scene
[1:10:55] during this time of great pressure
[1:10:57] they had this boy and they're they're
[1:11:00] nursing him feeding him but there is a
[1:11:03] law in the land say look we're gonna
[1:11:05] have to go ahead and kill because of the
[1:11:06] the the children Israel they all praying
[1:11:08] and talking about a delivered a they're
[1:11:10] looking for they're I mean they're I'm
[1:11:11] the expectation for say say they're all
[1:11:13] talking about say you know what we're
[1:11:15] gonna have to do something special we
[1:11:16] have to get rid of every boy that is
[1:11:19] under the age of two and they set this
[1:11:21] law in the land and so when they set the
[1:11:23] law they went running from house to
[1:11:25] house they had they had multiple things
[1:11:28] in place to try to snuff out the
[1:11:31] deliverer oh I like this they they first
[1:11:34] had let's find them to a number and then
[1:11:37] they said midwives when y'all go into
[1:11:39] the house if you find a boy being boy
[1:11:42] kill the boy Amen if it's a girl a lot
[1:11:45] of girly but if it's a boy kill the boy
[1:11:47] and they're in the house maybe the
[1:11:49] midwives come the very day that Moses
[1:11:51] was born oh I I hope you always stay
[1:11:54] with me and I know a man even if you've
[1:11:57] never let me put it this way if you've
[1:12:00] never really a man in Scripture like
[1:12:02] this praise the Lord you still say man
[1:12:05] because it's there is that I'm just kind
[1:12:06] of adding a little a little bit of my
[1:12:09] own imagination to it but it's there
[1:12:11] praise the Lord but not and and and the
[1:12:13] good thing about this is that I'm not
[1:12:15] going to leave it at Moses you just got
[1:12:18] to you got to work with me through Moses
[1:12:20] but I said peculiar purse I just say
[1:12:25] Birds
[1:12:25] I said verse so work with me here amen
[1:12:32] but by here here may be the midwives get
[1:12:34] to Moses them house at the time of Moses
[1:12:36] birth all this pressure they looking for
[1:12:39] boys they're trying to kill
[1:12:40] but when the midwives get there he was
[1:12:42] already born and they could not bring it
[1:12:44] to themselves to kill that baby so they
[1:12:46] told Pharaoh say when we get there the
[1:12:49] Hebrew women are not like us they
[1:12:51] already had the baby by the time we get
[1:12:52] there we just you know and here god
[1:12:55] bless simple because the things that
[1:12:57] they did hallelujah glory as we go on in
[1:13:00] the story Moses is born mama and daddy
[1:13:03] got him for three months but here the
[1:13:05] depressions on this seeking these boys
[1:13:07] seeking these was anybody two years old
[1:13:09] and I'm there's a boy got to die mama
[1:13:11] say you know what I can't take it no
[1:13:12] more they got this close to Moses
[1:13:14] yesterday she told she told us that we
[1:13:16] got have to do something different and
[1:13:18] can you imagine this can you imagine a
[1:13:21] mama taking her three-month-old child
[1:13:25] putting them in a basket that the daddy
[1:13:28] had made for putting it in a basket and
[1:13:30] just sending it down the river
[1:13:32] what face it took for that mama to do
[1:13:37] something like that
[1:13:38] now i'ma tell you when you got that type
[1:13:41] of pressure on you you don't know what
[1:13:43] you'll do hallelujah when you get to a
[1:13:46] spot like that where it's so much
[1:13:48] pressure you have no idea what you will
[1:13:51] do so we don't criticize Moses mama I do
[1:13:53] know this much that according to
[1:13:56] Scripture by her giving her baby up to
[1:13:59] them now God gave her back her baby
[1:14:04] because Miriam watched a little art go
[1:14:06] down a man threw along the Nile River
[1:14:09] and here this are in Pharaoh's court
[1:14:13] Pharaoh's daughter says I'm gonna take
[1:14:16] this baby amen and I'm gonna raise it
[1:14:18] like it's my own son God allowed the
[1:14:21] deliverer to be raised right in the home
[1:14:25] amen of their persecutor not only that
[1:14:30] when Miriam saw who had the baby she
[1:14:34] went running it's a do you need a nurse
[1:14:36] for the baby do you need a nurse
[1:14:39] yeah I need a nurse for the baby can you
[1:14:41] go get me one she said yeah I got the
[1:14:42] perfect person and
[1:14:45] ran back to my house and got mama mama
[1:14:49] you released the baby to them now the
[1:14:52] baby ended up in pharaoh's court with
[1:14:54] Pharaoh's daughter raising the baby and
[1:14:57] they need a nurse mama you got a job so
[1:15:01] God gave Moses mama amen a job to raise
[1:15:05] her own baby and get wages for it how
[1:15:12] many all been paid to raise your own
[1:15:14] children praise God
[1:15:16] but God did this to Moses mama because
[1:15:20] she moved by faith you moved by faith
[1:15:23] you don't know what God will do for you
[1:15:26] here you know this peculiar birth that
[1:15:29] happened at this time of persecution
[1:15:31] brother Branham say it was just like the
[1:15:33] Lord Jesus and and I'm up the next quote
[1:15:37] that i'ma read as the Ange of God so
[1:15:39] just get that lined up for me in a
[1:15:42] second he said he said just like the
[1:15:44] birth of the Lord Jesus and you know the
[1:15:46] Lord Jesus when he came there was
[1:15:48] persecution on the earth at that time
[1:15:51] and here virgin first of all just think
[1:15:54] about how peculiar is it a virgin
[1:15:56] conceit that's peculiar right a virgin
[1:16:00] actually conceived and and she bore a
[1:16:02] child she bore a child that is
[1:16:04] absolutely a man like I said before and
[1:16:07] I said again if there was anything
[1:16:08] impossible that's the one thing that
[1:16:10] should have been impossible but God did
[1:16:12] exactly what he said he was going to do
[1:16:13] in his word here come Jesus a virgin
[1:16:16] conceived bear child it was a time of
[1:16:18] persecution they they decided that they
[1:16:20] don't do some taxation in the land amen
[1:16:22] hallelujah raise the taxes in the land
[1:16:26] and in hallelujah glory glory glory and
[1:16:29] they did this while it was her third
[1:16:31] trimester right now why didn't they do
[1:16:34] why didn't they come up with this plan
[1:16:35] at a first trimester but here the lady
[1:16:38] at any moment could give birth to this
[1:16:40] baby and they come up with the law they
[1:16:42] didn't even care about her being
[1:16:44] pregnant get on the donkey and leave
[1:16:47] nobody cared ruthless people heartless
[1:16:51] people lived at this time and I want to
[1:16:54] tell you even in this hour the bride
[1:16:56] Amen is living there
[1:16:58] ruthless people there are some heartless
[1:17:01] people amen they don't care anything
[1:17:03] about anything all they want to do is
[1:17:05] push they're up there but their their
[1:17:07] agenda ruthless people not even thinking
[1:17:11] about the greater good of everybody else
[1:17:14] hallelujah
[1:17:15] but when we see things like this we can
[1:17:17] see the types of scripture if that
[1:17:19] happened in the days of Moses and God
[1:17:20] kept Moses if it happened in the days of
[1:17:23] Jesus and God kept Jesus when it happens
[1:17:26] in the days of the bride God will keep
[1:17:29] his bride
[1:17:31] look at this you know they they finally
[1:17:35] get to the land to the city where they
[1:17:37] want to you know stop for the night and
[1:17:40] when they get there there's no room in
[1:17:42] the end and have to go down to a man a
[1:17:44] stable and here in the stable our Lord
[1:17:47] chooses to be born in a stable
[1:17:49] identifying him as the Lamb of God amen
[1:17:53] because lambs are born in stables not in
[1:17:55] hospital roofs praise God identify him
[1:17:58] as the Lamb of God the other peculiar
[1:18:01] thing at his birth angels came down and
[1:18:04] starts singing because when Kings are
[1:18:07] born a man people sing but here the King
[1:18:10] of Kings was born and angels began to
[1:18:13] sing amen shepherds were gathered in
[1:18:15] there and watching their flocks at night
[1:18:18] and here they got an announcement from
[1:18:20] the Angels a peculiar thing happening
[1:18:22] separates him from angels say go and
[1:18:24] find the babe wrapped in swaddling cloth
[1:18:26] you'll find them a man in this table go
[1:18:29] down there now God had to you separates
[1:18:31] because Kings didn't want to go to
[1:18:33] stables governor's didn't want to go to
[1:18:35] stables amen important people didn't
[1:18:37] want to go to stables but a shepherd had
[1:18:39] no problem going to a place that he was
[1:18:42] fully identified hallelujah glory to God
[1:18:46] so shepherds came running from the
[1:18:48] fields to find him in a stable
[1:18:49] later on you know at the same time his
[1:18:52] verses another peculiar thing happened
[1:18:53] there was a star a man that was placed
[1:18:56] in the sky and wise men followed that
[1:18:58] star for two years till it brought them
[1:19:00] to the place where Christ was born
[1:19:03] peculiar things happen at his birth
[1:19:07] let's look at this going back to Moses
[1:19:10] here just
[1:19:11] little thought out of the angel God
[1:19:13] glory glory glory the Prophet says this
[1:19:17] says now who was he speaking to Moses
[1:19:22] many of you in your Sunday School
[1:19:23] lessons has read of this great Bible
[1:19:26] character Moses I like him because he
[1:19:30] was a shadow of the coming of Christ he
[1:19:33] was just a shadow of Christ coming now
[1:19:35] now when I read there in the scripture
[1:19:37] in the book of Acts chapter 7
[1:19:39] there was a verse that said that the
[1:19:43] Lord would I'm gonna read it for you
[1:19:45] again just to make sure we got this I
[1:19:47] don't want to misquote it
[1:19:49] it was Acts 7 and verse 37 a man acts 7
[1:19:53] and verse 37 the Bible says this says
[1:19:56] this is that Moses which said unto the
[1:20:00] children of Israel a prophet shall the
[1:20:02] Lord your God raise up unto you of your
[1:20:06] brethren like unto me him show you here
[1:20:10] now clearly clearly that particular
[1:20:16] verse does speak of the coming of the
[1:20:19] Lord Jesus Christ clearly that verse
[1:20:23] speaks of that
[1:20:23] however Amen we had the opportunity to
[1:20:27] look through prophetic lenses and we can
[1:20:29] see that even in this day God rose up a
[1:20:33] prophet that was like unto Moses Amen
[1:20:36] and that scripture could also be applied
[1:20:38] to that prophet today scripture can have
[1:20:42] compound meanings Oh hallelujah yes we
[1:20:45] do believe that applied to Christ but I
[1:20:48] believe it has a compound meaning to
[1:20:50] also apply to brother Branham we'll talk
[1:20:53] about that a little bit later on let's
[1:20:54] go on hallelujah look at this a man a
[1:20:57] man a man the same way Moses was given
[1:20:59] to science brother Branham was given to
[1:21:02] science Hollow
[1:21:03] it was it was it was a clear indication
[1:21:06] that God was using a prophet like unto
[1:21:08] Moses the same way Moses brought the
[1:21:11] Word of God to the people it's the same
[1:21:14] way
[1:21:14] brother Brown brought the Word of God to
[1:21:16] the people as they got all screwed up
[1:21:19] and mixed up amen throughout the ages
[1:21:21] God had to send a prophet to salute me
[1:21:25] too just to stabilize us and through the
[1:21:28] revelation of the word that has been
[1:21:30] given we have found the secret place
[1:21:33] glory to God that we can dwell in
[1:21:36] hallelujah
[1:21:38] glory hallelujah hallelujah amen now we
[1:21:42] can comfort one another with these words
[1:21:43] the reason we don't fear and the reason
[1:21:46] we're not afraid the reason that Amen we
[1:21:48] can keep moving on because we got an
[1:21:51] open vision before us hey man let's keep
[1:21:53] looking at this let's keep looking he
[1:21:55] says since a shadow of the coming of
[1:21:57] Christ he was just a shadow of Christ
[1:21:59] coming notice now when the people of
[1:22:02] Israel in Egypt and had come into
[1:22:05] bondage for four hundred and twenty
[1:22:06] years says which he had already told
[1:22:09] Abraham now this is this is important to
[1:22:11] me because we want I want I won't read
[1:22:15] it but I'll just give you the scripture
[1:22:16] Genesis 15:13 13 through 14 God had
[1:22:20] already told Abraham what was gonna
[1:22:22] happen to the children of Israel God
[1:22:24] already told him saying they're gonna go
[1:22:26] down this land they're gonna get in
[1:22:27] bondage but I'm gonna raise the
[1:22:29] deliverer so when Moses is born
[1:22:32] Moses is actually getting ready to be a
[1:22:34] part of a vision hallelujah I like that
[1:22:39] because I need you to understand when
[1:22:41] you were born you were actually coming
[1:22:43] here to be a part of a vision when Mary
[1:22:49] was born that's why I keep saying this
[1:22:52] the Word was waiting on Mary to get here
[1:22:56] oh I got so much I'm a Trotter I'm gonna
[1:22:59] I'm gonna get tall this the Word was
[1:23:01] waiting on Mary you know and even Moses
[1:23:04] Moses caught with his his his role was
[1:23:06] the reason Moses caught it is because
[1:23:09] his momma was teaching him his momma say
[1:23:11] now son you know you you were born to be
[1:23:15] the deliverer you would protect it from
[1:23:17] death you would protect it from this you
[1:23:19] protect it from that son you were born
[1:23:22] to be the love I know you inside of
[1:23:24] Pharaoh's house I know you there but God
[1:23:27] got you here
[1:23:28] for a purpose you were born to be the
[1:23:31] deliverer God don't make mistakes
[1:23:34] hallelujah amen every step it's ordered
[1:23:38] of God so his mama raised in Tulsa
[1:23:40] so Moses had that inside him that's why
[1:23:42] he went out of struct an Egyptian he
[1:23:44] thought that the people would understand
[1:23:47] what his role was he thought the people
[1:23:49] was ready but but when he went under
[1:23:51] trying to separate his brothers he
[1:23:53] realized they were not ready to receive
[1:23:55] him guess hallelujah glory glory glory
[1:23:59] sometimes you just have to wait
[1:24:03] Moses realized much after after 80 years
[1:24:06] not 40 years but after 80 as he realized
[1:24:08] now it was his time to go out there and
[1:24:11] do and God got brother Graham said God
[1:24:13] did more with that one man with a stick
[1:24:16] one man with a stick in his hand not not
[1:24:19] trying to kill Egyptians by yourself not
[1:24:21] trying to kill him buddies but one man
[1:24:23] with us yeah you come deliver him but
[1:24:25] you're gonna do it my way not your way
[1:24:27] Moses your way is to take out each
[1:24:30] Egyptian find them over here take them
[1:24:32] out burying final another one take them
[1:24:34] out there no Moses that's not my plan
[1:24:36] that's not my plan just just wait on me
[1:24:39] hallelujah glory to God all right let me
[1:24:42] let me let me keep going let me keep
[1:24:43] going
[1:24:44] amen sometimes you just gotta wait on
[1:24:46] the Lord wait on the Lord Amen
[1:24:48] hallelujah hallelujah and and now let me
[1:24:52] be clear we're not waiting for another
[1:24:57] messenger to come we're not waiting on
[1:24:59] that because you know sometimes you know
[1:25:02] people whether people think the people
[1:25:03] don't want me know now the question is
[1:25:06] who are you according to the scripture
[1:25:09] right then somebody else rise up saying
[1:25:12] that they got a message that's that's we
[1:25:14] know that that's out of the Word of God
[1:25:15] because it's only seven angels right if
[1:25:18] I ate one try to rise up we already know
[1:25:20] her oh no no no I'm sorry I'm not
[1:25:22] following that at all I got to read
[1:25:24] these quotes I got to read these quotes
[1:25:26] you know y'all bear with me because it's
[1:25:28] it's a lot here let's go let's go it
[1:25:31] says notice now when the people of
[1:25:36] Israel had going down in Egypt and that
[1:25:37] coming to bondage for 400 420 years
[1:25:40] which it already
[1:25:42] told Abraham that they would do when the
[1:25:45] time to promise true now then I want you
[1:25:47] to notice notice now how that when the
[1:25:49] time of promise drew nigh the people
[1:25:52] began at that time to see that there was
[1:25:55] something happening that something
[1:25:58] happened to them some troubles see in
[1:26:01] the time of trouble he gotta hide me
[1:26:02] right some some troubles and God look at
[1:26:06] this statement God always caused
[1:26:09] troubles mostly always to bring the
[1:26:13] people together now trouble is supposed
[1:26:17] to actually bring us together if trouble
[1:26:21] is dividing us there's a problem
[1:26:24] somewhere but what trouble is supposed
[1:26:27] to do is bring us together and God is
[1:26:31] the one behind trouble brother Branham
[1:26:35] said he but he takes trouble puts bits
[1:26:37] in its mouth makes it do what he wants
[1:26:41] you to do in order to bring people
[1:26:43] together all right
[1:26:47] God always cause trouble mostly always
[1:26:50] to bring the people together did you
[1:26:52] know that I'm gonna tell you something
[1:26:54] in the midst of this this right here
[1:26:56] this this this this this this this
[1:26:58] outbreak amen I've seen churches that
[1:27:03] ain't fellowship in years be able to
[1:27:06] fellowship because they concerned about
[1:27:08] their brother Oh hallelujah Amen Saints
[1:27:13] that might not have been able to
[1:27:14] fellowship they start fellowship for now
[1:27:16] because they concerned about their
[1:27:18] brother brother branham say pretty much
[1:27:20] when the trouble come that's when we
[1:27:21] find out the honey sticks brotherly
[1:27:25] comma sister honey
[1:27:28] this praise God thank God for this
[1:27:32] church the trouble is what brings us
[1:27:35] together look at this it says I believe
[1:27:38] there be a time when there won't be no
[1:27:43] more division amongst the people of God
[1:27:45] I want to read that again this is the
[1:27:49] proper sentence that there will be a
[1:27:51] time when there won't be any more
[1:27:53] division amongst the people of God such
[1:27:57] as I belong to this church and I belong
[1:28:00] to that church I believe the persecution
[1:28:03] will run all the big ransom Church of
[1:28:06] God together and will be one in Christ
[1:28:09] Jesus God I save man today amen and then
[1:28:13] he will take home so the persecution
[1:28:16] will drive us together hallelujah and
[1:28:19] then he'll take us home oh then he'll
[1:28:24] take a home if we can't get together now
[1:28:26] how are we gonna get together up there
[1:28:28] so the persecution is what's kind of
[1:28:30] bringing this amen the pressure is was
[1:28:33] bringing us he says and then he will
[1:28:34] take a home now we now we won't argue
[1:28:37] whether this doctrine is right or that
[1:28:40] he goes on and I noticed then that the
[1:28:43] at the at the time of the promised drew
[1:28:45] nigh there raised up a pharaoh who do
[1:28:47] not know Joseph and they put burdens
[1:28:50] upon the people when the people serve
[1:28:52] burden that they could not make the
[1:28:54] bricks and things that they were
[1:28:55] supposed to and then would you think now
[1:28:58] look at this would you think that God
[1:29:01] would play gets people in that manner I
[1:29:02] get made a they were clothes so
[1:29:05] stressful let me just you can take that
[1:29:11] down just for a second out just let me a
[1:29:13] personal plunk workload so stressful and
[1:29:17] you think brother branham say you think
[1:29:20] what God Plagueis people that matter
[1:29:22] because the first thing we say because
[1:29:24] I'm going through this can't be God
[1:29:26] this came to god I'm going through no no
[1:29:29] no that actually shows that it probably
[1:29:31] is God and I remember I was you know on

[1:31:44] thing to strike me in order to push me
[1:31:47] to where I'm at today had I not gone
[1:31:50] through that those type of pressures
[1:31:52] then I wouldn't be standing where I
[1:31:55] today look here I want to tell you
[1:31:58] Church I don't care what it is all
[1:32:00] things
[1:32:01] Oh things I don't care what you going
[1:32:06] through right now all things work
[1:32:09] together for good to them that love God
[1:32:12] and to them who are the called according
[1:32:15] to his purpose
[1:32:17] this ain't got nothing to do what your
[1:32:19] purpose this is all about his purpose
[1:32:21] your career and got nothing to do with
[1:32:23] your purpose this is all about his
[1:32:26] purpose praise God a man a man a man
[1:32:30] sometimes we look at things either from
[1:32:33] the wrong angle hey man look at look at
[1:32:36] this look at what look at what the
[1:32:37] Prophet goggle says would you think that
[1:32:39] God would plague his people in that
[1:32:40] manner he says yes for the Word of God
[1:32:45] is eternally true is that right and he
[1:32:47] promised he would deliver them and no
[1:32:49] other way he had to do it but this away
[1:32:52] so in order to deliver them they had to
[1:32:55] get in trouble in order to deliver them
[1:32:59] he had to have some ruthless people
[1:33:01] around amen to force him into this
[1:33:03] situation that they were in God had to
[1:33:05] Amen brother brother whisper made it
[1:33:08] made it he said he said God needed a
[1:33:10] dirty man for a dirty job that's why he
[1:33:13] that's why he allowed Judas to be born
[1:33:17] on earth not just born but imma let you
[1:33:19] get into the inner circle man I'm not
[1:33:23] known that you came you can't betray the
[1:33:25] Lord walking with the Pharisees Oh
[1:33:27] working as a ver see you got to be a
[1:33:30] disciple so you come right over here and
[1:33:34] I machine to church I'm with a message
[1:33:37] Jesus shoe the church let you eat my
[1:33:39] flesh drinking my blood you have no fur
[1:33:41] he should the church everybody walk by
[1:33:44] my and then the 70 that got ordained by
[1:33:48] Jesus say this are hard singing they say
[1:33:51] look you know will you also go the extra
[1:33:53] disciples and Judas was standing right
[1:33:55] there with her we also go act like he
[1:33:57] was a believer just say ain't going
[1:34:01] nowhere he soon as Peter say only thou
[1:34:03] had the words of you turn like I can see
[1:34:05] Judas a a me
[1:34:09] but within days Jew does that change
[1:34:13] everything and a sad part about Judas
[1:34:16] now I'm gonna be honest with you Judas
[1:34:18] had no idea he was fulfilling Scripture
[1:34:22] Judas accent out he was helping things
[1:34:24] out we'll get some more money for the
[1:34:26] bank account y'all gonna pay me this and
[1:34:29] I'm gonna take this and I add a little
[1:34:31] bit I had a little bit too the trench
[1:34:36] Judas had the money now I'm add a little
[1:34:39] bit to the Treasury but I'm gonna keep
[1:34:40] the rest of this he say because Jesus is
[1:34:42] gonna get out of this situation then
[1:34:44] realize that he was fulfilling the word
[1:34:46] he was actually stepping into a vision
[1:34:49] and had no idea he had stepped into it
[1:34:53] Church that's the way to be with us we
[1:34:54] don't realize when we'll step right into
[1:34:56] something hallelujah
[1:34:59] y'all coming to church you have stepped
[1:35:01] into a vision you're hearing the message
[1:35:03] of the hour you stepped into a vision
[1:35:05] come on let me let me let me go in a
[1:35:08] little further with this Oh God
[1:35:10] amen all right this he says this so says
[1:35:18] so therefore at the time of the
[1:35:20] persecution of Israel then God had an
[1:35:22] angel to come down to the earth but
[1:35:25] before he had the angel to come he had a
[1:35:28] little boy born down there by the name
[1:35:30] of Moses is that correct and this little
[1:35:32] boy Moses was born rather born a rather
[1:35:35] peculiar birth and then at the age of
[1:35:37] maturity he was sent out to deliver the
[1:35:39] children of Israel for they were in
[1:35:41] bondage and God told him before he went
[1:35:43] now says I'll send my angel before thee
[1:35:47] now God could have sent the angel down
[1:35:50] this is an important statement God could
[1:35:53] have sent the angel down couldn't he he
[1:35:56] could have left the angel coming himself
[1:35:58] but instead of that he sent the angel to
[1:36:00] speak through the voice of a man he said
[1:36:04] the angel to speak through the voice of
[1:36:07] a man God always used man for his work
[1:36:11] is that right he don't use organizations
[1:36:15] so forth and and he also and as a
[1:36:18] conjunction
[1:36:19] he don't use mechanic
[1:36:21] devices hope that we can shoot God what
[1:36:32] is the quote say God always if it's
[1:36:36] always that mean there is no other way
[1:36:41] oh the church can hear that I want to
[1:36:48] put emphasis on that God always amen
[1:36:53] amen I done lost my place here but I
[1:36:56] find it soon
[1:36:57] amen oh my okay right since our God
[1:37:02] always used man for his work is that
[1:37:05] right he don't use organizations or so
[1:37:07] forth and mechanical devices but he uses
[1:37:11] ma'am the Holy Spirit fell upon me the
[1:37:16] Holy Spirit did not follow your tape
[1:37:18] recorder Oh your your CD or your mp3
[1:37:23] player the Holy Spirit falls upon me
[1:37:26] that's not my word but that's what the
[1:37:30] prophets say they're not the mechanical
[1:37:33] device not the mannequin God didn't call
[1:37:36] the mechanical device and I got you know
[1:37:38] people say got our ordained one brother
[1:37:42] just to play tapes why would God do
[1:37:43] something like that y'all don't cheapen
[1:37:45] my god
[1:37:46] got any ordained nobody to push play on
[1:37:49] a tape if he ordained he supposed to
[1:37:53] preach the gospel let's bring it back in
[1:37:58] line with the prophet see he did not
[1:38:04] ordain the Holy Ghost did not fall on a
[1:38:06] mechanical device the Holy Ghost falls
[1:38:09] on men
[1:38:11] hallelujah while Peter press PLAY that
[1:38:17] ain't what the Bible say
[1:38:18] while Peter spake these words the Holy
[1:38:22] Ghost fell on there all right Church I
[1:38:25] told you I had to read these quotes I
[1:38:26] told you I had to read them alright
[1:38:28] alright stay with me here he uses men
[1:38:31] the Holy Spirit fell upon me and that's
[1:38:33] God's instrument here on
[1:38:35] earthnow I just I'm stopping there on
[1:38:39] that particular quote there's so much
[1:38:41] here I got I got I got a lot more that
[1:38:44] uh but I'm gonna just try to change a
[1:38:46] man just something I Oh Lord just bear
[1:38:49] with me there's a brother branham had a
[1:38:58] peculiar birth the Lord did something so
[1:39:06] special he was born in a household
[1:39:08] father was a drunk I was just reading
[1:39:11] like his life story again and and and
[1:39:13] they were just sharing how the data
[1:39:16] there's mama his mama actually a thing
[1:39:19] his mom and daddys mom was 14 years old
[1:39:21] and she got married to brother branham's
[1:39:24] damn she's living in Texas and her
[1:39:26] mother had died roughly about three
[1:39:28] years or so before she got married she
[1:39:30] was a very young woman had and she was
[1:39:32] the oldest of all the kids and she saw
[1:39:35] marriage as her way to get out of the
[1:39:38] situation that she was in some people do
[1:39:42] it that way they see marriage as the way
[1:39:43] out and actually when you see marriages
[1:39:45] the way out sometimes it leads you to a
[1:39:48] way in into some other trouble come on
[1:39:51] somebody alright our way of escape is
[1:39:54] Christ's Amen nothing else on this earth
[1:39:57] so she saw marriage as a way out and and
[1:39:59] she went running off and she got married
[1:40:01] to brother branham's dad and you know
[1:40:04] met him at a rodeo and she got married
[1:40:07] to him and and here she is 15 years old
[1:40:10] away from her family pregnant expectant
[1:40:13] in the very night that she's expecting
[1:40:15] brother branham's daddy took off to the
[1:40:17] to the to get his paycheck and and he
[1:40:19] was a drinking man so he stopped on the
[1:40:21] way home and got herself something to
[1:40:23] drink and he can come home too late that
[1:40:24] night and she was going through labor
[1:40:25] pains all day long waiting on you know
[1:40:28] the husband to come and just kind of
[1:40:30] work with him she just didn't know what
[1:40:31] was happening no she was there in the
[1:40:32] mountains by himself in his log cabin
[1:40:34] had no idea what was getting ready to
[1:40:36] happen no idea but she had nobody there
[1:40:39] to help her she's just sitting there
[1:40:40] waiting waiting crying like lord please
[1:40:42] send my husband home and finally a
[1:40:45] husband come home he got a little
[1:40:47] something in his pocket
[1:40:48] you know and he finally maybe they
[1:40:51] didn't really have lights but they had
[1:40:52] candles and stuff today with light back
[1:40:53] in that time and and he and he just
[1:40:55] heard his wife in there groaning he
[1:40:57] tried to just tip in the house but he
[1:40:58] heard in that moaning and groaning me
[1:40:59] like Oh Lord she said she said Charles
[1:41:01] Charles say this is this is it it's time
[1:41:04] it's time and he like he had just bought
[1:41:07] herself some overalls he like men I'm
[1:41:08] celebrating my baby being born with a
[1:41:10] new pair of overalls get that that's the
[1:41:14] way they celebrated they were very
[1:41:16] humble back then right you know I'm
[1:41:18] gonna celebrate this and and so he said
[1:41:19] she said go get your mama and and bring
[1:41:22] your mama because I think this is it
[1:41:24] tonight's the night
[1:41:24] and so he went down and got to mom and
[1:41:27] got back about our got some other people
[1:41:29] to come and said our mama had already
[1:41:31] had 17 kids so she should be a good
[1:41:34] Midwife and so here she comes and she
[1:41:40] starts helping her daughter-in-law and
[1:41:42] and and and and and they sent you know
[1:41:44] brother branham's father out the house
[1:41:46] while I was waiting on the baby to come
[1:41:48] in and happened to be in this month of
[1:41:49] April right that uh that this baby was
[1:41:53] being born and and here that morning
[1:41:55] April 6 1909 brother Branham comes to
[1:42:00] the earth and within 15 minutes of his
[1:42:03] arrival the daddy went and they really
[1:42:06] didn't have windows he said just like a
[1:42:07] would opening in the house and and so he
[1:42:10] said all he did daddy just went to just
[1:42:12] try to open and let the Sun come in Oh
[1:42:14] hallelujah but instead of s UN coming in
[1:42:18] the s OE n came into the room say that
[1:42:22] pillar fire came whirling into the room
[1:42:25] circling around say they had no idea
[1:42:27] what type of child this was this was a
[1:42:30] peculiar birth even so I don't say what
[1:42:34] this young and it's gonna be something
[1:42:36] special about this youngin a peculiar
[1:42:40] birth very very peculiar birth God gave
[1:42:44] that to the Prophet and now I want to
[1:42:47] just I wanna I wanna I want to bring
[1:42:50] this in let me just read this quote here
[1:42:52] God revealing himself to his people
[1:42:54] because as Moses was at a spot where the
[1:42:57] people couldn't receive him brother
[1:42:59] Branham also got to that spot where
[1:43:01] people can receive him
[1:43:02] as Moses was given to science brother
[1:43:05] branham was given to science so as I
[1:43:07] said earlier yes that Scripture does
[1:43:10] apply to Jesus yes it does
[1:43:13] but it has a compound meaning I believe
[1:43:15] it also applies this prophet now I got
[1:43:17] to read this and then I'm gonna get real
[1:43:19] fast on y'all because I want to talk
[1:43:20] about one other peculiar birth I talked
[1:43:26] about Moses I talked about Jesus I'm
[1:43:28] talking about the Prophet but I got
[1:43:30] another one I want to talk about now
[1:43:32] look at this guy reveal himself to his
[1:43:33] people oh Lord and he walked and he
[1:43:39] looked up to me with kind they looked
[1:43:42] pathetic to look at him he's talked
[1:43:43] about the angel the Lord this brother
[1:43:45] branham an angel Lord coming directly to
[1:43:46] him says he looked like he was a man
[1:43:48] well I just could not picture his
[1:43:51] characteristics of his character in his
[1:43:53] face he looked like a man that was
[1:43:54] sympathetic kind-hearted but yet he
[1:43:56] looked like a man if he speak it would
[1:43:58] be that way so I looked at him and he
[1:44:01] looked at me I was so scared I was
[1:44:03] biting my thumbnail till it was almost
[1:44:05] bleeding listen friend you'd be too you
[1:44:08] don't think you wouldn't and I was right
[1:44:11] like that he said fear not says I knew
[1:44:15] that was the same voice that spoke to me
[1:44:17] all alone that was the first time I'd
[1:44:20] ever seen it like that but I know that
[1:44:22] voice he said fear not I am sent from
[1:44:24] the presence of the Almighty God to tell
[1:44:26] you that your peculiar birth and
[1:44:28] peculiar life been always misunderstood
[1:44:32] with man so brother Branham got a
[1:44:34] peculiar birth he'll pick you your birth
[1:44:35] and you'll procure your life as always
[1:44:38] been always misunderstood with men said
[1:44:40] you're peculiar life and peculiar birth
[1:44:43] has been to indicate that you're to take
[1:44:45] a gift of divine healing to the people
[1:44:47] peoples of the world he said I'll be
[1:44:50] says certain and I said sir I cannot go
[1:44:55] now ain't that something similar what
[1:44:57] Moses God raised a prophet like unto
[1:45:00] Moses and not not just I mean Moses had
[1:45:03] a peculiar birth Jesus had a peculiar
[1:45:05] birth brother Branham has a peculiar
[1:45:07] birth you had a peculiar birth
[1:45:09] [Music]
[1:45:10] [Laughter]
[1:45:12] and I know you're thinking with me yeah
[1:45:15] you got a peculiar birth I'll tell you
[1:45:17] I'll tell you about in a second he said
[1:45:25] it's a prophet Moses was given he says
[1:45:28] he said I'll be with you I said sir I'm
[1:45:30] educated I said I could not go the
[1:45:32] people won't believe me he said as the
[1:45:33] prophet Moses was given two sons so will
[1:45:36] you be given two signs said first will
[1:45:38] be that you'll be able to detect the
[1:45:40] diseases by your hand taking the patient
[1:45:42] about the right hand a man in in your
[1:45:45] left and and if you'll be sincere when
[1:45:47] you pray get them to believe you and be
[1:45:49] sincere when you pray nothing she'll
[1:45:52] stand before your prayer not even cancer
[1:45:56] and I can just put not even covet 19c he
[1:46:01] spoke he spoke he spoke cancer that's
[1:46:06] the only disease he said he said then if
[1:46:08] you'll be sincere with that it'll come
[1:46:10] to pass that you would tell them the
[1:46:12] secrets of their heart saying them will
[1:46:14] be the two signs and he said and I said
[1:46:17] I would go he said I'll be with you and
[1:46:19] just in the light beginning to gather up
[1:46:22] and gather up to the angel and it got
[1:46:25] into the angel the angel went up into
[1:46:27] that little light pill of fire that you
[1:46:29] seen tonight and it went out of the room
[1:46:32] I didn't know what to do and I'm gonna
[1:46:34] just stop right there on that course I
[1:46:36] didn't know what to do so here
[1:46:37] that same pillar fire that came in at
[1:46:39] his birth that same pillar viola now is
[1:46:42] coming in to ordain him to go out with a
[1:46:44] gift into the land now brother Branham
[1:46:47] went with that gifting and where where
[1:46:52] am I yeah he went with that gift and it
[1:46:55] has blessed all of us it has I mean
[1:46:57] we're still standing on that now I'm
[1:46:59] going back to our thought that the angel
[1:47:04] the Lord gave a man to the prophet and
[1:47:07] pick up your pen and write let me let me
[1:47:09] go there I must say a couple of things
[1:47:11] and then we're gonna bring it home okay
[1:47:13] just bear with me now I usually read to
[1:47:17] you all out of this church age but today
[1:47:20] I want to read it from the spoken words
[1:47:21] original seat where he originally gay
[1:47:23] his thought this is where we've been
[1:47:25] getting stepped into the vision this is
[1:47:27] where because this is ultimately the
[1:47:29] vision so everything I'm reading to you
[1:47:31] is part of the vision that the angel
[1:47:34] gave up to the Prophet hallelujah
[1:47:36] waiting for people to come on the earth
[1:47:39] that will fulfill this all right watch
[1:47:42] the spoken words original seed she says
[1:47:44] now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb
[1:47:48] and I'm a think is on the second page if
[1:47:51] you turn the page over I'm there says
[1:47:53] let us stay like Joshua and Caleb now
[1:47:55] watch close this is going to have a
[1:47:58] spiritual background now let us stand
[1:48:02] like Joshua and Caleb it says as we see
[1:48:05] the promised land coming in sight it's
[1:48:09] nearing the time to be given Joshua and
[1:48:13] Hebrew means Savior and represents the
[1:48:17] promise in time leader to take the
[1:48:21] church over now right there two angels
[1:48:23] telling us that brother branham's
[1:48:25] ministry is a promise in time leader to
[1:48:29] take us over the edge was giving this
[1:48:31] time now look at what he also says Caleb
[1:48:35] represents the true believer who stayed
[1:48:39] with Joshua
[1:48:41] now that hit me after I read it again
[1:48:44] Amen justice week
[1:48:45] Caleb represents the true believer who
[1:48:49] stayed with Joshua that means that's me
[1:48:53] that's you glory to God and you know
[1:48:57] Caleb when it come time for them to go
[1:48:59] to the promised land Caleb had already
[1:49:01] walked on certain grounds Caleb had
[1:49:04] already seen certain things Caleb had
[1:49:07] already experienced the grapes in the
[1:49:09] land Caleb Caleb knew exactly what he
[1:49:12] wanted hallelujah when he went back into
[1:49:15] the camp and he told her people say say
[1:49:17] we're more than able to overtake them
[1:49:19] don't y'all fear though listen to the
[1:49:21] reporter these are the spots we're more
[1:49:23] than able to overcome them because if
[1:49:25] God be for us who can be against us
[1:49:27] Caleb had a different spirit hallelujah
[1:49:30] but there come a time because Caleb and
[1:49:32] Joshua was
[1:50:35] [Applause]

[1:55:16] look at this
[1:55:17] he says Caleb represents the true
[1:55:21] believer who stayed with Joshua got God
[1:55:24] started Israel as a virgin with his word
[1:55:26] but they wanted something different so
[1:55:28] did this last day church
[1:55:30] notice how God did not move Israel in
[1:55:32] tears on the point at time now listen
[1:55:34] you gotta wait and listen this this is
[1:55:36] going to mean something when you see the
[1:55:40] the parentheses like that this this is
[1:55:43] going to mean something that's brother
[1:55:45] branham injecting his thoughts he says
[1:55:47] Joshua waited for that time now no no
[1:55:50] how no matter how much people might have
[1:55:53] said God gave us the land that promise
[1:55:56] let us go now and take it they might
[1:55:58] have said Joshua you lost your
[1:55:59] commission you're all washed up and and
[1:56:02] how many people saying that today when
[1:56:04] you look you know you see all these
[1:56:05] different websites of brother branham's
[1:56:07] dis brother arms that
[1:56:08] no no no Joshua he loses commission
[1:56:10] ain't nothing go wrong everything was
[1:56:12] right right
[1:56:13] it says Joshua lost your commission
[1:56:14] you're all washed up why are you not
[1:56:16] doing something you used to do you used
[1:56:18] to know thus saith the Lord in a moment
[1:56:19] and what was the will of God but this
[1:56:22] wise God sent prophet the promise of God
[1:56:24] but also new to wait for that promise a
[1:56:27] clear-cut decision from God for his time
[1:56:29] see these parables now watch and when
[1:56:31] the time come God gave it to Joshua who
[1:56:34] is state with him by the word for he
[1:56:37] could not trust the others he could he
[1:56:38] could trust him so will it repeat then
[1:56:41] goes on says like the mighty anointed
[1:56:43] prophet Moses knew God would use him for
[1:56:46] he approved Moses to be a servant by his
[1:56:49] peculiar birth and at the right time
[1:56:51] that it deliverance for Abraham seat was
[1:56:54] at time he says are you getting it Moses
[1:56:57] never stayed in Egypt and argued
[1:56:59] scriptural points with them so brother
[1:57:00] Adam went to the wilderness he did not
[1:57:02] stay down in the Baptist Church arguing
[1:57:03] with his pastor he went to the
[1:57:05] wilderness waiting waiting for and what
[1:57:07] it is is the same way Moses went to the
[1:57:09] wilderness he had to wait for the people
[1:57:11] to receive him he thought they were
[1:57:12] ready but God didn't have him ready yet
[1:57:14] and there's people that we thought they
[1:57:16] was ready
[1:57:17] remember they weren't ready yet but this
[1:57:19] word coming right back around amen and
[1:57:22] typically is that at a time of pressure
[1:57:25] it's at a time of pressure when people a
[1:57:28] lot more open to hear what you got to
[1:57:30] say all right look at this says Moses
[1:57:35] never seen the age of menarche
[1:57:36] description points with them he never
[1:57:37] fuss with the priests but he went to the
[1:57:39] wilderness and waited on the Lord until
[1:57:41] the people's ready to receive him he had
[1:57:43] to come to testify of them but they
[1:57:46] would not receive him God called his
[1:57:47] prophet to the wilderness God testified
[1:57:49] he had chosen chose him but the waiting
[1:57:51] was not by Moses but for the people to
[1:57:54] get ready to receive Moses Moses thought
[1:57:57] the children would understand that he
[1:57:59] was sent and look what brother Graham
[1:58:01] said I never wrote it he did he talked
[1:58:05] about the angel the angel wrote these
[1:58:07] things the angel was saying Moses
[1:58:10] thought that the people
[1:58:12] Moses taught the children would
[1:58:14] understand that he was sent he said so
[1:58:16] is it now just like people didn't
[1:58:18] understand in that day that God was
[1:58:20] sending
[1:58:20] brother
[1:58:21] percent Moses people didn't understand
[1:58:23] today that God was sending his prophet
[1:58:25] according to Malachi chapter 4 verse 5
[1:58:30] and 6 according to revelation 10 verse 7
[1:58:34] according to st. Luke 17 verse 30
[1:58:38] scripture after scripture after
[1:58:40] scripture supports this prophet coming
[1:58:43] on the scene and not only that if you
[1:58:45] just read his life story you'll see he
[1:58:47] had a peculiar birth just like Moses had
[1:58:50] a peculiar birth
[1:58:51] just like Jesus had a peculiar birth and
[1:58:53] I told you there was one other you had a
[1:58:56] peculiar birth you see brother Jack how
[1:58:59] well the Prophet told us that we were
[1:59:04] born in chicken coops I can understand
[1:59:09] why we look different
[1:59:10] while we act different while we talk
[1:59:13] different why we couldn't eat the stuff
[1:59:15] that they was eating because of where we
[1:59:17] was born he said but one day mama came
[1:59:21] screaming by with the Word of God and we
[1:59:25] could identify with what the mother
[1:59:27] Eagle scream was the mother Eagle knew
[1:59:29] she lost another egg she said I don't
[1:59:32] know where this egg is but I know it's
[1:59:34] time for birth I know it's time for so
[1:59:37] mama came screaming over this chicken
[1:59:39] coop just yelling and and here we looked
[1:59:41] up like mama Hymon where can we get up
[1:59:44] there you know we thought that we can't
[1:59:47] fly like that we talked that we can't go
[1:59:49] up there like that we taught that we
[1:59:51] earthbound creatures say that the momma
[1:59:53] said see screaming said son just flap
[1:59:55] them wings because it's it's in you to
[1:59:58] come out of that condition where you at
[2:00:00] do you know your resurrection is already
[2:00:03] in you and the same God that said I lay
[2:00:07] my life down and I take it up again
[2:00:10] brother Branham say that same God is
[2:00:11] dwelling you you can raise yourself up
[2:00:15] that eagle had to raise himself up even
[2:00:19] though he had a peculiar birth even
[2:00:21] though he was in the midst of some
[2:00:22] strange people yet he had something in
[2:00:25] him that could identify with a mother
[2:00:27] scream and when it come time to fly he
[2:00:30] flew himself right out of the situation
[2:00:32] he was in
[2:00:32] you know Eagles
[2:00:35] fly above storms geez that's why the
[2:00:46] storm don't bother the ego because egos
[2:00:49] get above storms bless it be the name of
[2:00:54] the Lord's God richly bless your church
[2:00:57] god bless you let's pray father God we
[2:01:08] are so grateful for your word Lord Jesus
[2:01:13] that has been given to us Lord we can
[2:01:17] look at these things scripture how an
[2:01:22] angel came to the prophet and God even
[2:01:25] gave him very specific words and well we
[2:01:27] look back at these different characters
[2:01:29] of Scripture and see how you have them
[2:01:31] come on the scene for a very specific
[2:01:33] purpose they were born to fulfill that
[2:01:37] lord help us to see ourselves God in
[2:01:43] Scripture that we would understand what
[2:01:45] it is that you have called us to in this

[2:06:12] will put the blood in her place the
[2:06:19] Spirit of God of widows their church we
[2:06:20] got nothing to worry about
[2:06:22] because she'll recognize her position I
[2:06:25] like this she'll recognize her position
[2:06:28] in the word and that's what we're trying
[2:06:30] to bring the church to recognition of
[2:06:33] who according to the word
[2:06:37] hallelujah even as we've gone we started
[2:06:40] our journey through faeces that's the
