[6:51] he'll be reaching out to
[6:53] each and every one of you um at a later
[6:56] time
[6:57] amen because just kind of caught
[6:59] everyone by by surprise here a little
[7:01] bit
[7:02] so we're gonna um if you take your
[7:05] bibles
[7:06] it's being bible study we won't be as
[7:09] formal
[7:10] amen and we're not gonna hold you along
[7:13] uh but if you turn
[7:15] in genesis we'll read this scripture
[7:17] right quick and then you can have your
[7:18] seats
[7:19] turn um to genesis the fourth chapter
[7:23] genesis the fourth chapter amen
[7:33] my mind amen
[7:37] genesis the fourth chapter and we're
[7:38] going to begin reading from the third
[7:40] verse and it reads it says here and in
[7:44] process of time
[7:49] it came to pass that cain
[7:52] brought of the fruit of the ground
[7:56] an offering unto the lord
[8:00] and abel he also brought
[8:04] of the firstling of his flock
[8:09] and of the fat thereof
[8:12] and the lord had respect
[8:15] unto abel and to his offering
[8:20] but unto cain and his offering
[8:24] he had not respect
[8:28] and cain was very rough
[8:32] and his countenance failed and the lord
[8:35] said unto king why are thy wrath
[8:37] and why have that countenance fear
[8:40] fallen
[8:41] if thou doest well thou
[8:45] shalt if y'all do as well
[8:48] shalt thou not be accepted
[8:51] and if thou doest not well
[8:54] seeing life at the door
[8:58] and unto thee shall be his desire
[9:03] and thou shall rule over him
[9:06] amen you may be seated all that
[9:10] blessings to the reading of the word
[9:12] we're going to take a little thought
[9:14] this evening on
[9:16] a study in well-doing
[9:22] doing well amen that that that what
[9:27] you when you think about just well doing
[9:29] that seems like that should be the
[9:31] christian mantra
[9:33] amen to uh always
[9:36] be doing well you know uh
[9:40] well done but we're gonna take a little
[9:41] we're gonna dive into this a little bit
[9:43] i like how
[9:44] uh this this brother quaker speaking of
[9:46] brother quaker there you go
[9:49] how he was talking about how uh
[9:52] uh jesus came i'm god stepped
[9:55] out of glory and um came down on the
[9:58] on and held on the cross there
[10:01] as a sacrifice amen and
[10:05] he was he had to uh he had to dive in
[10:08] he couldn't do it from glory he had to
[10:11] come down
[10:12] amongst us and he used the type he said
[10:15] it's like a lifeguard
[10:16] amen so he had he had to come down off
[10:20] of you know lifeguard sits up on a
[10:22] platform
[10:23] and he looks down and if he sees
[10:25] somebody's in trouble
[10:26] amen he jumps down off the lifeguard and
[10:29] he
[10:30] he dives in the water to what guard that
[10:33] life
[10:34] amen so he he's he's he's he's guarding
[10:38] not only your life but he's guarding
[10:41] amen the life that he put in you
[10:44] amen so amen we we believe that
[10:48] tonight amen the lord is going to uh
[10:52] come down and be a lifeguard and
[10:54] sometimes lifeguards they have to go
[10:56] in and they pull a person out and they
[10:58] may have to perform some
[11:00] uh cpr or different things to get the
[11:04] person back right and everything so we
[11:05] believe that god is our life god
[11:08] this this evening amen to god the life
[11:12] amen that he placed on the inside of us
[11:14] now looking at these scriptures here
[11:17] we see uh that uh came
[11:22] the sixth chapter he said the lord said
[11:24] unto cain why aren't thy roth
[11:26] you see cain was angry and why have thy
[11:30] countenance failed
[11:32] and thou if thou doest well
[11:37] thou sh shalt thou not be accepted
[11:41] and in cain's opinion of himself he had
[11:44] done well
[11:46] he had labored in the field he planted
[11:49] all of
[11:50] the fruits and things like that he
[11:52] worked very hard to bring forth his
[11:54] sacrifice
[11:57] he worked very hard he presented it and
[12:01] everything he
[12:02] he dressed it up real nice and and and
[12:05] and the thing of it was is that kane
[12:07] he thought he was doing well but
[12:10] you know he cast me a question uh if
[12:13] thou do us well
[12:14] he said well what do you mean if i do
[12:17] well i did do well
[12:19] he i brought forth all of the fruit and
[12:22] different things of that nature and
[12:23] notice god
[12:24] says if thou do us well
[12:27] cain what cain had done
[12:30] amen was not doing well
[12:34] in the sight of god even though
[12:37] he had put forth a great deal of effort
[12:40] even though he was very sincere in what
[12:43] he was doing
[12:45] amen he had not done well
[12:48] and if thou doest not well then
[12:52] seeing life at the door
[12:55] we know that later on that he got so
[12:57] upset and roth and angry
[12:59] immediately after this event he murdered
[13:01] his brother
[13:02] you know a good litmus test if you're
[13:05] doing well or
[13:06] whatever you might be doing hey man if
[13:09] if if you find out that in the midst of
[13:11] doing it you you get angry
[13:14] and you're well they don't accept me and
[13:16] now you get mad and all this that kind
[13:18] of stuff that's usually a good litmus
[13:20] test that you're not in the will of god
[13:23] that's a good litmus test right there
[13:26] because we see that the same thing
[13:27] happened to cain
[13:29] and in the process of time it says here
[13:32] cain brought the fruit of the ground
[13:35] and uh the fourth verse says and abel he
[13:38] also brought
[13:39] the firstling and the flock of the fat
[13:41] thereof
[13:42] and the lord had respect unto abel's
[13:46] offering abel's work
[13:49] in his sacrifice revealed
[13:52] his faith amen
[13:56] his sacrifice actually showed
[13:59] the revelation that he had in his heart
[14:02] amen
[14:03] the original sin and the lamb of god
[14:09] would one day come and be slain
[14:13] for the sins for the redemption of of of
[14:15] mankind
[14:16] so abel had a revelation his his
[14:20] he was his his sacrifice his labor
[14:23] uh uh uh uh was was was received by god
[14:27] amen but because abel was in the will of
[14:31] god
[14:31] he was doing well
[14:35] amen he was doing well
[14:38] but unto cain and to his offering he had
[14:41] no respect
[14:44] now it wasn't that cain
[14:47] didn't put forth effort or energy
[14:50] but his sacrifice was inspired
[14:54] by a false revelation
[14:58] his sacrifice was inspired
[15:01] by a misunderstanding amen
[15:05] because he thought it was botany life
[15:10] that caught that caused eve to fall oh
[15:13] man
[15:15] because he thought it was botany life
[15:19] that caused eve to fall
[15:24] that she ate apples or whatever apricots
[15:27] are pears
[15:28] but we know amen that it was the
[15:31] shedding of innocent blood
[15:33] that caused the fall
[15:37] when the serpent went with eve in the
[15:40] false
[15:40] union we know that that
[15:44] that that was the first blood that was
[15:46] shed
[15:47] upon the earth amen
[15:51] now stay with me we're gonna get through
[15:54] this
[15:54] amen it was a blood sin
[15:58] amen then he had to be a blood
[16:01] therefore it had to be a blood sacrifice
[16:05] now cain again as i said was very was
[16:08] was very angry amen his
[16:11] face showed an angry scribe
[16:14] an anger uh he had in other words he had
[16:17] his lips poked out
[16:19] he was pouting and carrying on and the
[16:21] lord said unto king
[16:23] why why art thou wroth and why are their
[16:26] countenance fought
[16:28] if thou does swell shalt thou not be
[16:32] accepted so
[16:33] even in that the lord you see what the
[16:35] lord gave came
[16:37] opportunity to do well
[16:40] even though he didn't have the
[16:43] revelation
[16:44] the revelation was presented to him
[16:48] see the the he said if you do like your
[16:50] brother
[16:52] then i'll accept your sacrifice too so
[16:54] there was no reason to get upset
[16:56] all he had to do was accept god's
[16:59] provided way
[17:01] amen all he had to do was accept
[17:05] amen and do well like his brother
[17:08] amen and if thou do as well
[17:13] here in seven thou shalt if thou do is
[17:17] not if if thou do as well shalt thou
[17:21] not be accepted and if thou do its not
[17:24] well
[17:24] sin life at the door
[17:27] now we're gonna look at this word well
[17:29] doing just a little bit here
[17:32] well doing is a course
[17:36] of right action a
[17:39] course of right action it is a
[17:43] virtue to serve the lord
[17:46] according to the program and the
[17:48] revelation of god
[17:50] for the age that you are living in
[17:55] amen because we know by teaching
[18:00] of the message of the hour that we can
[18:03] try to do
[18:03] god a service amen
[18:07] and it not be his will and it's not
[18:10] accepted
[18:12] amen so uh but if the service is
[18:16] outside of the wheel and the plan of god
[18:18] for that age
[18:19] then the service is not accepted it will
[18:22] be
[18:22] in vain just as cain's sacrifice was
[18:26] it has to be in the will
[18:29] and in the plan of god amen
[18:33] talking about doing well well doing
[18:37] let's put up in galatians the sixth
[18:40] chapter
[18:42] and we're gonna look at the ninth verse
[18:46] of galatians here
[18:54] amen
[18:56] a study in well-doing
[19:01] it says here in galatians let us not be
[19:04] weary
[19:06] in well-doing
[19:09] for in due season we shall reap
[19:12] if we faint not
[19:15] as we have therefore opportunity
[19:19] let us do good unto all men
[19:24] especially unto them
[19:27] who are of the household of faith
[19:31] amen now
[19:34] let us not be weary in doing
[19:38] so
[19:42] anyone
[19:45] is a human sometimes we just get weary
[19:50] we see kids you buy them a special toy
[19:55] they'll play with it for a while and
[19:57] after a while they tired of it
[20:00] they don't just don't want to play with
[20:02] it no more they just got they're weary
[20:04] of the thing i'm sure a lot of times
[20:07] we can all attest that sometimes we we
[20:09] sit down and we begin to read our bibles
[20:11] and study
[20:13] we get tired we get weary
[20:16] amen i believe it's in ecclesiastes i
[20:20] think it's the
[20:20] second chapter the 12th verse the bible
[20:23] talks about that that that we get where
[20:25] much study brings weary to the flesh
[20:30] we we even find that sometimes on our
[20:33] jobs we
[20:34] we we get a new job and we're excited
[20:37] about going
[20:39] but it'll be there for a few years
[20:42] you know it's just it's hard to roll out
[20:44] of bed in the morning
[20:46] man i don't feel like what we get we get
[20:48] weary sometimes
[20:51] now we can be honest with ourselves
[20:53] sometimes we get weary
[20:55] coming to church it's time to go to
[20:58] church oh man sometimes we just get a
[21:00] little weary
[21:03] but let us not be weary in well
[21:06] doing amen so
[21:10] we will reap in due season
[21:14] if we faint not we could allow ourselves
[21:18] to get weary on a lot of things
[21:20] but weary and well doing
[21:25] let us not get weary let us continue to
[21:28] just press the battle no matter how
[21:30] tired we get
[21:33] no matter how hard it seems
[21:36] because it is connected directly to a
[21:39] reward
[21:41] we'll get into that a little bit later
[21:43] on in the in the study
[21:45] amen the scripture
[21:50] promised us that there is a time
[21:53] coming that if we wearing not
[21:56] in our service then we will reap
[22:00] a great harvest a blessing in life
[22:04] so the scriptures are dealing with this
[22:06] human trait
[22:07] to encourage us not to get tired and to
[22:12] lose
[22:13] our enthusiasm amen for the things of
[22:17] the lord
[22:18] and our service to the body of christ
[22:22] amen now now now now i want to say i
[22:26] want to i want to bring this out that
[22:27] this this this word well doing
[22:30] we we we we're not talking about how
[22:34] you yo yo you you got you have to work
[22:36] your way to heaven
[22:38] that's not what we're talking about amen
[22:41] because
[22:42] uh you're saved by grace amen
[22:45] but there's certainly a reward connected
[22:49] to your well-doing amen
[22:52] because we know a salvation is of the
[22:56] lord and not by works
[22:57] amen but there is
[23:01] reward connected to the end of the road
[23:04] for our service amen
[23:08] let us look at matthew the 24th chapter
[23:12] i'm sorry 25th matthew 25th
[23:16] chapter there beginning at the 14th
[23:20] verse
[23:22] let us not be weary in well-doing
[23:26] amen for the kingdom of
[23:29] heaven is as a man
[23:33] traveling into a far country
[23:37] who called his own servants and
[23:40] delivered them to
[23:41] and to them his goods
[23:44] and until one he gave five talents
[23:47] and another he gave to and to another
[23:50] one
[23:53] one to another one to every man
[23:56] according to his ability
[24:01] man you see he god ain't going to ask
[24:04] you to do
[24:05] what you see thank you lord
[24:08] don't worry about what somebody else
[24:10] doing
[24:11] see you do what god
[24:14] told you to do
[24:18] you can't you can't you can't don't use
[24:21] me as your measuring stick
[24:24] don't use brother quaker is your
[24:26] measuring stick don't you
[24:28] you you have to you have to be led
[24:32] by the holy spirit
[24:35] now that don't mean where the lord told
[24:36] me to stay home no he didn't neither
[24:39] no that was the devil you need to learn
[24:41] to be able to differentiate the two
[24:44] if you just staying home now if you're
[24:46] ox in the ditch get your outside but if
[24:47] you stay at home
[24:48] i'm tired i'm gonna just kick my feet up
[24:50] now you watch yourself
[24:52] you're getting weary and well doing
[24:55] amen but he gave you see here in this
[24:59] example he gave
[25:00] every man his talents unto his own
[25:04] several ability and straightway took his
[25:07] journey
[25:09] then he that he had received the five
[25:12] talents
[25:13] he went and traded with the same
[25:16] and made them other five talents
[25:22] and likewise he that had received two
[25:25] top two he also gained
[25:29] other two talents but he that had
[25:33] one talent and he dig
[25:37] it into the earth and hid
[25:40] his lord's money amen
[25:46] after a long time the lord of those
[25:49] servants cometh
[25:51] and reckoning with them what have you
[25:55] done with the talents that i gave you
[26:00] and so he that had received five talents
[26:04] came and brought the other five talents
[26:06] saying lord
[26:08] thou deliver us unto me five talents and
[26:10] behold i have
[26:12] gained besides them five talents more
[26:16] and the lord said unto him well
[26:20] done thou good and faithful servant
[26:24] thou has been faithful over a few things
[26:28] i will make you ruler over many things
[26:31] enter into the joy of the lord
[26:35] he also had received two talents came to
[26:38] the lord
[26:40] came and said lord thou deliver us unto
[26:43] me
[26:44] two talents behold i have gained two
[26:47] other talents beside them
[26:51] and the lord said unto him well done
[26:55] good and faithful servant
[26:59] thou has been faithful over a few things
[27:05] i will make the ruler over many things
[27:08] enter into the joy of the lord
[27:12] now we're just going to start right
[27:14] there because we
[27:16] know that the other fellow uh didn't
[27:18] didn't didn't quite
[27:20] do those things he just kind of sat on
[27:22] the gift
[27:24] didn't give back didn't do anything with
[27:27] it
[27:28] and and believe the scripture that said
[27:30] that he was cast into
[27:32] outer darkness amen
[27:35] so what i wanna i wanna i wanna kind of
[27:37] switch gears right there and i wanna
[27:39] i want us to think about something here
[27:42] one of the most precious commodities
[27:46] we got all kind of commodities oil gas
[27:50] uh gold all of these wood all these
[27:53] certain things
[27:55] but one of the most precious commodity
[27:58] is time god has given
[28:02] all of us a certain amount of
[28:05] time time
[28:09] is like currency and i asked a question
[28:12] of the day
[28:13] how will you spend the time god
[28:16] gave you
[28:20] you only got so much
[28:23] how are you spending
[28:27] god's time right that's heavy
[28:31] what are you doing with the time
[28:35] god gives you
[28:40] are you putting it to good use are you
[28:43] doing
[28:44] well or are you burying it
[28:49] and wasting the time
[28:52] god gave you think about that
[28:57] the most precious commodity
[29:00] to the person that don't know him
[29:04] in the salvation of your souls
[29:08] god is giving you time
[29:12] every day you wake up in the morning
[29:17] you have another opportunity to make it
[29:20] right
[29:22] how precious for god
[29:26] to give you time to make it right
[29:33] you didn't ask for it you didn't earn it
[29:37] it is freely given
[29:40] but every man his own measure
[29:45] we don't know when this when when our
[29:47] time is going to run out
[29:49] i don't care how much money you got i
[29:51] don't care
[29:52] what it is how popular you are
[29:56] famous how pretty handsome
[30:00] or whatever the case may be you're
[30:03] giving you a lot of time
[30:05] and one day he's gonna come back say
[30:07] what have you done
[30:09] with the time that i've given you
[30:14] amen let's move on
[30:19] we know here that uh
[30:23] the last servant was given
[30:27] one talent by his master and he hid it
[30:30] in the earth
[30:32] and was slowful
[30:36] with what he had been given
[30:40] and then we see that he was cast over
[30:42] into outer darkness now
[30:44] i'm not going to get into that because
[30:46] there's a there's a lot there
[30:49] so but we're looking at this question of
[30:53] what it means to be a good and faithful
[30:55] servant
[30:56] he said well done not good and faithful
[30:58] servant
[31:00] no doubt there's a lot of people that's
[31:02] doing things and spending the time very
[31:03] well
[31:04] i there's a certain uh
[31:07] uh uh a group of people that they come
[31:10] and
[31:10] and they'll knock on your door i mean
[31:13] they don't kind of got away from it a
[31:14] little bit but that's
[31:15] you know they knock on your doe and they
[31:18] they
[31:19] they spending their time man i tell you
[31:22] what man i admire y'all out here doing
[31:24] this
[31:25] you're wrong but i you know it's i'm you
[31:28] know that's real good what you're doing
[31:30] i like that
[31:31] you know but they believe in their
[31:34] hearts
[31:34] and their heart of hearts that they're
[31:36] doing well
[31:40] they believe in their heart of hearts
[31:41] that they're spending their time well
[31:45] but so they came
[31:50] your the spending of your time
[31:55] your well-doing is directly connected
[32:00] to the will of god there's no reason it
[32:03] would do me no good to get out here and
[32:04] start hammering away on the ark i am not
[32:07] well doing yeah that's not that's not
[32:10] the revelation of the age that we're
[32:13] living in
[32:15] amen the catholic we look at
[32:18] maybe they they they go to mass every
[32:21] morning and they might say 100 hail
[32:22] marys
[32:25] maybe you know that maybe people that in
[32:26] their heart of hearts they really feel
[32:27] like they're doing well
[32:30] hey man we look at our baptist brothers
[32:34] and sisters
[32:35] good folk love them
[32:38] and they may go and uh uh uh uh immersed
[32:42] in the water and
[32:43] baptizing in the titles
[32:48] and feel like they're doing real good
[32:49] doing well
[32:52] amen but they but without a revelation
[32:55] amen
[32:59] it's just like kane
[33:03] you know you you you you you're taking
[33:06] the talents and the time and you're
[33:08] and you're spending it but you're
[33:09] spending it unwisely
[33:11] it has to be connected to a revelation
[33:16] of the hour that you're living in
[33:21] amen or you're wasting
[33:27] your time
[33:30] amen kane thought that uh
[33:33] if he uh uh uh uh that his first fruit
[33:35] like cane
[33:37] uh god would have accepted his offering
[33:40] even though it was contrary to the
[33:42] revelation of the hour
[33:45] eve didn't eat an apple amen
[33:48] it was a blood sin and the revelation
[33:52] had to be made known to cain
[33:55] by the example of abel's offering
[34:00] so cain was presented with truth
[34:06] even though he had he he he he was
[34:09] he's presented with truth by abel's
[34:11] offering but he would not accept it
[34:15] he turned it down
[34:20] talking about well doing
[34:24] proverbs the 14th chapter 12th verse
[34:26] says
[34:27] there is a way that seemeth right unto
[34:29] man
[34:30] but in the end thereof are the ways of
[34:34] death
[34:37] amen to be a good
[34:40] and faithful servant
[34:43] you must multiply the talents
[34:47] given to you for the age that you live
[34:50] in
[34:52] there have been many talents given out
[34:57] in this age to all servants of this age
[35:02] those talents are connected
[35:05] directly and indirectly to the head
[35:09] servant of this
[35:10] age which god
[35:13] used to bring forth the restoration
[35:17] he was the first wave sheet
[35:21] amen so
[35:24] the word as he promised for this
[35:28] hour so our work
[35:31] is to be involved in the same work
[35:35] of using our gift
[35:38] talents to advance the revelation of
[35:42] this
[35:42] hour in whatever capacity
[35:47] we are called to serve in
[35:51] if we are called to serve the lord by
[35:54] supporting the ministry
[35:57] by helping in the church service
[36:01] by being a part of the body of believers
[36:05] being faithful part of the body
[36:10] then that is being faithful and well
[36:14] doing and you will hear those words
[36:18] well done that good and faithful servant
[36:22] amen we know that in the parable of the
[36:27] prodigal son
[36:29] he failed to take the right course of
[36:32] action
[36:34] we look at the prodigal son and and uh
[36:37] he got weary
[36:38] and well doing he went to his father and
[36:42] said i i i want my i want all i want my
[36:44] money now
[36:46] you know i'm tired of doing this i want
[36:48] to go out
[36:50] i want to explore i want to go do my own
[36:53] thing
[36:56] and we know the story he he went out and
[36:59] uh
[37:01] spent all his money you know just
[37:05] living living like he wanted
[37:08] how they said that they were living his
[37:10] best life
[37:12] doing all he wanted to do but he found
[37:16] himself in this in a situation
[37:19] where uh uh he broke
[37:22] and and destitute
[37:26] now i want to point out in in this story
[37:28] that
[37:29] he he didn't lose his salvation
[37:34] he lost a joy of his salvation
[37:39] because he was a son he was a son he was
[37:42] a son
[37:44] he that that didn't change
[37:47] amen but he made his way back home
[37:52] but in his not well doing
[37:56] or his
[38:01] unrighteous act what he did lose
[38:04] was his reward at the end he lost his
[38:09] inheritance
[38:12] it was directly connected
[38:15] to his reward we look at galatians
[38:20] amen um the sixth chapter the seventh
[38:24] verse says be not deceived
[38:27] god is not mark whatsoever a man soweth
[38:31] that shall he read
[38:35] for he that sought in the flesh
[38:38] shall of the flesh reap corruption but
[38:41] he that soweth
[38:43] to the spirit shall of the spirit
[38:47] reap ever reap life everlasting
[38:50] and let us not be weary in well doing
[38:53] for in due season we shall reap if we
[38:57] faint if we faint not amen
[39:02] now looking at this going back to the
[39:04] opening scripture there looking at
[39:06] how cain amen his accountants
[39:10] had fallen he was uh he was
[39:14] he was rough because he wanted to serve
[39:16] god
[39:18] in his age the way that he thought god
[39:23] should receive his sacrifice i'm gonna
[39:25] say that again
[39:26] he wanted to serve god in the way that
[39:28] he
[39:29] thought god should receive his sacrifice
[39:36] and god would not accept it that way
[39:40] cain thought he had done well but he
[39:43] hadn't done well
[39:45] because his what a service and a
[39:49] sacrifice
[39:50] with the contrary revelation is no
[39:53] service at all
[39:55] it is a disservice
[40:00] if thou doest well thou
[40:03] shalt not be accepted
[40:06] and if thou i'm sorry if thou do as well
[40:09] thou shalt
[40:10] not if thou do its well shall not be
[40:12] accepted
[40:13] he put it in the form of a question and
[40:15] if thou do as well not then sin lies at
[40:17] the door
[40:19] well doing is to come into the obedience
[40:24] of the revelation of god for the hour
[40:28] in which you live in well-doing
[40:32] is coming into the obedience of the
[40:35] revelation of god for this day
[40:41] our service and our sacrifice in this
[40:44] hour
[40:45] is to express the revelation of the word
[40:49] in the season for which we are living in
[40:54] and this is the season now that we were
[40:58] that we are to become one
[41:03] with the word this is the season
[41:08] amen that we are to unite
[41:11] with the word amen the prophet said it
[41:15] like they say we are to lay in the
[41:17] presence of the revealed word
[41:19] so that we that's where that all the
[41:22] greenness will be
[41:23] baked out of us and so that we can
[41:26] become
[41:27] one in marriage with christ
[41:30] himself that is the program
[41:34] of god for this time
[41:40] if ye do well
[41:43] weary not in well doing
[41:48] for in due season we will receive
[41:52] the things that he's promised
[41:56] amen we see here
[42:02] what is it to be well doing it is to
[42:06] manifest the will of god
[42:09] and the revelation of the age it is to
[42:13] serve
[42:14] god's purpose
[42:17] in your life to serve god's purpose
[42:21] in your life not to serve god's purpose
[42:25] in my life
[42:27] not me to serve god's purpose in your
[42:30] life i got to serve god's purpose in my
[42:32] life
[42:36] see the gospel uh uh is it it's like a
[42:39] a a a a a a show say a dark theater
[42:44] you ever go and and you have the ushers
[42:47] and they have their flashlights and
[42:50] the theater is dark but you
[42:54] purchased your ticket you have your
[42:57] token
[42:59] and your token has a number on it that
[43:03] identifies and matches up to a specific
[43:06] seat in that auditorium
[43:10] i don't care how late you come to the
[43:13] show
[43:14] that is still your seat
[43:18] paid for you didn't pay for it
[43:22] he paid for it and it's your seat
[43:26] you got the token
[43:29] amen so
[43:32] the usher would leave take his
[43:35] flashlight
[43:37] and he walked down the dark theater
[43:40] so that he can see where we're going
[43:44] without the flashlight because the
[43:46] theater is dark
[43:48] you wouldn't know when you see that you
[43:52] wouldn't be able to find
[43:53] your way to your seat you may stumble
[43:57] and fall
[43:59] you may you may wind up somewhere where
[44:02] you ain't even supposed to be
[44:04] but this usher is to lead you
[44:09] shining the light before you
[44:13] to your seat and if he gets dead in your
[44:17] seat
[44:19] and somebody is sitting in your seat
[44:22] excuse me sir you got to get up
[44:26] this is not your seat so don't worry
[44:29] about
[44:30] what somebody else is doing
[44:33] they got a seat you got to see
[44:38] make sure amen that you are doing
[44:42] what you can what you have to do
[44:45] to serve god's purpose
[44:49] find your seat
[44:53] find your seat because he said
[44:57] if it's being a part of the body of
[44:59] believers
[45:00] if i was to put on a show there's no
[45:03] reason for me to have a show with a
[45:05] bunch of empty seats
[45:07] i serving nobody but you are
[45:10] part of the body for that to be a
[45:14] successful show
[45:15] it has to be the people performing
[45:19] and the audience everybody in place
[45:24] now it's perfect everybody's in their
[45:28] place
[45:30] everybody's in their position we can go
[45:33] home
[45:35] amen no matter how late you could be the
[45:39] last one coming through the door
[45:42] there's one seat left what's your token
[45:45] number
[45:46] one there it is that's your seat
[45:51] so you don't have to be concerned about
[45:53] somebody taking your seat
[45:56] or uh uh or what am i suppose
[46:04] i remember one time i'll give a quick
[46:06] testimony
[46:09] oh i was i was i was i was a young
[46:14] young young lad about 16 17.
[46:18] and everybody know my brother was a was
[46:21] a just a dynamite song leader
[46:25] and i would serve the lord you know
[46:27] whatever could pass
[46:28] i i can't sing like that boy boy's
[46:31] insane
[46:32] i get up then and just i get in line
[46:35] with him and in tune with him and
[46:36] and have a good time but that was his
[46:39] calling
[46:40] that was his that was his purpose so i i
[46:43] can remember we was going we went home
[46:45] after a really good service
[46:48] sister bird my mom was in the kitchen
[46:52] and i i went in and i was just kind of
[46:55] puzzled and
[46:56] just kind of i said what does the lord
[46:58] have for me to do
[47:01] this was the question that i asked her
[47:05] and she she gave me a real good talk and
[47:08] i
[47:10] she said the lord has what he has for
[47:12] you is just for you
[47:16] and we had a little conversation and i
[47:18] it was probably somewhere in the
[47:19] neighborhood of nine
[47:20] ten o'clock at night after service so it
[47:23] was late
[47:24] i went outside and i leaned up against
[47:28] the car
[47:29] i'll never forget and
[47:33] i held my head down and i began to pray
[47:37] say lord what is your will for my life
[47:42] what what is it that you would have me
[47:44] to do
[47:47] and i i just felt lost
[47:52] and i had my head down
[47:55] my eyes were closed
[47:58] and when i i said that prayer i opened
[48:01] my eyes and i looked up
[48:04] there was a cloud in the form of an
[48:08] angel one wing
[48:12] was down at his body and the other wing
[48:15] was outstretched and he said
[48:20] come unto me i got you
[48:24] and it was just so plain i began to weep
[48:29] and i said oh lord is that you
[48:32] and i put my head back down and i began
[48:36] to pray again
[48:38] and i looked back up to see this sight
[48:42] and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
[48:46] i looked all around where where did the
[48:48] cloud go
[48:50] there wasn't a cloud nowhere
[48:53] i couldn't find a cloud nowhere that was
[48:56] the law
[48:59] that just let you know that each and
[49:01] every one
[49:03] he has a place that is just for you
[49:08] that is just for you
[49:12] how are you going to spend the time that
[49:13] he gives you
[49:16] he gave you a spike he gave you a seat
[49:19] are you going to show up and take your
[49:21] seat
[49:24] are you going to leave your seat empty
[49:26] it's your seat no one else can sit there
[49:30] amen
[49:41] what he has called you to be in this
[49:43] hour
[49:46] is to serve god's purpose and his will
[49:52] to the resurrection to serve his purpose
[49:57] not our purpose his purpose
[50:01] the bible says in second corinthians
[50:04] the ninth chapter the sixth and the
[50:07] seventh verse
[50:09] he says but this i say
[50:14] he which soweth sparingly
[50:18] shall reap also sparingly
[50:22] and he that soweth bountifully shall
[50:26] reap
[50:27] also bountifully
[50:30] every man according
[50:34] has he purpose in his heart
[50:39] so let him give not grudgingly
[50:43] or out of necessity for god
[50:46] loves a cheerful giver
[50:57] studying well doing
[51:00] doing well recently
[51:07] i saw a little uh
[51:10] a little uh a post
[51:16] of uh senator lewis his passing
[51:20] and there was another minister i think
[51:22] right
[51:24] and the caption said that these
[51:28] men lived a purposeful life
[51:33] they lived a life of purpose and
[51:36] i pondered on that and i thought i said
[51:38] you know that that's just wonderful
[51:41] and i thought about our lord and savior
[51:46] and how we are to live a purposeful
[51:49] life
[51:54] jesus came to the rich young ruler and
[51:56] said sell
[51:58] all that you have
[52:01] and give to the poor give it away
[52:06] see the the mystery in that is that i
[52:08] gave it to you
[52:10] all the riches that you have all of the
[52:12] things that you have
[52:14] it came from me so what i want you to do
[52:20] is to give it away i didn't give it to
[52:23] you
[52:24] to bury it i gave it to you
[52:28] to give it away
[52:32] and the second part of that commandment
[52:34] was to give it away
[52:36] and come follow me he couldn't do it
[52:41] he couldn't give it away
[52:45] the things that god gave you he gave you
[52:47] life
[52:49] he gave you breath
[52:53] he gave you understanding
[52:57] he gave you knowledge he gave you love
[53:02] he gave you peace
[53:06] give it away share it
[53:10] give it to those who are less fortunate
[53:14] and come follow jesus amen
[53:20] amen thank you
[53:27] study and well-doing amen
[53:31] you know that that that whole saying
[53:33] sort of just get
[53:35] watered down today you know so many
[53:39] people
[53:39] believe that they're doing well and
[53:42] we're not going to burst anybody's bob i
[53:44] don't mean to do that
[53:46] but according to the scripture
[53:50] you know i i don't want you to get to
