[50:48] this morning so we thank god
[50:50] uh for that opportunity that he had
[50:53] amen to go there
[50:55] praise the lord um
[50:58] let's turn our bibles to a uh a
[51:00] scripture here in
[51:02] john chapter one
[51:04] last week and we had a wonderful time
[51:06] with brother diggs and man and um you
[51:10] know he
[51:11] uh he
[51:12] he it kind of picked up where we were in
[51:15] in some of our messages we had just
[51:17] preached the message on traits and he
[51:18] came and just hit
[51:20] all of that and uh and then i had
[51:23] another sermon that i was just waiting
[51:24] to preach here uh this morning and and
[51:27] he stepped right into that with uh
[51:29] uh with his uh uh the scriptures and you
[51:31] know we'll probably go from a different
[51:33] angle
[51:34] uh than what he presented to us but
[51:36] nonetheless it is the word of god amen
[51:40] and we trust that we'll all be blessed
[51:42] amen by this so let's uh let's look at
[51:44] this uh john chapter one
[51:47] amen
[51:48] uh
[51:49] verse one says in the beginning was the
[51:50] word and the word was with god
[51:54] and the word
[51:55] was
[51:57] god
[51:58] amen the same was in the beginning
[52:01] with god
[52:02] all things were made by him
[52:04] and without him was not anything
[52:07] made
[52:08] that was made
[52:10] and i'm skipping over to verse 10 uh in
[52:14] the same
[52:16] chapter
[52:17] i'm gonna i got a little ring coming
[52:18] back to me here just maybe lower my
[52:21] mommy just a little bit
[52:22] um
[52:24] it says here in verse 10 says
[52:26] he was in the world
[52:28] and the world was made by him
[52:31] and the world knew him not
[52:34] uh he came into his own in his own
[52:36] received him not can you imagine all
[52:38] this just just just i mean ponder
[52:41] you know what john is was speaking to us
[52:44] here
[52:45] he says but as many as received him to
[52:47] them gave he power to become the sons of
[52:49] god
[52:50] even to them that believe on his name
[52:53] which were born
[52:55] not of blood
[52:57] nor
[52:58] of the will of the flesh
[53:00] nor of the will of man
[53:03] but of god
[53:05] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[53:07] among us and we built we beheld his
[53:09] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[53:12] of the father full of grace and truth
[53:15] let's just bow in a word of prayer
[53:17] lord jesus we are
[53:20] grateful
[53:21] for the opportunity to read the
[53:23] scripture

[54:46] of god
[54:48] and um
[54:50] when
[54:52] i i'm just i was just kind of i'm gonna
[54:55] hit another another passage of scripture
[54:57] here in a second
[54:58] and um
[55:00] but
[55:02] i was just uh really really blessed by
[55:05] this scripture that we just read and you
[55:07] know last week when when brother um
[55:10] diggs had actually
[55:12] read it i said this was the one that i
[55:14] needed
[55:15] uh
[55:16] because it it connected with something
[55:18] else that i that i had so just bear with
[55:21] me here
[55:22] uh
[55:23] i'm just looking at this
[55:26] as we just read here you know in the
[55:28] bible john 1
[55:30] verse 10 it says
[55:32] he was
[55:33] in the world
[55:35] this is talking about our lord and
[55:37] savior jesus christ
[55:39] he was in the world
[55:41] and the world was made by him
[55:44] and the world knew him not
[55:47] this just really strikes me the creator
[55:51] of you know of the universe
[55:54] the one that spoke let there be
[55:57] had become flesh
[56:00] and here he was dwelling
[56:03] amongst mankind
[56:05] amen um
[56:07] my
[56:08] uh if i could just use words like this
[56:10] he was
[56:11] going to school every day
[56:15] come on somebody
[56:16] and and as he was approaching school
[56:19] these kids had no idea
[56:23] who was their student
[56:25] the the student that was next to them
[56:29] when the teacher would call him up to
[56:30] the board
[56:32] and he would figure out the math problem
[56:34] the teacher had no idea
[56:37] who this child was
[56:40] right uh maybe the neighbors a man in
[56:42] the neighborhood had no idea who was
[56:45] living next to them
[56:47] right i want you to try to get this amen
[56:50] in your mind when he when he went to
[56:52] work praise god because his uh he he was
[56:56] a carpenter amen when he went to work
[56:58] the co-workers had no idea
[57:01] who was working next to them this is the
[57:03] creator of mankind
[57:06] this is the one that gave you breath to
[57:08] breathe
[57:10] hallelujah this is the one that put life
[57:12] in your body
[57:14] this is the one that's made a way out of
[57:16] no way this is the one when you when you
[57:18] when you when you heard the testimonies
[57:20] in church about god opening up a red sea
[57:24] amen when you heard the testimonies
[57:26] about a man a lion's den
[57:28] and an alliance not being able to to
[57:31] take advantage of daniel when you heard
[57:33] about the three hebrew boys in a fire
[57:35] and a fourth man stepped in this is the
[57:39] one that is standing there
[57:41] this is the one that is sitting there
[57:45] he came into this world
[57:48] came into this world the bible tells us
[57:50] this he was in the world and the world
[57:53] was made by him
[57:55] good god almighty
[57:57] and the world knew him not
[58:00] you know it it it just it i have to say
[58:03] it somewhat bothers me
[58:05] that they didn't know how how is it that
[58:07] they miss uh the lord jesus how is it
[58:10] that they missed it right because um you
[58:13] know the same way today i want to put it

[58:48] there just teaching a class
[58:50] glory to god amen there's a daughter of
[58:53] god walking into your presence every day
[58:56] there's a son of god walking into your
[58:59] presence every day the world knows us
[59:02] not
[59:04] we're not just an ordinary church we're
[59:07] not just another group of people sitting
[59:09] here gathered we have come from god and
[59:12] we're going back to god we know who we
[59:15] are
[59:17] blessed be the name of the lord and our
[59:19] names may not be written in who's who
[59:22] but we know our names are written on the
[59:24] lamb's book of life
[59:28] oh hallelujah church
[59:31] i think it's important that we recognize
[59:32] who we are even though the world didn't
[59:34] know jesus jesus knew who he was
[59:37] and you know and and i think you know
[59:38] there we will get to this in a little
[59:40] bit but there were there was some in the
[59:43] world that knew who he was
[59:45] and and and one of them amen that that i
[59:48] believe it clicked
[59:50] uh somewhere along the way that this
[59:51] wasn't just an ordinary baby
[59:54] right i mean mary got a revelation at
[59:56] some point in time because um when jesus
[59:59] came of a certain age and and the family
[1:00:01] hadn't been invited to a wedding
[1:00:04] and here they all are headed to this
[1:00:05] wedding and and when they get there to
[1:00:08] the wedding uh you know somehow some way
[1:00:11] they run out of wine
[1:00:13] glory to god and and mary though uh i
[1:00:16] believe it's just my imagination i
[1:00:18] believe mary had gone through certain
[1:00:20] things in the home
[1:00:22] where she knew that when trouble arose
[1:00:24] she could go to jesus
[1:00:27] hallelujah we got to know the same thing
[1:00:29] when trouble arrives as we can go to
[1:00:32] jesus
[1:00:34] hallelujah you might not be able to get
[1:00:36] to mama you might not be able to get to
[1:00:39] daddy
[1:00:40] glory to god when you call maybe that
[1:00:42] they're busy and they can't take the
[1:00:44] telephone call but you can always call
[1:00:46] on jesus
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:00:50] and he's always there to answer
[1:00:52] but maybe mary had some experiences
[1:00:54] there in the house that she could give
[1:00:56] the people advice they now whatever he
[1:00:58] tells you to do just do it
[1:01:01] oh glory it may it may sound crazy
[1:01:04] it may sound ridiculous but if he tells
[1:01:07] you to do it just do it
[1:01:10] and hear a mary saying no now this is
[1:01:12] what you do so jesus come and say now
[1:01:14] i'll tell you what it's really before my
[1:01:15] time but but just go get some water pops
[1:01:18] and fill them up with water and just you
[1:01:20] know just get water pots and just bring
[1:01:21] them and and they're uh and at this
[1:01:24] wedding glory to god he turns the water
[1:01:27] into wine
[1:01:29] right she had a she had a revelation she
[1:01:31] had an understanding of who this was
[1:01:34] this was the creator
[1:01:36] that was in her presence
[1:01:39] glory to god and i believe everybody
[1:01:40] else that tasted of that wine also knew
[1:01:43] the creator was present they never seen
[1:01:46] a man turn water
[1:01:47] into wine
[1:01:48] glory to god now i want to just maybe
[1:01:50] read something here because uh i'm i'm
[1:01:53] kind of uh intertwining some things here
[1:01:56] uh my title's beloved now we are the
[1:01:59] children of god see i mean jesus
[1:02:01] certainly was the the first begotten of
[1:02:03] the father but but we're also sons of
[1:02:06] god we're also daughters of god we are
[1:02:08] the children of god
[1:02:10] now i want to just read something and
[1:02:11] and my prayers that um
[1:02:14] in recognizing who we are we'll come to
[1:02:16] uh our spirit man will get settled amen
[1:02:20] that you know we don't have to be
[1:02:22] worried about this and worried about
[1:02:23] that we are the children of god now i
[1:02:25] want you to understand i want to i don't
[1:02:26] want to i want to say this we're not uh
[1:02:29] using that in a way of arrogance
[1:02:32] amen but it's just recognizing that as a
[1:02:35] son of god the devil can only go so far
[1:02:38] only as far as god will let him
[1:02:41] hallelujah somebody some of us should
[1:02:43] have already been dead
[1:02:46] accidents that we had and all kind of
[1:02:48] other things that we ran into the reason
[1:02:50] you are not going right now because god
[1:02:52] said not so
[1:02:57] hallelujah
[1:02:58] god said not so
[1:03:00] amen if satan has boundaries he can only
[1:03:03] go so far
[1:03:04] now as children god we got to go through
[1:03:07] things now understand that that's part
[1:03:09] of life we're going to have some trials
[1:03:10] we're going to have some distresses
[1:03:12] we're going to have some tribulation
[1:03:13] that is part of this journey even jesus
[1:03:16] had to go to the cross
[1:03:19] so we're not running from trials and
[1:03:20] we're not trying to stop that it's
[1:03:22] through that that our characters develop
[1:03:25] so we thank god for it but but i want i
[1:03:27] want to say it's not a place of
[1:03:28] arrogance but it's a place of certainty
[1:03:32] i know who i am in christ
[1:03:34] i am a son of god
[1:03:36] i am a daughter of god
[1:03:39] amen look at this now i want to read

[1:10:40] ghost people today they got a lot of
[1:10:42] fear the devil's just trying to scare
[1:10:43] you out of something he's trying to put
[1:10:45] something off somewhere else
[1:10:47] say some of these days you'll be this
[1:10:49] you are
[1:10:51] now
[1:10:52] now we're sons of god
[1:10:54] now we're seated together in heavenly
[1:10:57] places now
[1:10:58] we have all powers in heaven and earth
[1:11:02] see now we have it not in the millennium
[1:11:06] we won't need it then we got it now
[1:11:10] glory hallelujah and if we got it now we
[1:11:12] ought to use it now
[1:11:14] amen uh he says uh right it says uh uh
[1:11:18] uh
[1:11:19] uh now we are the sons of god it does
[1:11:21] not appear what we shall be but we know
[1:11:25] we should we will be like him what you
[1:11:27] are here is a reflection of what you are
[1:11:30] somewhere else
[1:11:32] those who he called he justified is that
[1:11:35] right those who he justified he have
[1:11:37] glorified already in the presence of the
[1:11:41] father we have a glorified body he says
[1:11:44] woo wasn't that deep all right we'll
[1:11:46] find out whether it's right or not if
[1:11:48] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:11:51] have one already waiting is that right
[1:11:53] that's right so right now uh what we are
[1:11:56] there is a reflection what we are here
[1:11:59] is a reflection of where we are
[1:12:00] somewhere else so if your deeds are evil
[1:12:04] you know where it comes from you know
[1:12:06] where your other body's waiting
[1:12:10] that's if your deeds are evil
[1:12:13] but if your deeds are good and righteous
[1:12:15] you also know where your other body
[1:12:18] is waiting
[1:12:19] glory to god glory to god i thank the
[1:12:21] lord for this amen now i want to slip
[1:12:24] into another little thought here
[1:12:26] um as we just you know again the
[1:12:28] scripture tells that he came to his own
[1:12:31] uh
[1:12:32] they didn't receive him not only that he
[1:12:34] was in the world the world knew him not
[1:12:36] and then he came to his own his own
[1:12:37] receiving not just just
[1:12:39] very negative
[1:12:40] you know when you look at the world
[1:12:42] don't know him the very place that he
[1:12:44] created they have no idea who he is and
[1:12:46] then the ones that he's coming
[1:12:47] specifically for
[1:12:49] actually reject them
[1:12:51] think about it they actually reject the
[1:12:53] word i mean these are the ones that he's
[1:12:54] coming to die for and they reject him
[1:12:58] that's a sad situation to be in right i
[1:13:00] mean you you can imagine you know just
[1:13:03] as a just as a human certain people that
[1:13:06] you might want to i want to do this and
[1:13:07] i want to do that maybe for a family
[1:13:09] member for a loved one i want to do this
[1:13:10] and you do it and they reject you
[1:13:13] it's not a good feeling
[1:13:14] but yet he does it anyway
[1:13:17] hallelujah
[1:13:18] now look at this i want to just kind of
[1:13:20] pick up something out of the message
[1:13:21] expectation
[1:13:23] the prophet says all right now
[1:13:26] let's give
[1:13:27] a little drama here let's give a little
[1:13:29] drama here
[1:13:31] it says let's say there's a prayer room
[1:13:34] out at the temple
[1:13:36] say it's monday morning
[1:13:38] and oh there's about 2 million something
[1:13:40] jews in palestine then
[1:13:42] probably many hundred children was born
[1:13:45] overnight
[1:13:47] right he's given a drama says and every
[1:13:48] day there would be a line of women
[1:13:51] lined up there for circumcision of the
[1:13:53] male child
[1:13:55] offering turtle doves of lambs if if it
[1:13:58] was a peasant they had turtle doves it
[1:14:01] was a rich person a lamb he says a lamb
[1:14:03] the rich person
[1:14:04] says for the purification of the mother
[1:14:07] and circumcision of the child and so

[1:16:27] no clothes you talk about poor
[1:16:31] there's not a family in phoenix that
[1:16:33] poor charity would do more for you than
[1:16:36] that but he was the very god of creation
[1:16:40] standing here born in a manger come by
[1:16:43] the way of a manger and went out the way
[1:16:46] of capital punishment came to his own in
[1:16:48] the world and the world was made by him
[1:16:51] the world knew him not and he was laying
[1:16:53] there in his mother's arms rapping
[1:16:55] wrapped in swallowing clothes now i want
[1:16:57] to you know just inject a little bit
[1:16:59] here before i go further amen and and
[1:17:02] that particular quote actually i'm going
[1:17:04] to be kind of moving around uh back and
[1:17:06] forth uh i'm going to probably next i'm
[1:17:09] going to go back to the
[1:17:10] uh raising gyros door and i'm going to
[1:17:12] go back to that but i'm going to come
[1:17:13] back to this expectations but let me
[1:17:15] just kind of move around here a little
[1:17:16] bit amen as i you know i'm just looking
[1:17:19] at a lord and savior
[1:17:21] a man uh
[1:17:23] coming to the earth and and looking at
[1:17:25] how humble it was his parents so poor
[1:17:28] you i mean i'm talking about god god
[1:17:31] could have made a decision to come
[1:17:33] uh through a palace
[1:17:35] he could have been born in a house where
[1:17:37] there was a king already on the earth
[1:17:38] but but he didn't do it that way amen
[1:17:42] he came to a man a place where they i
[1:17:44] mean they could barely rub two nickels
[1:17:47] together
[1:17:48] i want you to think about it
[1:17:50] amen here you know he chooses just this
[1:17:52] couple uh that he's gonna use as as you
[1:17:56] know uh amen just just thought he could
[1:17:58] become kin to mankind i want to put it
[1:18:00] that way we know that moses i mean mary
[1:18:02] was not his mother and joseph was not
[1:18:04] his father amen it was god created this
[1:18:07] entire body inside of mary mary's just
[1:18:10] an incubator carrying a man christ
[1:18:13] but they did have a responsibility to to
[1:18:15] raise him and to teach him and to and to
[1:18:18] do all these things they had that
[1:18:19] responsibility but yet he was god in the
[1:18:21] flesh i want to i want to say this jesus
[1:18:24] was more than the cousin of john the
[1:18:27] baptist
[1:18:29] glory hallelujah jesus was more than a
[1:18:33] teacher when they called him rabbi he
[1:18:36] was more than just a teacher amen jesus
[1:18:39] was more than a carpenter
[1:18:42] hallelujah amen jesus was the second
[1:18:45] adam who came to redeem his own
[1:18:49] glory to god the reason the world could
[1:18:51] not receive him is because the world was
[1:18:53] not his own but he came to redeem his
[1:18:56] own
[1:18:59] jesus was god in the flesh
[1:19:02] this is what we read in scripture the
[1:19:04] word was made the word was made flesh
[1:19:07] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:19:08] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:19:11] of the father full of grace and truth
[1:19:14] i remember you know a little story here
[1:19:17] of a sister brother branham ran into a
[1:19:20] she said he says you know um
[1:19:22] you brag too much on jesus
[1:19:25] so you brag too much on him you say you
[1:19:27] try to make him divine he said oh my
[1:19:29] sister
[1:19:30] i can't brag enough on the lord jesus
[1:19:32] i can't preach enough about the lord
[1:19:34] jesus i can't talk enough about the lord
[1:19:36] jesus she said you just brag too much on
[1:19:38] jesus she said i can show you in your
[1:19:40] own bible where he was not divine he
[1:19:42] said you can show me in the bible where
[1:19:43] jesus was not divine she said please
[1:19:45] pull up that scripture for me sis and
[1:19:47] she went and turned her bible and and
[1:19:50] she got the story of lazarus and she
[1:19:52] looked and she saw uh the shortest verse
[1:19:54] in the bible two words and she had a she
[1:19:57] thought she was prudent before and said
[1:19:59] so it said right here jesus wept that
[1:20:02] shows how could he be divine and crying
[1:20:04] at the same time
[1:20:05] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:20:08] and i like this because i wrote this
[1:20:09] note he was human enough
[1:20:12] amen to be touched by the infirmity
[1:20:17] but he was god enough
[1:20:19] to raise lazarus from the dead
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:26] and you know brother brother branham
[1:20:28] said sis you know that's a very weak
[1:20:30] argument
[1:20:31] i mean just you got to keep reading the
[1:20:32] rest of that story right because you got
[1:20:35] him you know jesus wept yes he did weep
[1:20:37] as a man he was touched by that he says
[1:20:39] but when he straightened up his
[1:20:41] shoulders
[1:20:42] amen and he said lazarus come forth that
[1:20:45] was more
[1:20:46] than a man that spoke that and the
[1:20:49] prophet even told us had he not called
[1:20:51] lazarus by name everything that was in
[1:20:54] the grave would have come forth at that
[1:20:56] time
[1:20:58] say he was human enough that when he got
[1:21:00] a little weary and wanted to lay on the
[1:21:02] back of a boat amen as he was going
[1:21:05] across to the other side he was human
[1:21:07] enough to be tired enough to want to go
[1:21:09] to sleep
[1:21:10] hallelujah but when they woke him out of
[1:21:12] his sleep glory to god because trouble
[1:21:15] was all around
[1:21:17] i'm telling when jesus saw trouble he
[1:21:19] didn't panic
[1:21:20] he shook it off praise god
[1:21:23] he looked at the wind and the waves and
[1:21:26] he said peace be still
[1:21:28] we need to wake up sometime and shake
[1:21:31] some things off and speak to the wind
[1:21:33] and waves in our life peace be still
[1:21:39] glory to god
[1:21:40] hallelujah he said took more than uh
[1:21:43] took more than a man to do things like
[1:21:45] that that was god almighty veiled in
[1:21:48] human flesh
[1:21:50] oh blessed be the name of the lord let
[1:21:52] me uh i think i'ma just keep reading
[1:21:54] here amen and that message expectation

[1:39:34] made it just in time so when brother
[1:39:36] branham's giving us this i mean it's
[1:39:38] just this thought here he's already had
[1:39:40] experiences like this
[1:39:42] amen let's pick it up now amen is to
[1:39:45] talk about simeon how simmons just walk
[1:39:46] him
[1:39:47] glory keep walking
[1:39:49] glory glory glory is that far enough
[1:39:51] lord just keep walking walks over and
[1:39:53] sees where this line of women well i
[1:39:56] think i'll walk down and as he got
[1:39:58] closer something began to move on him
[1:40:00] don't you believe that led by the spirit
[1:40:03] of god sons of god the promise is there
[1:40:07] the messiah
[1:40:08] was in the temple the very one that the
[1:40:11] holy ghost promised him he walks down
[1:40:15] he sees this little woman he reaches
[1:40:19] over and he takes that baby out of her
[1:40:21] arms tears running off his white beard
[1:40:24] now he was drawn to the one that had the
[1:40:26] swaddling cloth
[1:40:29] oh hallelujah amen simian is drawn to
[1:40:32] this one right so he says reaches over
[1:40:34] takes the baby out of her arms tears
[1:40:36] running off his white beard said now
[1:40:38] lord
[1:40:39] let thy servant depart in peace
[1:40:42] according to thy words for my eyes have
[1:40:45] seen your salvation oh my
[1:40:47] lead of the holy ghost yes he was
[1:40:50] expecting to see him and if he was
[1:40:52] expecting to see him god is under
[1:40:54] obligation to let him see him
[1:40:58] see there were some people that was
[1:40:59] looking for him simeon was one of those
[1:41:01] and at the same time you know she came
[1:41:03] and you go back and read it in in the
[1:41:05] scripture
[1:41:07] uh
[1:41:08] i i wrote it down i don't have it in
[1:41:10] front of me i think it's in the book of
[1:41:11] luke there but you can go back yeah luke
[1:41:13] chapter two you can pick up the whole
[1:41:14] thing but anna was there also as a
[1:41:16] witness that's just to prove that it was
[1:41:18] the lord jesus he was not just another
[1:41:21] child coming to be dedicated amen he was
[1:41:23] just uh amen this was the god of heaven
[1:41:26] that was coming the redeemer that was
[1:41:29] coming salvation was coming you know and
[1:41:32] as i thought about this because
[1:41:34] beloved now we are the children of god
[1:41:38] let's pick up a scripture
[1:41:39] let's pick up a scripture first john 3
[1:41:42] first john 3 i was
[1:41:44] at my house a few weeks ago and
[1:41:47] and uh
[1:41:49] i was just trying to read a little
[1:41:50] scripture before we leave amen in the
[1:41:53] morning we have a word of prayer and we
[1:41:54] read a scripture
[1:41:56] and and that morning i just you know
[1:41:58] picked up this and i started reading it
[1:41:59] and as i picked it up i said my this
[1:42:02] this really speaks to me but here in 1st
[1:42:04] john chapter 3 verse 1 and 2
[1:42:08] it says behold what man of love
[1:42:12] the father hath bestowed upon us
[1:42:15] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:42:19] therefore therefore the world knoweth us
[1:42:22] not
[1:42:24] because it knew him not now that that's
[1:42:26] the part that really got me the world
[1:42:29] knoweth us not
[1:42:31] because it knew him not
[1:42:33] when you you you you students that are
[1:42:35] amen going to school
[1:42:38] your your classmates have no idea who
[1:42:40] you are those of you that report to work
[1:42:43] amen every day your co-workers have no
[1:42:47] idea who you are
[1:42:49] they don't realize a son of god or
[1:42:51] daughter god had just walked into the
[1:42:53] room
[1:42:54] oh hallelujah
[1:42:56] they have no idea what they're connected
[1:42:59] with
[1:43:00] and i was saying earlier jesus was not
[1:43:01] just the cousin of john the baptist i
[1:43:04] want you to know something your family
[1:43:06] don't even know
[1:43:07] who you are
[1:43:11] this is my cousin ah
[1:43:13] i'm i'm more than your cousin
[1:43:18] i mean in mary and joseph's case he was
[1:43:21] more than a
[1:43:22] son right he was more than a brother
[1:43:26] to them siblings he was more than that
[1:43:28] hallelujah it's time for amen us to
[1:43:31] first recognize who we are
[1:43:34] because here the scripture says uh the
[1:43:37] world knoweth us not
[1:43:40] because it knew him not
[1:43:42] amen beloved now
[1:43:45] are we the sons of god we uh and and it
[1:43:48] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[1:43:51] we know that when he shall appear we
[1:43:54] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:43:56] as he is
[1:43:58] now as i was just you know thinking
[1:43:59] about you know this this
[1:44:01] just pondering on this this poor family
[1:44:05] glory that's coming to the temple one
[1:44:07] day just to offer
[1:44:09] uh uh for purification for the mother
[1:44:11] and you know dedication of this child
[1:44:13] and everything and nobody really
[1:44:14] understood here these these these
[1:44:16] sisters are just talking oh that that's
[1:44:18] her look at her that's the one that you
[1:44:20] know
[1:44:21] had that babe without being married and
[1:44:22] she said
[1:44:24] she said the holy ghost came have you
[1:44:27] even ever heard of anything called a
[1:44:29] holy ghost
[1:44:31] this new language she using come on
[1:44:32] what's she expect us to believe we know
[1:44:34] we we know how children are born
[1:44:37] we know but didn't know that that was
[1:44:39] the very their very creator they were
[1:44:41] speaking of like that
[1:44:43] hallelujah as i pondered on it just hit
[1:44:46] me i thought of another poor family that
[1:44:48] came to this earth
[1:44:50] gave birth to a son
[1:44:52] and when this boy was born there just so
[1:44:54] happened to be a a dove i think flying
[1:44:57] through the route flying through the
[1:44:58] room
[1:44:59] amen the supernatural happened when this
[1:45:01] boy was born amen uh this this boy that
[1:45:05] was born in this house a man was
[1:45:07] predestinated by almighty god to fulfill
[1:45:10] certain prophecies in the scripture
[1:45:12] amen he attended school at one time and
[1:45:16] i'm talking so poor he attended school
[1:45:18] one day he went to school with his
[1:45:20] mama's shoe on one foot and his daddy's
[1:45:22] shoe on the other foot you talk about
[1:45:24] paul
[1:45:26] can you imagine a man sending your kids
[1:45:28] out to school like that and it's cold
[1:45:30] and they need to have their feet covered
[1:45:32] so he got to go to school with one mama
[1:45:34] shoe in one daddy's shoe you know he was
[1:45:36] ridiculed for that
[1:45:38] you know he was made fun of for that and
[1:45:40] i thought about what this this young man
[1:45:42] was experiencing throughout his life and
[1:45:44] life and i just wonder how i mean maybe
[1:45:47] most of his classmates had no idea who
[1:45:50] this boy was that had one daddy shoe and
[1:45:53] one mama suit
[1:45:55] they had no idea who this guy was
[1:45:58] amen and they were ridiculing him and
[1:46:00] picking at him and doing everything they
[1:46:02] could amen uh i mean just to try to
[1:46:04] destroy him but they had no idea this
[1:46:06] man was the very fulfillment of
[1:46:08] scripture
[1:46:11] i said little did they know that they
[1:46:13] were attending school with the seventh
[1:46:15] messenger
[1:46:16] of revelation
[1:46:18] uh one two and three
[1:46:20] little did they know that they were
[1:46:21] attending school with the man that was
[1:46:23] fulfilling malachi 4 verse 5 and 6.
[1:46:26] glory to god see the scripture says
[1:46:29] uh uh we came into the world and the
[1:46:31] world didn't know i see the world
[1:46:32] knoweth us not they didn't even know

[1:49:06] john 1 verse 10 through 13 we read a
[1:49:09] little earlier
[1:49:10] says he was in the world
[1:49:13] and the world was made by him
[1:49:15] and the world knew him not
[1:49:17] glory he came into his own and his own
[1:49:19] received him not
[1:49:21] but i love this but as many as received
[1:49:24] him
[1:49:25] that's us to them gave he the power to
[1:49:27] become
[1:49:28] the sons of god
[1:49:30] even to them that believe on his name
[1:49:33] and i want to i want to go another step
[1:49:34] in that because john was writing about
[1:49:36] you when he wrote this
[1:49:37] which were born
[1:49:39] not of blood
[1:49:41] let me tell you something your parents
[1:49:42] didn't plan to have you
[1:49:46] amen and in some situations some of your
[1:49:48] parents say well now you know we really
[1:49:50] wasn't trying yes you were trying if
[1:49:53] they were born you was trying amen but
[1:49:55] now we really weren't trying to have no
[1:49:57] children you a mistake don't let your
[1:49:58] parents tell you that you was a mistake
[1:50:02] i'm i'm because the scripture says that
[1:50:03] you were a man uh which were born not of
[1:50:07] blood
[1:50:08] nor of the will of the flesh
[1:50:10] amen nor of the will of
[1:50:13] man
[1:50:14] but of god i am here because god wanted
[1:50:17] me to be here
[1:50:18] and i couldn't help how i got here amen
[1:50:21] but i'm here because god wanted me to be
[1:50:23] here
[1:50:26] hey
[1:50:27] we're children of god
[1:50:31] amen amen amen so there's something
[1:50:34] greater than my my natural lineage
[1:50:37] yeah there's certain traits that may
[1:50:38] follow through that natural lineage but
[1:50:40] but there's a heavenly trait that's been
[1:50:42] following me
[1:50:43] glory hallelujah hallelujah amen all
[1:50:47] right hey man i wanna i wanna uh pick up
[1:50:51] oh my
[1:50:52] just a a couple of things here let me go
[1:50:54] back to a little little
[1:50:56] little quote that i had
[1:50:58] this is out of smyrna church h
[1:51:02] god came down
[1:51:05] in a blood cell
[1:51:07] not through a man
[1:51:08] by the holy ghost and in that virgin
[1:51:10] womb a tabernacle for the purpose of
[1:51:12] death of death was built
[1:51:15] the seed of the woman came in order that
[1:51:17] he be bruised to bring us our salvation
[1:51:22] when the holy ghost came upon mary he
[1:51:24] created within her womb the cell that
[1:51:26] would multiply and become the body of
[1:51:29] our lord
[1:51:31] that cell was created
[1:51:33] it was the beginning of the creation of
[1:51:36] god
[1:51:37] that is who jesus is and that holy one
[1:51:40] was filled with the holy blood even the
[1:51:42] blood of god
[1:51:44] that tabernacle came to birth he grew to
[1:51:47] be a man he went to jordan and there
[1:51:49] that sacrifice was
[1:51:51] washed of john in the river called
[1:51:53] jordan when the acceptable sacrifice
[1:51:55] rose out of the water god came and in
[1:51:59] dwelt him
[1:52:00] filling him with the spirit without
[1:52:02] measure and when he died and shed his
[1:52:04] blood the perfect life of of out of god
[1:52:06] was liberated to come back upon the
[1:52:08] sinner who accepted the accepted the
[1:52:11] christ as his savior
[1:52:13] look at this
[1:52:14] it says oh how striking it is
[1:52:16] jehovah
[1:52:18] born crying over a manure pile he's in a
[1:52:22] manger right amen uh born crying over a
[1:52:25] manure pile jehovah born in a manger of
[1:52:29] straw
[1:52:30] there is your everlasting sign to the
[1:52:33] proud and puffed up
[1:52:34] pseudo-intellectuals that have evolved
[1:52:36] their own theology and denied the truth
[1:52:39] of god look jehovah
[1:52:42] amen god
[1:52:44] a crying baby
[1:52:46] can you imagine that
[1:52:48] now i'm gonna tell you something amen uh
[1:52:50] you know brother branham says this now
[1:52:52] and i i i'ma just have to take what the
[1:52:54] prophet said
[1:52:55] uh he said that anna was blind
[1:52:58] when she came to jesus you know simeon
[1:53:00] and anna said anna was a blind woman
[1:53:02] that came came to jesus she had spent
[1:53:04] all the years there in the temple you
[1:53:05] know after the husband had passed away
[1:53:07] and he says anna was blind a blind
[1:53:09] prophetess that was coming to the lord
[1:53:10] jesus and i just imagine
[1:53:13] you know she got there and she was um
[1:53:15] uh uh uh just worshipping and praising
[1:53:17] and identifying that this is the savior
[1:53:19] of mankind and i can just imagine even
[1:53:22] as a baby
[1:53:24] knowing who this was
[1:53:26] even as a baby had anna
[1:53:30] maybe picked him up
[1:53:33] and just maybe he
[1:53:35] mistakenly
[1:53:36] you know how babies can get their hands
[1:53:38] and extremities and everything all
[1:53:40] together and maybe just mistakenly
[1:53:43] oh
[1:53:44] yeah
[1:53:45] i just believe if if anna would have
[1:53:48] just got a little touch from jesus
[1:53:50] i think her blindness would have went
[1:53:52] away even without them ever saying a
[1:53:54] prayer
[1:53:55] because the bible say lay hands on the
[1:53:58] sick
[1:53:59] and they shall recover
[1:54:02] i just believe that would have happened
[1:54:05] oh glory to god jehovah
[1:54:09] amen let's look at him now jehovah
[1:54:13] jehovah god a crime baby in a stinking
[1:54:16] barn
[1:54:18] then we think we have a right to be
[1:54:20] proud holding up our nose criticizing
[1:54:23] and acting as though we were somebody
[1:54:26] man here's your real sign this is the
[1:54:28] right one jehovah playing as a boy
[1:54:33] i want to ask if it was jehovah playing
[1:54:35] the day jehovah playing football
[1:54:38] jehovah playing soccer
[1:54:41] jehovah playing basketball
[1:54:43] jehovah playing baseball
[1:54:46] my god wouldn't you want jehovah on your
[1:54:48] team
[1:54:51] and i can imagine every time he got the
[1:54:53] ball
[1:54:54] glory to god maybe they give it to him
[1:54:57] and he start running and guys
[1:54:59] approaching them like they're going to
[1:55:00] tackle him and they just fall down and
[1:55:02] guys can't figure out what is going on
[1:55:04] here this man got some type of shield on
[1:55:07] him
[1:55:08] hallelujah amen he can't be hurt he
[1:55:10] can't be touched and that's the way we
[1:55:12] are we can't be hurt we can't be touched
[1:55:15] when when the devil tries to bring
[1:55:17] something that will hurt us what do we
[1:55:19] do
[1:55:20] glory to god and we keep pressing no
[1:55:23] [Applause]
[1:55:27] amen look at this jehovah playing as a
[1:55:30] boy jehovah working in a carpenter shop
[1:55:33] jehovah washing the feet of fishermen
[1:55:36] i would give you a sign and god another
[1:55:39] sign of white-collar priesthood not the
[1:55:41] sign of wealth and power there's nothing
[1:55:43] in this sign that you want or think
[1:55:45] suitable but it is an everlasting sign
[1:55:48] it is the greatest sign of all jehovah's
[1:55:51] standing in the courtyard
[1:55:53] bruised and bleeding with thorns on his
[1:55:55] brow see i told you we got to go through
[1:55:57] if jesus went through some things we're
[1:55:58] going to have to go through we got to
[1:56:00] face our trials we don't run from them
[1:56:02] amen we run to them amen jehovah amen
[1:56:06] bleeding with thorns on his brown spit
[1:56:08] on his face mocked and said it no
[1:56:10] jehovah despised and rejected hanging
[1:56:14] naked upon the cross
[1:56:17] i want you to get that while the
[1:56:19] hypocrites jeered and dared him to come
[1:56:21] down off the cross jehovah dying
[1:56:25] jehovah praying and nothing happening
[1:56:28] now that one get me right there
[1:56:30] i like that one jehovah praying and
[1:56:33] nothing happened how many of jehovah's
[1:56:35] offspring
[1:56:36] have prayed and seemed like nothing was
[1:56:38] happening
[1:56:39] but i'm gonna tell you when you're
[1:56:40] praying and it seems like nothing's
[1:56:42] happening just be certain of god
[1:56:45] hey i'm gonna tell you even when it
[1:56:47] looked like he not working
[1:56:49] he always working
[1:56:54] he never stopped working can i share
[1:56:56] just a quick testimony
[1:56:57] can i just inject this testimony
[1:57:02] we you know we're here
[1:57:05] in a different season
[1:57:07] we had our church that we were
[1:57:08] fellowshipping under and you know with
[1:57:10] uh there for 13 years but we knew it was
[1:57:12] the almighty god that allowed
[1:57:16] for a uh
[1:57:17] another church to come in and say we
[1:57:19] want to pay market rent for this spot
[1:57:21] market rent was 6 dollars a month
[1:57:24] now i think that's just
[1:57:26] way too much
[1:57:28] to be paying i think that's not good use
[1:57:30] of the finances that god gave us
[1:57:33] so we had to make a decision saying now
[1:57:34] we're not gonna take a three-year lease
[1:57:36] six thousand dollars a month we're not
[1:57:38] gonna do that and then on top of that
[1:57:39] now some of y'all might think this way
[1:57:41] but i don't think it's good as a
[1:57:42] christian to do this
[1:57:44] don't sign your name to a contract and
[1:57:46] say you're gonna do this and then break
[1:57:48] it in the middle of the contract
[1:57:50] that's not christianity
[1:57:52] that's a that's a pair that's a terrible
[1:57:54] testimony if you told them people you're
[1:57:56] going to stay there for three years it
[1:57:57] got to be something supernatural to get
[1:57:58] you out of that
[1:58:00] otherwise you owe them people that money
[1:58:04] we don't say amen to that but it's the
[1:58:06] truth in the house you sign your name to
[1:58:08] that contract
[1:58:10] your name got to be worth something
[1:58:13] so i was i said i'm not going to sign
[1:58:14] the name to the contract like that and
[1:58:16] and and we we owe this for all the time
[1:58:18] and we know that we're believing god to
[1:58:20] to to find our own space we're believing
[1:58:22] god for that so um
[1:58:25] uh you know we we've been working with a
[1:58:27] couple different people we got a
[1:58:29] particular building in our mind that
[1:58:30] we're we want to go after and amen and
[1:58:33] the lord bless me to have conversation
[1:58:35] with the pastor and just you know just
[1:58:36] just inform we're trying to put a formal
[1:58:39] offer together for him that's what we're
[1:58:40] trying to do so god kind of connected us
[1:58:43] through a number of things
[1:58:44] amen my daughter was at work and just
[1:58:47] happened to be working on this guy teeth
[1:58:50] my daughter sarah and and um
[1:58:52] while she cleaned the teeth to hear it

[2:07:20] my position
[2:07:23] oh i love the lord jesus
[2:07:25] let me just read a few more quotes to
[2:07:26] you
[2:07:27] here is out of the message what was the
[2:07:29] holy ghost given for
[2:07:32] it says you know
[2:07:33] in the same chapter john 14 philip said
[2:07:36] lord show us the father
[2:07:38] and it will satisfy us
[2:07:41] jesus said i've been so long with you
[2:07:42] philip and you don't know me
[2:07:44] when you have seen me you have seen the
[2:07:46] father
[2:07:47] and why sayest doubt unto me show us the
[2:07:50] father god was made flesh now here it is
[2:07:53] the father was god over you that was the
[2:07:56] father we're saying we're saying we've
[2:07:59] been since adam god the father was over
[2:08:02] moses and the children of israel and a
[2:08:04] pill of fire
[2:08:05] then god with us in christ
[2:08:09] walk with us glory amen talk with us ate
[2:08:13] with us slept with us god over us got
[2:08:17] with us and now god in us
[2:08:20] all god was coming to christ oh christ
[2:08:23] was coming to the church what is it god
[2:08:26] working in you
[2:08:29] anywhere in the world if he want to call
[2:08:31] on you you're right here working in you
[2:08:34] to do his will how we ought to thank god
[2:08:37] for that god the holy spirit is sent for
[2:08:40] the purpose of god living in his church
[2:08:43] moving through each age working out his
[2:08:45] divine will he goes on when when when
[2:08:48] men make fun of you i love this
[2:08:52] when men make fun of you that thing
[2:08:55] about i was telling you how
[2:08:57] brother branham coming to school one day
[2:08:58] with his mama she won
[2:09:00] with his dad issue on
[2:09:02] that was man that was
[2:09:05] children children don't they don't have
[2:09:06] no filters
[2:09:08] they just let it fly
[2:09:10] man you can just imagine the
[2:09:11] embarrassment
[2:09:13] that he must have felt but they had no
[2:09:14] idea this man standing there with mama's
[2:09:17] shoe and that issue was the very
[2:09:19] fulfillment
[2:09:21] of scripture
[2:09:23] think about maybe some of the times
[2:09:24] people might have laughed at you because
[2:09:25] of who you were but they didn't realize
[2:09:27] they were laughing
[2:09:29] at a child of god
[2:09:31] look at this when men make fun of you
[2:09:34] they're not making fun of you
[2:09:37] say that when men make fun of you
[2:09:39] they're not making fun of you they're
[2:09:40] making fun of him
[2:09:43] that sent you
[2:09:44] oh i want to say that again when men
[2:09:46] make fun of you they're not making fun
[2:09:48] of you they're making fun of him that
[2:09:50] sent you so jesus said blessed are ye
[2:09:54] when men shall say all men of evil
[2:09:56] against you falsely for my sake blessed
[2:09:58] are you and again all that live godly in
[2:10:00] christ jesus shall suffer persecution
[2:10:04] for when god made himself known in
[2:10:06] christ they hated him who hated him
[2:10:08] worse the church
[2:10:10] the church hated him worse they hated
[2:10:12] him worse than the drunkard they hated
[2:10:14] him worse than than all the other people
[2:10:16] it was the church that hated him so
[2:10:18] therefore when you see cosmos the world
[2:10:21] order the world knoweth him not means
[2:10:23] means the church so-called knew him not
[2:10:26] he came to his own and his own received
[2:10:28] him not but as many as did receive him
[2:10:31] to them gave he the power to become sons
[2:10:33] of god to them that believed on his name
[2:10:35] oh how we should love him and worship
[2:10:37] him the purpose of god wanting to become
[2:10:40] in fellowship all right i i i thank god
[2:10:44] for this let me uh skip on a little bit
[2:10:46] more
[2:10:47] amen
[2:10:49] let me see here this last amen this this
[2:10:52] would be my last quote coming out of
[2:10:53] smyrna church age
[2:10:55] i just want you to understand church we
[2:10:57] got to recognize
[2:10:58] right now we are the sons and daughters
[2:11:01] of god
[2:11:02] we're not we're not going to be and can
[2:11:04] i can i can i can i say this you know
[2:11:05] when you're born into a particular
[2:11:08] family they want you to be on
[2:11:11] your best behavior
[2:11:13] because you're always representing that
[2:11:14] family name
[2:11:16] right and if anything
[2:11:18] goes down
[2:11:20] your name
[2:11:22] comes up
[2:11:23] and you represent the family
[2:11:26] right your name comes up your name is
[2:11:28] shown on the news and all that your name
[2:11:30] is what's representing the family
[2:11:32] your cousins know you
[2:11:34] you know and all and oh that's that's so
[2:11:36] and so that you don't want to do
[2:11:37] anything that's going to bring shame to
[2:11:39] your family
[2:11:41] i want to i want to encourage you don't
[2:11:42] do anything that's going to bring shame
[2:11:44] to your spiritual family
[2:11:50] you got to recognize who you are no you
[2:11:51] you're not just a man
[2:11:54] can i cannot you're not just some
[2:11:56] person just walking the earth god had a
[2:11:58] purpose and a plan for you being born
[2:12:02] that job that you have it's the god got
[2:12:04] a purpose and plan for you to have that
[2:12:06] job
[2:12:07] somebody he wants to reach while you're
[2:12:09] there
[2:12:10] amen you have to see yourself as more
[2:12:12] than what you really are you are a child
[2:12:14] of god
[2:12:16] that's i mean that's the greatest
[2:12:17] heritage that anyone can have is to know
[2:12:20] that i'm connected to god
[2:12:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah here
[2:12:25] this is one of my favorite quotes i want
[2:12:27] to just read this and i'll i'll close
[2:12:29] here out of smyrna church it says now
[2:12:32] then uh here we are coming to a
[2:12:34] conclusion
[2:12:36] it says as the eternal logos god
[2:12:40] was manifest in the sun
[2:12:42] and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[2:12:45] the godhead bodily
[2:12:47] and that eternal one was the was the
[2:12:49] father manifest in flesh
[2:12:52] and thereby gain the title of son
[2:12:55] even so we eternal in his thoughts and
[2:12:58] our term became the many member-spoken
[2:13:02] word seed i i i want y'all to get this
[2:13:06] one this is this is important we i mean
[2:13:08] in his thoughts we became
[2:13:11] the many
[2:13:12] members
[2:13:13] spoken word seed see he was manifest in
[2:13:17] the flesh but now we have been manifest
[2:13:19] in the flesh
[2:13:20] manifest in the flesh and those eternal
[2:13:23] thoughts now manifested in flesh
[2:13:26] are the sons of god
[2:13:29] even as we are so called we did not
[2:13:32] become seed by the rebirth we received
[2:13:34] and therefore were reborn for only the
[2:13:37] elect can be reborn because we were seed
[2:13:41] is the reason we could be quickened
[2:13:43] that's why we're in this church
[2:13:44] it's i mean look
[2:13:46] you could go to any church that you want
[2:13:48] to go to but no you come where they
[2:13:50] feeding you the word
[2:13:53] feeding you the truth
[2:13:55] right and it's because there's something
[2:13:56] in you that that that that longs for
[2:13:58] that you know when we heard this word uh
[2:14:00] no matter what our background was when
[2:14:02] we heard this word we've gone to church
[2:14:03] we don't we not been to church before we
[2:14:05] don't heard about what happened in the
[2:14:06] garden of eden but that stuff never
[2:14:08] settled with us
[2:14:09] somebody eating a fruit in the garden
[2:14:11] that just don't that don't seem to make
[2:14:12] no sense we just accepted it because
[2:14:14] everybody said it but it didn't make
[2:14:16] sense but when we come to this word and
[2:14:18] somebody said no it was adultery in the
[2:14:19] garden i said hey hey hey that makes
[2:14:22] sense
[2:14:24] hallelujah glory to god this word
[2:14:27] connects us
[2:14:28] this word bypasses amen uh all of our
[2:14:32] our our nationalities and all that this
[2:14:33] word is what connects us
[2:14:36] hallelujah in non-seed there is nothing
[2:14:38] to quicken
[2:14:39] hold this carefully in mind
[2:14:41] now take the next step
[2:14:43] redeem means to buy back it restores to
[2:14:46] the original owner
[2:14:48] god by his death the shed blood brought
[2:14:50] back his own he
[2:14:52] brought back the spoken word see bride
[2:14:56] my sheep hear my voice that means they
[2:14:59] hear the word and they follow me you are
[2:15:02] you always were a sheep you never were a
[2:15:07] pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is
[2:15:09] impossible for every kind of life
[2:15:11] produces the same kind and there's no
[2:15:14] change in species as we were in the
[2:15:17] thoughts of god and expressed in flesh
[2:15:20] there had there had to come a day when
[2:15:22] we would hear his voice the word and
[2:15:25] hearing that voice become aware of our
[2:15:27] father calling us
[2:15:29] and recognize that we are the sons of
[2:15:33] god
[2:15:34] amen we heard his voice and we cried out
[2:15:37] as did the prodigal son save me o my
[2:15:40] father i am returning to thee
[2:15:43] says the son of god
[2:15:44] can go a long time before he recognizes
[2:15:48] that he is a son amen we got we got many
[2:15:51] children of god out there just wandering
[2:15:53] aimlessly not recognizing that they are
[2:15:55] children of god we're praying for them
[2:15:58] amen a son of god can go a long time
[2:16:00] before he recognizes that he's a son in
[2:16:04] fact a lot of true christians are like
[2:16:06] the story of the baby baby eagle that
[2:16:08] was hatched out under him you know that
[2:16:10] eagle is a type of the true believer
[2:16:13] amen well a farmer took an egg from an
[2:16:15] eagle's nest
[2:16:16] and he placed it under him
[2:16:18] in due time all the eagles under the hen
[2:16:20] hatched out the baby chicks got along
[2:16:23] fine with the mother hen but that little
[2:16:26] eagle could not figure out the clucking
[2:16:29] and scratching for food in the manure
[2:16:31] pile he managed to make a living but he
[2:16:34] was pretty confused about it all
[2:16:37] hallelujah but one day
[2:16:39] from way up in the air
[2:16:41] the mother eagle that had laid the egg
[2:16:45] spied that little eagle on the ground
[2:16:48] she swooped down with tremendous speed
[2:16:50] and screamed at the top of her voice for
[2:16:52] him to fly up to meet her he had never
[2:16:56] heard an eagle cry my god but when he
[2:16:59] heard that first scream something in him
[2:17:01] stirred and he longed to launch out
[2:17:04] toward it but he was afraid to try
[2:17:07] amen there's that fear again amen again
[2:17:09] that mother screamed for him to rise in
[2:17:12] the wind and follow her and i noticed
[2:17:14] mama didn't come pick him up he had to
[2:17:15] use what he had
[2:17:18] he was born to fly
[2:17:20] and somehow he had to get over his
[2:17:21] sphere and start flying and some you're
[2:17:24] gonna have to overcome your fear and
[2:17:26] start doing what god called you to do
[2:17:31] glory hallelujah
[2:17:34] hallelujah uh he says uh he but he was
[2:17:36] afraid of trying again about that mother
[2:17:38] screamed for him to rise in the wind and
[2:17:41] follow her he screamed back that he was
[2:17:43] afraid
[2:17:45] once more she called out screaming that
[2:17:48] he tried
[2:17:49] amen beating his wings i love that i
[2:17:53] just got it all in my mind
[2:17:55] beating his wings he hurled himself into
[2:17:57] the air he'd never done this before he
[2:17:59] just jumped up
[2:18:01] my god hurled himself in the air and he
[2:18:04] and answering the cry of his mother he
[2:18:05] saw it off into the blue skies see i'm
[2:18:08] gonna tell you nature just kicked in
[2:18:10] once he got up
[2:18:12] glory hallelujah hallelujah amen says uh
[2:18:16] uh sought off to the blue skies you see
[2:18:19] he was always an eagle
[2:18:21] he acted like a chicken for a little
[2:18:23] while but it could not be satisfied
[2:18:26] see sometimes we act like the world
[2:18:29] we look like the world but we'll never
[2:18:31] be satisfied
[2:18:33] we might as well get back and start
[2:18:35] acting like a child of god
[2:18:37] because that's who we are
[2:18:40] hey i got representation somewhere else
[2:18:43] and it's not in the lower world amen
[2:18:45] it's in a heavenly atmosphere
[2:18:47] and it's time for me to act like heaven
[2:18:49] on earth
[2:18:51] all right
[2:18:52] you see he always wasn't he acted like a
[2:18:54] chicken for a little while but he could
[2:18:56] not be satisfied but when he heard the
[2:18:57] call of the great eagle he came to his
[2:19:00] own place
[2:19:01] and once a true son of god
[2:19:04] here's the cry of the spirit and how
[2:19:06] you're going to hear it
[2:19:08] by the word
[2:19:10] he too will realize who he is
[2:19:13] and run
[2:19:15] to the great prophet eagle and be with
[2:19:17] him forever seated in heavenly places in
[2:19:20] christ jesus i like that i like i'm
[2:19:23] seated right now
[2:19:25] in heavenly places
[2:19:27] you know i'm gonna tell you when you see
[2:19:28] it in the heavenly places
[2:19:30] you respond to things differently
[2:19:33] you act differently
[2:19:35] you know there's a lot of a lot of stuff
[2:19:37] going on in the world and and as
[2:19:39] christians we don't have to get all
[2:19:40] caught up in a lot of this stuff
[2:19:42] we don't
[2:19:44] you know one thing for me as i see you
[2:19:46] know they're everywhere you turn
[2:19:48] everywhere you turn i don't care where
[2:19:50] where i don't care what you do
[2:19:51] everywhere you turn somebody got some
[2:19:53] conspiracy
[2:19:55] somebody got another theory
[2:19:57] and we just be tracing this one and
[2:19:59] chasing that one so we don't need to do
[2:20:00] that as believers we got scripture that
[2:20:03] we're watching to be fulfilled
[2:20:06] amen
[2:20:07] hallelujah we got we got scriptures that
[2:20:09] that we're being watched i'm gonna tell
[2:20:11] you right now they cannot wipe out the
[2:20:14] population
[2:20:17] they can't do it
[2:20:18] and the reason they came to is because
[2:20:20] their scripture left to be fulfilled
[2:20:22] there's going to be a rapture
[2:20:23] there's going to be 144 000 come
[2:20:26] it's going to be a tribulation
[2:20:29] right some somehow they gonna make it
[2:20:31] through all this
[2:20:33] that i don't know how but they're gonna
[2:20:35] make it throughout god's word and it's
[2:20:37] not gonna fall to the ground and return
[2:20:39] void i don't care what people say
[2:20:42] so ain't no sense in us as believers
[2:20:44] walking around in fear
[2:20:48] amen i'm i'm not coming to church
[2:20:50] because of a vaccine
[2:20:54] or a virus that's not why i'm coming to
[2:20:56] church because i'm afraid i'm coming
[2:20:58] because i love god
[2:21:00] and i
[2:21:06] and i just can't wait to get in the
[2:21:07] presence of god with his people singing
[2:21:09] praises
[2:21:10] it just blessed my soul when i come but
[2:21:13] i'm not running from nothing that the
[2:21:14] devil's doing i'm not afraid of any of
[2:21:16] that
[2:21:17] amen if if i drink anything deadly it
[2:21:20] won't harm me
[2:21:22] that's what the bible
[2:21:24] says amen
[2:21:27] i might as well say this while i'm while
[2:21:29] i'm here
[2:21:31] you know somebody was asking me it's
[2:21:32] like uh bro jack can you give me a
[2:21:34] scripture or something
[2:21:36] uh
[2:21:37] for us
[2:21:39] for me not to take the vaccine that you
[2:21:40] can you know give to support not taking
[2:21:42] the vaccine so now i'm gonna be honest i
[2:21:44] i can't give you a specific scripture
[2:21:48] now you might have your own personal
[2:21:49] scripture but from the past i can't just
[2:21:51] give you something like that all right i
[2:21:53] mean you know there's a lot of stuff out
[2:21:55] there but i can't really get that
[2:21:56] because i i can go to this message and i
[2:21:58] can show you where brother branham
[2:22:00] prayed for these things
[2:22:03] they prayed that god would help them
[2:22:04] find a vaccine
[2:22:06] and and the reason i say that this is
[2:22:08] it's not the market obesity i know that
[2:22:09] much
[2:22:10] i know that much and the reason i can
[2:22:12] say that is because you know they had uh
[2:22:14] in in early days the salk vaccine
[2:22:18] is for people that was suffering from
[2:22:20] polio right and they had a vaccine for
[2:22:23] it now if if a vaccine is the mark of
[2:22:25] the beast it would have been the mark of
[2:22:27] the beast back then
[2:22:31] so i can't give you nothing like that
[2:22:32] but i will say this you have your own
[2:22:34] choice i will tell you that much you
[2:22:37] have your own choice but but you know
[2:22:38] you can't put this on god like that now
[2:22:42] this is not the mark of the reason i'll
[2:22:43] tell you what the mark of the beast is
[2:22:46] i can tell you what it is i know the
[2:22:48] vaccine is not that but i'll tell you
[2:22:49] what it is it is to reject
[2:22:53] the reveal
[2:22:56] not just the word the reveal word for
[2:22:59] your day
[2:23:01] that's the mark of the beast
[2:23:04] you can go back to cain and see that he
[2:23:06] had a mark placed on him
[2:23:09] and that mark was given to him because
[2:23:11] he rejected
[2:23:14] the reveal word

[2:23:19] and this vaccine ain't got nothing to do
[2:23:20] with the bible
[2:23:24] nothing
[2:23:25] now i'm not telling you to get it or not

[2:23:28] up to you but i will tell you you don't
[2:23:30] have to
[2:23:31] walk in fear
[2:23:34] whether you get it or don't get it you

[2:24:07] and she put it out on social media for
[2:24:09] everybody to read it
[2:24:10] you know what i know what i did i never

[2:24:19] vaccine
[2:24:21] we shouldn't go out

[2:24:32] should never never be a thing to divide
[2:24:35] people
[2:24:37] don't let it divide people that's just
[2:24:38] nonsense actually this is a trick of the
[2:24:41] enemy
[2:24:43] this whole thing is a trick of the enemy
[2:24:45] and if you can't if you can't see that
[2:24:47] it just it just we just get a sight
[2:24:50] we don't we don't want to do that

[2:25:01] well it's going to be more people so
[2:25:02] what did that what that mean what that
[2:25:04] mean
