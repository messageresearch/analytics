that made the adjustment a man to the time change a man but it's just good to be back in the house of the Lord want to thank all the same step were able to go with us on Friday night amen to my cousin's church and just helping them out the pastor of that church it was his sermon and that brought conviction to the mother's heart and and you know she got saved underneath you know his ministry and that turned our new house rule around right when lovable mama got saved it turned our whole house around yeah I'm saved because mama got saved you know but my brother has like been changed because what happened to mama all of the kids were impacted by what happened to mama right and we're very grateful you know for that and you know and and you know sometimes you know when I when I just look at it I look at what we have here you know with this word there's some people that have never really come to everything that we got right but you know they've walked and everything that they do and God used him a manifold for that day a specific purpose so you know that that that pastor was certainly grateful because I've not he'd done what God told him to do then we wouldn't be where we act come on folks are sometimes we you know we we have to remember where we come from you went here always you didn't have this truth always right so somebody had to say something to you at some point in time but then it started after you accepted Christ right and that that gentleman his ministry was very effective a man to listen you know I mean there's there's many there's a man that he rides around the city here's an old pastor the rides around on his bicycle I see him it wants to mom and and when I see him on his bike I just stopped and I stopped praying for me so because that man years ago had a church and inside his church he was playing a movie called the burning hell and I went to see that movie as a young man and and when I saw in the movie how they depicted how people would be inhale I said I don't want to go right I don't want to go on that night in that church I gave my heart to the Lord at least I thought I did there is something that got me you know turning in the right direction the reason I said I thought I did because I I repent it but I went right back into it some of the same things I was doing before but it got my heart thinking that I right and because that man played that video of that night it impacted my life so I have to stop sometime and just begin to you know just just thank the Lord for different people that have crossed our paths that have made a difference in us that that put us on the right track you know it make that God sometimes can use somebody in the message that sometimes God can use somebody outside the message but his message to you hey man and that is that he loves you no matter what a man so we thank you for for going and just kind of supporting and and a man just just appreciate just appreciate you all Amen for that and you know sometimes you get a chance to go out you can see how church is done in other places come on somebody you can you can just go out and just observe and just notice how things are done alright please alone they're all friends are handled and and everything you know what I'm saying right huh y'all bring between the lines glory to God a man a man a man but you know we're just trying to do what the Lord called us to do and and we thank the Lord a man for for all things and I tell you what when you go out of here and you you just be a Christian in the midst of it you never know who be drawn to Amen what they see in you hey man so praise the Lord praise the Lord God bless you musicians thank y'all and then I appreciate you all amen also grateful for the specials that were done here this morning certainly appreciate that a man a man praise God i'ma read here in a second but you know you sometimes you just have to just sit back and try to figure out what the devil doin he started striking and doing all kind of stuff and like well okay where'd this come from you know you got the expecting to do something all right a man he's a lie anyway there's this week I did something to my my my ankle here and I don't know what it was I start going back in my and my mind and just trying to figure out and brother the solidness on that song and I was I would jump and I was saying but brother today was one of them days like I came I can't move that ankle you know and but uh but I was trying to forget it man what what what did I do what happened here and I remember going on and playing golf with brother Quentin yes maybe maybe and we planned man song was down you know we still out there hitting golf balls but I said now I could have been that we're just walking and talking and fellowship and then it hit me it hit me because it's sometimes you forget what you do right it hit me man I was like they're playing kickball with them kids I'm I'm assured him I can kick this ball but I kicked all right well I meant that when I put one on Miss Lee oh for sure I had a whoop do you know but I said man I start feeling a pain the next thing like where that came from what happened I didn't do it then so man yes you did you just playing kickball on yesterday so like okay all right I got it so I'm learning I'm i'ma get there I remember my dad I used to see my daddy 70 years old like here trying to race somebody the younger people like then you can't do that well I understand not daddy you know I didn't get a deal but I'm understanding like that you feel like you still got it you know so you know you still be out there trying to deal with something but man you ain't the same age as them your body don't respond the way they bother is fun they give a little little something happen later anchor they back up the next day not you you gonna be down for a couple of days but I God is good anyway you know we're certainly certainly grateful a man but we've been we've been journeying men through this little thought on spiritual revelation and and I was trying to move on or something else but the Lord just kind of brought some things right back around to me last week I had no idea there was I had mentioned something in the sermon but I didn't go too far into it I'll go a little further today in it but I've mentioned something in the sermon and and then brother Troy had said you know what on this day brother branham Creek it was the fourth you know of March brother Brandon preached a particular sermon on the 4th of March making a way and he said he was talking about what you were talking about in church today SL phrase the life so that's a confirmation and and when I looked back at my notes guess what I had the quote in here that I did not read to y'all from Macon away all right and and then you know something like man that's that that was that was something there and then I was talking a little bit before Solomon and and he pulled ice I got a question about a quote and he pulled up on this you know they pulled out a quarter say brother I had that quote in my notes but I did not read it I didn't read it it was in my notes but I didn't read it I said well I said as another confirmation I say I'll keep going right and we'll just let the Holy Ghost have his way you know in this but if you don't my understanding and we'll read the scripture you all should be very for me with it a man out of Matthew chapter 16 and verse 13 and then we will we will go on from there praise the Lord Matthew 16 and verse 13 it says when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi the exodus disciples saying who do men say that I the Son of Man em they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some elijah others Jeremiah or one of the prophets now I want y'all to just really get that how would they even say John the Baptist they knew of what who would be saying something like this right because they knew John the Baptist and Jesus was two different people right but there was word around I believe where one thought that John the Baptist might have been might have come back to life in Christ right and so they would they come up with all kind of crazy things you know some say thou art John the Baptist some say some elijah others others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said that but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him the last art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I were given to me the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charge these disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus to Christ amen let's pray father we thank you for your word and God as we've just endeavor to go a little further with this felt today help us God about to receive revelation it's the only thing that's going to be able to overcome the enemy the gates of Hell will not prevail against Revelation so help us work to receive it and your prophet told us if revelations be honest and they look up and ask you for so God we ask that you administer to every heart to every need that you would just get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise a man from this portion of service thank you for everything that you have done this farm in our midst and God we would take control of every spirit that's against your spirit we know Satan's that work but God we know you're also at work so we help us to tap into what you're doing in this ours in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise well you can be seated a man so we will continue down this journey a man of spiritual revelation now I stopped there at verse 20 amen and Matthew 16 but I made this comment and I wanted to show you I'm going to go forward and verse 21 just a couple more verses from that time forth began Jesus is showing to his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day now notice he gives them this great experience you know I mean this here he's asking for a personal revelation as to who he is you know from them now if I understand this correctly and I could be correct I could stand correction but for for Peter to actually state that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God amen he was stating something a lot more than what we're thinking a man that he's stating remember brother Branham told us he had an experience with you know a rabbi and now he asked the rabbi a question is they now what relation will Messiah be to God right revelation will Messiah be to God now I say the extra rabbi because a rabbi being Jewish they they see things a little different from with Gentiles so so the question to this Jewish rabbi is regulation will Messiah be to God and the rabbi responsible randoms question and the rabbi says Messiah will be gone no not the Son of God the Messiah will be got so little when geuman when Peter stands here here he identifies amen this are with mrs. Smith the answer to the question identify who Christ is he says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and what he's trying to say you are he made a mess but he kept telling us a blast about simon barjona because we should not reveal this to you but my father reveal this to you and I said I'd give you the keys you know to the kingdom this was a a man a very significant a statement and lord help me God III need this I need to slow down and stop and say something in here I want to read a quote for you from making the valley full of ditches man I want to I want to read this quote praise the Lord it's that the Prophet says this it's the only way you're ever going to see your you see your way out ain't about it going through anything can I ask the question is anybody going through anything then I write that down make it okay let me just give it to you 56 - 0 7 - 8 E - 45 my question is anybody going through anything in here and if you said you're not you lying no I can feel it I can feel it yeah I can feel it I feel it but you know it's alright we still got victory and yeah we gonna press till we get out of here all right I got some stuff to share with y'all today yeah I pray you to be a blessing with you amen I can I can I just use these well I'm gonna say these words a little prematurely you going through something don't panic turn around tell your neighbor sake don't panic don't panic don't panic don't panic don't bet you're going through something don't panic don't panic all right making the valley full of ditches and all the way you're gonna see your way out is an old-fashioned spiritual revival hello somebody the only way you're gonna see your way out of whatever you're going through is going to be an old fashioned spiritual revival all right we're the Hallelujah of God is ringing from the bottom of your heart and you don't need you got me a hallelujah from their insides right and y'all really can't be based on how you feel right in the heart because they know you're not supposed to hear it anyway step on it see your old fashioned senior you'll see you AF is an old-fashioned spiritual father where the high values of God is ring up in the bottom of your heart and an old-fashioned holy case simply farmer histor place that's what I'm looking for oh yeah amen I'm an expectation for winning an old-fashioned does he not you got a usual the term they used to make you speak in tongues yeah thank you making it make you make you shout men thank you very much your neck your neck you anyone how we need a fashion holy this the wrong way you never sing the praise God Oh Lord it ah here come the chance to beat you they may come and get your dress messed up get your suit messed up somebody's not know yet you try to concern them that they came become sole because they underneath your name flashing holy peace faction holiest I'll talk about all the things that make you know we leave in search so much power the other than periods you can't try because the police pull you over and see you on the museum floor yes I'm on the movies Oh God [Music] a man I'm gonna tell you this right now where y'all see sister Sam is any man you know it's hidden come on that's she's my friend I could I could mess with her like that man I beat her at kickball man I looked at it this week and I say you gonna be graduating next year I cannot believe him I remember I remember this precious young youngsters - and she was just a little baby my mama was bringing the church and man she'd be crying of something they back of my day they call him Holland Lucas she just be crying she'd be crying and unlike boy I mean so she walked into the church she would cry now I'm a I'm up to y'all some secrets but I remember when when we first when we started church there and Green Acres and and sister Michelle that made the decision to come I remember sisters Maya stopped crying certainly appreciate the journey a man a man never thought he had me but I got a week I'm trying to move on y'all bear with me I got I got I got so much all right so I am from where the holidays of God is ringing from the bottom of your heart and an old-fashioned Holy Ghost sent revival hits the place then you begin to see things then God will begin to reveal things you ain't gonna see nothing you ain't gonna have no revelation and to the Holy Ghost brings it all right so this is why it's important for us to get under under expectation and anticipation for the Holy Ghost hey man come on y'all hey man all right since did yo then you wonder why these real Christians are hanging on and and why they're praying for you what a revival and he got in the spirit now the reason that these people have dances if they didn't have a dance so they could get in the spirit of dancing when they announced there's gonna be a dance you already know what to do when or if it's gonna be a dance you know get your dance clothes on huh hey man and listen to your music before you get here so you know what we get ready to do watch yourself a few moves so you understand what's give it you got to get him to the spirit of the dance hello somebody I'm talking if you're going to dances I don't go to dances now I try I try but I don't go you know but I remember this one brother went a patient shouldn't depend that nobody use brother my brother went to the dance and when he got to the dance the music got real good to him and he jumped out in the middle oh say honey he's setting up in there he's full of it at church alright but if you're gonna go to the dance again and get into the spirit of the dance all right let me let me go he says well you can't have a ball King unless you get in the spirit of everything now you that when it's about a team got home court advantage is because the the fans are playing in a certain atmosphere a certain spirits they get loud when the man trying to shoot free throws they doing everything to distract them but those eyes are creating an atmosphere to make the very hostile are you with me they're making a hostile for the enemy a man making very difficult for the opposing team and you can control you trying to make things hot Wow you tryna make it baby alline do anything in here [Applause] [Music] hallelujah gotta pee on the inside don't panic don't panic I know you're going through but don't panic I'm Shane to title my sermon today y'all watch this you have a ball game unless you're given the spirit of the ball game you've got to get in the spirit of it and we can never have a revivalist report or should I say West Palm Beach or anywhere else until the church gets into this in the spirit of revival God can God can come and perform miracles and we've seen him do that he can show wonders we seen him do that he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and afflicted the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but there'll never be a revival until the church gets in the spirit of revival can I enter interject something there we own Dania fast we own the Dania facts and we need everybody participate in the fast not just the preacher understand not just to preach it praise the Lord yeah I told some saints I was coming back out with this today went to church on one night we started fast in one day and peoples off the fast in one night y'all gonna have to see y'all got to shape up a conch fritter really really really and when your doctor tell you defense because they got to do some tests or whatever you have no problem with that you the concentrator won't bother you but when the pastor say pass palm count excuses we're not not getting up from God to everybody give them spirit everybody and let me tell you something if you're struggling with the fast don't talk to other people that struggling because if you struggling and then struggling y'all will not overcome all y'all gon being defeated talk to other people that's actually doing it don't talk to us that's not doing it find somebody that's do it that's where you get your strength from all right I just need to drop these things off I tell ya I got I gotta say this before we before we go further praise the Lord all right I'm in here I'm in here minds we're just staying here praise the Lord aid man now let's see where am I I told y'all don't panic don't panic I know you're going through but don't panic okay so the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized by this Everett about three weeks I've been emphasizing it's a man so it can never be overemphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you might realize these are some things that the Prophet said he said it's the revelation of God that will give you a fall red team all over the devil a man not that not not the the good song a man is going to be revelation that give you authority over the devil I like that right I remember sister Wesco brother Westco always shared his testimony sister wesco she got a revelation from God and the doctors that told the family come together your mama gonna die you know y'all might as well get together and do this and do that and you know your mama's get ready to leave here and she prayed about it say Lord you know I just I just don't believe that this is this this is right it shouldn't be and God revealed hug your mama ain't gonna die now medical science says she was but revelation says she was right and sister sister sister let's go is the only one standing and see this is the individual revelation right when sister Resco car that she began to tell her family said mama not gonna die and they say well you don't lost your mind you know the doctor said no God told me mama is not gonna die and she was the only one standing by herself with that revelation do you realize that by the time the whole situation over God deliver her mama from that hospital bed raised her up she lived another 13 years before she died and she did that based on a revelation that was given to her daughter revelation can change a lot of things revelation can change your situation I want to say that again I'm there you going through some stuff but revelation can change your situation and the reason it can change your situation because your home and then the way that you begin to respond it's not based on what others are saying that you respond face for your revelation according to your revelation you live according to your revelation [Music] based on your revelation collaboration can change your situation there is nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word of God Amen nothing with such prevailing power now let me slip over here a man into something glory to God I said on panic for whatever you do just don't panic hallelujah hallelujah a man I was bringing this out on last week when Jesus went a man to Caesarea Philippi and he went to this place for these words to be said amen and this place it was very significant you know when we read Matthew 16 when I read verse 21 showing you that after he said it he was headed towards Calvary let's read verse 21 again Matthew 16 verse 21 they'll pull it up on the screen for you if you want to get your Bibles I don't mind i actually like hearing the pages flip hey man that just that means something to me a man somebody came to church prepared glory to God not just depending on the screen if the screen was down what would y'all do and then when you went home went home you'll know where to turn glory to God amen Matthew 16 verse 21 now this is after he says upon this rock I'll build my church right and after he gives him the keys to the kingdom a man of heaven but but verse 21 he says from that time forth began Jesus shows his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem a man and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day so here he is you know after you know this particular passage and you know the Lord just kind of took me on a little journey myself here at hours I was seeing some things here this weekend just unlike see you know we're on our way to Calvary right we're building up a man as we as we take this journey towards Calvary right and and and when we we started it and I didn't realize that you know but when we were preaching the sermon amen to some miracles don't matter I used a particular story I said now that that's two unbelievers that it don't matter but to believe this is the children's bridge right and I didn't realize it but you know that that whole statement of is the children bread you will find that in Matthew 15 and then the Lord takes us to Matthew 16 and we get stuck here for a little bit but I'm trying to also bring you into Matthew 17 alright because because Matthew 16 he begins to show a man of disciples of you know some things here and he doesn't in a very specific place and i'ma get into that in a little bit if I can just just just don't panic whatever you whatever you do don't panic right well but i'ma get into that the back that brought back but he goes from Matthew 6:15 to Matthew 16 and and this great story happens accessory of philipot but then an in Matthew 17 glory to God I'm gonna just read these scriptures because we hit this this morning in in Sunday school and it's just absolute I didn't catch it till I was reading in the sunday school but let's let's let's get this and let's just start reading a man verse 1 and Matthew 17 lord have mercy Jesus glory to God you know what y'all just barely we're gonna read all of the rest of 16 and then all the students the first 13 verses 17 imma go there verse 21 22 and in Matthew 16 says that then Peter took him oh yeah I needed this one I forgot I'm glad I'm glad I hope Thank You Holy Ghost thank you all he goes verse 21 again from that time forth began Jesus assuring to his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests the scribes and be killed and be raised again the third thing but Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from the lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan see the st. Peter that was said blessed art thou now is being rebuked right but he turned to 7 Peter get thee behind me Satan now art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but but those of those that be admit me stop and say Pete he was not calling Peter the devil he was there was the devil speaking through Peter anointing him a man at that time glory to God Alleluia the devil can show get us and some of your closest people your friends your family the devil can get in them you yesterday would care if you open yourself up to him he can come in sorry I said then Dan said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it and I like this this is what I wanted to stumble over these things these are things jesus said before he goes to the cross for what what what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul now there's a sermon just index right what does it I mean I used to hear that when I was when I was coming up that's what actually gave me guidance when it came to a man going after my that's my career and keeping things balanced with cards right because I realized that I could go out for my professional career and I can achieve great success amen in the natural I can do that but if I did not have God then it did not matter because at the end Amen when when you get better leave this room at the end nobody gonna care all of the things that you did you can't take the money with you you can't take the press speech with you you can't take nothing with you but your character so I learned at a very early age we had to keep these things balanced and I want to bring that that you keep these things balanced lord help me Jesus right but what isn't a man what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange was slow but a son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works fairly I'm sending you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom see the Son of man coming in the Katyn his kingdom I want to go further but it's just hard it's hard it's hard I'm by God's grace I'm coming back I want to go to Matthew 17 but before I do that I got I got to just stop here at Matthew 16 accessory of Philip I I've told you all what this place was was geez this was a place full of idol worship and I want to read just a couple of things you know here regardless that I found on the Internet this this actual place Caesarea Philippi was actually known as the gates of Hell right they was known as the gates of Hell so when he says the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it that has multiple meanings right but but this place that Jesus is telling this to the disciples he's standing in the place known as the gates of Hell now there's a reason that it's known as the gates well let me just let me just help you with some of this they said that this place was called the city of pagans and they said on an old test time's the northeastern area of Israel became a center for Bell worship and the nearby city of damned Israelite King Jeroboam built the high place that angered God and eventually led the Israelites to worship false gods eventually worship of Bell was replaced with the worship of Greek fertility gods now this is what happened when they got off the revelation a man they began to just go from one thing to the next thing hey man when they left the true foundation they began to go from one thing to the next thing and if I couldn't say that's exactly what's happening to folk today when they leave the world and then they end up here in the end up there and if you'll never find no place to rest they had all right I'm going on says years later when the Romans conquered the territory Herod Philip rebuilt the city and named it after himself accessory Oh Philip I continue to focus on the worship of Greek gods and the cliff that stood above the city local people built shrines and temples to pan pan pan the god Pan this was the God that they worship this God Pam alright stay with me here alright so um says uh later on says since Rhea Philip I we stood in a lush area near the foot of Mount Hermon became the religious center for worship of the Greek god Pan the Greeks named the city tonight upon eius in his honor now pan is a God of the while a man is a God of shepherds and flocks in a man of nature of a rustic of music and all kind of stuff like this but uh he was known to be a God that was half goat and half human all right this dis god Pan was known to be half goat and half human now there's another interesting a man statement here about this dock pan because the root word amen of Pennock comes from the name pan so when I say don't panic I really mean that don't panic search right because because predict this was the route I'm innocent it originated from the worship of this God pan you understand I think God don't give you the spirit of fear does not give you the spirit of I mean a panic in about you should be in control Amen God is on your side and no matter no matter what it is that you're going to gobble me to do that thing if he left the toilet he'll lead you through it but whatever you do don't don't panic notice this God paying what was the god of this area that Jesus is standing it and this God is half human half dope now why would Jesus be standing here in this place a man glory to God oh let me let me go on a little I got a little bit more than that but uh but why would Jesus be standing because Jesus was the scapegoat Jesus was the scapegoat and being that he was the scapegoat that would be offer for our sins a man he stood in that place and he began to tell the disciples certain things and then after that he began to talk about how you had to go to Jerusalem and how he had to die the scapegoat was given to take our stands to Calvary not like a cavalry but he went to hell so we don't have to go the scapegoat did this see everything that Jesus did was extremely significant there was nothing that was happening it wasn't it wasn't just happening by chance and let me tell you whatever you're going through is not just happening by chance God has purpose but everything you're going through Oh glory to God glory to God alright let me let me let me let me let me read a quote on that one this is out of the message taken away this was from last Sunday all right this is what the prophets taking away a man is but then one go there had to be cast a lot cast and this is from if you want to read more about this Leviticus 16 is where you find it there had to be a lot cast and a lot fell on one go it dot see they have two goats that they would bring a man before the priest and the priest would take one go go and kill it and then the other go he would actually have to take it and send it out into the wild now stay with me i'ma show you that the one that went out into the wild was a scapegoat but now actually brother branham tells us that Jesus represented both ghosts the goat that was killed and the goat that went out into the wild all right look he says there had to be a lot cast and the flop fell on one go it died and then the blood of this goat was placed upon the other goat with the hands of the high priest confessing the sins of the people now notice I says that his place throwing the other girl with the hands of the high priest if you go back and read Leviticus 16 you'll see that there were certain times that the high priests had to washes hands right but when he was dealing with the blood of the one group that was killed and then and then when he went to the other goat and put his hands on his head and then he said now you bury this on out into the wild as a scapegoat he'd never washed his hands in between that process so so when he killed the one he had blood on his hands and then he took that same blood and put it on the hands of the other goat and sent out into the wild Jesus bore our sins Oh glory their God's a man listen he says how he says with the hands and a high priest confess to the sins of the people from the living goat and then a man who was worried at taking a living go on this arm and went away into the wilderness when the goat would have to perish and go into an isolated out-of-the-way place never no more in that state to come back into the family of his own again but to be isolated forever bearing the sins of the people away now I know many scholars perhaps are standing here especially their Venice they think that one that one goat was Christ and the other one was the devil my brother and I have two different a little on that we can't sacrifice to the devil both those record in Christ both of them as Christ Christ is or he brought us in and he brought with him his self away devil came there my sin Christ is our sin bear get it straight then your faith won't move Christ is our sin bear and the sins of the world Christ was the dying animal at the cross listen the lamb slain from the foundation of the world now I'll stop with that amen that quote right there the other thing that happened here at this place accessory of Phillip I was called Amen like I told you two gates of hell and I'm just getting some information on presenting see the pagan mind at this cave accessory of Phillip on they the cake that like the pagan mind created a gate to the underworld where fertility gods lived during the winter and say they committed to testable acts to worship these false gods oh my god y'all stay with me here today since I'm here they are that the pagans of Jesus day come and belief that their fertility gods lived in the underworld during the winter and return each spring they saw water as a symbol of the underworld and thought that their gods travel to and from that world through case so this is why I was called the gates of Hell the underworld right this but notice Jesus is tenant in this place and he's not giving Peter keys to the underworld he given Peter keys to the kingdom of heaven oh my god he's not given I mean here they're dead practicing these things because you know here is Satan is getting all kind of worship in this very spot now Jesus goes and gives a believer amen keys to the kingdom of heaven and what are the keys do it give you power to bind and loose that's why I say don't panic you don't you don't need to panic you know you can change the situation with your works oh lord have mercy y'all don't realize that you can change the circumstance with your words buying that devil in the name of Jesus all right let me go wrong the pagan mind the the cage in Springwood accessory Oh Philip our creative gate to the underworld they believe that their city was literally at the gates of the underworld the gates of hell in order to attend sighs to return of their God and each year the people of caesarea philippi engaged in horrible deeds it was prostitution and all kind of other stuff happening there in that place but Jesus stood in this very wicked place this very evil place and it says the gates of Hell won't prevail against you and if you can stand there and tell Peter that and that wicked place let me tell you something I don't care what you're going through they're not they're not doing it that bad where you wherever you at right now it ain't that bad but the gates of hell won't prevail against you either all right I'm picking up in Matthew 17 this is you know this is a journey towards Calvary Oh God but I got to give it to you from an angle of spiritual revelation because if you don't catch it spiritually you'll miss it you're gonna miss God and so many other forms a man I brought something else out last week that I'll touch it again and then we'll go on but Matthew 17 notice now after Jesus has this experience accessory of Philip I'll now he's carrying them all and and I didn't you know we're not when I got there to Israel last year and I saw these things just for myself then it made sense to me right it made a lot of sense to me Jerusalem Jerusalem to where accessory of Philip Isle it's a pretty good journey right it's a good journey and they did everything by foot they that they weren't riding in vehicles or and things like that they did everything by foot so this is you know even where Mount Transfiguration happened it was by foot that Jesus took them from Caesarea Philippi to get to you know this place with Mount Transfiguration and notice what the Bible says in verse 1 chapter 17 after 6 days because it took him that long to walk there after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bring them up into the high mountain apart now I want you to remember this glory to God remember Peter was the one that expressed the revelation of who Christ was in Matthew 16 Peter was the one that caught it and Jesus blessed him for his revelation notice this but says after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and brings them up into a mountain uh bringing them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the Sun and his raiment was white as the light and the world that appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talked with him now last week I talked about how Moses and Elijah were the witnesses of the book of Revelation these are the two witnesses a man the Bob was playing in tell us Moses and Elijah was talking with him glory to God then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elijah while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son and will my am well pleased hear you him now I like the way that this is set up because Peter was the one that expressed it in matthew 16 by his old post revelation when Jesus acts who the newspaper I have a son a man named Peter sent down for Christ he said what he's saying is that you got in flesh this is what Peter said you are God in flesh now I want you understand Peter expressed his revelation but God came back and written in matthew 17 and vindicated revelation Peter expressed it but God vindicated when he said this is my beloved son hear you him and I won't tell you something you will have to express your personal revelation and after you express your personal revelation God vindicated Oh hallelujah CC you know a lot of times what we want God to do is vindicate first before we Express but no you got to learn how to express even when everything is coming against you your family don't believe you your friends don't believe they thank you crazy I mean you know you know it's strange to follow prophet nowadays everybody thank you create now God will use prophets no more we wouldn't did he stop show me in the Bible when he stopped I know he started to show me where he stopped I got to go further in the scripture right because you know the thing of it is this this message that we believe in y'all this message that we're standing off was promised by the Bible the problem is the problem is that our teachers in our former churches could not teach these things because it had not been revealed to them if you just begin to look back you know as to where God even brought you from some of the churches that he brought you out of all the people that was in those churches but God would choose you to reveal this truth to come on church like I'll tell you sometimes just go back in go be my guest go enjoy yourself you will see the difference you'll see the difference oh my god ain't no more life out there y'all and I know that that hurt people when you say you're trying to say you the only one with it well let's go back to Cain and Abel which one had it only I've had it it's always only been one a man and I'm gonna tell you Jesus is the one a man but but you know don't get offended by these things I mean receive revenue just gonna take spiritual revelation for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you he wouldn't even want to come to a man in there he spoke only have one wife praise the Lord she's probably have one husband right it's all right always get back down to one a man hallelujah glory to God all right let me let me go in here but what I want you to see is Peter expressed it by faith he said and it's another bonus that the other disciples didn't say anything I don't know if they were thinking it or not but Jesus said because he said Peter blessed are you oh my god and later on the very next chapter God comes and vindicates Peters revelation vindicated it and God gonna Bend occasional revelation see and what the other thing that kind of my spirit is see that this why he told the woman amen in the days we Elijah oh my bake me a cake first I know you I know you hungry I know you're starving I know your family ain't got enough food I know you're going through some things but I want you to do I want you to honor my word first Oh God y'all ain't got it I need I need that I need to break it down even a little bit further I want you to honor me first I want you to pay your tithes and offering first huh I want you to give me your firstfruits I want you to do that first and see what you said Lord Lord I need you to show me a miracle first gossiped no no I need you to show me your faith first giving up a first and then I'm bill perform a miracle but I mean decision trust me first let your Revelation speak fast hmm see God comes up to Vindicator after you did do what you supposed to do look at it now verse 5 again while he s fake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them well the voice of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him and Peter had the pedo at the being in his spot to see all these things happen he see logic see Moses you see he see all this verse 6s and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face or were so afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead now this is where it gets tricky and I've been touching on these things but now let's just see if we can get in there a little bit more this is where it gets tricky because this portion of Scripture is for our day Jesus prophesied of where you're living at notice this now and his disciples asked him saying why then now see they understood the scriptures let me let me let me let me can I just go out there with me they're with me you can't understand Scripture if you don't get into the spirit before you read the Bible [Music] you you can't you can't you you're not gonna be able to understand the Bible if you can't understand Amen if you don't get into the spirit of what's there lord help me Jesus right when you going to a ballgame you got to get into the spirit of the ballgame if you got to go to a man a dance you got to get into the spirit of this if you don't go to church you gotta get into the spirit of what's happening in church honey is somebody let let me tell you something I'm preaching the message you understand so giving them establish to that they hear what the Prophet saying yourself at home then you'll be able to identify what I'm saying your church if you're not given to the spirit of this thing look at the dance they listen to music then they go to the dance why not listen to the pop it before you come to church if you don't get in the Spiritist thing you go you're not gonna catch it I'm sorry I got out you know what I'm gonna just keep preaching I've know some of y'all done lost a tower a man just feeling it you but you knew ahead of time you just gonna lose that out and you ain't do nothing to just I went to bed early I'm where the bed earlier I'm ready to preach I'm stopping to stay right here with it alright watch this now because this is for you these words are for you and in these words that I'm giving to read have become a problem today many people are applying it the wrong way and when you miss apply it you you mess up some stuff but here it is verse 10 and it's a cyclo zags I'm saying why then say the scribes then Elijah must first come nigh me understood scripture they they they they parents that taught them they went the church they learned something in church they understood scripture they went in accent then why did say to scratch then Elijah must first come now that that let you know that they were looking for the squash were looking for Oh yo yo I mean the religious leader from that day we're looking for Roger hey Roger had come and gone and I have no idea here come and go and let me tell you something that the leaders today are always looking for logic but man come and go now you act let me let me let me just drop this off because we got to get into this not now they say logic must first come now let's read this read let's take this reason God Jesus answer the Senate and Elijah truly chef first come and restore all things let me read it real fast and I'll go back to read it slow but i standed you that Elijah has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him once ever they listed likewise shall also the seventh man suffer of them nice field talking about going to Calvary okay the scapegoat is on his way to count all right then the disciples understood that is fakin to them of John the Baptist wait hold on wait slow down wait how did they understand he never said it he didn't tell them of John the Baptist how did these disciples catch it spiritual revelation now let me ask you another question how could they say John the Baptist was because you know based on that time I'm talking up to that time I'm not you know when I say up to that time Old Testament scripture because the name John the Baptist is not an Old Testament because the first person P but the first question people ask you you say brother Branham where's his name in the Bible where's John the Baptist name in the Bible Old Testament I feel annoying that I can walk now where and how did they identify John the Baptist as a little angel how could they without spiritual revelation well the question is how can identify brother Branham when his name is not in the Bible how can identify him as the fulfillment a relaxant that restores all things cuz Jesus said it jesus said it I want to go back and read it jesus said if you lean on me I heard the master say come on I'm I'm moving on she pathetic and if Jesus thank these things we should be looking for this notice what Jesus means glory to God verse 11 7 jesus answered coz they will they said widely described see that Elias must first come alive so much risk oh and Jesus he says he said Sheila said something you like to truly share first from every store all things but I say unto you that Elijah's already come which Elijah because there's two larges coming than them two versus there's a larger that came when Jesus said but I've sent me Elijah has already come that was talking about John the Baptist but we say Elijah was going to come and restore all things that was talking about brother branham's ministry what are we talking about what are we talking about his ministry was a restore truth what truth y'all what truth okay so many of them it's so many what about tis which way do we get baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which one is right did Peter have it wrong does the scripture contradict itself yeah I mean Father Son and Holy Ghost is it three gods or one gods these are the things that were restored right I mean who should be in the pulpit who shouldn't be because the church then got away from it we don't even know what we the pulpit no more how how how how how can a woman be a bishop when the Bible I'm telling we go back to the Bible when the Bible say alright y'all don't pull me into something I wasn't going here but y'all gonna make me going here when the Bible say then the bishop must be - [Music] so I can I wanna be with my Bibles say this do you know that when you have a woman in the pulpit preaching the Word of God that you are committing spiritual homosexuality spiritual homosexuality the Word of God is seed the Word of God is seeds and it's a man that carries seed woman carries egg man carries seed the woman represents the church the church has a womb to receive the Word of God spiritually I'm talking about the woman is the church so the women should receive seed from a man but when you have a woman trying to give seed to the church woman you have spiritual homosexuality and because you have spiritual homosexuality that's why you end up with natural homosexuals lead to the gospel well that they were Jews were prompted to take us back to the Lord back to you chew sometimes is unpopular but yet it's the truth [Music] see this is what this is why God sent a prophet to keep us on the word not for us to worship Him we don't worship brother Branham we not here all right we don't sing those songs that clarify brother Branham all of our songs glorify God but we understand what Christ did through Scripture if if jesus promised it why should we look for don't get this wrong and to these questions well show me his name in the Bible you show me John the Baptist name in the Bible Old Testament all right so you gotta kick these these things of reveals spiritual revelation Church can I go a little further Oh God see this whole thing that was showed here to Peter James John you know here at Mount Transfiguration this whole thing and they caught up by revelation who he was talking about when he said Alliance must come on Elijah's come already and they knew him not but have done unto him what some of they listed likewise also shall the Son of Man suffer them then the disciples understood lord I pray one day that that same thing a drop and see it's like revelation just kind of just found its resting place in the heart city to slap then there I mean all this time is with Jesus and then like Elijah was supposed to come first Elijah suppose the first come Elijah and they hold it on to the scripture they think they got something they hold it on to and Jesus just finally just break it down Eli and I want to tell you another thing by the time the disciples understood that John the Baptist was the fulfillment of Elijah do you know your large had already died yeah come and go they was even maybe someone got baptized by him maybe I mean maybe they heard him preach the audience of the man had come and go and it finally struck them who he was history has a strange way of repeating itself but the only way that these disciples could understand it is they had to have spiritual revelation all right all right all right okay I'm gonna move on all right can I can I go back and hit something that I hit last week Kaluga I'm decent you know we just we just need this we need we need this all right this is out of that the great coming revival Oh God the Lord actually you know what the the the scripture that when we talk about a brother branham supposed to come Malachi 4:5 in 6 tells us that the whole lot was Cindy Elijah to prophet for the great dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children to the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse now I've said this now violet this quote for me I was a great coming revival in the outpouring of the oldest fear I've said this before if you apply John the Baptist ministry to the restoration of all things then you have to deny the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ because if John the Baptist came to restore which is what people trying to teach today that John the Baptist the one that restored I'd say well what did you restore brother one brother told me baptism I say John restore baptism I said no that don't that don't really make sense to me I say because Paul told them to be baptized in acts 19 so it could be restored and then they doing something else a give us something else that John restored and I'm saying furthermore you gave me one thing that John restored now the Bible say all things give me some more stuff and I can tell you again I'm just going off the top of my head water baptism God hid the truth the marriage and divorce right come on what else did it restore right serpent see what happened in the Garden of Eden all that stuff was lost right I mean I'm just the future there's so many things that was lost in the church the baptism of Holy Ghost we're all these these teachings that was given back pass that's why restoration is glory to God oh my shut up shop right now boy this is it but I tell you what church let me let me let me let me let me let me keep going here we're expecting this but now let me let me just go and look further if I can today now I'll find my way out of here I promise I promise the great coming revival on out for the Holy Spirit I hit this on last week but I want to hit it again so now as I just said the antediluvian struction noir was a sign no one had the sign to start on when he's seen Enoch was taking up Enoch was taken up then Noah but then though it was time for Nora to start for he knew that would be the sign of his beginning and then and then the end would be near and Enoch of course was a type of the rapture group of the church and Noah's a type of the carried over of the elect of the Jews that would be carried through the tribulation period and we're now living in that day I was standing this little earlier if you apply John the Baptist being the restoration of all things John would a restored us restored us to law and that would have denied Greece right so you cannot put John the Baptist in that brother branham was the fulfillment of the restoration of all things Jesus prophesied that that Minister was coming and it's here and gone praise the Lord all right I'm just I'm just walking you through Scripture now this this quote here that I just read it was a problem it has become a problem a man to some people because they know that Enoch I went through all the calculations and everything of Enoch actually being gone six to nine years before no one would even see him right so if the quote says that knoweth star II not and that was his sign say how can he do that because Enoch was already don't he that he didn't die he walked with God right God called him away got it caught him up in a rapture he walked with God and so he was going six to nine years before Noah a man actually was even born all right so but spiritual revelation tells us that if Moses could be the one to write about what happened to Enoch because nobody else knew right Moses came even after Enoch after Noah after Abraham talked to all these people but he's the one that tells us what happened in Genesis Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible and all these things had already occurred how did Moses kitchen spiritual revelation that's how Moses caught it and I mean let me just also just kind of drop this off Moses was a prophet and God shows a prophet more than he shows everybody else because could nobody else write that I got a revelation no no no no we're not tell about that man amen my fist being a perfect cut something and dropped it off for the people gave us the first five books of the Bible so here - a man catches it and tells us that Enoch walked with God and then he says he says Noah days were Enoch with 365 years Enoch walked with God he was not for God took him now I'm gonna have to stop here y'all I gotta stop and go back to that scripture can you pull up Genesis 5 and 23 and 24 yeah I'll just bear with me y'all bear with me now Oh Lord Jesus hold on before I give him this before I give him this before I give him this one more cool God's provided place of worship now I I'm trying to bring all these things together if y'all just bear with me hey man Moses called it best spiritual revelation no one caught what happened to Enoch by spiritual revelation and guess what we caught it by spirit revelation hallelujah now there's another controversial quote that people using to pull away from the message and this was the quote that I said after I preached this it was brought back to my attention I say you know what let me I'm gonna go ahead and hit that I had in my notes last week but I didn't read it for y'all I read it this time this is look at this one and we found out that he not come into God's provided way with his word and walked 500 years and pleased him we found out that the mechanics was so perfect in him that when the denominators go to work in an engine it just took him off the earth he took the first airplane flight like to heaven working on God's mechanics and dynamics together he was not because God took him out of the earth without death that's exactly right he was walking and gods provided we notice that was 1965 brother Branham passed away in December of 1965 this was April of 1965 that this quote was stated and he made a comment here the key thing that I want y'all to catch that he said is that he that we found out he not coming to gospel right away with his word and well five hundred years and pleased to welcome our hundred years that's not what the Bible state the Bible said three hundred and sixty-five years the Prophet said five hundred years and we have people that say well he's not a prophet because he said something that's against the Bible I think that's that's far fetched that's very far fetched now I want to go on I want I want I want to now I need that scripture because I need to I need to help you out see something here bear with me now y'all still with me trying to deal with some things but it's gonna be you know it's gonna take some spiritual revelation to catch this all right now notice this in this verse let me just get my notes right here so I can line it up just right Robert says in all the days of Enoch for 360 and five years so that's that's different from what that quote list said they said five hundred years but the Bible say three hundred sixty-five years notice the next thing next verse and II that walk with God he not walk with God and he was not for God took him now I'm gonna read that a little different this time I want to read the same verse I want to read it a little different this time and Enoch walked with God : and he was not semicolon for God took him can I read it again and Enoch walked with God : and he was not semicolon for God took him so we need to understand writing now okay the use for the colon and the semicolon in that script ago I can keep that scripture the use of the colon and the semicolon in that scripture the colon introduces an element or series of elements that illustrate amplify the information that preceded the colon the column is that an illustrator so so so let's being amplified notice inna walk with God we go by this and Moses goes will amplify so he responds and it puts a semicolon but a silicon sure is true independent clauses that return to signal a close connection between them so similar colors and he was not first wealthy gods that's that's the key thing that's the subject of this he is God he was not the last thing as God took him well that's what that's what Moses did yeah can we see what Paul said Paul said this vicious code in Hebrews 11 go to Hebrews 11:5 it's okay don't panic don't panic don't panic don't don't need a message over it is no I'm just I'm using this now let me let me also just tell you I'm not gonna I'm not gonna stand here and justify what brother Branham said about five hundred years I can't do that I can't do that I have a good feeling that if I'm using these worse if somebody pointed out to him brother Branham you said five hundred years but the Bible say three hundred sixty-five years if somebody pointed that I have a I have a good feeling that he was saying yeah take what the Bible say you know why I said it because he's already proven that most not where the Prophet was proven wrong no I'm using that in very loose terms when he's when he miss quoted something and it was say it wrong he had no problem repenting immediately go back to listen to the seals he he said seven hundred and she said seven thousand and when he heard that he home he repeated the very next service now people today when they get people they have a hard time coming back and saying I'm sorry I was wrong about that I'm sorry for criticizing that I was wrong about that let's see what Paul said about this cuz see the colon the colon is there to amplify let's see what Paul said about this same thing verse 5 a man in Hebrews chapter 11 it says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had his tests that have this testimony that he pleased God now the word translated is not in Genesis that's not what Moses said Moses didn't say he was translating just that he was a mote mote that Moses said that uh he walked with God and he was not for God took him no way to Paul get the freedom to it yes the Liberty takes place that he was translated because the colon that the colon gives him that Liberty the colon allows you to amplify this you know and I got a quote for we don't need new Bible translations to try to amplify Scripture all we need is worth the prophets man that illustrates in amplified Scripture that the colon was also used in the book of Jude can I read you for you verse 14 and 15 Jude only one chapter in jute only a few verses but look look at jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù says and Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands things first of all first of all first of all when did the Bible say if ojou that Enoch prophesied Moses did not say that Moses that he walked with God and God took him Moses didn't say nothing about him prophesied where did you get the liberty all right to execute judgment verse 15 upon all and to convince all that all that all that are ungodly men I'm sorry and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him and this is what Jude expresses about Enoch but we never saw any of these things before they weren't in scripture before but you know what we take it as gospel now I got some I got something for you all with that quote that I just read to y'all brother branham stand 500 years now I told you there if there's he said Enoch was here 500 years but the Bible said 365 now I say I'm not gonna be here I'm not gonna be the one to say him tell you and argue with you that that that brother Branham was right when he said 500 years here's what I do know that God shows prophets more than what he shows us now I do not have enough information to to say whether it was right or wrong now what what others have done they have deduced it y'all stay with me they have deduced it and they said we're brother Branham got his information from this book called The Book of Enoch hmm that's kind of strange because I was also told that would you got his information was from that same book now I don't read The Book of Enoch because I don't believe that's biblical right and and here's what I've told people is that you can't prove to me that brother Branham got it from the Book of Enoch you don't know where he got it from cuz if God if God showed him something a little more than what he showed us that's why he said what he said prophets see things that we don't see Moses saw what happened in the beginning Noah saw what happened to his his great granddad Enoch Paul being a prophet saw what happened in that time brother branham sir that's what prophecy so I'm not here to debate on that I will say that's there I can stay with the Box the Bible the Bible say 365 years that's what I read that's what I'll stay with right but I'm not gonna say I also say that brother Branham is not a prophet because he said 500 years look it's been too many things proven in his life for me to say he's not a prophet can I say this way too many vindications too many vindications one vindication was a man this this this chart that I have here on this wall the seven churches did chart brother Branham went to teach that chart at his church and he teach dit he taught he taught went all the way through 1960 went all the way through he drew it up like this put it on a little whiteboard drew it up and put it up you know put the Stars and put the the names and all that now now now now actually I'm gonna tell you something about this chart the chart that brother Branham put right on the chart that he put let's see if I can get this yeah on the chart that he put he like he listed all these names here but when he got here to this his chart he left it as Elijah he left it as he liked it that's where he put Elijah right there right there that that's what he put Elijah now which Elijah I just went through the scripture with you right in Matthew 17 which he lodged with you're talking about because the Spirit allowed to come five times according to the Bible but I don't have time to talk about all that today I'm I'm gonna get out of here in a little bit but but he pretty logic now I had this chart done by one of the brothers in the church I say brother you work at Kinkos would you just do this chart for me and I gave him the way brother Branham gave it to him gave it does he put Elijah that's what that's what that's what brother Brett I say just blow this up and break it something back at the church and whip it on the wall he say okay now when I got the chart back it didn't have any larger it had Branham no why would that but why would that brother well would that brother take a large off and put bramma Wow because he has spearonation y'all wanna know what that boat is brother Devin does brother Devin he comment by revelation took your eyes up and put brown a man grant Toa hmm six let us PRA in a j7 let us God know exactly what are you doing after brother Branham had taught this at his church drew this chart just like this taught this at his church closed up the Bible after the last sermon is preached on the seventh Church age to Laodicean church a closing up the Bible Holy Spirit comes into the church at the end of the sermon goes to the back wall and the Holy Spirit writes everything that you see on this on the back wall has that happened in any churches you've been to I know none of us that I grew up in none of that ever happened it's been too much vindication on this truth for me not to believe it I walk away over five hundred verses 365 no it's gonna take more than that it's gonna take a lot more than that when he was born how to pill a fire came into the room to welcome him to the earth did that happen when you were born parents weren't even Christians weren't even born in a Christian household but when that pillar fire came into the room they're like what in the world and everybody knew something special about this child growing up and hearing the voice of God telling that he couldn't smoke a drink a defiled his body with women in any kind of way and when he would go try to do it one time he there trying to drink in that voice I told you not to defile your body in any way would let him drink wouldn't let him drink voice tsk I mean he just had all types of experiences went down to one brother criticized him about you know a divine hill and how you know he hypnotizing the people and all this and and God not doing that no more and they stay won't they have a debate stuck there in Houston and he told his uh his buddy you know brother Bosworth say I don't debate with nobody I'm not gonna argue with nobody I don't do that and brother Bosworth she would let me take it up he said let me have it the hizzy they stayed brother Bosworth please don't don't are say I won't argue Thomas I want argue I'm not gonna close and fight no I promise okay got it then let the man's day with doctor best let me up there just just doing you know presenting so he's a brain divine healer down here you know I want it I want to meet him say no no sister for the brand life divine healer crisis divine healer he say say no no no bring him here he said bring that I want to prove that he's a false he's fake he's phony so dr. Betz say you know just scope to the word and the man started proving all his points and why he and believe divine healing so brother brother brother Bosworth say I got one question for you he says the seven compound names of Jehovah saves do they apply to Jesus Christ dr. Betsy I ain't got time for your questions bring them down here so now he knew he was wrong right there cuz if you go if you can if you can apply them seven compound names in the Old Testament then it shows that he's the same yesterday today and forever you say well you know what this this dis debate is over it's over and he said well Lord they say he said he say um he said this debate is over and says he says uh he says if brother Branham want to come down here and he want to face this dis audience he can do it he's on his own it's up to him said brother Branham got out the seat he was sitting up in the balcony and he walked out now now I need to tell you when you're going listen to this this tape and you hear him say this on the tape he'll say 500 angels was walking with and and I heard they don't want even 500 people in the building that night but he say 500 angels what does he see that the others are not seeing oh you remember the Prophet had that to pray and ax the ax God to open and yellow man's eyes give him spiritual revelation because without it he will perish glory to God say when you walk down there then they start taking pictures of the platform start taking pictures and when they went to develop all the pictures and this one preacher you know doctor best he got his hand underneath brother Bosworth you know face you know like this what kind of preacher is this right but he he he sitting there making mockery making fun and all the pictures that they took that day only one picture came out and it was a picture that had a light over brother Branham vindicating that this is the same pill of fire that led the children of Israel out of Egypt that same fill of fire that Paul saw on the road to Damascus that same feel of fire took a picture with God's prophet one was over shoulder one I think over his head and with the one being over his head what does that show is that he's under the authority of Almighty God God don't take his picture with everybody they took that picture and put it in Washington DC oh that's become a problem she might have told me that that brother Branham says in the hall of critics in Washington DC and there is no building in Washington DC called a hall of critics so I'm leaving the message I said they that that's one if that ever came across my way it would be problems and the reason would be problems because I went to Washington and I saw the picture myself that it's hanging right there in Washington DC it wasn't in the Hall of critics but it was in what's the name of that place brother Library of Congress and let me tell you you do not decide that you're gonna walk through the doors at the Library of Congress without going through extreme security so it's there those that don't know that is there and that have left a message over that I'm telling you you can scratch that one off your list if you go to the library Congress is there god vindicated his prophet can I just read one last quote now I'll leave for the day I promise all right this is going to come out of the revelation of Jesus Christ and I'll read paragraph 34 1 and 34 2 so when we have true revelation the gates of Hell can't prevail against us but we prevail over them over them look at this says oh how we need revelation by the spirit church and if I could I could stand here and I could talk and I could you know these are things that that God showed me just thirty years and I wasn't born in this message I was not born I was born Baptist I was I was out if it was if it was the will of the Lord I would have stayed that and about this time I long mm-hmm feel like one dinero y'all yeah that's that's where I'd be going right now yes that half sum up yep I have them on the organ Rick come on Whitney y'all y'all don't fell asleep in here but I'm still preaching I start singing my sermon and most of them have to sing because they ain't got nothing to say but I wouldn't I wouldn't die the way God showed me this message pulled me out of the Baptist Church and showed me it is and look when God showed it to me it was individual it was individual and and and what I had to do is look at it from a scriptural standpoint you giving me scriptures I'm gonna read it Malachi 4 right I just gave you one out of Matthew 17 revelation 3 revelation 10 their script is all about this message coming to us in this end time and when I saw it in Scripture that's when I can say okay that's that's God and let me tell you something jesus said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they won't follow and I just start following this message because I heard some strange voice I start following because I heard the voice of God oh how we need revelation by the Spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation those summer very did this is what happened but because people can't understand I remember you know a certain gentleman he was a / witness he said the the these in the house in the dust isn't and all that I can't even understand that so I just had to go get me another Bible now why does that everybody else before you could understand it and now you can't understand it it's because God didn't give you spiritual revelation you didn't get into the spirit of what you read you were looking to try to find a way to get out so now we got all of these different turpitude and I like can I tell y'all something you know I used to read the amplified I used to used to used to because I've noticed people got all these different bombs come and I and I really catch that so I need to catch it over here and I got this one I got the message Bob and I got this like you've got a wife Saudis different interpretations that you're reading Cassandra is missing the interpretation right you've given up you can end up lost because of that interpretation stay with KJV but I used to read it but what I found out is that there was a woman very smart woman thank God for her wits but there was some group of men the sauce mark this woman was and they got to hide her and say why don't why don't we we use you to write a different Bible for everybody and you know you tell us what you think it mean and you write it well she's the one that wrote the amplified version the Bible I'm not going with a man just what somebody think it mean I want to go what God said me so if it started that way with an amplified version you start if you just look at the front of your Bible where it come from who was behind it you get it or you get a quite a good understanding as whether you can trust it or not I trust the King James Version for a King James Version because that's what the Prophet used all right oh how we need revelation by the Spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need new translation though some are very good and I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the Spirit thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his Spirit it's gotta come by a spirit that God began by his Spirit to give us a continuous life given a prevailing revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation I like that if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify God father eight years ago I want to say I preached this message spiritual revelation and I remember that day a man the day that spoke it you know God does things certainly at certain times it just stays with you but I remember i was telling Telesis that you know she had come to church that day too that preached this a man and and went so I remember remember Sister Sister kimra you know she was here the first time I preached this and when sister camera showed up about two weeks ago the church that was a confirmation for me she didn't realize it but that was her that was God's confirmation to me that I was supposed to preach this again I went back over it you know this uh this this week and said when I preach them up eight years ago I preached it I went back over and when I preached it the first time I didn't preach it nothing like this nothing like this but I know God a man had purpose for this for us to take this journey and I trust that you will catch spiritual revelation if you don't get nothing else get that because the gates of hell can't prevail against that it came prevail against it don't fight it yield to it yield to it look at the Bible can you know Jesus Jesus would tell them you know they had promised earth they'd say search the scriptures they are they that testified me and I'm telling you search the Scriptures I'm giving you certain scriptures just look at those scriptures read over those the last script in the book of the in the Old Testament prophesied it would happen the last chapter last verse said we'd be living in this day right now and we're here alright church spirit revelation that's what we need let's pray father we've taken this journey and I know God some things Lord me it made me kind of go a little bit over but uh you told us to look up and ask you for we're not trying to go over we're trying to bring it right into the heart right into the heart of people the hour is so late time is so short and Ghana and we don't want to just go through the motions we want to we want to be real and God I don't want to just be a hearer of this word I want to be a doer of it my prayer is that you would bring revelation fresh revelation into the hearts of all your people God speak speak Laurent if you could make this thing clear to me and coming from a Baptist background Pentecostal background I've walked through all of that but when I came to understand this word Laurent the Bible became a new book for me Father and I'm just so grateful that you would open up my understanding the very purpose of our existence on earth today Raptors should have come a long time ago but the reason that we're here still is because somebody has not come to recognizing who you are in your word today I don't know Lord I don't know if this would be the last message that some will hear I don't know that God but I want to do the best I can to get truth to the people the Bible says we'll know the truth the truth will make us free have you a God in every heart it's in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus that we pray amen amen well the Solomon would you come and close us
