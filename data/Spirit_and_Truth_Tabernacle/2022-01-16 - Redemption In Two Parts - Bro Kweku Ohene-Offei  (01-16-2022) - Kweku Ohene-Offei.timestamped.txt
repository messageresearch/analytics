[47:59] um
[48:00] it's good to be back home
[48:03] as we were away on last weekend and we
[48:05] had a wonderful time there in tucson
[48:09] uh arizona
[48:10] we
[48:12] um went to a
[48:14] banquet on
[48:16] uh
[48:17] i guess it was friday night and
[48:19] you know i got all the way over there to
[48:21] tucson
[48:22] i
[48:23] thought i had everything that i needed
[48:24] and i went to go get dressed for the
[48:26] banquet and realize i have no dress
[48:29] shirts no whatsoever
[48:32] so i say lord i'm gonna be late to this
[48:34] banquet and um i went running out trying
[48:37] to find a little store to find something
[48:39] and
[48:40] and uh tucson's a huge city
[48:43] and uh so i just was all over town just
[48:45] trying to get a get a shirt and you know
[48:47] finally finally found a jcpenney or
[48:49] something like that
[48:50] and um
[48:52] you know just just amazing i think i
[48:53] went in there and it used to be jcpenney
[48:55] you'll find just about everything but i
[48:57] went there and they were about
[48:59] empty
[49:00] um and you know i was kind of shocked at
[49:03] that like man you know only like two or
[49:05] three shirts that you can pick from
[49:07] and you know just something's going on
[49:10] you know um i know that even when i went
[49:12] to the grocery store
[49:14] shells are empty i can't get nothing
[49:17] so uh you know i'm realizing we're going
[49:18] to come to this spoken word real soon
[49:21] and we have to use the power that's been
[49:23] given to us
[49:24] praise the lord but uh but we made it by
[49:27] the grace of god you know there and then
[49:29] on saturday night the concert
[49:32] which i thought was
[49:33] a
[49:34] very historic
[49:37] um
[49:38] event
[49:39] tucson is not the
[49:42] uh
[49:44] it's not the easiest city to have a
[49:46] church in
[49:47] let me just put it that way
[49:49] um a lot of division you know there
[49:51] brother branham talked about it when he
[49:53] was here he said you know desert
[49:55] conditions
[49:56] and everybody's like a cactus a sticker
[49:59] sticking each other
[50:01] right and uh so it's a little little
[50:04] different you know and um
[50:06] but nonetheless uh for that concert to
[50:09] take place there in that city and
[50:11] churches came together and supported it
[50:13] and made it what it was i thought it was
[50:15] very historic and just a wonderful
[50:17] wonderful
[50:18] uh uh
[50:20] you know just just
[50:21] event and i know that there were many
[50:24] comments that came back from it and you
[50:26] know i heard that they want to try to
[50:28] get the choir to colorado and uh
[50:30] overseas and people just trying to go
[50:32] everywhere and people you know sending
[50:34] me texts like tell this brother so and
[50:36] so i'm like i really don't know that
[50:38] brother
[50:39] i just came just like he came
[50:42] but it sounded like we had been together
[50:44] for a while you know and it's just a
[50:46] virtual you know thing that they did and
[50:48] i think it was um like i said just a
[50:51] real blessing and then on sunday morning
[50:52] i went to
[50:53] brother caleb durham they're an amazing
[50:55] grace tabernacle and we we had service
[50:57] there and uh just had a wonderful

[51:08] the desert that are looking to try to
[51:09] come here to florida they said they want
[51:11] the florida experience
[51:14] i hope y'all can create a florida
[51:15] experience

[1:04:38] the lord is good unto us
[1:04:41] and as brother jack said
[1:04:43] the lord gave us the opportunity to go
[1:04:44] to uh i went to south america actually
[1:04:47] central america colombia
[1:04:49] uh bogota and uh fusa suga
[1:04:53] quite quite a mouthful names
[1:04:55] but each of them have some significance
[1:04:58] so i want us to look at the powerpoint
[1:05:01] slice and just give a brief report
[1:05:04] of what transpired in
[1:05:06] bogota fusaka suga colombia
[1:05:10] i went to
[1:05:11] the host pastor was brother
[1:05:14] gabriel
[1:05:17] and
[1:05:18] the lord did some wonderful things but
[1:05:21] jerry god bless you but the jedi gave me
[1:05:23] a right and we went through some things
[1:05:27] i think i was supposed to go on the 21st
[1:05:29] of december but then my covey text that
[1:05:32] i took on a sunday wasn't ready
[1:05:34] in fact i went and came back and the
[1:05:35] kobe test wasn't still ready
[1:05:38] so
[1:05:39] we had to drive around we left around by
[1:05:41] i think seven were underway called the
[1:05:44] place for the test it wasn't ready they
[1:05:46] were not even at work so we caught them
[1:05:48] after eight and they gave me the number
[1:05:50] of the lab to cut the lab i called the
[1:05:52] lab and they told me that
[1:05:54] don't put your trust in it
[1:05:56] it wasn't going to be ready because
[1:05:58] there's a sage of covid in the u.s
[1:06:00] so they had a bunch of tests and mine
[1:06:02] wasn't those who did their tests on
[1:06:04] sunday i shouldn't even expect the test
[1:06:06] to be ready uh even on the next day
[1:06:09] and the covetous should be ready within
[1:06:11] 72 hours so i went to the airport
[1:06:14] to inform them and they said well
[1:06:16] there's there's a test here rapid test
[1:06:17] which is if you want to pay 160 dollars
[1:06:20] go do it so i went to do it
[1:06:22] and i was supposed to be ready in within
[1:06:24] 20 minutes it wasn't ready within an
[1:06:25] hour
[1:06:27] so
[1:06:28] i had to reschedule the flight to
[1:06:30] 23rd and i had to do transit because
[1:06:32] there was no flight direct from
[1:06:35] fort lauderdale to um to bogota the
[1:06:38] capital i could either go through and
[1:06:41] what's the name of the place
[1:06:43] orlando and sleep over for 12 hours and
[1:06:46] i said it's not worth it so we arranged
[1:06:48] to
[1:06:48] go through another city called kali
[1:06:51] and
[1:06:51] from fort lauderdale to cali then kali
[1:06:54] to bogota so that was on the 23rd
[1:06:56] but the lord had a purpose because but
[1:06:59] we planned he planned to take me to
[1:07:01] other cities elsewhere to preach
[1:07:04] but the lord had
[1:07:05] a soul riding
[1:07:07] bogota that he wanted his word to touch
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:12] the lord knows how to touch each and
[1:07:13] every one of you and there's a testimony
[1:07:15] that i believe it through my heart for
[1:07:17] the lord to bring an atheist
[1:07:20] to receive the lord and to be baptized
[1:07:22] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:24] and that was
[1:07:26] so
[1:07:30] the lord could cause the pla was about
[1:07:33] abraham uh the flight to deliver for
[1:07:34] abraham to pray for a
[1:07:37] a colored woman in a forgotten alabama
[1:07:39] somewhere for for the son who was dying
[1:07:41] so they call can the mississippi thank
[1:07:44] you the lord can
[1:07:46] do whatever changes he need to make to
[1:07:48] reach to a single person
[1:07:50] a seed a prison a protested son or
[1:07:52] daughter of god amen
[1:07:55] the the slightest this is the out view
[1:07:57] of a sunset in is this yeah sunset um
[1:08:01] fusaka suga
[1:08:02] and fusa gazuga means
[1:08:04] um a woman
[1:08:06] who is hidden and is
[1:08:08] invincible and bogota means a planted
[1:08:11] field
[1:08:12] so i will use it part of the same one so
[1:08:14] that was it then the second slide is the
[1:08:16] friday i arrived on the thursday i think
[1:08:19] so
[1:08:20] and then we drove to but um brother
[1:08:24] gabriel picked me and we went to that
[1:08:26] was bogota we had a home service in
[1:08:28] bogota that night and that was when i
[1:08:31] came across i came in contact with one
[1:08:33] brother
[1:08:34] alejandra and his wife sister louisa
[1:08:37] and their story i'll talk more about it
[1:08:39] later on so the friday we had a sorry
[1:08:42] this thursday night we had a home
[1:08:44] service
[1:08:45] and then about 1am and then we drove two
[1:08:48] three hours to fusaka suga and i already
[1:08:51] know slept for about two days
[1:08:53] so we drove all the way to to uh for the
[1:08:56] garciages where we go stationed we had
[1:08:58] some sleep and the night was brother
[1:09:00] gabriel's parents-in-law's 50th wedding

[1:09:23] and the children three daughters and
[1:09:25] three sons and grandchildren

[1:09:28] was a wonderful time we had a wonderful
[1:09:31] time speaking at a 58 wedding
[1:09:33] anniversary
[1:09:34] so
[1:09:36] let's go to the next slide yeah so i had
[1:09:38] a chance to take a picture with them
[1:09:40] with a couple
[1:09:41] and they are wonderful so the saturday
[1:09:44] we started that was the christmas day
[1:09:46] itself we spent a christmas giving food
[1:09:48] to um people in town just like the food
[1:09:52] pantry we do here but this is different
[1:09:54] there you have to go and look for the
[1:09:56] people that you want to give food and
[1:09:58] pray for
[1:09:59] so you go to traffic lights downtown in
[1:10:03] front of stores and colombia has a lot
[1:10:06] of immigrants from um venezuela because
[1:10:09] of crisis political and economic crisis
[1:10:11] in venezuela so we have they have a lot
[1:10:13] of them there so they have a bunch of a
[1:10:15] lot of people community that they give
[1:10:17] food to and they go and buy the food
[1:10:19] from another set of believers who
[1:10:21] prepare it's like they call it tamales
[1:10:24] it's like
[1:10:25] tamales the regular one but they use
[1:10:27] plantain leaf and then they add rice
[1:10:30] corn vegetables and it's the amanda i'm
[1:10:32] sorry they add meats
[1:10:36] and they give it to them so
[1:10:38] so we went and
[1:10:40] our they have it they put on their
[1:10:41] t-shirts they call it our the lost not
[1:10:44] our community table that was a blue
[1:10:46] shirt that we we we had on so we went
[1:10:49] and asked gabriel what did we do he said
[1:10:51] you just go
[1:10:52] and the lord will take care i said i
[1:10:54] thought you should leave he said oh you
[1:10:56] go
[1:10:57] i'm going to record and you you are
[1:10:59] going to be the main person as a really
[1:11:00] so we divide ourselves into two group
[1:11:02] groups his father-in-law parents-in-law
[1:11:04] and
[1:11:05] his wife and the rest went to another
[1:11:07] place and
[1:11:08] my brother gabriel myself and his
[1:11:10] brother-in-law we went to downtown
[1:11:12] so we started giving giving out food and
[1:11:15] the people want praise
[1:11:17] from addiction from different things
[1:11:20] and it turned out to be a prayer line i
[1:11:22] was surprised
[1:11:24] about six people lining up in downtown i
[1:11:27] mean waiting for prayers you pray for
[1:11:28] this person the next person come
[1:11:30] somewhere as young as 14 year old
[1:11:33] uh girls or young ladies and 16 year old
[1:11:37] young boy they wanted prayer and they
[1:11:38] were asking where's your church
[1:11:40] but then but gabriel doesn't have
[1:11:42] a big church he rented a place they call
[1:11:44] it mountains i'll show you the pictures
[1:11:46] where they they gather once in a while
[1:11:49] but then he he transmitted a savage from
[1:11:51] home because the people are some are
[1:11:54] different places in bogota and it
[1:11:55] doesn't have a big church so we do what
[1:11:57] you call catch and release like you
[1:11:59] catch a fish and you turn the face back
[1:12:01] in the river and i said but the gabriel
[1:12:03] you can't be doing this i mean people
[1:12:04] want to go to church they want their
[1:12:05] word their hearts are so warm for the
[1:12:08] word of the lord they want to receive
[1:12:09] their word you give the word to them and
[1:12:11] they just i mean receive it just like
[1:12:14] that
[1:12:15] receive the word they want to they want
[1:12:16] christ and there was no church so
[1:12:19] we we just pray for them and we just say
[1:12:21] let the lord take care of them so we had
[1:12:23] and i said gabriel i'm going to pray for
[1:12:25] you that the lord will bless you there a
[1:12:27] place that you can i come on the account
[1:12:29] of the people so we had um let's see go
[1:12:32] to the next slide please okay good thank
[1:12:34] you yeah this is a family a young lady
[1:12:36] and a children that we prayed for
[1:12:38] on the streets and they wanted to go to
[1:12:40] church but we don't have a chat so
[1:12:42] sometimes it gives them the website
[1:12:44] address but you know new people is much
[1:12:46] better if you have a place to
[1:12:47] accommodate them the next slide
[1:12:51] yeah this is um friday night after we
[1:12:54] finished no that was saturday
[1:12:56] yeah saturday evening we went to where
[1:12:57] the fellowship this actually is supposed
[1:12:59] to be the church as a two-story building
[1:13:00] bamboo there's a bamboo structure so
[1:13:03] they have a place they call it a
[1:13:04] mountain and what he uses it for
[1:13:07] is to seek those who want to see the
[1:13:08] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:13:10] uh he's about to quickly sometimes we
[1:13:12] baptize the people they come to receive
[1:13:13] the word of the lord we baptize them and
[1:13:15] then that's okay we think everything is
[1:13:17] okay but we don't
[1:13:19] help them or lead them to receive the
[1:13:20] holy ghost or we don't preach the holy
[1:13:22] ghost the significance of the holy ghost
[1:13:24] enough to them so what he does is
[1:13:27] this they call it the mountains it's
[1:13:28] sunny by a mountain and if you want to
[1:13:30] go and stay there for whenever you want
[1:13:32] to pray and seek for the holy ghost you
[1:13:34] can do that or if you want him to go
[1:13:36] with you with his wife they go there
[1:13:38] they have place that you can lodge the
[1:13:40] the the upstairs and the downstairs and
[1:13:43] you can study for whenever you want and
[1:13:44] you pray and pray and pray and pray to
[1:13:48] you
[1:13:49] and the almighty your creator are sure
[1:13:52] that you have the creator in you you
[1:13:53] have got the holy ghost baptism and i
[1:13:55] said that is very laudable
[1:13:57] so that is um
[1:13:59] let me see when is the next one yeah
[1:14:01] this is after i preached on the sunday
[1:14:03] that was sunday uh photo we preached
[1:14:06] at the place the mountains and after he
[1:14:08] asked me to give testimonies and that is
[1:14:10] when the lord began to deal with certain
[1:14:12] hearts so i preach and
[1:14:15] on redemption in two parts
[1:14:18] and after that i ask you to give
[1:14:20] testimony you play guitar go and rest a
[1:14:22] little bit and then we come back and we
[1:14:24] pray we pray sorry yeah we pray and then
[1:14:27] give testimonies and there was one lady
[1:14:31] louisa and her sister-in-law the
[1:14:32] husband's um sister is called a yuya
[1:14:37] they were crying all the time
[1:14:39] sharing tears of repentance and i didn't
[1:14:41] know exactly what they were going
[1:14:43] through so they cried for hours we
[1:14:46] prayed and we give testimonies we prayed
[1:14:48] you know thomas because this was
[1:14:50] christmas time nobody's going to work so
[1:14:52] we had probably spent about four or five
[1:14:54] hours after the service praying and and
[1:14:57] giving testimonies and answering
[1:15:00] questions and so on and so forth
[1:15:02] so one of the
[1:15:04] one of them were really two of not one
[1:15:06] of them one family was touched
[1:15:08] one brother is called a brother some
[1:15:10] samwell i think his picture is somewhere
[1:15:12] he's when one of the blue but
[1:15:14] somewhere was but of gabriel's first
[1:15:16] convert when he received a message he
[1:15:18] was baptized in the name of the lord 18
[1:15:20] years ago and his son is alejandra who
[1:15:23] was an atheist
[1:15:25] he was smart he was a college professor
[1:15:28] i think a chemistry
[1:15:29] and he's received award from the
[1:15:31] president of colombia he has awards from
[1:15:34] argentina he does research in
[1:15:37] was the name of uh renault
[1:15:39] renewable energy and he's so smart so he
[1:15:43] he had nothing to do with it he didn't
[1:15:44] believe his mecca existed you know an
[1:15:47] atheist it is those who don't believe
[1:15:49] god existed you know they came from i
[1:15:52] don't know wherever they came from
[1:15:53] proteins and organic soup and
[1:15:56] i don't know monkeys or whatever
[1:15:59] so that is it is believed so this guy
[1:16:01] was a young man 44 years old and very
[1:16:04] very intellectually smart so
[1:16:06] i think the parents came from a catholic
[1:16:08] background and then his father received
[1:16:11] a message and his mom received a message
[1:16:13] but he had nothing to do with religion
[1:16:16] well so i think about a month ago before
[1:16:18] i went the the wife and and uh
[1:16:21] the young man asked
[1:16:23] brother gabriel to come and visit them
[1:16:24] it looks like they have some issues and
[1:16:26] he prayed for them and so when i went we
[1:16:28] first met in bogota we talked about
[1:16:30] job and different things we didn't talk
[1:16:32] too much about we didn't i mean i didn't
[1:16:34] i thought he was a believer so we just
[1:16:36] talked about what do i what do you do
[1:16:38] what do you do we just conversate on
[1:16:40] that
[1:16:40] then the sunday is when the lord was
[1:16:42] dealing with the wife the wife was
[1:16:43] crying and he asked me to pray for the
[1:16:45] husband on something so we prayed and
[1:16:47] the monday they came to where i was
[1:16:49] staying and we ministered to them again
[1:16:52] and then they slept over
[1:16:54] and we kept the tuesday the wife and the
[1:16:57] sister were still and the house
[1:16:58] brother-in-law
[1:16:59] they were just in tears and crying and
[1:17:02] crying and you could see the lord was
[1:17:04] dealing with them so but i gave it to
[1:17:06] you and it looks like they want to be
[1:17:07] baptized in the name of the lord and i
[1:17:09] said okay is i keep praying for them but
[1:17:11] he has to go to work the next day he's a
[1:17:13] professor and he's very busy he has to
[1:17:14] go back to bogota but he's taking
[1:17:16] decision with his wife as to whether to
[1:17:19] stay and then we go baptize them on
[1:17:20] wednesday so keep praying for them so we
[1:17:23] kept praying and they decided not to go
[1:17:26] to work but they want to be baptized in
[1:17:28] the name of the lord so
[1:17:30] on the wednesday we went to their family
[1:17:32] home and fellowship and we took time to
[1:17:34] go into
[1:17:36] uh why we baptized in the name of the
[1:17:37] lord we went to scriptures from from old
[1:17:40] testament new testament and we give them
[1:17:42] various examples in book of acts
[1:17:45] uh where
[1:17:46] uh disciples the day of pentecost peter
[1:17:48] was commissioned
[1:17:49] and that repent and be baptized in the
[1:17:51] name of the lord jesus christ and you
[1:17:53] receive the gift of the holy ghost so we
[1:17:55] went through so many scriptures in
[1:17:56] ephesians and
[1:17:59] acts
[1:17:59] cornelius and different ones paul was
[1:18:02] baptized in the name of the lord so we
[1:18:04] give all those fundamental
[1:18:06] bases or doctrines of baptism in the
[1:18:08] name of the lord and then we went to see
[1:18:11] if we could baptize them in a pond they
[1:18:13] they have
[1:18:14] beautiful structures in colombia our
[1:18:15] shirt some of their burdens
[1:18:17] is way beyond what we can imagine here
[1:18:20] and i said wow you people are rich
[1:18:24] and bogota as well they have a lot of
[1:18:26] skyscrapers all over in bogota and they
[1:18:28] have new apartment where but brother
[1:18:30] gabriel lives looks like a new city that
[1:18:32] is being constructed and said but
[1:18:34] gabriel is it a new cities they know i
[1:18:36] was raised up here when i was young the
[1:18:38] road was stunning they had a stony road
[1:18:40] that was bought by the
[1:18:42] indians they have native indians in
[1:18:44] colombia but then construction began and
[1:18:47] the whole place is different they have
[1:18:49] everywhere new new building developing
[1:18:52] everywhere so we went to one of the
[1:18:53] swimming pool to see if we could baptize
[1:18:55] them but they said they refused because
[1:18:57] people were swimming so we have to go to
[1:19:00] the woods to go and look for navigate
[1:19:04] go and look for a place to baptize so we
[1:19:06] went and let me see go back to
[1:19:09] i think the previous pictures
[1:19:12] yes this is the next one
[1:19:14] yes this is brad alejandro and his wife
[1:19:16] louisa and their son nicolas so that was
[1:19:19] on our way to to to the baptism to the
[1:19:21] river so we went to the river and we
[1:19:24] were looking for there were a lot of we
[1:19:26] couldn't have a place which was deep
[1:19:28] enough to baptize we're looking for like
[1:19:30] an hour because they were so shallow the
[1:19:32] river was shallow this it wasn't every
[1:19:34] but it was actually like a stream and
[1:19:36] people were there tourists a lot of
[1:19:37] colombians who live in the u.s here they
[1:19:40] were there somewhere doing they're
[1:19:42] having fun barbecue and different things
[1:19:43] so we went to
[1:19:44] and we couldn't get enough
[1:19:46] place which was at least deep enough to
[1:19:48] baptize them so i was having a stick
[1:19:51] go to the next one i had some stick
[1:19:54] trying to find out where it's deep
[1:19:56] enough because there were a lot of
[1:19:57] stones
[1:19:58] and uh but gabriel and i were doing that
[1:20:00] and he got himself baptized first
[1:20:04] he stopped over and he he ran in the
[1:20:06] river and he said brother gabriel you
[1:20:08] believe your you believe your your dog
[1:20:09] training so you want to leave by the
[1:20:11] example you just had some people he just
[1:20:13] drowned in his money and his paperwork
[1:20:16] were all wet so we pull him out and then
[1:20:19] we baptize alejandro at that place and
[1:20:22] this is the team his father-in-law is
[1:20:24] singing songs and alejandro's appearance
[1:20:27] i think they were on the other side they
[1:20:28] were not in the pictures so whilst we
[1:20:30] were baptizing three men came around
[1:20:33] they were one of them actually lives
[1:20:35] right in west palm beach here uh
[1:20:37] military and one of the road
[1:20:40] so i share the word of the lord with
[1:20:42] them
[1:20:43] i think they have not even seen somebody
[1:20:44] baptizing they got to know
[1:20:47] sister carolina by gabriel's
[1:20:49] wife's auntie so they came around and
[1:20:52] said what are you guys doing here and
[1:20:53] they said we brought somebody to baptize
[1:20:55] what is that so i gave them what is
[1:20:57] baptism they were not acquainted with
[1:20:59] the bible
[1:21:00] and i asked them what did they do and
[1:21:01] the guy said he said he's a
[1:21:03] medi he meditate he's not a christian so
[1:21:06] i gave the word to them and his two
[1:21:07] brothers they receive it and say well
[1:21:09] sometimes you just all you need is to
[1:21:11] plant
[1:21:12] the lord has the harvest time so you
[1:21:14] just don't worry about if the rest the
[1:21:16] lord will take care you plant and so the
[1:21:18] lord will send somebody to do the
[1:21:19] harvesting so we sow the seed with them
[1:21:22] and we had a wonderful time with them
[1:21:24] and there was a dog this dog came right
[1:21:26] where a black dog came in he baptized
[1:21:28] himself he came and just got himself
[1:21:30] baptized
[1:21:33] and left and came to observe and i said
[1:21:35] the lord that's miracles
[1:21:37] a dog came to baptize himself
[1:21:41] was it in the bible somewhere
[1:21:43] was it a is that if you won't give what
[1:21:45] is that the lord can raise children out
[1:21:47] of i forgot the scriptures stones right
[1:21:50] to give glory to god something like that
[1:21:53] to be so the lord can use animals even
[1:21:55] for a symbol
[1:21:56] so the animal the dog got himself
[1:21:58] baptized and i think he's got a seed of
[1:21:59] presentation
[1:22:02] so that was uh
[1:22:04] that was the baptist oh i think i missed
[1:22:06] some of the pictures when we were
[1:22:07] praying for the
[1:22:08] the street okay let's keep going so
[1:22:11] this is what it looks like
[1:22:14] the whole purpose of me going was this
[1:22:16] a gentleman and his wife
[1:22:18] so after he was baptized he gave me one
[1:22:20] of the biggest hacks
[1:22:30] glory
[1:22:32] and god bless you brother jerry but
[1:22:33] jerry and i had a right
[1:22:36] on that day
[1:22:37] but jerry is so he wasn't protected at
[1:22:39] all because i was already had to go to
[1:22:41] work
[1:22:41] and was driving around we tried to stop
[1:22:43] and call the that was the first day i
[1:22:46] went 21st
[1:22:47] and i called the covet people to find
[1:22:49] out if my test was ready
[1:22:51] and the test wasn't ready the police
[1:22:53] would come hey leave before we give you
[1:22:55] tickets and but the jerry would drive
[1:22:57] around and come back to the same spot
[1:22:59] and bridget was as calm as cam could be
[1:23:02] he wasn't moved i said i was worried a
[1:23:04] little bit for his work and he said no
[1:23:06] i've called my boss i'm fine
[1:23:08] and he was so
[1:23:10] so
[1:23:11] i mean the lord put gifting people god
[1:23:13] bless you by the jerry
[1:23:14] and
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:20] all the toys we were going through was
[1:23:23] for this gentleman and his wife
[1:23:25] because the lord wanted to cut part of
[1:23:27] the trip that was planned off so that we
[1:23:29] could concentrate on this guy
[1:23:31] because if i had to go to other places
[1:23:32] he wouldn't have spent enough time there
[1:23:35] i mean to be able to maybe connect with
[1:23:37] this guy how the lord wanted us to
[1:23:38] connect so the lord sometimes when
[1:23:40] something is going on you might think
[1:23:41] it's the devil yes the lord allowed the
[1:23:43] devil to do it allow satan but he's for
[1:23:45] to accomplish the purpose of the lord
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:49] and and i let me finish before i get
[1:23:51] into preaching
[1:23:53] praise god hallelujah so we finished
[1:23:54] with him and we came back and it was
[1:23:57] just it's like mission accomplished
[1:24:00] his wife uh louisa sister louisa also
[1:24:03] got baptized
[1:24:04] and they were the parents were so so
[1:24:06] happy yeah this let me see
[1:24:09] let me shoot if you can show me this
[1:24:11] picture
[1:24:15] do you see it
[1:24:18] okay let me let me show it to you
[1:24:20] oh they got it thank you god bless you
[1:24:25] go back please i think it was
[1:24:30] the lord touched um brother alejandro's
[1:24:32] sisters to julia she was
[1:24:36] she was she has been baptized already by
[1:24:38] by the gabriel in the name of the lord
[1:24:39] but then
[1:24:41] they went with a husband they went to be
[1:24:42] baptized yes sister zuzia she went back
[1:24:44] and said i've been baptized like four
[1:24:46] times
[1:24:47] i went back to the indonesian church and
[1:24:49] they told me that no i was wrong to be
[1:24:50] baptized in the name of the lord i
[1:24:52] needed to be baptized in the name of the
[1:24:53] father the son and the holy ghost so i
[1:24:55] went back to baptize the name of the
[1:24:57] lord and i had already been baptized i
[1:24:58] think in catholic
[1:24:59] and i've been baptized somewhere else so
[1:25:01] she's going to say what do i do she was
[1:25:03] crying
[1:25:04] and i said well i think probably what
[1:25:05] you need is the holy ghost baptism but
[1:25:06] if you want to baptize again but a giver
[1:25:08] can baptize you so
[1:25:10] a sister juja and her husband is also
[1:25:12] called alejandro they all have
[1:25:14] five-year-old sons
[1:25:15] and they were crying for hours and
[1:25:17] sister brother alejandro's wife
[1:25:20] and a sister-in-law the lord was just
[1:25:23] dealing with them and they just pouring
[1:25:25] their heart out and they just they have
[1:25:28] been also being very supportive with
[1:25:29] their food pantry they call it a our
[1:25:32] community table
[1:25:33] and so
[1:25:34] we went on so yeah so you can go on to
[1:25:36] to let me see today where we were before
[1:25:40] so that was the baptism we finished the
[1:25:41] baptism then
[1:25:43] we baptized them and then we came back
[1:25:44] to bogota that was on the the day before
[1:25:48] december 30th i think that was
[1:25:51] i don't remember the day but we came
[1:25:52] back to bogota and we had another
[1:25:54] service in bogota this is one brother
[1:25:56] brother
[1:25:57] hugo and his wife's sister
[1:25:59] claudia their home is where but uh
[1:26:02] gabriel did have fellowship in bogota
[1:26:05] and bogota is planted filled
[1:26:07] and the lord touched some family one
[1:26:09] this
[1:26:11] young man and his wife and family they
[1:26:14] were attached they were a christian
[1:26:15] their brother was telling me that but
[1:26:16] gabriel was telling that his brother has
[1:26:17] a ministry
[1:26:19] but he hasn't given his life fully to
[1:26:21] the wet so
[1:26:22] we should pray for him and the lord
[1:26:23] dealt with them and like i said
[1:26:25] sometimes all you need to do is sow
[1:26:27] the plantain will come in its own time
[1:26:30] so that was um
[1:26:32] a bits about bogota just a snapshot
[1:26:35] about bogota and colombia
[1:26:40] so god bless you for all the
[1:26:41] contribution and the blessing and the
[1:26:43] prayers
[1:26:44] the lord touch and transform
[1:26:47] an atheist who doesn't even believe
[1:26:50] that there's an existence of a greater
[1:26:52] power
[1:26:53] parents were missing believers
[1:26:55] is your son or daughter an atheist
[1:26:58] if the lord could transform an atheist
[1:27:00] the lord can do for your son
[1:27:02] your children your parents
[1:27:04] your your spouse
[1:27:06] [Applause]
[1:27:11] if the lord can take the intellectual
[1:27:12] from an atheist
[1:27:14] and humble him to receive jesus christ
[1:27:16] in his heart
[1:27:17] and his wife used to be a staunch
[1:27:19] catholic they are all now
[1:27:21] baptized not just baptized but they have
[1:27:23] received their love with all of their
[1:27:24] hearts so let's pray for them that the
[1:27:26] lord will fill them with the holy ghost
[1:27:28] and they have a mountain they place the
[1:27:30] cod mountain where they go and pray to
[1:27:32] seek the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:27:34] and so
[1:27:35] so let's come back to uh the same one
[1:27:39] and see if you can share something a
[1:27:41] little
[1:27:43] about redemption in two parts amen
[1:27:48] i think
[1:27:49] the lord is good
[1:27:51] praise god hallelujah amen there's
[1:27:53] nothing the lord can do for you
[1:27:56] there's nothing
[1:27:57] and no matter how your loved one has
[1:27:59] gone he's still in the palms of god's
[1:28:02] hands
[1:28:03] they've not gone nowhere he can be an
[1:28:04] atheist he can be wherever he might be
[1:28:06] he might go as
[1:28:08] as as away as you can be
[1:28:11] let them go wherever they want
[1:28:13] in sin in the deepest of hell
[1:28:15] there was a david is it even there
[1:28:18] you are there with me amen
[1:28:20] let them sink in the deepest talk about
[1:28:22] whatever sin you can think about
[1:28:25] the seed of representation which is
[1:28:27] christ
[1:28:28] is in them
[1:28:30] and they see they can run but they see
[1:28:31] do not run away from them
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:35] in in uh
[1:28:36] there's something you cannot sink a seed
[1:28:38] of god

[1:28:41] you
[1:28:42] adam where are thou
[1:28:44] my son where are thou my daughter where
[1:28:46] are thou
[1:28:47] and that voice
[1:28:49] that voice becomes stronger and stronger
[1:28:51] and to get to a place that they can
[1:28:53] resist that voice
[1:28:55] and that voice will bring them back to
[1:28:56] where they belong to amen
[1:28:59] the lord can let you go through as a
[1:29:00] parent as as a spouse as an uncle as a
[1:29:03] brother as a pastor as a minister you
[1:29:06] can go through
[1:29:07] a lot amen just for the sake of one
[1:29:10] person
[1:29:11] one family one one child one daughter
[1:29:15] the lord can let you suffer and go to
[1:29:17] trials they'll wreck your heart yes
[1:29:19] you're a human being even jesus on a
[1:29:21] cross he cried amen but
[1:29:24] the seed will never leave them amen
[1:29:28] they can't even blaspheme themselves out
[1:29:29] it's impossible
[1:29:31] because they were part of eternity
[1:29:33] and they are part of eternity and they
[1:29:35] are eternally part of eternity amen
[1:29:38] so a seed of god can never be lost it's
[1:29:41] impossible amen so you believe as the
[1:29:44] prophet said that he said you apply the
[1:29:46] talking

[1:30:03] process
[1:30:04] they are going to the the contrast of
[1:30:06] redemption
[1:30:07] so that when the lord bring them out
[1:30:10] they can look back and see oh my
[1:30:12] where was i and they can have a priest
[1:30:15] to give unto the living god amen
[1:30:17] so all is well amen our loved ones they
[1:30:20] are here already amen

[1:30:51] his time
[1:30:52] is his time amen and his time is our
[1:30:55] time
[1:30:56] amen so in his time you bring them from
[1:30:58] wherever let it let them let them do
[1:31:01] whatever they can go to

[1:31:08] pillow fire in their heart will put them
[1:31:11] right to where they belong to a man
[1:31:14] because because they are god's children
[1:31:16] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:31:18] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:31:20] christ amen glory hallelujah if the lord
[1:31:24] transformed alejandro from being an
[1:31:27] atheist somebody who has even brought
[1:31:29] gabriel was telling me said he's in some
[1:31:30] organization the government some gorilla

[1:31:40] grandfather one of her grandparents was
[1:31:42] a previous president of mexico colombia
[1:31:45] and the lord brought them out
[1:31:47] to receive to be humbled
[1:31:50] not to be baptized in a pool no
[1:31:52] to baptize in the stream
[1:31:54] dirty stream
[1:31:56] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:31:59] what can the lord do for you and i
[1:32:02] amen
[1:32:03] so the lord has a purpose for everything
[1:32:05] amen
[1:32:07] so the school room experience is just a
[1:32:09] transitional experience amen we are
[1:32:12] passing here for purpose
[1:32:14] to both character
[1:32:15] to build a temple
[1:32:17] but the real promise is there amen
[1:32:20] glory hallelujah so let's look at our
[1:32:22] ceremony and redemption in two parts
[1:32:25] let's go to our same one let's go to the
[1:32:27] next slide redemption is um
[1:32:30] calling out as the prophet preached to
[1:32:32] us
[1:32:32] calling out
[1:32:34] and then entering in
[1:32:37] so you have to be you have to be called
[1:32:39] out the mail does the calling
[1:32:42] the mail is christ
[1:32:44] the mail is the messengers the mail is a
[1:32:47] ministry the evangelist the prophet the
[1:32:49] pastors the apostles
[1:32:51] uh the teachers they are the male form
[1:32:53] of christ
[1:32:54] and they do their calling amen
[1:32:57] and their male could be you it could be
[1:32:58] their mother it could be their daughter
[1:32:59] it could be their wife it's the seed
[1:33:01] it's not a physical female but the seed
[1:33:04] of god calling a seed of god deep
[1:33:06] calling for the deep so the male is the
[1:33:09] calling and the female response amen
[1:33:12] so the males that are calling come out
[1:33:13] my daughter come out my son and be no be
[1:33:16] partakers of their sin
[1:33:18] and then you have to make a choice that
[1:33:21] is the female
[1:33:22] respond that yes i do
[1:33:25] and then you march on to enter into
[1:33:27] christ
[1:33:28] to receive the holy ghost baptism amen
[1:33:30] blessed be the name of the lord so i
[1:33:32] have a bunch of let's go to

[1:33:36] that is we have types in the bibles we
[1:33:38] can use moses moses was picked from from
[1:33:41] the water that was calling out coming
[1:33:43] out from from the water and then joshua

[1:33:48] he apportioned the land for them in
[1:33:50] kinderland and we can we go to some
[1:33:52] scriptures so egypt is a type of calling
[1:33:55] out and canaan is the promised land
[1:33:58] egypt is a world and canaan is the holy
[1:34:00] ghost baptism
[1:34:02] and then when you are called out you
[1:34:04] have to go through seven church ages
[1:34:06] you have to build you have to destroy
[1:34:09] and build you have to destroy the old
[1:34:11] nature
[1:34:12] the pillar of fire has to destroy the
[1:34:14] old nature
[1:34:15] and christ has to come in amen before
[1:34:18] you have to pass through river jordan
[1:34:20] and then go to canaan land amen in 1933
[1:34:23] a prophet god sent a prophet with
[1:34:25] abraham the lord called him out of his
[1:34:27] bapti baptist denomination
[1:34:29] and then through him he called the
[1:34:31] people from
[1:34:32] baptism in the name of titles and dead
[1:34:35] dead names to baptism in the name of the
[1:34:37] lord jesus christ so that was a river
[1:34:40] and then he entered into the pillow fire
[1:34:42] on mount sunset in 1963
[1:34:45] to receive the seven seals
[1:34:47] but then between then we can talk about
[1:34:48] the church ages we know the church
[1:34:50] changes from paul to abraham but then in
[1:34:53] brahms ministry we can talk about seven
[1:34:55] churches ministry
[1:34:57] in 1960 sorry 1956 the church ages came
[1:35:00] to an end
[1:35:02] the lord closed the churches he said
[1:35:03] america has got his last calling and the
[1:35:06] lord gave america to himself or herself
[1:35:09] so 56 up to 63 when the services were
[1:35:12] revealed was seven years so it's a type
[1:35:14] of another church ages that this judge
[1:35:17] went through amen so 1983 was coming out
[1:35:21] of water water means multitude of people
[1:35:24] and then entering to the cloud of
[1:35:25] witness on sunset mountain amen the
[1:35:29] cloud is not just a cloud but it's few
[1:35:31] funnies
[1:35:32] it's pillar of christ and all his
[1:35:34] eternal attributes
[1:35:35] adam and all the sons and daughters of
[1:35:37] god from adam to the last one even those
[1:35:39] who were not born they were there amen
[1:35:42] glory hallelujah we don't have time but
[1:35:43] if you go to the bible revelation when
[1:35:45] john
[1:35:46] um on the island of patmos when he cried
[1:35:50] for redemption there was no redemption
[1:35:52] and john was crying
[1:35:53] and a voice said don't cry that was uh
[1:35:56] the lamp john the lamp is what uh is
[1:35:59] worthy to the lamp of god is is overcome
[1:36:02] and prevail the land of trouble of judah
[1:36:04] and he said who that was william brahm
[1:36:06] the seventh angel
[1:36:08] before he dropped on earth john wanted
[1:36:10] to worship the seven angel but he said
[1:36:12] don't worship me i'm just one of you one
[1:36:14] of the messengers worship the lord jesus
[1:36:16] christ amen so before even you dropped
[1:36:19] here you had a manifestation in the on
[1:36:21] the antenna in eternal dimension amen so
[1:36:25] you went you existed before the
[1:36:27] financial world and you exist what you
[1:36:30] are going through
[1:36:31] a sinner going through drinking is just
[1:36:33] going through the shadow but he already
[1:36:35] was safe before the foundation of the
[1:36:37] world amen glory hallelujah so let's go
[1:36:40] to some scriptures that talk about the
[1:36:42] calling in hosea chapter 1 verse 1
[1:36:46] calling us out of the world out of egypt
[1:36:49] into christ
[1:36:51] i think it's the second and second slide
[1:36:54] slide two is it when israel was a child
[1:36:57] then i left him and i called my son out
[1:36:59] of egypt
[1:37:01] so the calling of the lord is out of
[1:37:02] love
[1:37:03] calling you from the world from sin
[1:37:06] sin is satan in your nature the old
[1:37:09] breath and then giving you the new
[1:37:10] breath through his love amen now if you
[1:37:14] go to revelation 18 in the same voice
[1:37:16] christ come out
[1:37:18] out of them and be not be partakers of
[1:37:19] their sins and receive not of a place
[1:37:22] the judgment that is ongoing
[1:37:24] second corinthians 6 6 16 to 17 is also
[1:37:28] calling these people out is a what
[1:37:30] agreement the lord is creating now a
[1:37:31] contrast
[1:37:33] that there's no agreement between you
[1:37:35] and and and the world
[1:37:37] come out and i will walk in you and i'll
[1:37:40] be a god and they shall be my people so
[1:37:42] the lord is calling us to be his people
[1:37:45] he said wherefore come out of among them
[1:37:47] and be separate so the calling calls for
[1:37:50] separation
[1:37:51] separation from the old life
[1:37:53] and then be united into the light with
[1:37:55] the life of christ
[1:37:57] amen
[1:37:58] glory hallelujah
[1:38:00] 18 and said i will be a father unto you
[1:38:03] and it shall be my sons and daughters
[1:38:04] says the lord almighty
[1:38:06] verse uh sorry ephesians 2 14 for he is
[1:38:09] our peace
[1:38:10] who he who is he
[1:38:12] christ timber jack has been on that
[1:38:14] series for pieces what a person
[1:38:18] a person of who jesus christ
[1:38:20] and he's you amen
[1:38:22] glory hallelujah
[1:38:24] he has made both one broken down the
[1:38:26] middle wall of partition
[1:38:27] glory hallelujah because you have to
[1:38:29] come up from chaos and then go into
[1:38:31] peace if you read joshua chapter one
[1:38:34] verse one to eight that was the lord
[1:38:36] calling joshua after the death of moses
[1:38:39] now the calling is over you have to now
[1:38:41] go entry and enter in into and enter
[1:38:44] into the promised land to inherit your
[1:38:46] promises what promises the law talking
[1:38:48] about it is the holy ghost baptism for
[1:38:51] the individual and for the church amen
[1:38:54] if you are here and you are not sure
[1:38:57] that you have got christ in you
[1:38:59] today is your day amen
[1:39:02] if you are not sure that you have christ
[1:39:05] thank you jesus
[1:39:07] the pill of fire in your heart
[1:39:09] that there's another being beside a
[1:39:11] human being sitting down
[1:39:13] then today is the day amen
[1:39:15] then you have to go to uh the mountain
[1:39:17] to seek the lord the mountain is in your
[1:39:20] heart
[1:39:20] amen because we came to
[1:39:23] to this world individually even if you
[1:39:25] were born twins
[1:39:26] one came first and the other came
[1:39:29] you have to seek the lord for yourself
[1:39:31] and when you seek him with all of your
[1:39:32] heart you will find him
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:35] so don't be happy
[1:39:37] don't be
[1:39:38] uh don't be what's the word i'm trying
[1:39:41] to use don't be uh
[1:39:43] i don't remember but don't be satisfied
[1:39:45] if you don't have the holy ghost if
[1:39:47] you're just a church member
[1:39:49] if you just come to church because when
[1:39:51] you're in church the anointing of the
[1:39:52] pastor is your father spiritual father
[1:39:55] he's your spiritual husband anointing of
[1:39:57] the brothers who hover around you it
[1:39:59] will protect you but when you are by
[1:40:01] yourself
[1:40:02] when christ is not here
[1:40:04] then the old person and his wits will
[1:40:07] come out
[1:40:08] so baptism
[1:40:10] means baptism is a greek word means to
[1:40:12] die to be buried
[1:40:14] the old person has to die be consumed by
[1:40:16] the lake of fire by the pillar of fire
[1:40:18] by the word
[1:40:19] by jesus christ then the seed that has
[1:40:22] been there eternally
[1:40:24] does he take a boat of your house of
[1:40:26] your house renovate and cleanse you and
[1:40:29] then he dwells in you and he becomes
[1:40:30] your husband and your kin amen and then
[1:40:33] you have peace in yourself
[1:40:35] people who don't have the holy ghost
[1:40:37] they don't have peace that's right
[1:40:38] you can have all the world
[1:40:40] alejandra was popular he had awards from
[1:40:43] presidents
[1:40:44] go to argentina to receive awards
[1:40:46] but there was something lacking
[1:40:50] he wasn't he was an atheist but he knew
[1:40:52] there was a maker amen
[1:40:54] at a death point when you are dying
[1:40:57] your pastor cannot take your place for
[1:40:59] you
[1:41:00] your mother cannot take your place
[1:41:03] your husband cannot take your place
[1:41:05] your wife cannot take your place
[1:41:07] you and your maker alone
[1:41:09] and that's why you have to settle the
[1:41:11] same question sin is not necessary means
[1:41:13] drinking smoking those are the
[1:41:14] attributes
[1:41:16] sin means unbelief satan in your nature
[1:41:19] you need to get rid of that nature
[1:41:21] the old nature
[1:41:23] and then christ the new nature take a
[1:41:26] hold of your heart
[1:41:27] and then he becomes your life amen
[1:41:31] so you have to ask yourself take
[1:41:32] self-inventory in your life and ask
[1:41:34] yourself that do i cocoo
[1:41:37] or hindu affair do i have christ in me
[1:41:40] if i should drop dead on the puppet now
[1:41:42] am i ready to go
[1:41:46] is the question you every individual
[1:41:47] that's why we come here amen
[1:41:49] we come we don't come here to show our
[1:41:51] dresses we don't come here to see one
[1:41:53] another but we come here to make sure
[1:41:56] that if it's time for me to transition
[1:41:58] i'm ready to transition
[1:42:00] because death is not a respectable
[1:42:02] person
[1:42:03] that's that doesn't respect whether you
[1:42:05] are old you are young you are a baby you
[1:42:07] just drop from the womb death can take
[1:42:10] you when it has to take you
[1:42:12] there was a man there was a story in
[1:42:13] brazil
[1:42:15] that there was a person that was
[1:42:16] assigned to die at a certain time
[1:42:18] and the guy decided you know what i'm
[1:42:20] going to there was a death angel to come
[1:42:21] and pick him up he said i'm going to do
[1:42:23] something i'm not going to let the death
[1:42:24] angel pick me up so he changed the color
[1:42:26] of his hair
[1:42:28] and then he left his home
[1:42:30] and there was like a lot of celebration
[1:42:32] in town so he went to town and the death
[1:42:33] angel came
[1:42:34] to his house he wasn't there
[1:42:37] and he went around looking through the
[1:42:38] city looking through for this guy
[1:42:40] couldn't get him and he saw a guy with a
[1:42:42] weird
[1:42:44] hair color and say you know what i need
[1:42:45] to take somebody today
[1:42:47] he just took him
[1:42:52] he couldn't hide from death
[1:42:55] there's a story of a forgotten story i
[1:42:57] think macbeth old literature that one of
[1:43:00] the kings did something evil
[1:43:03] i think it's like erica knows that story
[1:43:05] and the king was assigned that a tree is
[1:43:07] going to fall on him to die
[1:43:09] he said that's the case i'm not going to
[1:43:10] die i'm going to i will never go to the
[1:43:12] woods to begin with i'm going to get my
[1:43:14] uh subject to cut all the trees around
[1:43:16] my house
[1:43:18] so they even they'd even have flowers
[1:43:19] they cut every tree he said then i won't
[1:43:21] die because
[1:43:23] there's no truth to fall on me
[1:43:26] one day he was lying on his bed
[1:43:28] and the wood
[1:43:30] one of the a wood
[1:43:32] furniture
[1:43:34] wood that was used in the ceiling
[1:43:36] fell on him and he died
[1:43:39] when it's time to go glory you're gonna
[1:43:41] go
[1:43:42] whether you like it or not
[1:43:44] so you have to don't let this work well
[1:43:46] take you over
[1:43:48] don't let the fanciful life take you
[1:43:50] over
[1:43:51] don't let america take you over the
[1:43:53] laodicean spirit in america in all the
[1:43:55] nations is the same spirit ladies yeah
[1:43:58] it works in different countries in
[1:43:59] different ways
[1:44:01] don't let that spirit take you over
[1:44:03] but let jesus christ take over your
[1:44:05] heart amen
[1:44:07] because when you're on your deathbed
[1:44:09] it's you and your maker
[1:44:11] and whether you are ready or not if
[1:44:12] death calls upon you and i you gotta go
[1:44:16] amen so the only thing you can do is now
[1:44:19] that you have life you have blood i mean
[1:44:22] circulating in your body give your heart
[1:44:24] all to the lord amen
[1:44:27] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:44:29] the lord jesus christ and be married to
[1:44:31] the kingdom of life
[1:44:33] and if you have life death
[1:44:35] you'll not be afraid of death but i'm
[1:44:37] talking about the story of um
[1:44:39] a man i think california a since that
[1:44:42] was dying
[1:44:43] and his brother they were sin their
[1:44:44] brother was sad and they called his
[1:44:46] brother luke he said look come on we've
[1:44:47] served the lord and why sing me this
[1:44:50] song read me the scriptures don't be sad
[1:44:53] don't today's the best day of my life
[1:44:55] i see the lord coming for me he said
[1:44:57] don't be sad and he changed the
[1:44:59] situation of his brother
[1:45:01] amen
[1:45:02] the death of a sins
[1:45:04] is joyful
[1:45:05] amen of course we are humans we have got
[1:45:08] emotions loved ones but it's a joy he's
[1:45:10] meeting the lord jesus christ angels
[1:45:12] pillow fires around amen the host of
[1:45:16] angel when a son and or a daughter of
[1:45:18] god is going to glory maybe you may not
[1:45:20] see you around my nose but he sees the
[1:45:22] lord jesus christ coming for him or her
[1:45:25] and angels and through funnies and his
[1:45:27] loved ones that have gone on coming to
[1:45:29] embrace and hugging him
[1:45:31] that is the death of a sin
[1:45:33] but the death of a sinner is a horrible
[1:45:36] one
[1:45:36] you can i'm not ready to go demons
[1:45:39] will torment you
[1:45:41] and so the lord gives you the
[1:45:42] opportunity that this day if you hear
[1:45:45] his voice harden up your heart
[1:45:47] amen so today is a calling out for
[1:45:50] somebody the lord wants to give you a
[1:45:51] millennium

[1:46:09] soon be satisfied why do you drink
[1:46:11] waters that doesn't satisfy you why do
[1:46:13] you move around people that make you sad
[1:46:16] while trying to please a person instead
[1:46:18] of pleasing the lord jesus christ

[1:46:51] to all that the lord has said unto moses
[1:46:53] and joshua gave it for an inheritance
[1:46:56] unto israel according to their divisions
[1:46:58] by their tribes and the land rested from
[1:47:00] war
[1:47:02] they didn't have to fight the jebusite
[1:47:04] and the canaanites and the amalekites
[1:47:06] because what the land joshua means
[1:47:08] jehovah salvation the holy ghost will
[1:47:11] give you your place your heavenly places
[1:47:13] in christ jesus
[1:47:15] and you don't have to fight the world

[1:47:19] be done by the lord himself when you are
[1:47:21] sleeping and snoring there's an angel of
[1:47:23] the lord guarding you
[1:47:25] amen when you are walking in the rough

[1:52:07] and there's no his life is not worth it
[1:52:09] because that life didn't serve eternal
[1:52:11] purpose

[1:56:11] proverbs chapter 9 this woman that was
[1:56:14] building
[1:56:15] a house he's giving the furniture the
[1:56:18] blocks the bricks and woods and whatever
[1:56:21] he needs she needs to build a house like
[1:56:24] brother gabriel was telling me he said
[1:56:25] one of the
[1:56:26] brother alejandro's his brother-in-law
[1:56:28] is working in a factory where they make
[1:56:30] uh they use bricks like you want to go
[1:56:33] to uk they use
[1:56:34] smoked bricks to buy their house he said
[1:56:37] brother gabriel whenever you're ready i
[1:56:38] can supply with all the bricks free of
[1:56:40] charge you need the land the foundation
[1:56:43] of the pyramid and the capstone of the
[1:56:45] pyramid but when it breaks the savannah
[1:56:47] changes i'm going to supply it to you
[1:56:50] amen
[1:56:51] and it's the natural type of spiritual
[1:56:52] the lord has given us
[1:56:54] everything that we need to build a house
[1:56:56] we have to construct so the message is
[1:56:58] this is this the sign of the end
[1:57:01] remember 271 it said remember paul
[1:57:04] come at the end of the age
[1:57:06] all the messengers come at the end of
[1:57:08] the age it's at the end time
[1:57:10] when these things are brought forth
[1:57:13] the lord waited when the church edges
[1:57:14] were open
[1:57:15] he let the church build itself
[1:57:17] goes on in whatever then at the end of
[1:57:20] the age the lord sent the messenger and
[1:57:22] the messenger come and what cup the age
[1:57:25] call those who are of the lord they hear
[1:57:27] the voice of the lord and they come up
[1:57:29] from among the denomination
[1:57:31] and then they receive the holy ghost and
[1:57:32] they are sealed unto redemption
[1:57:34] and a judgment fall upon their own
[1:57:36] believers and the church is raptured to
[1:57:38] glory
[1:57:39] and another age church arise amen let's
[1:57:43] go to the next one please
[1:57:45] [Music]
[1:57:48] he said for this course i bow my knees
[1:57:50] unto the father of our lord jesus christ
[1:57:52] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:57:53] earth is named
[1:57:55] that he will grant you according to the
[1:57:57] to the riches of his glory to be
[1:57:59] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[1:58:01] the inner man that christ may dwell in
[1:58:03] your hearts by faith that he being
[1:58:06] rooted and grounded in love amen that is
[1:58:09] the essence of the calling the lord is
[1:58:11] not just calling you but he wants to
[1:58:12] ground you in his life and his faith
[1:58:15] amen so redemption is two parts one part
[1:58:19] is what coming out being caught up from
[1:58:21] the world but that's not the ultimate
[1:58:24] that's just a transition the next space
[1:58:27] is entering in
[1:58:29] that you will be named because before
[1:58:31] the foundation of the world you were
[1:58:33] part of the family of christ so you have
[1:58:35] to be said named you have to have a
[1:58:37] family name just like when a woman
[1:58:39] marries her name changes
[1:58:41] there's a new leadership amen there's a
[1:58:43] new husband there's a new lord and now
[1:58:46] you have to that lord the lord jesus
[1:58:48] christ becomes your husband and then he
[1:58:50] put his name
[1:58:52] his life name is identity name is a
[1:58:54] nature name is a commission name is what
[1:58:57] your allotment your inheritance and it
[1:59:00] gives you a heavenly inheritance and he
[1:59:02] will give you the riches of heaven his
[1:59:04] love and faith and everything that is in
[1:59:06] him is you is you is yours amen
[1:59:10] if a man really truly loves his wife
[1:59:12] if you want to make a world right that
[1:59:14] if something should happen and pass away
[1:59:16] who should who do you want to be quite
[1:59:17] your properties to your wife and your
[1:59:19] children
[1:59:20] you don't give it to your fiance your
[1:59:22] girlfriend
[1:59:23] no you don't give it to your your what
[1:59:24] do you call it a
[1:59:26] forgotten mistress thank you that's the
[1:59:28] word i was looking for you don't give it
[1:59:29] a mistress
[1:59:30] unless maybe you hit your wife you want
[1:59:31] to punish your family
[1:59:33] and then you alert it to your mistress
[1:59:35] some people do it
[1:59:36] because there's some problems
[1:59:39] i don't want to there was one one star
[1:59:40] tv star who did he allotted his
[1:59:42] properties to to to to the mysteries
[1:59:45] at least some for the children do but
[1:59:47] the one who loves the wife who give
[1:59:49] everything to their wife
[1:59:51] amen and that's what our lord jesus
[1:59:53] christ
[1:59:54] is giving everything to the church
[1:59:57] every power
[1:59:59] that was in jesus christ of nazareth
[2:00:01] is in you amen and when that power needs
[2:00:04] to be manifested it comes to
[2:00:05] manifestation
[2:00:07] if it's gift of speaking in tongues if
[2:00:09] it's a healing
[2:00:11] the dead that power is in you amen it's
[2:00:15] all yours
[2:00:16] and you use it when it becomes necessary
[2:00:18] it's not for a show off no god doesn't
[2:00:20] use his pathway show off but when
[2:00:22] there's an a necessity it's important
[2:00:24] there's an essence to use that power
[2:00:27] you don't know how it comes it just
[2:00:29] manifests itself just like that if you
[2:00:32] have to call the dead from the grief
[2:00:35] if you have to call the dead if you have
[2:00:36] to call whatever
[2:00:38] you can do it amen because that power of
[2:00:41] creation is in you the power to speak
[2:00:43] into creation
[2:00:45] and to speak out of creation you speak
[2:00:47] the positives of christ into creation
[2:00:49] and speak sickness speak a
[2:00:52] corner virus hiv death cancer and all
[2:00:56] those demonic spirits you speak them out
[2:00:59] of creation
[2:01:00] amen that power is in you and i
[2:01:03] because jaguar your husband the lord
[2:01:05] jesus christ has become you so you are
[2:01:07] the jaguar amen
[2:01:09] glory hallelujah
[2:01:12] let's go to the next slide
[2:01:16] now baptism
[2:01:18] baptism is the transition when the lord
[2:01:20] called israel from egypt
[2:01:23] to go to the promised land they have to
[2:01:25] they have to be baptized in the red sea
[2:01:27] what is the rest see is the baptism of
[2:01:29] fire and burning that's where you have
[2:01:31] to lay down your old life
[2:01:33] you have to willingly let the lord that
[2:01:35] this material cannot go to the a chamber
[2:01:38] when when enoch
[2:01:40] brought the pyramid of egypt he didn't
[2:01:42] use bricks and mortars after now
[2:01:44] scientists don't know how those uh
[2:01:47] ganganite pyramid was built in egypt
[2:01:49] because it wasn't built by
[2:01:51] a human masonry it was spoken into
[2:01:54] creation
[2:01:55] enoch was a prophet of the lord and he
[2:01:57] was supposed to go into the rapture he
[2:01:59] was i think his grandson or
[2:02:00] great-grandson was um noah so enoch had
[2:02:04] to leave a symbol of justification
[2:02:07] and the lord commissioned enoch to speak
[2:02:10] the pyramid of giza into existence
[2:02:14] and he spoke into creation
[2:02:16] and then all they don't during the flood
[2:02:18] of noah that permit stood the test of
[2:02:21] time
[2:02:22] the promise wasn't broken because it was
[2:02:23] the spoken word of the lord as a symbol
[2:02:26] that the lord has justified the earth
[2:02:28] and the lord was only uh purging the
[2:02:30] earth the lord was not destroying the
[2:02:32] earth
[2:02:33] the same thing when you have the baptism
[2:02:35] of fire and burning it doesn't consume
[2:02:37] your human flesh
[2:02:39] but the professor that even the atoms of
[2:02:40] your body is rearranged
[2:02:43] the lord rearrange you take diseases
[2:02:45] take cases from your life and bring the
[2:02:47] holy spirit into your life amen
[2:02:50] glory so the lord has given us material
[2:02:53] to kill the beast the holy ghost baptism
[2:02:56] and then he's giving us the pillars the
[2:02:59] materials to build our seven church ages
[2:03:02] glory hallelujah because the seventh
[2:03:04] church is the character that leads to
[2:03:06] the a.d
[2:03:07] that is the king's chain but that king
[2:03:09] is not in the seventh churches anymore
[2:03:12] the king is in the day all right we are
[2:03:14] not in the night time anymore i'm
[2:03:15] preaching the same one it is the rise of
[2:03:17] the sun
[2:03:18] the night time is over
[2:03:20] that's when we're building character
[2:03:21] amen
[2:03:22] but now the morning is when life is
[2:03:25] being portrayed it's just like a man
[2:03:27] plant his life in the in the womb of his
[2:03:29] wife in the night time then they won't
[2:03:31] get pregnant then the child is born and
[2:03:33] everybody to see the child that has been
[2:03:36] born and there's a time that the man
[2:03:38] child the woman child has been born on
[2:03:41] earth
[2:03:42] amen so the night time is over
[2:03:45] but we are in the morning it is the rise
[2:03:47] of the sun
[2:03:48] good morning mrs jesus christ amen
[2:03:51] glory hallelujah
[2:03:56] let's go to the next slide please
[2:03:58] just to save some time
[2:04:00] yes we are the planting of the lord
[2:04:02] bogota i think uh that was
[2:04:04] uh the planted field that's sister birth
[2:04:07] sang that song for me god bless you my
[2:04:09] dear sister that's why you couldn't run
[2:04:11] away from that song bogota means planted
[2:04:13] fields and in the in the old
[2:04:15] civilization when the spanish people
[2:04:17] went to invade
[2:04:19] central america south america in 1538
[2:04:22] they called it bakata in the native
[2:04:24] language they called them muskaya muskas
[2:04:27] they call them bakata which modern de
[2:04:29] bogota means planted field sometime when
[2:04:32] i travel i found out the meaning of the
[2:04:34] places because many times
[2:04:36] where you are going what is going on has
[2:04:38] connotation to what the lord is doing
[2:04:40] spiritually so i found out what is the
[2:04:41] meaning of bogota what's the meaning of
[2:04:43] this and it means planted field if you
[2:04:46] read some one verse three i think i
[2:04:48] didn't put that one on the slide
[2:04:50] someone verse 3 said i said
[2:04:52] talking about a man that gave his heart
[2:04:54] to the lord he said he shall be like a
[2:04:56] tree
[2:04:56] planted by the rivers of water that
[2:04:59] brings forth his seasoning his fruits in
[2:05:01] his season his leaves shall not weather
[2:05:03] and whatsoever he died
[2:05:09] this morning glory hallelujah and sister
[2:05:12] michelle sung millennium for us the race
[2:05:15] and isaiah also i mean uh allude to the
[2:05:18] same the same as scripture to appoint
[2:05:20] unto them that morning zion to give them
[2:05:23] beautiful ashes and the oil of joy for
[2:05:25] mourning the garment of priests for the
[2:05:27] spirit of heavens that they might be
[2:05:28] called up the trees
[2:05:31] of righteousness the planting of the
[2:05:33] lord that he might be glorified
[2:05:35] when the lord plants you he can glorify
[2:05:37] himself in you
[2:05:39] that's why the lord didn't accept the
[2:05:41] the
[2:05:41] the sacrifice of a
[2:05:44] king
[2:05:44] because his sacrifice was what blood
[2:05:47] so what the lord revealed to abel that's
[2:05:49] what the lord accept
[2:05:51] the lord will not accept your condition
[2:05:53] he will accept his condition for you
[2:05:57] he'll meet you on his premises not your
[2:05:59] premises
[2:06:01] some people say oh i believe in god i
[2:06:03] don't go to church i don't read a bible
[2:06:05] but i believe in god satan believes in
[2:06:07] god
[2:06:08] it doesn't make no difference
[2:06:10] believing that you have a maker
[2:06:12] is not a mystery
[2:06:13] but his purpose for your life what
[2:06:16] before the foundation of the world
[2:06:18] he ordained for you to do on earth
[2:06:21] when you accept that condition
[2:06:23] accept that perfect woe for your life
[2:06:25] that is when you become the planting of
[2:06:27] the lord amen glory to the lord
[2:06:31] let's go to the next um
[2:06:33] the next one the rapture is a person
[2:06:36] and it's a person of christ jesus the
[2:06:38] lord and is you
[2:06:40] uh christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:06:41] he said 188 and to be sure he said the
[2:06:44] whole rapture
[2:06:45] now luther was a part
[2:06:47] we always look at rapture in the future
[2:06:49] but let's look at what this this one
[2:06:51] could change my thinking some years back
[2:06:54] and so to be sure the whole rapture
[2:06:56] now luther was apart
[2:06:59] how can luka be a part of the rapture
[2:07:00] when the rapture is not taking place
[2:07:02] so the rapture is a person it's not an
[2:07:05] event
[2:07:05] we find out wesley was a part right
[2:07:09] and he kept using wars he didn't say
[2:07:11] he's going to be a part he said what's a
[2:07:12] part
[2:07:13] so past the prophet was a part
[2:07:16] if they are if they aren't part just in
[2:07:19] the revelation that they was making up
[2:07:21] the body so the rapture is the body of
[2:07:23] the lord
[2:07:25] it's you this is a rachel
[2:07:26] it's your solomon it's you sister brown
[2:07:30] it's all of you
[2:07:31] a man
[2:07:32] it's a body feet
[2:07:35] toes
[2:07:36] arms and so forth wow so rapture has a
[2:07:39] toe
[2:07:40] rapture has a feet
[2:07:41] rapture has a head
[2:07:43] wow
[2:07:44] that's amazing
[2:07:46] until the head
[2:07:47] which we get to that in a few minutes
[2:07:49] see we send a lot of the prophet went
[2:07:51] into that that makes the entire rapture
[2:07:55] so rapture is a whole
[2:07:57] something it is the body of the word
[2:07:59] which is christ amen
[2:08:02] the rapture is a person remember the
[2:08:04] brahms that when the seas were revealed
[2:08:07] his bible the old king james bible
[2:08:09] thompson's chain
[2:08:11] whichever bible was using became a new
[2:08:12] book how
[2:08:14] how did the bible it's a revelation
[2:08:16] in the bible the law revealed more to
[2:08:19] him than he has already received when
[2:08:21] you read this older message you talk
[2:08:22] about rapture in the future but when the
[2:08:24] seas were opened
[2:08:26] he said rapture is a person
[2:08:29] john wesley was part of the rapture
[2:08:32] remember in whistler's revival american
[2:08:34] journalists went to england to
[2:08:36] interrogate about what is this wesleyan
[2:08:38] revival reviewing about
[2:08:40] when they went to this old
[2:08:41] police-centered uh
[2:08:43] policeman who was a son of god full of
[2:08:45] the holy ghost
[2:08:46] he didn't point them he said we are
[2:08:48] looking for the with the reviver
[2:08:50] if somebody asks you i'm looking for
[2:08:51] spreading through tabernacle don't say
[2:08:53] okay let me take you to brad jack's
[2:08:54] house no no no no you feel the test

[2:09:23] you are going into it
[2:09:24] that is just the tabernacle that we
[2:09:25] congregate by you
[2:09:28] and me we are the tabernacle of spirit
[2:09:30] and truth glory hallelujah
[2:09:34] amen
[2:09:35] so the rapture is you
[2:09:38] the millennium is you
[2:09:40] peace is you
[2:09:41] mercy is you
[2:09:43] love is you
[2:09:45] it's all the person of christ in
[2:09:47] manifestation amen brother jeffrey you
[2:09:50] are peace
[2:09:51] you are the rapture amen
[2:09:53] so we don't go looking for the rapture
[2:09:55] is is you amen
[2:09:57] you don't have to wait for sometime
[2:09:58] people get scared and they act based on
[2:10:00] fear
[2:10:01] when they hear oh there's coronavirus oh
[2:10:03] wow the rapture hey brother joseph
[2:10:05] rapture is so close we got to like live
[2:10:07] a good life
[2:10:09] when everything settled okay let's go on
[2:10:11] and
[2:10:12] boozing drinking
[2:10:14] and doing it because they are acting on
[2:10:16] fear it's not a revelation
[2:10:18] abraham was sitting in his temple in his
[2:10:21] heart
[2:10:22] when melchizedek came to him
[2:10:25] before he destroyed sodom and gomorrah
[2:10:28] came to inform
[2:10:30] for abraham
[2:10:32] he changed his body he said can i heard
[2:10:34] anything from my prophet
[2:10:36] he was a friend of god
[2:10:38] elohim was in him
[2:10:40] christ is in you
[2:10:41] you are your own rapture
[2:10:43] by the holy ghost baptism that's why
[2:10:45] it's so important that whatever you are
[2:10:48] doing if you don't have the holy ghost
[2:10:50] in you stop it and seek the holy ghost
[2:10:53] and make sure
[2:10:55] make sure
[2:10:57] make assurance doubly sure
[2:11:00] or eternally sure
[2:11:02] that you are a working jesus christ
[2:11:06] you are a working monument of elohim
[2:11:10] that you you see christ in yourself
[2:11:13] and others will see christ in you
[2:11:16] that is your purpose number one
[2:11:18] because you can build the seven police
[2:11:21] remember mrs wisdom
[2:11:22] she had materials to build
[2:11:24] a house
[2:11:26] to kill a beast
[2:11:28] but she asked what let go herself
[2:11:31] let the revelation kill her own beast
[2:11:33] her own ambition
[2:11:35] and then let christ
[2:11:36] take over her life and christ in hell
[2:11:39] was teaching her yes when you look at
[2:11:40] the seven church churches they had
[2:11:42] mistakes
[2:11:43] ephesians they left their first love
[2:11:45] sadist they were not perfect i think
[2:11:48] it's philadelphia that they they said
[2:11:50] they had almost everything right
[2:11:53] but most of the church churches had loud
[2:11:55] this year of course you know these are
[2:11:56] people's right
[2:11:58] but they received christ
[2:12:00] and christ helped them to turn around
[2:12:01] the corner
[2:12:02] to patch their mistakes
[2:12:04] to pitch their their shortcomings
[2:12:07] because christ was the one directing the
[2:12:08] house to be built
[2:12:10] he is giving you an idea material to
[2:12:12] build our house what is the house the
[2:12:14] house of the lord the house of the
[2:12:16] living christ and what house are you
[2:12:18] building for the lord are you building
[2:12:21] based on selfish ambitions
[2:12:23] or based on ulterior motives or is it
[2:12:26] centered on jesus christ in your life
[2:12:29] and for the body of the lord amen
[2:12:31] whatever gift the lord has put in you
[2:12:33] the lord wants to use that gift
[2:12:36] but he need your permission
[2:12:38] he need you to surrender that gift to
[2:12:40] him
[2:12:42] like the two songs that were sent my
[2:12:43] sister bruce and sister michelle they
[2:12:45] just like ran into the message i was
[2:12:47] going to preach they had to surrender
[2:12:49] their gift
[2:12:50] to be used by the lord amen
[2:12:54] let's go to the next one
[2:12:56] the next city the the two cities fusaka
[2:12:59] suga
[2:13:00] they call it fusaka sugar
[2:13:02] means a woman who has become invisible
[2:13:04] to the world
[2:13:05] hidden in christ
[2:13:07] and is invincible too powerful to be
[2:13:09] defeated or seduced
[2:13:13] when you see the revelation of christ
[2:13:17] you hide over the mountain and the house
[2:13:19] that the the the worship is this
[2:13:21] mountain around
[2:13:23] and it's kind of ousted it's not in town
[2:13:26] and i said the natural types of
[2:13:27] spiritual
[2:13:28] your life is hidden
[2:13:30] in christ
[2:13:32] the devil cannot touch you he has to
[2:13:34] touch christ before he can touch you
[2:13:37] and become invincible
[2:13:39] it becomes too strong
[2:13:41] for the world to seduce you the lord has
[2:13:44] put virtues in you
[2:13:47] as a church and that virtues
[2:13:50] is for the lost use
[2:13:51] is for your husband jesus christ that
[2:13:53] virtues is not for the seducing person
[2:13:56] it's not the air for what's the name of
[2:13:58] those people i don't remember the name
[2:14:00] uh womanizes i want i wonder where that
[2:14:03] i want to use i don't remember but it's
[2:14:04] not the man that seduce people
[2:14:07] with money
[2:14:08] with sex
[2:14:10] your virtues has been given to christ
[2:14:12] and you keep it holy for the christ
[2:14:15] spiritually and naturally amen you keep
[2:14:18] yourself for your husband you keep it
[2:14:19] yourself for your wife
[2:14:20] and we keep our soul for the body of for
[2:14:22] christ amen our eternal husband even if
[2:14:26] your husband dies christ is still your
[2:14:27] husband
[2:14:29] if your wife dies christ is your wife
[2:14:31] if your brother dies christ is your
[2:14:33] brother if your sister passed away
[2:14:34] christ is your sister and so we keep
[2:14:37] ourselves for christ and christ alone
[2:14:40] glory hallelujah
[2:14:42] i think we've read the scriptures let's
[2:14:44] just go ahead and save time
[2:14:46] the power of multiplication
[2:14:51] it looks like it's raining
[2:14:52] heavily raining cats and dogs
[2:14:56] as they say
[2:14:58] infinity the term infinity means god
[2:15:02] without limitation
[2:15:03] he hasn't got any limitation
[2:15:05] when you see your limitation
[2:15:07] let christ come sin
[2:15:09] amen the lord allow certain things in
[2:15:12] our lives for purpose so that he will
[2:15:14] fill the gap in your life
[2:15:16] william brahm had a stomach problem
[2:15:19] that attacked him all his life he could
[2:15:21] i think one testimony he said he prayed
[2:15:22] for people
[2:15:24] cancers were dropping healing dead were
[2:15:26] raised but he had this little stomach
[2:15:29] pain
[2:15:30] south stomach that was troubling him
[2:15:33] almost all the time but the lord sought
[2:15:36] to glorify himself
[2:15:37] when the lord healed him
[2:15:39] he drew his face in iraq
[2:15:42] amen
[2:15:43] and i think he revealed something to you
[2:15:44] about his name 777
[2:15:46] williams seven letters marion seven
[2:15:48] letters branham seven letters
[2:15:51] so there are certain things in your life
[2:15:53] that you might be battling with that you
[2:15:55] might not understand certain trials that
[2:15:57] the lord permit them it's not the devil
[2:15:59] the lord permitted them in your lives
[2:16:01] that he'll be glorified in those trials
[2:16:04] it could be a delay of one of the
[2:16:05] promises for you it could be a family it
[2:16:07] could be sickness but the lord wants to
[2:16:09] have a third pool
[2:16:11] in that trial
[2:16:12] amen it doesn't matter what it is the
[2:16:15] lord wants to magnify himself and so let
[2:16:17] him take over that spot in your life
[2:16:20] and you see his glory in a very special
[2:16:22] way amen so the quotes here countdown
[2:16:25] 64.
[2:16:27] so now look look at here on the day of
[2:16:29] pentacles the holy spirit separated
[2:16:31] itself and tons of fire set upon each
[2:16:34] one
[2:16:34] the great pillar of fire separated and
[2:16:37] each one received a portion
[2:16:39] of the of the holy spirit upon them like
[2:16:42] tongues of fire well
[2:16:43] if you put one tongue of fire and two
[2:16:46] tons of fire together you get twice the
[2:16:49] strength that you had in one
[2:16:52] amen remember it wasn't ezekiel in his
[2:16:55] vision of the two sticks in the hand
[2:16:57] if i put my little pill of fire to
[2:17:00] brother solomon's pillow fire we get
[2:17:02] what twice to the jacks to my sisters we
[2:17:05] have multiples amen so you don't have to
[2:17:08] be a hermit crab living by yourself
[2:17:11] but let it let your pillow fire adjoin
[2:17:13] to another pill of fire
[2:17:14] let your faith adjourn to another faith
[2:17:17] and when we put it together it becomes a
[2:17:19] combustion
[2:17:20] wrong called a roman candle
[2:17:22] it bends without ending
[2:17:25] if we put our love together when we we
[2:17:28] unite together with one mind one accord
[2:17:31] one purpose one motive one reason
[2:17:33] on anything heaven comes down
[2:17:37] amen every yoke is broken because
[2:17:40] eternity is in action
[2:17:42] amen
[2:17:44] there are certain things that you can do
[2:17:45] by yourself
[2:17:46] but when you add your faith to someone's
[2:17:48] faith your brothers your sister's faith
[2:17:50] it becomes easy tax for you to do it
[2:17:52] glory hallelujah
[2:17:56] wisdom let's go to the next slide
[2:17:59] wisdom is a person
[2:18:01] and wisdom is message jesus christ
[2:18:04] she keeps her virtues for her husband
[2:18:06] the lord jesus christ
[2:18:07] the wife is the wife of christ is

[2:21:20] mentioning as far as the names of those
[2:21:21] cities but i i love that little thought
[2:21:23] on
[2:21:24] the jaguar
[2:21:26] and um you know you you look at um that
[2:21:29] animal and i think he said it it kills
[2:21:31] its prey with one leap
[2:21:33] nip
[2:21:34] or blow
[2:21:35] and um you know and oftentimes you know
[2:21:38] you look at that and and you think of
[2:21:40] you know just what satan is able to do
[2:21:42] but he turned around and put it on
[2:21:44] christ
[2:21:45] and it says uh you know christ can just
[2:21:47] take one leap
[2:21:50] one nip one blow and everything's wiped
[2:21:52] out just like that i i was i was just
[2:21:55] very very blessed eternity is living for
[2:21:57] others
[2:21:59] uh
[2:21:59] uh
[2:22:00] you know and how the word of god is
[2:22:02] calling us for separation called

[2:22:25] work because god started dealing with
[2:22:27] his heart him and his wife at the same
[2:22:28] time
[2:22:29] and how they had to go through
[2:22:31] i mean driving for an hour

[2:23:07] on the will of god
[2:23:08] you know but but we got to learn how to
[2:23:10] persevere

[2:23:57] orchestrate something like that i just
[2:24:00] it just it's blessed my heart i'm so
[2:24:02] glad that he just took time to share and
[2:24:05] and as i was telling you all earlier
[2:24:06] when we when we when we give
[2:24:10] this is where
[2:24:11] you know our giving is going to to be
[2:24:13] able to kind of support work like this
[2:24:15] um i was um
[2:24:18] while i was in north carolina recently
[2:24:20] uh brother barry coffey was was telling
[2:24:23] me about um
[2:24:25] there's a um
[2:24:26] a ministry in africa that he he he went
[2:24:29] actually to the to the nation of africa
[2:24:31] he uh i forget what nation is but he
[2:24:33] created his own bank account
[2:24:35] um and uh so he has
[2:24:38] um
[2:24:39] he's able to just kind of transfer funds
[2:24:41] from one account to another and he says
[2:24:43] what i do is i have i gave the pastor
[2:24:46] over there a debit card to that account
[2:24:48] and anytime he need money he just go to
[2:24:50] that account and get the money out and
[2:24:53] always just you know just transfer money
[2:24:55] accordingly so he was telling me this
[2:24:57] and i say um i said okay he said well he
[2:24:59] uh he said the the
[2:25:01] pastor uses it in order to support the
[2:25:03] missionaries that take all the messages
[2:25:06] throughout the country and even to other
[2:25:07] countries all into the bush
[2:25:09] i see he said he said cost them brothers
[2:25:11] about 25 a month
[2:25:14] to support their families
[2:25:16] and to deliver all these books
[2:25:18] i said 25 a month
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:22] he said yeah that's that's that's what
[2:25:24] it cost him so the pastor get 25 for
[2:25:26] this brother 25 for that brother 25 for
[2:25:28] his brother and just gives it out to him
[2:25:31] you know and said hey just take this
[2:25:32] this is for your family to make sure
[2:25:34] your family can eat and then you also
[2:25:36] can go and do the work of the lord 25
[2:25:38] a month
[2:25:40] i ain't talking about giving to hungry
[2:25:42] kids
[2:25:44] some of them kids ain't too hungry i'm
[2:25:46] gonna listen to that right now
[2:25:48] but uh but but but what i'm saying is
[2:25:50] that we have to get ourselves to a level
[2:25:52] where we can actually support
[2:25:53] financially to things like that 25 a
[2:25:57] month supports an entire family
[2:26:02] church we we can do better
[2:26:05] we can do better you know so i mean this
[2:26:07] this year that's going to be part of our
[2:26:08] our our our our vision you know but we
[2:26:11] want to go to the next level even again
[2:26:13] we uh i asked brother bear said well how
[2:26:15] do you get the money to put into the
[2:26:16] account and say churches just send money
[2:26:19] to us sometime we take that money just
[2:26:20] put an account and then that goes
[2:26:23] there for that passing
[2:26:24] i said okay i'm gonna go back and i'm
[2:26:26] gonna talk to our church because i think
[2:26:27] we want i know we can afford at least 25
[2:26:32] i think we can afford more than that
[2:26:35] but i would love to see some of the
[2:26:36] saints just try to catch a vision say
[2:26:38] look you know what i want to be a part
[2:26:39] of this just put this in let the
[2:26:41] missionaries go and do the work of the
[2:26:42] lord
[2:26:43] and i'm going to tell you something
[2:26:44] everybody that has touched every that
[2:26:46] one man that was touched in
