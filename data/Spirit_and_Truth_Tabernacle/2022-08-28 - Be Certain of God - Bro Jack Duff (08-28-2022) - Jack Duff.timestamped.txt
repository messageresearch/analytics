[55:28] hallelujah
[55:30] amen the bible says in first peter
[55:34] chapter 4
[55:36] verse 12
[55:38] amen
[55:39] um the bible
[55:42] states beloved
[55:44] think it not strange
[55:47] concerning the fiery trial
[55:50] which is to try you and i love the way
[55:54] peter writes this because if you're not
[55:57] going through anything right now
[56:00] i'm here to tell you get ready
[56:02] because there's a trial coming your way
[56:05] and when the trial comes your way you
[56:08] have been thoroughly warned so therefore
[56:11] you don't have to think it's strange
[56:13] and you don't have to sit there and
[56:15] wonder why me why am i going through
[56:17] this amen because i can tell you already
[56:20] the reason you're going through is
[56:21] because god already know
[56:23] you're going to overcome it
[56:25] amen i i i just feel like getting this
[56:28] out right now right right off the right
[56:31] at the gate i just want to tell the
[56:32] devil quitting is not an option
[56:37] quitting is not an option
[56:40] giving up is not an option that i mean
[56:42] you can just you can just stop
[56:44] throwing thoughts like that out towards
[56:46] me because quitting is not an option i i
[56:48] plan to go all the way with this thing
[56:51] come what will come with me i'm going
[56:53] all the way
[56:55] praise god but the bible says beloved
[56:57] think it not strange concerning the
[57:00] fiery trial which is to try you as
[57:03] though some strange thing happened unto
[57:06] you amen but this is the rather than
[57:08] thinking of strange here's the other
[57:10] part to the scripture but rejoice
[57:13] amen in as much as ye are partakers of
[57:16] christ's suffering that when his glory
[57:19] shall be revealed ye may be glad also
[57:22] with exceeding joy amen so trials are
[57:26] part of the christian amen experience
[57:29] and and we we have to understand that
[57:30] and i'm sorry i i i don't want to forget
[57:33] this i don't know did we announce about
[57:36] sister capers that lost her brother oh
[57:38] can we pray for her okay thank you all
[57:40] right i missed that we want to keep her
[57:42] in prayer keep her and brother keepers
[57:43] and prayers they travel
[57:44] there to alabama to be with the family
[57:46] man let's keep them in prayer all right
[57:48] i want to read from here time tested
[57:50] memorials of god
[57:51] um there's a little couple statements
[57:54] here uh that the prophet says and i just
[57:56] want to uh bring this
[57:58] it says if he went to that much trouble
[58:00] to be sure that the bridge would be safe
[58:03] and he's talking about this gentleman
[58:05] that built a bridge over in australia
[58:08] nobody want to take on this task of
[58:10] building this bridge they thought and
[58:12] there were just so many critics around
[58:14] telling that man when you get this
[58:15] bridge established it's probably going
[58:17] to fall apart as soon as the first car
[58:19] goes across it but this man just did
[58:21] everything he could to to make sure that
[58:23] that bridge was going to hold
[58:25] and uh and i had a chance to go and and
[58:27] see that bridge and go across that
[58:29] bridge and it's still holding today
[58:31] right and so he's talking about this man
[58:33] and time tested memorial how he tested
[58:35] the the underneath the ward and tested
[58:38] all kind of things and make sure that
[58:39] the bridge would stand it says if he
[58:41] went to that much trouble to be sure
[58:44] that the bridge would be safe
[58:45] how much trouble do you think god went
[58:48] to to be sure this church would be safe
[58:50] amen yes sir there's a memorial to the
[58:53] death of christ
[58:54] that's his church
[58:56] some people don't want to live it some
[58:59] people will but it's a testing time
[59:03] look at this god's testing people today
[59:06] for his memorials
[59:08] amen and a lot a lot of times people say
[59:10] oh i'm so tempted
[59:12] look at this blessed be the name of the
[59:14] lord
[59:15] for the
[59:16] temptations now that'll give the devil a
[59:19] mind battle when you can start praising
[59:21] god even for your temptations
[59:24] blessed be the name of the lord for the
[59:26] temptations
[59:27] amen he goes on and uh and says this
[59:30] when i am weak then i'm strong said paul
[59:34] every sun that cometh to god must first
[59:36] be tried and tested and these testings
[59:39] are more sweeter to you and dearer to
[59:42] you than precious gold is testing time
[59:47] hallelujah amen a little further it says
[59:50] long years ago
[59:52] before they had the smelters they used
[59:54] to take the gold and how they would know
[59:56] how it was right or not with all the
[59:59] sludge was uh with all the sludge was
[1:00:01] out of it and all of the iron pyrite
[1:00:03] that's fools go all the foods out of it
[1:00:06] beaters beat it beat it and turned it
[1:00:08] and beat it and turned it until the
[1:00:10] beater sees his reflection in the goal
[1:00:13] amen that's the way god does his church
[1:00:16] glory he
[1:00:18] gives you trial after trial
[1:00:21] glory test after test
[1:00:24] trial after trial
[1:00:27] test after test amen somebody should say
[1:00:31] thank god for the tests
[1:00:32] thank god for the trial right amen test
[1:00:36] after test trial after trial and the
[1:00:38] reason he's doing this is because he
[1:00:39] wants to see the life of christ
[1:00:41] reflected in your life
[1:00:43] amen until you become peaceful
[1:00:46] come on somebody
[1:00:48] sober
[1:00:50] amen the trial is there to make you meek
[1:00:54] gentle
[1:00:55] hallelujah humble
[1:00:58] amen the trial makes you ready
[1:01:01] submissive
[1:01:03] willing to turn your heads from the
[1:01:05] things of the world amen thank god for
[1:01:08] the trial
[1:01:09] amen and looking right looking straight
[1:01:11] to calvary to the one who's doing the
[1:01:13] beating many times you think you're
[1:01:15] strange you think you think it's strange
[1:01:17] because fiery trials and sickness and
[1:01:20] persecution is only done to test you
[1:01:24] amen to get the dirt out of you to get
[1:01:27] the sludge out of you to get the
[1:01:29] slowness out of you amen to wake you up
[1:01:33] to the place where you can look and see
[1:01:35] the reflection a man can see the
[1:01:37] reflection of christ in you christ in
[1:01:39] you the hope of glory
[1:01:41] let me go a little further in this he
[1:01:42] says he tested every piece finally
[1:01:45] before he put a bolt on he tested he
[1:01:47] tested everything then when he got it
[1:01:48] all done now the scoffer stood by and
[1:01:50] said it will not hold up it can't do it
[1:01:52] he's talking about this man on the
[1:01:54] bridge again he says that's what they're
[1:01:56] saying today this here holy ghost
[1:01:58] religion you're talking about it won't
[1:02:00] be long that tree will burn down
[1:02:03] but it don't burn down the fire only
[1:02:05] waters it it only gives us new hole it
[1:02:08] only strengthens it every trial testing
[1:02:12] every time a wind hits a tree and shoves
[1:02:14] it back and forth and back and forth it
[1:02:17] only loosens the roots
[1:02:19] for one purpose so it can go deeper and
[1:02:22] get a better hole
[1:02:23] every time sickness strikes your home
[1:02:26] every time trials strike your home every
[1:02:29] time the neighbors say something bad
[1:02:30] about you it's only shaking you loosing
[1:02:33] you up so you can get down and get get a
[1:02:36] better hold on the eternal rock of god
[1:02:38] unmovable word that's how god does it he
[1:02:41] sends those trials to test you to prove
[1:02:43] you to shake you up and to give you a
[1:02:46] new hole
[1:02:48] you know it's the midst of our trials
[1:02:50] they have a saying no no no test no
[1:02:52] testimony
[1:02:54] right so the trial actually only
[1:02:55] strengthens your testimony
[1:02:57] so we got to thank god for we learn we
[1:02:59] learn to give god praise in the midst of
[1:03:01] wherever we are you know i was i was

[1:06:27] all right here let me get this out of
[1:06:28] this state of the scriptures for phil
[1:06:30] before we just kind of slip back into a
[1:06:32] couple of things here
[1:06:33] my god i i i i
[1:06:36] i love this i love this here this day
[1:06:38] the scripture is fulfilled the prophet
[1:06:39] says this israel
[1:06:41] at the river
[1:06:43] when they possess the land went over
[1:06:46] how they going to do it is the month of
[1:06:49] april
[1:06:50] the floods are coming down before the
[1:06:52] snow is melting
[1:06:54] up in judea oh what a poor general it
[1:06:57] seemed like that god was to bring his
[1:06:59] people there in the month of april when
[1:07:02] the jordan was higher back
[1:07:04] than it ever was
[1:07:06] now i want you to get this you know
[1:07:07] before we finish this quote uh
[1:07:10] god
[1:07:11] brought the children of israel into the
[1:07:12] promised land but the month that he
[1:07:15] brings them into the promised land
[1:07:18] is a time where the banks are
[1:07:20] overflowing with water
[1:07:23] i want to i'm going to bring this to to
[1:07:25] to our to where we live in that in a
[1:07:28] second but but god his strategy
[1:07:32] is is not when it's a drought
[1:07:36] not to bring them over a man when it's
[1:07:39] very easy to cross
[1:07:41] but no he wants it to be difficult
[1:07:44] and now the waters are overflowing
[1:07:46] because of amen because of the rain and
[1:07:48] everything this is a time where
[1:07:50] everything is very the water is very
[1:07:52] high
[1:07:53] now i want to bring a little closer god
[1:07:56] amen we will have you to buy a house
[1:07:59] glory to god when the market
[1:08:02] is high
[1:08:05] come on somebody
[1:08:07] i'm talking about the god we serve
[1:08:09] because the way we think it's like we
[1:08:11] want to wait until things are low
[1:08:14] hallelujah but god say when it's high
[1:08:17] let me let me let me let me get you to
[1:08:19] understand something the same god that
[1:08:21] provides you five dollars
[1:08:24] it's the same god that provides you five
[1:08:26] hundred thousand dollars
[1:08:28] look you don't pray to a different god
[1:08:31] to get five hundred thousand amen you
[1:08:34] pray to the same god
[1:08:36] and he he will meet any need that you
[1:08:38] have all he wants us to do is start
[1:08:41] praising him in advance
[1:08:43] amen the earth is the lord's
[1:08:46] the fullness thereof the world and they
[1:08:49] that dwell
[1:08:51] our god is a big god
[1:08:54] and he does big things
[1:08:59] hallelujah so understand this is how god
[1:09:02] just like god does things he waits till
[1:09:05] the most difficult time because that's
[1:09:07] when he gonna get the most glory
[1:09:10] he waits to the doctor say stage four
[1:09:15] when when you hear that everybody oh
[1:09:18] stage four you gotta remember it's your
[1:09:20] attitude towards that
[1:09:22] which brings a man which was gonna allow
[1:09:25] uh or that thing to change and go in one
[1:09:26] direction i read the quote on wednesday
[1:09:28] night how people when they hear that
[1:09:30] from the doctor they just oh i might as
[1:09:31] well get my thing get things ready i'm
[1:09:33] leaving here soon stage four this this
[1:09:35] is over and when they start acting like
[1:09:37] that before they know it it's over
[1:09:39] but another person say the doctor look
[1:09:41] at them and say well you know it's life
[1:09:44] and if i gotta die dying is a part of
[1:09:46] living and i can't lose when i die i'm
[1:09:48] going to win anyway when they have that
[1:09:51] type of attitude the doctor says
[1:09:54] he say that person just lingers home
[1:09:57] praise god
[1:09:59] amen you ain't going nowhere to god say
[1:10:01] you going
[1:10:06] but there's some things we might have to
[1:10:07] go through before we get there
[1:10:09] praise god amen he says this in the rest
[1:10:12] of this quote he says
[1:10:14] i might could stop here if i had time to
[1:10:17] give give us just a little tip
[1:10:20] sometimes you may be setting out there
[1:10:22] with cancer or you might be setting with
[1:10:25] the disease you think why me being a
[1:10:27] christian would be in this away
[1:10:29] why would i be sitting like this if i'm
[1:10:31] a christian it says sometimes
[1:10:35] god lets things get so dark
[1:10:39] that you can't see up
[1:10:41] you can't see around
[1:10:43] you
[1:10:44] you can't anywhere else and then he
[1:10:46] comes and makes a way
[1:10:49] through it
[1:10:51] it gets so dark you can't see your way
[1:10:53] out of this thing and then god comes and
[1:10:56] makes a way through it
[1:10:58] that's what we're looking for
[1:11:00] a man says any excess and then he comes
[1:11:02] and makes a way through it for you that
[1:11:04] you might say this day this scripture is
[1:11:07] being fulfilled that he promised to do
[1:11:11] there's going to be a performance of
[1:11:12] those things that he promised you
[1:11:14] don't give up on it
[1:11:16] i want us to just look at this scripture
[1:11:19] that i
[1:11:20] read here
[1:11:21] amen this morning
[1:11:24] exodus 15
[1:11:26] i read verse 22
[1:11:28] but i want to just slip back to uh verse
[1:11:30] 20.
[1:11:32] i want us to understand what has just
[1:11:33] happened
[1:11:36] um you know i could i could i could go
[1:11:38] back uh even before these verses just to
[1:11:41] kind of tell you this is the time where
[1:11:43] the children of israel
[1:11:45] had experienced one of the greatest
[1:11:47] victories
[1:11:49] that they ever had in their life
[1:11:52] this was a time where you know they had
[1:11:54] been in bondage for over 400 years
[1:11:57] god finally sends a prophet
[1:12:00] amen moses comes in and he begins to uh
[1:12:04] a call for the various plagues that was
[1:12:06] striking egypt and finally the last
[1:12:08] plague that come was the plague of death
[1:12:10] and death to the firstborn son and when
[1:12:13] when pharaoh experienced that he says
[1:12:15] get get your stuff get your people y'all
[1:12:17] get out of egypt get out right now you
[1:12:20] know and pharaoh finally he decides to
[1:12:21] let him go and and man they rejoice him
[1:12:25] they rejoice in that that pharaoh has
[1:12:27] allowed them to leave egypt and and my
[1:12:30] you can imagine just the
[1:12:32] maybe the victory dances
[1:12:34] amen and a shop and when and the other
[1:12:36] thing about when they left they didn't
[1:12:38] leave
[1:12:39] paul
[1:12:41] praise god amen they borrowed the riches
[1:12:45] amen from the egyptians
[1:12:47] come on somebody and as they took the i
[1:12:49] mean even egyptians like you know we're
[1:12:51] not even concerned with our stuff y'all
[1:12:53] can even have the stuff that y'all took
[1:12:54] you ain't got to even bring that back
[1:12:57] good god almighty but here they leave
[1:12:59] with the riches of
[1:13:01] of egypt and they're all just rejoicing
[1:13:03] but before you know it something
[1:13:06] happened in pharaoh's mind and the
[1:13:07] people that were referrals like we don't
[1:13:09] let all the slaves go we can't do that
[1:13:11] who gonna do the work now say no we need
[1:13:13] to go get our slaves and bring them back
[1:13:16] so here they go from a tremendous
[1:13:17] victory to a tremendous trial because
[1:13:20] now pharaoh and his army are on their
[1:13:22] trail and and they're looking at most
[1:13:24] like what are we gonna do now these
[1:13:26] these people are upset moses and we're
[1:13:28] faced with the red sea what are we gonna
[1:13:30] do now moses
[1:13:32] oh moses told them is these these
[1:13:35] inspirational words the egyptians you
[1:13:38] sing today
[1:13:39] you shall see them no more forever now
[1:13:42] when moses spoke that god never told
[1:13:44] moses to say that
[1:13:48] and there are some things that you speak
[1:13:50] out of your mouth
[1:13:52] that god never told you to say
[1:13:54] but because moses was a son of god and
[1:13:58] because you are a son of god and you are
[1:14:02] a daughter of god god had to back up
[1:14:06] what moses said and if god backed up
[1:14:09] what moses said i'm here to encourage
[1:14:12] you this morning god will back up
[1:14:15] what you have said
[1:14:20] you don't have to go back on your word
[1:14:22] god come back up what you release out of
[1:14:25] your mouth
[1:14:26] whether you can see it whether you can
[1:14:28] feel it it don't have nothing to do with
[1:14:31] it heaven will back up what you saying
[1:14:38] glory to god
[1:14:42] they are in the in the midst of this
[1:14:43] great trial
[1:14:45] pharaoh's army got him surrounded they
[1:14:47] they they they got the red sea in front
[1:14:49] of him and pharaoh's army behind them
[1:14:51] and what god does is
[1:14:53] is uh is coming and put a pill of fire
[1:14:56] in between
[1:14:57] the army amen and and uh you know and
[1:15:01] and and israel and so god put the pill
[1:15:03] of fire and that it i mean the egyptians
[1:15:05] cannot get to him because this pillar
[1:15:07] fire got him blocked off they should
[1:15:08] have turned around right then
[1:15:12] wait a minute i mean they should have
[1:15:14] known we fighting something this is
[1:15:15] greater than what
[1:15:17] any other war we don't been in this
[1:15:19] there's something different here let's
[1:15:20] get back let's get out of here
[1:15:23] but no they they was too proudful
[1:15:26] they're going to press through that
[1:15:27] that's the way the devil he's going to
[1:15:28] press through everything to try to get
[1:15:30] to you but god got a surprise for him
[1:15:35] moses moses god told him to stretch out
[1:15:37] that rod and stretch out the rod and the
[1:15:39] water parted
[1:15:41] he said now let the israel children
[1:15:42] israel go go across onto our land and
[1:15:45] here they come walking across on dry
[1:15:47] land
[1:15:48] my god and and by the time they get
[1:15:50] through pharaoh realizes well the the
[1:15:53] fire done
[1:15:54] lifted
[1:15:55] we can chase them again and here they
[1:15:57] come running into the red sea
[1:16:00] thinking that god was making a way for
[1:16:02] him he really was
[1:16:05] making a way for them amen to to fulfill
[1:16:08] the word that moses spoke
[1:16:14] because the word was the egyptians
[1:16:17] you've seen today
[1:16:18] you shall see no more forever
[1:16:21] so if god got to open up a red sea
[1:16:24] and drown all your enemies
[1:16:27] to make your word come to pass
[1:16:31] not his word but to make your work god
[1:16:34] was making moses word come to pass when
[1:16:37] he drowned those those the enemy in the
[1:16:40] red sea
[1:16:41] that wasn't god's word that was moses
[1:16:43] work
[1:16:46] hey god will bankrupt the heavens
[1:16:49] before one word of his falls to the
[1:16:51] ground and return void
[1:16:54] you've been inspired to speak and stay
[1:16:56] with it
[1:16:57] and i want to encourage you be certain
[1:16:59] of god
[1:17:00] be sure of god

[1:21:21] we got a whole bunch of dances

[1:21:30] all right let me
[1:21:33] all the women went out after her with
[1:21:35] timbers and with dances
[1:21:37] and miriam answered them
[1:21:39] singing to the lord for he hath
[1:21:42] triumphed gloriously
[1:21:44] the horse and his rider hath thee thrown
[1:21:47] into the sea
[1:21:50] how they just got through praising god
[1:21:53] worshiping the lord
[1:21:55] look at this
[1:21:56] so moses brought israel from the red sea
[1:22:00] and they went out into the wilderness of
[1:22:02] shore
[1:22:06] and they went three days
[1:22:08] in the wilderness
[1:22:11] and found no water
[1:22:13] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:22:14] minute
[1:22:15] from this great mighty mighty
[1:22:19] uh move of god
[1:22:22] now they led into a place called the
[1:22:25] wilderness
[1:22:28] of sure
[1:22:30] after god is made aware after god has
[1:22:33] done this and after god did that and
[1:22:35] after that now now you'll find yours in
[1:22:37] the next verse
[1:22:40] you're in the next verse now and you're
[1:22:42] in what we call the wilderness of sure
[1:22:46] and they found the water three days
[1:22:48] didn't find any water
[1:22:50] now let's look at this
[1:22:53] oftentimes we're led by god to the
[1:22:56] wilderness of sure
[1:23:00] and and what this word sure means i
[1:23:02] might be i might actually be pronouncing
[1:23:05] it wrong and and and if i am forgive me
[1:23:08] but to me it does make sense
[1:23:11] in the english language
[1:23:13] to pronounce it as sure
[1:23:19] sure
[1:23:22] we're getting close
[1:23:25] but but sure means wall
[1:23:28] there's this place called sure it's
[1:23:31] actually a wall
[1:23:32] that's what it means come on somebody
[1:23:34] you you go from worshiping and praising
[1:23:37] god and seeing him make a way and doing
[1:23:39] all this and then you run into a wall
[1:23:50] it was a landmark between the delta and
[1:23:52] the deserts
[1:23:53] it was a barrier of some kind across the
[1:23:56] great north northeastern highways out of
[1:23:59] egypt
[1:24:00] now i like this point it's a barrier
[1:24:03] when you're coming out of egypt
[1:24:06] when you're trying to get delivered from
[1:24:08] something when you're trying to get free
[1:24:09] from something this place called sure
[1:24:12] becomes a barrier to try to block you
[1:24:14] from getting a cross
[1:24:18] but when you get to the wilderness of
[1:24:19] sure my encouragement to you this
[1:24:22] morning be certain
[1:24:25] of god
[1:24:32] when when saints get to this place
[1:24:34] called shu or this wilderness of sure uh
[1:24:37] you know this is where this is where
[1:24:39] people become
[1:24:40] unsure
[1:24:44] when they're standing that sure they
[1:24:46] become unsure
[1:24:49] and they begin to say things like this i
[1:24:51] know god can do it but will he do it for
[1:24:54] me
[1:24:55] see you unsure right i know god is a
[1:24:58] healer and i believe and rejoice over
[1:25:00] the testimonies i heard but really heal
[1:25:02] me
[1:25:04] i know god made a way before but really
[1:25:07] make a way this time for me you are
[1:25:09] unsure
[1:25:13] say don't be unsure be be certain of god
[1:25:17] amen
[1:25:18] look at this out of the sermon be
[1:25:20] certain of god watch this quote brother
[1:25:22] branham brings us
[1:25:26] he says you know
[1:25:28] when
[1:25:29] we have confessed our sins and met every
[1:25:31] requirement that god requires

[1:33:10] and i'ma still operate with that
[1:33:14] i'm certain of god
[1:33:25] his word has to be true and if you if he
[1:33:26] required you to meet these circumstances
[1:33:28] then you did he's obligated to take care
[1:33:30] of his own word don't back off
[1:33:32] and say oh i'll never get healed oh you
[1:33:34] poor weak weak faith don't believe that
[1:33:36] if everything's confessed
[1:33:38] and everything's out and you met god's
[1:33:40] requirement faith holds right there
[1:33:44] there's nothing
[1:33:46] will move it
[1:33:47] he is and you're sure
[1:33:50] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:33:52] their strength they shall mount with
[1:33:53] wings of an eagle they shall run and not
[1:33:55] be weary and they shall walk and not
[1:33:57] faint
[1:34:00] wait
[1:34:01] when you've met his requirements that
[1:34:02] brings your faith to a showdown if you
[1:34:05] have met god's requirements has been
[1:34:06] made met and you have and you have fully
[1:34:09] considered it and you have done
[1:34:10] everything that god required you to do
[1:34:12] then your faith rests right there
[1:34:15] that he is be certain of god
[1:34:19] to this place
[1:34:21] that the children of israel have come to
[1:34:24] after
[1:34:25] a man of the defeat
[1:34:28] a pharaoh in his army in the red sea
[1:34:30] this wilderness of sure
[1:34:33] well this is not the first time somebody
[1:34:35] in the bible has come to sure
[1:34:39] we have some other instances that i want
[1:34:42] to show you in scripture amen one of
[1:34:44] them we're going to find in genesis 16.
[1:34:48] glory to god verse 6 through 10.
[1:34:53] this is amen a time when abram
[1:34:57] and
[1:34:58] sarah or sarai
[1:35:00] they have received a promise from god
[1:35:03] amen that sarai was going to have a
[1:35:05] child
[1:35:06] but sarai began to doubt the promise she
[1:35:09] became unsure
[1:35:12] glory to god and when she doubted the
[1:35:14] promise she she suggested to abraham
[1:35:18] it was surrounded suggested why don't
[1:35:20] you take uh my handmaid here hagar and
[1:35:24] maybe bear a child through her and that
[1:35:25] suggestion turned out to be a really
[1:35:27] really bad
[1:35:29] decision
[1:35:31] but look at this in in genesis 16 6
[1:35:34] but abraham said unto sarai
[1:35:37] behold thy hand that i made is in my
[1:35:40] hand due to her as it pleadeth thee and
[1:35:42] when sir i dealt hardly with her she
[1:35:44] fled from her face
[1:35:46] now this is that that sarai was the one
[1:35:48] suggested that this lady take her place
[1:35:51] and now she's upset with her
[1:35:54] and said then and the angel of the lord
[1:35:56] founded by a fountain of water in the
[1:35:57] wilderness by the fountain in the way to
[1:36:01] sure
[1:36:04] look at this now the angel lord found a
[1:36:07] hagar
[1:36:09] amen the handmaid found her at founder
[1:36:13] at the fountain in the way to sure
[1:36:16] and when and he said hey god sir is made
[1:36:20] with king of style and wither will thou
[1:36:22] go and she said i flee from the face of
[1:36:24] my mistress sarai
[1:36:26] and the angel lord said to her return to
[1:36:29] thy mistress
[1:36:31] and submit thyself under her hands now
[1:36:34] this is a a tremendous trial i mean this
[1:36:38] lady just just gave me what for
[1:36:41] and she made it made it very clear that
[1:36:43] i'm not welcome in her house and you
[1:36:45] want me to go back to our house
[1:36:48] some of y'all need to go back into some
[1:36:50] situations and get it straightened out
[1:36:51] maybe humble yourself and submit
[1:36:53] yourself to some things
[1:36:56] you're me god and the wilderness of sure
[1:37:00] go make things right
[1:37:01] before you see god make things right
[1:37:05] but here the angel lord told her to go
[1:37:07] back and submit herself uh under her
[1:37:09] hands and the angel is telling her i
[1:37:10] will multiply thy seed exceedingly that
[1:37:13] it shall not be numbered for the
[1:37:15] multitude now i want you to catch this
[1:37:18] hagar was found by the angel lord at
[1:37:20] sure and she would be blessed not only
[1:37:23] would she be blessed but her seed would
[1:37:26] be blessed if she went back and
[1:37:28] submitted herself to sarai
[1:37:30] after she got an uh a direct word from
[1:37:33] god
[1:37:35] at sure
[1:37:41] genesis 20.
[1:37:50] verse 1 says this
[1:37:53] and abraham journeyed
[1:37:56] from thence towards the south country
[1:38:00] and dwelt between kadesh
[1:38:03] and
[1:38:04] sure
[1:38:06] and sojourn and gerrard now now what
[1:38:09] we're getting here as we as we go into
[1:38:11] this abraham
[1:38:12] uh the promise for him
[1:38:15] sarah was going to have a son
[1:38:17] sarah's going to have a son oh my god
[1:38:18] god told him that sarah's going to have
[1:38:20] now they've been waiting for a number of
[1:38:21] years for sarah to have this son
[1:38:23] glory to god now i believe there was a
[1:38:25] famine of something that struck the land
[1:38:26] and abraham decided you know i got to
[1:38:28] get up and i got to leave but god could
[1:38:30] not bless abraham outside of being there
[1:38:32] in the land where he told him to be
[1:38:34] god can't bless israel outside of where
[1:38:36] he told him to be he's not going to deal
[1:38:38] with israel until they get back to where
[1:38:40] they're supposed to be you know even in
[1:38:41] this war with ukraine russia is driving
[1:38:44] some of israel right back into there
[1:38:47] you realize god gonna deal with 144 000
[1:38:50] jews some of them could have been
[1:38:51] sitting in ukraine
[1:38:53] and sometimes it take war to get people
[1:38:55] back to where they need to be sometimes
[1:38:57] it takes trials it takes distress to get
[1:39:00] people in the place where god wants them
[1:39:01] to be
[1:39:05] amen amen look at it
[1:39:08] abraham journey from this towards the
[1:39:09] south country and dwell between kardesh
[1:39:11] and sure
[1:39:12] sojourned in gerar
[1:39:15] and abraham said of sarah's wife she is
[1:39:17] my sister
[1:39:19] and abimelech king of garage sent and
[1:39:21] took sarah
[1:39:22] but god came to bimelec in a dream by
[1:39:24] night and said to him behold thou art
[1:39:26] thou art but a dead man for the woman
[1:39:28] which style has taken for she is a man's
[1:39:30] wife but abimelech had not come near her
[1:39:33] and he said lord without slay also a
[1:39:36] righteous nation said he not unto me she
[1:39:39] is my sister and she even uh even she
[1:39:42] accepts that he is my brother and the
[1:39:44] integrity of my heart and energy of my
[1:39:46] hands have i done this both abraham and
[1:39:48] sarah live
[1:39:52] now this is a little different from uh
[1:39:54] uh anonymous sapphire
[1:39:57] they lot
[1:39:58] and then live to lie again
[1:40:01] but abraham and sarah lot come on
[1:40:03] somebody both of them lied but god still
[1:40:06] delivered them and the reason that god
[1:40:08] delivered them there was a promise over
[1:40:10] their life
[1:40:12] there was a promise that god has spoke
[1:40:14] sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:40:17] i don't care what you feel abraham i
[1:40:19] don't care what you think and all this
[1:40:21] jerry your wife gonna have a son
[1:40:24] not your sister i ain't calling your
[1:40:26] sister i said sarah your wife
[1:40:29] amen
[1:40:30] and yes she is your sister's half sister
[1:40:32] yes she is but look at this
[1:40:35] look at this
[1:40:38] verse six and god said unto him in a
[1:40:39] dream yeah i know that thou didst this
[1:40:41] and the integrity of the heart for i
[1:40:43] also withheld thee from sinning against
[1:40:44] me therefore suffered i thee not to
[1:40:46] touch her
[1:40:47] now i want you to understand the reason
[1:40:48] that god won't allow
[1:40:50] this man to touch sarah is because god
[1:40:54] had a promise
[1:40:56] wrapped around sarah
[1:40:57] and there was nothing that could come i
[1:41:00] don't care how old she got
[1:41:02] there was nothing that could stop god's
[1:41:04] word from being fulfilled
[1:41:07] in sarah's life
[1:41:08] and in abraham's life and look at this
[1:41:10] this i just love this because even even
[1:41:13] when we
[1:41:14] when we are doubting our unbelief and
[1:41:16] maybe god should just kick us to the
[1:41:18] side
[1:41:19] but he don't
[1:41:21] he's still got good things to say about
[1:41:22] you
[1:41:24] child you still my child
[1:41:26] my son my daughter i don't care what you
[1:41:28] still my child look at what happened
[1:41:30] here in verse seven now therefore
[1:41:32] restore the man his wife
[1:41:36] for he is a prophet look at that not
[1:41:38] liar
[1:41:40] prophet
[1:41:41] for he is a prophet and he shall pray
[1:41:42] for thee and thou shalt live and if thou
[1:41:44] restore not know thou that thou shalt
[1:41:47] surely die thou and all that are that it
[1:41:50] was here
[1:41:51] at sure this wilderness assure where
[1:41:54] abraham was unsure about what god
[1:41:57] promised him and he did something wrong
[1:42:00] let's catch one more in scripture
[1:42:03] somebody gets to sure
[1:42:06] and gets unsure
[1:42:08] first samuel
[1:42:10] 15
[1:42:13] verse 7
[1:42:20] and saul smote the malachites from
[1:42:22] havilah
[1:42:23] unto thou comest
[1:42:25] to sure
[1:42:27] that is over against egypt and it took
[1:42:29] agag the king of the malachites alive
[1:42:32] and utterly destroyed all the people
[1:42:34] with the edge of the sword but saul and
[1:42:36] the people spared a gag and the best of
[1:42:38] the sheep and of the oxen and other
[1:42:41] fatlings and the lambs and all that was
[1:42:43] good and would not utterly destroy them
[1:42:45] but everything that was vile and re
[1:42:47] refused that they destroyed utterly now
[1:42:51] that was not what god told them do god
[1:42:53] told them destroy everything
[1:42:55] but they saved some of the things and
[1:42:57] they thought that they would try to
[1:42:58] bring that and offer that to god and
[1:42:59] when when when the prophet uh uh
[1:43:02] samuel came down and said what is this
[1:43:03] out here you supposed to destroy
[1:43:05] everything what did you do saul he said
[1:43:07] he said no no no i did this i did that i
[1:43:09] did this
[1:43:11] let's skip down to verse 20.
[1:43:14] but you didn't do what god told you to
[1:43:15] do
[1:43:18] and this is what happened in verse 20.
[1:43:20] this happened
[1:43:21] at sure
[1:43:24] saul said and samuel have obeyed the
[1:43:26] verse of the lord and have gone the way
[1:43:27] which the lord sent me and have brought
[1:43:28] a king
[1:43:30] ag the king of amalek and have utterly
[1:43:32] destroyed their malachites god actually
[1:43:34] told him to destroy a gag too
[1:43:36] he failed to do exactly what god told
[1:43:38] him to do
[1:43:39] and later on if you read scripture
[1:43:41] you'll find out that it was one of these
[1:43:43] um amalekites that actually slayed saul
[1:43:46] so you better kill your enemy
[1:43:48] before your enemy kills you
[1:43:52] look at this verse 21 but the people
[1:43:54] took out a spoiled sheep and oxen and
[1:43:56] the chief of the things which should
[1:43:57] have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice
[1:43:59] them to the lord thy god and give god he
[1:44:01] thought he had to dress that thing up
[1:44:02] real good they took the best so they can
[1:44:04] sacrifice unto god
[1:44:06] but then what god asked for god said
[1:44:08] destroy everything
[1:44:10] look at this amen he said and then he
[1:44:13] had to be rebuked by the prophet
[1:44:15] thinking he was doing something good
[1:44:17] oh my he says this in verse 22 samuel
[1:44:20] said hath the lord as great delight and
[1:44:22] burnt offerings and sacrifices
[1:44:24] as in obeying the voice of the lord
[1:44:27] behold to obey
[1:44:29] is better than sacrifice
[1:44:32] to hearken than the fat of rams for
[1:44:34] rebellion
[1:44:37] is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:44:41] and stubbornness
[1:44:43] is as iniquity and idolatry
[1:44:47] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:44:49] the lord he have also rejected thee from
[1:44:52] being king
[1:44:53] this happened at sure
[1:44:58] see you don't want to be unsure
[1:45:01] of a god that's already done so many
[1:45:03] great things
[1:45:05] amen it's not only if he did it before
[1:45:08] he can do it again no if he did it for
[1:45:10] he will
[1:45:13] do it again it's time for us to be
[1:45:14] certain of god
[1:45:18] we find
[1:45:21] this great trial here in exodus 15
[1:45:24] israel celebrating the victory
[1:45:26] over pharaoh and his
[1:45:28] army but verse 22 when we read it in
[1:45:31] exodus 15 shows that they moved from a
[1:45:33] great victory
[1:45:35] to a great trial says so moses brought
[1:45:37] israel from the red sea
[1:45:39] and they went out into the wilderness of
[1:45:40] shur
[1:45:41] and they went three days in the
[1:45:42] wilderness and found
[1:45:44] no water
[1:45:46] praise god
[1:45:48] i want to drop this little uh quote off
[1:45:51] with y'all to speak to the rock and it
[1:45:53] shall give forth this water
[1:45:56] hallelujah
[1:45:58] church we find ourselves in the same
[1:46:00] position

[1:46:06] out of this 40-day uh uh um prophecy and
[1:46:10] and i did want to say this i i think
[1:46:12] some kind of way we need to be able to
[1:46:14] hear some of the testimonies
[1:46:16] that god has done in this 40 days
[1:46:19] and i'm trying i'm thinking that we
[1:46:21] might have to set up a special service
[1:46:23] just just for that
[1:46:25] amen to be able to kind of come and just
[1:46:27] let people share what the lord did for
[1:46:29] them in this 40 days i don't want to
[1:46:31] just to go and just
[1:46:32] pass and be going i want us to let's
[1:46:35] let's exalt the lord
[1:46:37] let's tell of his goodness i want y'all
[1:46:39] to be thinking of it and there are some
[1:46:40] things that i mean i've been hearing
[1:46:42] different people i had this on my prayer
[1:46:44] list i had that god did this god oh my
[1:46:46] goodness look at god
[1:46:49] some of y'all wrote some things down and
[1:46:51] god been answering everything that you

[1:46:56] need to hear hey man tell tell if it's
[1:46:58] one of one wonderous deeds
[1:47:01] we're getting ready to come out of this
[1:47:03] but here's the other thing i want to say
[1:47:05] just as israel was coming out of this
[1:47:07] great manifestation
[1:47:10] they faced the wilderness
[1:47:12] of sure
[1:47:13] and if that is our amen if that's part
[1:47:16] of our story i won't encourage us before
[1:47:18] we get there
[1:47:20] be certain of god
[1:47:24] hearing the sermon speak to the rock and
[1:47:26] it shall give forth this water
[1:47:29] the prophet says this they had seen ten
[1:47:31] powerful miracles performed down in
[1:47:33] egypt
[1:47:34] flies lice
[1:47:37] fire
[1:47:38] death angel
[1:47:39] all that seen in egypt all these great
[1:47:41] miracles they had seen god do and we're
[1:47:44] still carnal thinkers anybody anybody
[1:47:46] can identify with the children of israel
[1:47:49] i'd have seen god do this i hadn't seen
[1:47:50] god do that and then my mind
[1:47:53] carnal thinking
[1:47:54] god delivered me from carnal thinking
[1:47:59] to set me free from from thinking like
[1:48:01] that god i i i mean if i just only want
[1:48:04] i want to only believe
[1:48:10] it says this colonel thinkers and then
[1:48:13] they saw the red sea
[1:48:15] that was laying in the path of duty they
[1:48:18] were on their road marching then
[1:48:21] come out there was a pill of fire before
[1:48:24] them and they marched on to the red sea
[1:48:27] and when they got there right in the
[1:48:30] line of duty
[1:48:32] laid an obstacle
[1:48:34] first thing you know fear struck them
[1:48:37] and they did not know what to do that's
[1:48:39] the way people does today when fear
[1:48:41] strikes them when they're right in the
[1:48:43] path of duty you're doing exactly what

[1:51:43] get under it
[1:51:45] get around it

[1:51:50] through it
[1:51:52] somehow another his grace is sufficient
[1:51:56] to carry us through it
[1:51:58] i thought about you know brother branham
[1:52:00] when he had that big old tax case
[1:52:02] and he couldn't figure out how to get
[1:52:04] get through this tax case he just
[1:52:05] thought he was doing all the right
[1:52:06] things with the money that was given to
[1:52:08] him
[1:52:09] and uh and and they're just coming after
[1:52:10] him and you know even while he's there
[1:52:13] fighting with this the the you know the
[1:52:15] tax guys and everything like you know i
[1:52:18] uh uh they told me oh so many thousands
[1:52:21] of dollars in taxes on the money and and
[1:52:23] and as he's as he's fighting with these
[1:52:25] guys uh they didn't get a trial in the
[1:52:27] middle all that mine just all messed up
[1:52:30] with it
[1:52:31] here's somebody need prayer for their
[1:52:32] baby
[1:52:34] and and he got to go pray for the baby
[1:52:35] but before the prayer for the baby the
[1:52:38] tax man called
[1:52:40] his wife pick up the phone
[1:52:43] and uh she yelled to him
[1:52:45] and not not she didn't yell but she just
[1:52:47] kind of made me mouth to him bill
[1:52:50] it's the tax man
[1:52:52] brother brandon run out
[1:52:54] side the house tell him i'm not here
[1:52:56] right now
[1:52:58] his wife looked at him see sarah lied
[1:53:00] for abraham but sister branham uh-uh
[1:53:04] this brand says that wait billy no
[1:53:07] gentleman you want me to tell him what
[1:53:10] and she you know she she said what he
[1:53:12] what he told say but when he came back
[1:53:14] in that house
[1:53:15] he'd say was that right
[1:53:19] bill was that right
[1:53:22] he said yeah it was right when you told
[1:53:24] him i wasn't in the house i actually

[1:53:33] thank god for a holy ghost-filled wife
[1:53:37] couldn't get around it and that that he
[1:53:40] said you know you're right and and then
[1:53:41] the holy spirit jumped on top of what
[1:53:43] his wife said now you're going to pray
[1:53:44] for a baby went down there to try to
[1:53:46] pray for the baby and just just just

[1:55:24] midst of out of nowhere that tax case
[1:55:26] was just dropped
[1:55:28] taken care of just like that
[1:55:31] see it's when we can't see our way
[1:55:32] through it we get to the wilderness of
[1:55:34] sure
[1:55:37] and that's that's that's sometimes
[1:55:38] you're in the best place that god wants
[1:55:40] you to be
[1:55:41] and when you're there don't give up
[1:55:44] don't don't get unsure
[1:55:46] but be sure be certain of god keep
[1:55:49] pressing on god will make a way through
[1:55:51] it
[1:55:52] when you can't get over it
[1:55:54] can't get under it
[1:55:56] can't get around it
[1:55:58] god opens up a way for you to go through
[1:56:00] it
[1:56:01] through it all i learn to trust in jesus
[1:56:06] i learn to to depend on his word
[1:56:15] let me finish you all with one of my
[1:56:17] favorite quotes
[1:56:21] smyrna church
[1:56:28] thinking not strange
[1:56:30] concerning concerning the fiery trials
[1:56:33] that are to try you
[1:56:36] that is what peter said is it is it
[1:56:38] strange that god wants us to develop
[1:56:41] christ-like character
[1:56:43] that comes through suffering
[1:56:47] no sir
[1:56:49] and we all have trials
[1:56:50] you put the exact uh that i gave you
[1:56:53] there that'll bring it up uh it says we
[1:56:56] all have trials
[1:57:01] we are all tried and chastened as sons
[1:57:04] not one but goes through that
[1:57:06] the church that is not suffering look at
[1:57:09] this statement
[1:57:10] the church that is not suffering
[1:57:13] is not being tried
[1:57:16] it isn't of god
[1:57:19] can i say that again
[1:57:21] the church that is not suffering
[1:57:25] and is not being tried
[1:57:28] it isn't of god
[1:57:30] so as a church we got to go through a
[1:57:31] particular trial
[1:57:33] and before we go into our promised land
[1:57:35] you got to go through the trial
[1:57:38] amen right says the church that has not
[1:57:41] suffered has not been tried hasn't got
[1:57:43] it it isn't of god hebrews 12 6 says
[1:57:45] this for whom the lord loveth
[1:57:50] he chasteneth
[1:57:52] not only just chastens but scourgeth
[1:57:56] every son whom he receiveth but yet but
[1:58:00] if ye be without chastisement whereof
[1:58:03] all are partakers then are ye bastards
[1:58:05] and not sons
[1:58:08] look at it
[1:58:09] now this special condition in smyrna
[1:58:12] must be applied
[1:58:14] to every age there is no age free from
[1:58:18] it there is no true believer free from
[1:58:21] it this is of god
[1:58:26] yes yes yes yes right where you sitting
[1:58:29] at right now this
[1:58:32] is
[1:58:33] of god
[1:58:36] i was thanking the lord i was driving by
[1:58:39] our or the building that we was just
[1:58:41] renting
[1:58:42] and um and i remember when i when i when
[1:58:44] i when i when that building came open i
[1:58:47] remember there used to be another church
[1:58:48] in there and they had a big bus in the
[1:58:50] back
[1:58:51] and i would always see that bus parked
[1:58:52] back there and then a few weeks i would
[1:58:54] drive by there and i wouldn't see the
[1:58:55] bus like maybe the bus in the shop
[1:58:57] i don't know what happened to the bus
[1:58:59] bus say no around i just kept going by
[1:59:01] there kept going by the asset ain't no
[1:59:03] bus where this bus had so one day i
[1:59:05] finally saw let me drive up in this
[1:59:07] plaza and i drove up in there and saw a
[1:59:09] big old sign felice
[1:59:11] i say oh my this church is available and
[1:59:14] at that time we needed just a little bit
[1:59:16] more space
[1:59:17] i was a little afraid to jump off in
[1:59:20] that
[1:59:21] because we we had a very few people and
[1:59:22] they they want they wanted our rent to
[1:59:24] double
[1:59:25] hey man if i i mean they were getting
[1:59:27] triple the space and they wanted to rent
[1:59:29] the dub and i'm like lord we ain't got i
[1:59:30] don't know how we're going to do the few
[1:59:32] people that we got lord but i remember
[1:59:33] brother caleb coming and and preaching
[1:59:35] why was down there in green acres
[1:59:37] and he said brother jack you lean in a
[1:59:40] particular direction god said go for it
[1:59:42] he's with you
[1:59:43] i broke down crying i say i love hearing
[1:59:45] the word of the lord the voice of the
[1:59:46] lord i i'm going by faith and god met
[1:59:49] our need
[1:59:50] for 13 years
[1:59:52] while we were there in that place
[1:59:54] sometime i tell people what we was
[1:59:55] painting like what y'all that
[1:59:57] that's what we have to pay here in
[1:59:59] florida
[2:00:00] but the same god that provides your 500
[2:00:03] is the same god that provided our 3 500.
[2:00:07] that's right
[2:00:08] that's that's the god we serve
[2:00:10] amen not a different god we don't pray
[2:00:12] to a different god when the knee get
[2:00:14] higher we go to the same god
[2:00:21] and when it's time for us to pay our
[2:00:22] mortgage he gonna provide
[2:00:25] he's already i mean look he done proven
[2:00:27] that over and over again he will provide
[2:00:33] i need to say that because i'm gonna go
[2:00:34] back and listen to this tape and i'm
[2:00:36] gonna need it when i get into the
[2:00:37] wilderness of sure i'm gonna need to
[2:00:39] hear that he will provide
[2:00:41] [Applause]
[2:00:46] but i was looking i said and then then
[2:00:48] you know a year ago here
[2:00:50] landlord comes on say you know what
[2:00:51] we're gonna double your rent say for the
[2:00:53] same space
[2:00:55] i just don't think this is the will of
[2:00:56] the lord
[2:00:57] talked it over to the few of the
[2:00:59] brothers and we all agreed they're
[2:01:00] saying the will of the lord no this
[2:01:01] ain't not the double our space not the
[2:01:03] double our rent for this same space

[2:03:29] persecuted they the prophets which were
[2:03:31] before you
[2:03:32] here it is
[2:03:34] one of my favorites
[2:03:36] the cloudy skies
[2:03:40] and storms of life
[2:03:43] are no signs
[2:03:45] of god's disapproval just because you're
[2:03:48] going through don't mean god upset with
[2:03:50] you
[2:03:53] no actually god got confidence in you
[2:03:57] the cloudy skies and storms life are no
[2:03:59] signs of god disapproval neither
[2:04:01] are bright skies and still waters that
[2:04:04] mean you ain't going through nothing
[2:04:06] signs of his love and
[2:04:08] approval so you see see the
[2:04:10] denominational church the you know uh uh
[2:04:14] many dynamics church they got so much
[2:04:15] money flowing through that just by
[2:04:16] building after building some people just
[2:04:18] give them buildings
[2:04:20] some of them bought it for a dollar you
[2:04:22] bought that whole how do i get that
[2:04:23] blessing
[2:04:25] but god ain't got it like that for me
[2:04:27] god got something else for us and i'm
[2:04:29] gonna tell you something else that i
[2:04:30] know about god that's something i
[2:04:32] learned about god
[2:04:34] um
[2:04:38] always got your best interest in mine
[2:04:42] one time we was getting ready to buy a
[2:04:43] house and we looked at it and said you
[2:04:44] know and we said we wanted this we
[2:04:46] wanted that we wanted this we wanted
[2:04:47] that and we wanted a few things and and
[2:04:50] then the house was gonna buy it didn't
[2:04:52] have everything we wanted so we're gonna
[2:04:53] compromise
[2:04:54] and take something you don't know how
[2:04:56] that is yeah yeah
[2:04:58] the lord just allowed the people not to
[2:05:00] even take our offer wouldn't respond to
[2:05:02] the offer didn't do nothing like what
[2:05:04] happened and we we couldn't figure out
[2:05:05] what happened to how all of a sudden
[2:05:07] another house popped up that had
[2:05:08] everything that we wanted in it
[2:05:12] not only had everything we wanted in it
[2:05:15] but it had a motivated
[2:05:18] seller when i say motivated
[2:05:23] motivated
[2:05:25] so motivated
[2:05:27] that his deal was i will give you
[2:05:30] ten thousand dollars if you buy my house
[2:05:36] you know you know what i did
[2:05:38] y'all know what i
[2:05:43] no y'all don't know me like that i want
[2:05:44] to say i'ma pray about this now i got
[2:05:47] man where the pen at
[2:05:50] where the pen
[2:05:52] give me the pen you gonna give me what
[2:05:57] then right and now you came back out of
[2:05:59] it
[2:06:03] god know how to do it i'ma tell you i
[2:06:05] might as well just say this while i'm
[2:06:06] here
[2:06:08] we want to host
[2:06:12] meetings
[2:06:14] we want to host
[2:06:16] the concert for the young people

[2:06:21] that will allow us to play
[2:06:23] host
[2:06:26] not just a church just to host us i'm
[2:06:28] thinking beyond us because this just
[2:06:30] what it is right now y'all ain't seeing
[2:06:32] who god gonna sing
[2:06:34] after you get into your building
[2:06:37] so we gotta have a building big enough
[2:06:39] and land big enough to handle all of
[2:06:41] that god already thought that out
[2:06:45] and he walked around our property
[2:06:47] right now
[2:06:49] [Applause]
[2:06:53] but until then we'll be faithful we'll
[2:06:55] just praise him right where we
[2:06:56] are amen cloudy skies and storm the life
[2:06:59] of no signs of his god's disapproval
[2:07:01] neither bright skies and still water
[2:07:03] signs of his love and approval his
[2:07:04] approval
[2:07:06] of any of us
[2:07:08] is is only in the beloved
[2:07:11] his love is elective
[2:07:14] which he had for us
[2:07:16] before
[2:07:18] the foundation of the world
[2:07:21] does he love us
[2:07:23] ah yes
[2:07:25] but how shall we know
[2:07:28] do we know god's love because he bless
[2:07:30] us with this and bless us with that and
[2:07:31] bless us with it no
[2:07:34] that just one that just goes on top of
[2:07:36] the love
[2:07:38] but how should we know we should know
[2:07:40] because he said so
[2:07:46] yeah yeah have y'all ever heard the lord
[2:07:48] tell you
[2:07:49] i love you
[2:07:51] i love you
[2:07:53] i love you
[2:07:56] we should know because he said so
[2:07:59] and manifested that he did love us for
[2:08:02] he brought us to himself and gave us of
[2:08:05] his spirit
[2:08:06] placing us as sons and how shall i prove
[2:08:11] my love to him
[2:08:16] that's how you do it not not just by
[2:08:17] saying lord i love you
[2:08:19] but by
[2:08:20] believing what he said
[2:08:23] that's the first thing you got to do
[2:08:24] believe what he said
[2:08:25] second is
[2:08:27] and by conducting myself
[2:08:31] with joy
[2:08:34] see happiness is something that has to
[2:08:37] happen to you
[2:08:39] but joy is something that's there no
[2:08:41] matter what's going on around you
[2:08:44] so i'm not conducting myself with
[2:08:46] happiness i'm conducting myself with
[2:08:49] joy
[2:08:52] amidst the trials
[2:08:54] that he in his wisdom
[2:08:57] allows to come to pass
[2:09:00] so when i hit the wilderness of sure
