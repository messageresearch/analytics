father we love you and we bless you you are the one who speak the word and lord hears your word blessed is the one that i speak and blessed are those that hear the word of the lord father lord give us the spiritual ears and hearts to hear your word we bless you this day we magnify your name we bring every spirit that is not of you under the control we send a bill of fire to consume every distracting spirit that your people who hear the word as you were here on earth you spoke and when people heard you they said we're glad they had the word of the lord it brought peace unto them may the same spirit of christ speak their word and bring peace and refreshing deliverance joy prosperity and every blessing and desires upon the heart of our people into manifestation father we love you and we bless you this day in your name jesus christ we pray amen god bless you shall we give a clap offering on to the lord [Applause] [Music] our lord is good amen we may take our seed there's none like unto him glory to his name we want to look at uh if you can bring the slice for for us we want to look at my purpose on earth individually why are we here is it to work and make money and just spend the money and die out go to vacations in the places that we love to go is it to marry and raise children and live a good life and die and go out is it to get some positions and fame on this earth and finish and live the good life so called and die and go out but what is the purpose that the good lord have on have for us on this earth why are we here why are you in the family that you are in why were you born in maybe west palm beach or wherever you were born why are you located here why are you sitting on this plastic chair why do you have the address that you have why are you in a job that you have why are you in the family of christ what is the reason that the lord put you here on earth amen this sermon was actually intended for the little ones for the children and i wanted to do some illustrations with it and i wanted to bring some books but i couldn't i'm not ready for that yet so i'll talk to the parents and the children and all of us amen everyone inclusive but god willing in his time we will just focus on the children narrow our eyes on the children and speak something to the children amen so let's look at the first scripture the second slide where were we before we drop here amen ephesians chapter one verse three to six if you want to open your scriptures if you understand we can if we're able to stand less than then as we read the word of the lord amen ephesians 1 3-6 and after we read isaiah 49 16 blessed be the blessed be god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in life so now he's unfolding some of the purpose he has for us that the lord chose you before the foundation of the world to be here in this world on this earth and to be holy amen that alone is the same one holy and would i blame before him in life amen so the holiness of god is not something is being forced on you but it's coming out of love it's not because i want to smoke but if i smoke but but someone is going to look at me that i'm not holy so i'm not going to smoke i'm still smoking in my heart if that's my desire but holiness which is come which comes from a pure heart you don't even have the desire to smoke and to drink and to do evil amen verse 5 says having predecessors predestinated us unto adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to to the praise of the glory of his grace wearing he has made us accepted in the beloved you may take your seat amen to the praise so the sole intention of the of the lord is for us to manifest his praise to be instrument of his spirit amen to be vessels of priest and honor and grace unto the lord let's go to isaiah 49 verse 16 isaiah 49 16 the second slide say behold i have grieved thee upon the palms of my hand thy walls are continually before me amen all your life from your from conception from being a seed in your father's voice before then until when you breathe your last breath you are always in the palms of god in the palms of his hands amen there's nothing that you go that's it thy walls are continually before me you are confined you can't hide away from the lord it's not possible amen you can dig down and go whatever fit you want to go billions of feet you are still naked before the lord amen let's look at another scripture here is a career verse three sorry sir career verse sorry chapter three verse one to eight now before you can achieve the purpose of god on earth you have to go through a transition and you want to look at those transitions the career was born was ordained a priest for the lord but then before he became a priest there was somebody objecting to his priesthood and want to find out and he needed to overcome he couldn't overcome by himself but there has to be a messenger from heaven to help zakaria overcome that opposition so that he could manifest the purpose god has for him on earth and so is every one of us before you can achieve the sole purpose of god in your life you need to be born again amen and look at the type verse one and he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him and the lord said unto satan the lord rebuked thee o satan even the lord that has chosen jerusalem rebuke thee what is jerusalem god city of peace it's not this brand plucked out of the fire it means joshua came from the pillar of fire and every one of you came from the pillar of fire which is the mind of jesus christ amen now joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel what is the filthy garment the old breath breathed through the canal realm which made you a sinner which made her sinners and he and verse 4 and he answered and speak unto those that stood before him saying take away the fifth garment from him and unto him he said behold i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and i will clothe thee with change of remnant what is the change of ramen the holy ghost baptism the new breath that will put you in the perfect will of god amen until a person is born again you cannot do god's prayer at all you can try with your mind but it's not going to bring the perfect will of god amen but when you are born of the lord then the life that is in you is no longer your life but it's jesus christ working his life and living his life in your life in your hearts amen verse five and i said let them set a fair meter upon his head so they set a fair meter upon his head and clothe him and clothe him with garments and the angel of the law still by what is the feminist it's a hebrew word if you go to the hebrew original readings miss nibbet something wrote around the head the turban or the headdress of a high priest which is a priesthood covenant amen now if you go to the east if you go to let's say india and pakistan pakistan shop you see the pakistanis and indians they have a table like a headgear around their head now that is a covenant that is a they have a cast originally they have a cast system pre-shoot a cast they have their business cast they have uh the lowest their cleanest now so the priesthood used to wear that turbine to show that they are from a royal family amen and the natural types the spiritual the bible is an eastern gospel and most of the cultures or all the cultures come from the east so the turbine signified the token and what is the turbine today is it the turbine that we wear no is it the turbine our sisters where no is it a is it a what else what what do what is the turbine what is that here it is the holy ghost baptism it is the inner man it is a christ in you it is the pillar of fire in you that sets you apart to be a royal priesthood unto the lord and when you walk in the angel of the lord singing holy holy holy unto the lord amen the flesh of brother solomon johnson is not the same as the flesh of brother solomon johnson before he was born again when you are born again even the atoms of your flesh the pillar of fire has to recreate it rearrange it so that he can live in it amen in the natural sometimes you buy a house the house is gorgeous your dream house but you go in there there's no certain things are not the way you want it so what do you do you refurbish your house is that right pull certain things down and create if a human being is wise enough to refurbish his house how much more did the creator amen how much more greeted tenna he want to live live in your flesh and my flesh and through the sex birth we were deviant amen we were away from his his covenant we were not in the in the mode that he could live in us so he had to consume he just doesn't refurbish he has to consume the old person the soul that didn't come from god and now he creates nature the soul is the nature of the spirit is the control tower amen before you were born again there was a being that was living in you that tells you to drink alcohol to smoke marijuana to take cocaine push cocaine into your veins and that was a control tower but then there's a time that the true owner of the house decided to swap ownership amen and he has to he doesn't just eject the one that was previously living there but it consumes him and destroys his kingdom amen because the kingdom of god is greater than the kingdom of this world the kingdom of this world can just go so far but the kingdom of god is returner amen so when the true owner of the house decide to take to use his house then he comes in and does the redemption work and his consumption amen consumption means to be done away then he create himself in you and when you are working you are no longer the same person you used to be you become a two-fold person you still have your human being a man this addiction is she's always been addiction but when she was one again she changed form heaven began to speak into her she saw another dimension that is walking in her that sing songs that praise the lord that loves to hear the word of the lord that that causes to raise her children in the fear of the lord and that is the holy ghost the christ the eternal being in you amen so joshua the high priest let's let's continue and verse 6. now joshua is ready to fulfill his purpose on earth verses says and the angel of the lord protested unto unto joshua saying that says the lord of hosts if thou walk in my ways and if that will keep my charge then thou shall also judge my house and shall also keep my courts and i will give the places to walk among those among these that stand by here now oh joshua the high priest thou and i fellows that seed before me for they are men wonder that for behold i'll bring forth my servant the branch what is the branch christ jesus now joshua is going to reproduce he's not going to produce the old joshua but he's going to produce a replica of heaven jesus christ in his flesh amen glory hallelujah to the lord now let's take a a typical example let's go to the next verse the next slide and let's see how the lord take our brokenness and transform them into masterpieces amen now before you were born your purpose was already woven in you your purpose on earth doesn't it begins manifesting on earth but the purpose was already predestinated before the foundation of the world whatever gift the lord gave to you to be a preacher to be a housewife to be a counselor to be a pro the one who prophesied to be whatever you do to be on the instrument the wisdom that our brothers and sisters have here the lord put in them they are all part of their attribute amen not everybody would love to be sitting at the computers somebody will have to be in the wild life someone will love to maybe play basketball not everybody we are not the lord didn't make us all the same amen but they can comfortably happily sit behind the instrument and do what they do over here over there amen to keep the system going so now let's look at esther esther was a masterpiece in the house of the lord before the foundation of the world but for esther to manifest her purpose on earth she needed she needed a contrast in other words a background and that background was brokenness it was actually death the lord took both parents the bible didn't say how old she was but they could probably she was very very young when the both parents died the bible didn't give her circumstances but both parents died and she became an orphan now let's read esther chapter two verse five to seven so now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was modikaya the son of jade the son of shima the son of kish a benjaminite who had been carried away from jerusalem jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jaconia king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away verse seven and he brought up hadassah is esther that is a hebrew name estha is i think the name that was given because the babylonians call it different so he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom modikaya when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter amen now look at esther she was born a beautiful lady fair to look upon you can your beauty can be a deception it can be an instrument of destruction it can also be a blessing in the house of the lord amen so let's see how esther used her beauty not not an instrument for the devil but for god to be a masterpiece in the house of god amen so we find out how esther started as a broken vessel and the lord transformed her with character with praise with fasting under the tutoring of her uncle which is her father sorry her cousin actually in bloodline but she became he became her father amen and what the child really said in the fear and admonition of the lord it's not had a choice esther could could have seen herself as a victim she could have even said that there's no god if there's a god how can that god take i mean take my parents away esther could have decided to do whatever she wanted to do but she humbled herself and gave her heart all out to the lord amen she didn't dwell on the past she didn't stay in the broken ashes in the broken vessel but she saw herself that lord you have a purpose for my life amen she yielded to the word of the lord in the in her father mordecai because maybe the parents wouldn't have raised the way she was supposed to be raised the parents would have spoiled her she could have become a sport daughter as pop rats but the lord wanted it to be something else amen so the lord made sure that the prince were out of her life so that she could be what he wanted her to be amen because esther was going to be a deliverer esther was going to be a kinsman esther was going to be a jesus christ esther was going to be a savior unto her people amen and power without character is what is satan power with character is what jesus christ amen glory hallelujah to the lord so now here we see esther being broken let's go to the next slide there was a redeemer needed now over the years the lord has been bringing the attribute that was already in esther through suffering through pain through prayers through obedience through things that maybe she didn't understand i don't think esther understood all her life maybe she never thought she was going to be as an immigrant a slave that was taken in captivity she was going to be the first lady or the queen of the land maybe that wasn't in her dream maybe her dream was just to be a happy girl you know happy daughter maybe get married and live a normal life but the great eterna has something way beyond her little dream life amen so there was a time that they needed a savior let's read esther chapter four verse seven to nine and monica told him of all that he had happened there was a time that you know heyman wanted to all the jews to be killed including even esther but then the lord turned things around so modikaya became the one that the brethren was upon her heart but then esther was a queen and she was living a good life but now there was a redemption a redeemer needed so let's see so monika told him and some of the money that he man had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the jews to destroy them so mordecai has actually put money in treasures treasuries that if they kill all the jews whoever will agree or will bring this to happen make it happen that all the jews are exterminated scratched out of existence that person will get maybe one trillion dollars who wouldn't go for that money if you have ever in your heart because people worship money the love of money didn't begin today the love for money began years ago right in the garden of feeding amen also he gave him a copy of the writing of the decree that was giving attrition to destroy them to show it to esther to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in onto the king and make supplication unto him and to make requests before him for her people and her touch came and told esther the worst of mordecai again esther speak unto her touch and give him commandment on to monaca now esther is listening sit in a white house so even to see esther it's not easy to see us that's where uncle went before the white house strip his clothes out that all your people are going to die and if you think you are the queen you are also an immigrant you're also a jewish so when it times it comes time for the jewish to be exterminated you're going to be one of them so you are the person of power you need to do something amen glory hallelujah let's go to the next slide essa chapter five one two three now esther has had fever before the king when the lord put you in a situation of blessing it's not for you to be selfish but it's for you to see what can i do to help mankind what i what can i do to help those beneath me those who don't have that power those who are less privileged many a time when human beings get power and money and resources they become selfish they build a wall around themselves it's me mine and myself they don't care about anybody else be it politicians be religious leaders that is what they want but if you have christ in your heart jesus christ he was the all in all he had millions or thousands of angels around him but he left that place of joy place of blessing place of throne of glory and took on mortar flesh to die that you and i will not perish amen that is the mind of christ and anyone that has got the man of christ you have the same mind amen you want to live for people eternal life is what living for others eternal life is not amassing all the world on the planet into your pocket into your bank and then see people suffering amen brotherly love is not when seeing your brother or your sister go poor when you can help them and you don't help them and even you case them that oh they are not hard working they are they are under case they are they are not they are not living their life that's why god is not blessing them not all the fingers are the same amen the lord make the this finger may be the tallest finger the lord made the thumb the thumb can touch all the all the other fingers i can leave it i don't want to dive it but i can go to the fivefold ministry amen the pastor is the thumb he can touch all the ministry the pastor is the prophet when they need to be a prophet he's a teacher i want he needs to be a teacher he's an evangelist he needs to be an evangelist he's an apostle when he needs to be an apostle amen maybe the evangelist cannot be a pastor he can just blast the word and causing us to stop i know an evangelist he speaks and people that are smoking weed on the spot they throw their weed away and come and i want to be in heaven he can cut you into pieces and then the pastor will take you and patch you up amen glory hallelujah to the lord so now back to esther now she has got favor with the king let's see how esther approached the blessing that the lord gave it to her esther five one two three now it came to pass on the third day three is what perfection esther put on her apparel now from brookiness she's the first lady the queen of the land and stood in and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and as i'm talking about the esta you put yourself in a statue amen who is the king king jesus we are not talking about the king of histories of some 50th century but we are talking about king of kings who lives in your heart amen and it was so very it was so that when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor and inside and the king held out held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hands so esther drew near and touched touched the the top of the scepter then said they came unto her what what will thou quen esta what is that request it shall even be given thee to the half of the kingdom amen what is the half of the kingdom the lord has given you a throne to rule the earth heaven is already for you amen that is your inheritance and the earth the lord has given you given it to you to rule over it what you see come to pass amen when you speak your word the way you speak is no what it's not the word of a man if you speak under inspiration your word begin to manifest you can sit here in west palm beach and you speak and things will happen in north carolina somebody might be sick in india in africa in asia in england in france and you just see a word of prayer where you are sitting in your closet and i had a testimony from brother solomon about a lady right who had gangrene and we prayed and the lord healed hey where's the lady located please pamby we didn't go to palm beach we didn't do surgery but prayers that we prayed was transformed supernaturally to heal the lady so she wanted to walk is that right now the word that you speak is life is here and amen and when you speak with the authority of christ in you it doesn't matter how long the word will walk in the dimensions it will pick more speed amen and it will bring to pass it will come to pass so esther has obtained favor before the king and now the king is that half of the kingdom i'll give it to you so let's go further let's go to the next slide esther chapter eight now esther has stepped into the position of a king's man's redeemer glory to the lord is er esther chapter eight verse one two four on that day on that on that day did the king and his sorrows gave the house of heaven to the jewish enemy unto esther the queen the enemy that wanted to kill esther and the people his house has been given to esther and mordecai came before the king for for esther had not told what he was for esther had not told what he was unto her in other words oh sorry for esther had told what he was unto her the king i think when he married esther probably he didn't even know esther was an immigrant esther was taken into captivity let's say he was brought to the united states when she was young he didn't have an accent so the king didn't know that he wasn't born in the united states he didn't know he came from somewhere in guatemala or somewhere in africa or somewhere in india or in asia but esther went later on up to let the king know that i'm a jewish i'm an immigrant and my uncle mordecai he's my uncle amen he was the one he's my father he's the one who raised me some people when they get their personal power they don't remember where they came from they don't remember their parents there's a saying in in in my country ghana he said when your parents raise you to to to develop your teeth help them to lose their teeth it means when your parents help you when when baby diapers they raise you up and now you've got to college you've got money you've got you can buy whatever car you want now your dad and your mom are suffering they can't even take out themselves and you bought lamborghini right you want all the jaguars that you want but you can't even buy a mercedes-benz if you won't buy mercedes-benz you can buy at least a ford for your dad and mom but your daddy wants to take the pass you only write letters to them that is the spirit of the world that is not the spirit of christ so if you're praying to help raise you up and the lord has blessed you remember them amen your parents your grandparents whoever touched was a part of your life do not be my be mindful of them amen glory is a blessing in yourself when you give back to those who help you amen so let's see and okay let's see and the king took okay let me continue from two and the king took off his rank which he had taken from hey man and gave it on to mordechai and esther set mordecai over the house of a man and esther speak here again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put out with a mischief of he-man the agar guide and his device that he had devised against the jews then the king held out the golden scepter toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king amen esther had to bow down how do we bow down your prayers your fasting when you speak to the lord on someone's behalf lord don't let them die heal them from their sickness save them from sin remove them of their unbelief forgive their sin take the wretchedness out of them transform them from their brokenness and make masterpieces out of them the lord hold this scepter to you amen you are mrs jesus christ you are the modern day esther amen and when you speak to the king the king cannot contain himself the king had begun to belg within him that i have to do something about this situation my wife esther has spoken and afterwards pay attention to what she's speaking i have to listen and i have to implement it i have to enforce it amen the holy ghost is the enforcer amen the holy ghost is the king and his sorrows of this day and will esther when you speak the holy ghost take your word and they send the enemies of the law that make it happen touch this lady touch esther's friend touch esther's uncle touch esther's father because i cannot be happy when my wife is not happy amen and the king will go into action the holy ghost will go into action glory hallelujah to the lord amen let's go let's go to the next slide i think i won't read that much from here but esther is still doing the kinsmen redeemer and now mordecai is in power and now he's in charge of the jews let's let him try to read the first verse then was the king's scribe called at the time in the third month three perfection that is the month of season which is our month called march jewish they call it sivan on three and the twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded onto the jews i think the jewish calendar is different they go strictly by their bible days they go by a 30-day calendar they don't have 31 days and 21 28 days and 29 days in february 30 30 30 30 30. that's that's their calendar and it was written according to all the modicals commanded on to the jews and to the lieutenant and deputies and rulers of their provinces which are from india onto ethiopia 120 and seven provinces onto every private province according to the writing thereof and on to every people after their language and to the jews according to their writing and according to their language and he wrote in the king in king aisora's name and sealed it onto the king's ring and sent letters by puss on horseback and riders on mules camels and young dominaries wearing the king granted the jews which were in the in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to sleep and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that will assault them both little ones and women and to take the spore of them for a pray amen when the lord gives you favor any spirit that will rise against you any spirit outright against your inheritance you've got the right to take arms and fight amen to possess to redeem your inheritance not a physical fight no but you fight supernaturally amen when the lord the enemy satan touches your children when it touches your grandchildren when it touches your church members when it touches your inheritance when it touches your health when it touches your finances when it touches your job when it touches you your peace you've got every right to pull weapons amen and defense your inheritance amen just like a man those who are i don't want to mention your name you know politicians right some of them are some of them support uh arms to the call is it a i forgot the section section one taco whatever five i forgot the amendment five fifth amendment right the right to possess arms and defend yourself am i right but what acquaintance second amendment thank you thank you so the second amendment authorizes you to keep arms bare arms and to protect yourself and your family and your property now the natural types of spiritual amen so you've got every right to take arms if you want to take if in america can buy whatever arms you want and to protect yourself that isn't natural but it's supernatural you don't have to possess ak-47 no you don't even need a pistol but you need a supernatural pistol you need a supernatural ak-47 you need a drone right this is the people don't fight the warfare is changing you carry drones you don't have to put a human being to destroy his life but just use a remote and send a drone to the enemy's camp and you take care of business for you amen prayer is way more than drone [Applause] your prayers is more than drone amen your prayer can do weird things than the dreams i know russia and ukraine they are fighting this heart battle and now ukrainians have they were timid in the beginning but now they've got modern weapons and they send drones into russia not just defend themselves but they send drugs into russia oil tanks and destroy their tanks and putin is now being taken aback he's wandering so when when the enemy always shout at you and you you are timid you have to shout you have to put the enemy back amen let the enemy know that no he can't put you down all the time he can't make you sad you can't take your children amen you've got the right to stand up because you've got the king power behind you king jesus that's behind you you are the esther of this day and you have to redeem your people you have to redeem the jewish people not in the natural jewish your sons and your daughters are god's hebrews amen hebrew means called out one amen and the lord has ordained you to his side so you've got every right by your prayer by your fasting by the word of the lord by your faith in your heart believing the impossibilities that what is for you the lord gave those inheritance to you your children came through you your grandkids came through you as a minister the church is your supernatural children and you are the you are what you are the overseer of the house of the lord and the enemy the wolf cannot take any one of your children you've got the power to claim them back to the house of the lord amen glory hallelujah let's go to the next slide now what comes after redemption or what what what do what is the end story of redemption redemption brings what joy light gladness peace and honor let's read essa chapter eight and monique verse 15 monica went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white blue signifies heaven eternity white stand for righteousness remember when we read ephesians chapter one that we've been called to be holy now the holiness is the righteousness of the lord how can you be holy you can't be holy on your own you have to be redeemed by the lord and the lord who put his holiness in you esther couldn't have done this on her own but the king gave her the scepter the authority the power the supreme power of the land that whatever esther sees you should be written in a book it must be implemented it became a law the west of esther is as good as the west of kinah soros and greater than esther is here amen you have way more than esther because the lord has revealed more to you than he revealed to esther esther used to they used to read uh the word of of data on a parchment pattern skin the skin of animal you know you are using area using uh ipads and computers and stuff like that amen not even the technology but i'm using that one to type the spiritual side of it the lord has revealed the seven-fold mysteries amen he has put in the 8-day eternity itself where the lord speaks to you face to face amen where the lord did with his wife amen that's why the lord has removed the seventh messenger the messengers have finished their work they have done what they were supposed to do they were the right hand of men from paul up to abraham they finished they did a good job excellent job now the lord himself wants to speak to his wife amen and you are missing jesus christ amen and he said uh verse 16 the jews had light gladness joy and honor and in every province and every city whosoever the king's commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day and many of the people of their land became jews for the fear of the jews fell upon them when they see christ in you they know that brother sullivan johnson has got something supernatural about him he's not just a photographer he says that johnson has got something about her even people that you deal with them they want to have a piece of you because they see something beyond that man they see something beyond a lady they see their christ in you amen and because they see what they call it a deep calling for the deep they say deep in you and it is a deep in them and they want to become the lord uses you to bring other seed from the ground into manifestation amen glory hallelujah to the lord let me read a little quote about how a man that we know as willie abraham his purpose started when he was just a little boy that's a my life story okay we have the coach here so i don't need to quote it verse 14 paragraph 49 well he said after i had after i had got up maybe 10 days old or something they took me up they're taking me up into a little baptist church called opposing kingdom or person kingdom baptist church that's quite a name there was an old circuit preacher the old fashioned baptist preacher came through there about every once every two weeks two months the people would have a little service together they would sing some songs but they had preaching every so often on the execute rider they paid him each year with a sack of pumpkins and a few things like that you know that the people would raise to give to give it and the old preacher came by and there he offered prayer for me as a little boy that was my first trip to church now i'm going to hold down on the on the parents amen now before any child can become who is meant to be parents have to invest time and resources in their lives let me read another quote and we hone it down let's go to the next slide uh lamp the lamp and the dove that light that you see on that picture was hanging over my cradle when i was born born on a little straw tick and a shark pillow my mother was 15 years old my dad was 18. five o'clock in the morning they didn't have a window in the house had a little door i don't know whether you see how many of you ever seen one of them little like supposed to be like a window but it's still a little door you open paragraph 98 and the angel of the lord angel of god at five o'clock in the morning april 6 1909 at five o'clock in the morning came right come right in and stood over that little bed where i was laying they didn't know my people before me were catholic and so there was no catholic churches up there so they're taking me over there to a lot of baptist church and then i made up my first visit to a church the baptist church is called opposing kingdom baptist church a person king of baptist church this that's where i made my first visit to a church and from when i was just about two years old the first machine come from that it's come on and on and on and i'm 50 and i'm 51 years old now see is the vision when he told me you were born for this for this purpose to pray for sick people amen you were born for this purpose to pray for sick people i said they wouldn't believe me he said as moses was given two signs you were given two signs he said one of them one of them just take the hand take the paper by the hand and don't don't use your thinking and it will be told what's wrong amen this is a man that was one for a purpose on earth to bring the greatest healing that's ever hit the earth one of his writings he said the lord did more than in my ministry in sinful city of jeffersonville more than a nazirite a city of prostitution and i was wondering when i was young in the message how can the bible say the things that jesus did even we can't write it if a body is an author how can this man say that the lord is something greater and then one day the lord opened the revelation to me that it wasn't he it was the lord who did that in your example amen there was this was a man who go to an auditorium park with thousands of people jam with people around he prayed and after prayers cancer people with breast cancer they would have to walk in cancer sometimes they have to take him he's like i've seen a photo where he was like a dead person himself all the human strength is almost gone and they carry him and his head at the back like a dead person but he had to find his purpose he has to accept the purpose god gave to him to be able to do that and so all of us have got purposes on earth you have to accept your calling and the purpose the lord brought you here on earth despite the predestination it was by choice and acceptance or rejection you can choose to reject your purpose on earth and die and go away without fulfilling your purpose or you can choose to face your purpose embrace it and accept it no matter the challenges that goes with it and the lord himself will make a way to fulfill our purpose amen glory hallelujah to the lord let's go to the next slide so i know you're gonna say so but a quick question into a baseball coach or something like that is he gonna coach us on baseball or football no i'm not going to you're going to spend about just about six hours just uh to quit your pace when go and practice on the field just kidding i don't even know the rules but i'll silence so don't be worried now we want to see how as parents you can invest time into your children and i got this picture of course from the internet but the story came from when i was living in a cold country very cold and i was living up hills so before the snow what i used to do is i go to the to the to the not a mountain but to bottom of the hill and run on top run and get the body acclimatized because if i'm in the house you can put on all the heaters you still full coat within you can put all the blankets and whatever all the jacket you still feel cold because their body is not acclimatized to it so i used to go out and run come back around and come back back and forth for their body to get used to it and that's what sometimes sportsmen do so i saw this lady she was a neighbor and five-year-old boy was around this is seven lemme see seven he said i'm going to take my son to play basketball i said what this snow i mean it's too cold for the little boy he said no he laughs you want to be a basketball player no sorry no basketball football or baseball one of them and he wants to practice so he's taking his son five year to seven-year-old boy to the field when me even an adult trying to get my body acclimatized i was still at home but she was taking a son to go and play baseball and the lord has a way of giving someone to preachers and i said wow look at the mother in the cold taking the little boy dressed up in his baseball clothes going to play baseball what about we sons and daughters of god what about the resources your your son your daughter is a resource god gave to you to raise if an earthly mother has enough view that son wanted to be a baseball player she had invested her time in the cold season when it was snowing to go and play baseball to practice baseball as a little boy to get him used to it how much were you an adult sorry another adult you a christian brother christian brother how much more time we need to invest in our children to raise them for the purpose god has given to them amen let them call my little friend say but joseph is he around can you come up here brother uh xavier and brazanda right let me get my my three wise men here please come up here line up here for me this is my friends i think a couple of weeks ago no no we month ago about two three months i think my job preached on that sunday and after after after service we were fellowshipping outside and i saw these three wise men sitting down and talking and they are my friends so but joseph was like seriously like somebody thinking of something i said brother joe what's going on what are you talking about what are you thinking he said well we're thinking about what you want to do when you grow up so wow that's interesting what do you want to do when you grow up he said i want to be a pastor and uh my church would be called is it holy spirit of barnacle great and i asked her alexander says and how about you said i want to be a pastor i said wow that's awesome then i came to my big brother brother xavier i said i want to be a deacon that's right so now but jesus said at the same time but uh brother troy and brad jack were talking very close he said what happened you want to be a deacon go see but a troll he's standing right there and i was wondering so god has something in this children's heart you can take your seat god bless you god has something in your heart the seed in them is talking now i'll call this time they are now called the state of angelic age they are the time of innocency and let me say roughly from birth up to let's say 12. i'm just using a crude example time is different children develop somebody can be six years old and they are way smart than even someone who is 12 years old they know what is good and bad but let me say the age of innocency is from zero to childbirth to let's say 12. they are innocent the devil cannot do much with them you know apart from telling not a lot of lies which children sometimes do but then when jumping let's say 13 14 15. now now things begin to change the angelic form of them they're going to dry out now they have to make choices now parents make choices for them parents i mean give them the dress the they have to they have to wait for services i think if brother jew am i right you've got your dress all lined up for you so mommy just give your dress why you choose your dress no puppy does it for you right would you choose your own clothes okay little preacher no so brother joe is a twister uncle but you know a certain age parents will do everything for you but they're going to get to age where they want to okay i'm 18. i've got my id i can drive i want to go and live on my own i want to go and live with my girlfriend my boyfriend now the english phone began to fade away now so now we need to invest something in the children that will help them when they get to their form amen we have to invest a lot of time t-i-m-e time seconds minutes hours days weeks month years into the children real investment just like if let's say football uh this um what they call it i forgot the term not the coaches the team those who recruit people into basketball what do you call them managers right recruiters right when they see a talent in you that you know how to play basketball they'll pay you millions from their high school or college basketball team now become a professional and now they invest in you they'll buy whatever you you need they will put huge amount your let's say 18 year old boy 1920 started playing basketball you started making millions is that in your account they're sitting there waiting for you so you invest you are happy you are motivated to put your life your soul into that basketball because that's going to be your career now we have to adults have to also put time and resources it doesn't have to be millions but time godly time prayers amen let me use babies for example babies almost in the same food that we eat but not in the same form you eat the same corn the same air uh what else rice and vegetables but now the babies or the children these have to be processed into a minute in a way they can take it the same starch the same wheat the same corn the same rice other greens or cereals but you have to make it work in a milk form cereal like right lactogen different version where you can add milk that the baby can easily take in but for you an adult you don't have to proceed to that form so now after the preacher speak the word of the lord you have to take the word that has been preached i said mother i said father when you go home break it in a way your son or your daughter can understand don't assume that they necessarily understood what was preached here [Music] their spirit man understand it yes you funny understand it but they on the human side their mind is not developed to the capacity where they can catch the revelation so the preaching can go here and go over there desperate money if they should die right now they have you finally understood let me see abram's daughter when abram's daughter died at a baby form when he went absolute father you have been preaching about heaven how did the little charon know about heaven because she had a few funny right so you have you found the that's why the bible said that a child of god the son of god will never get lost it's not possible let them mess themselves up because their names were written the lamb book of life isaiah 49 16 said you are in the palms of my hands the children can go as wayward as they want to go they are not lost but we are talking about their manifestation on earth achieving their purpose fulfilling their mission that the lord has ordained for them to fulfill so you have to pray with them not only praying for them but pray with them amen does amanda does something that i appreciate can i tell it i i i was i've been into their home i mean so many times and there was a couple times that i had to take care of the kids and before they go to sleep she'd go and stand each of them before before their room and pray for them that's outstanding before the kids will go to sleep pray for them and when the kids do something bad i like the way their punishment is you're going you're grounded and your grounding is good read your bible you go listen to messages wow i wish i was grounded when i was kid that way there's no punishment just go lie in bed comfortably and read bible that's awesome but that is what in a form to teach them that don't lie don't do this do the right thing so you have to soak the word of god into their heart just like moses mother did amen bombard them with the word like left and right so they'll have no choice but to hear the word of the lord amen you have to read for the scriptures for them you have to ask them questions that what did the preacher say let them tell you their version their little version of what they understand what was the same one today after going home ask your children what did you hear amen xavier what did you hear tell me what brother quaker said what did you get out of it they may not remember the scriptures they might not quote the scriptures but let them then you quicken their mind activate their spiritual mind they turn out you know way smarter than you think amen give them cell phones they can go to where pornography is the same mind if you turn it around with the word of the lord it will put them in a spiritual side amen if you just certain parents give their children let them do whatever they want they don't inspect their cell phones they're already going to point side doing things primary school trying because their minds are curious they want to lengthen around them but then if they get on their negative frequency the devil uses them on that way if they keep you keep them on their positive frequency jesus christ uses them in a positive frequency that's why ram said that the children are not if they are not too small too young for the devil to use them then they are not too young for that for the lord to use them amen if they are not too young for the for the devil to manipulate use them to tell lies then they are not too young for the for jesus christ to use them so you have to make them available to jesus christ don't just feed them don't just buy them nice clothes don't just take them to vacation side don't just take them to disney they're all good if you want to support your children even more they have this piece x where the space you can take your children to space if you want what's the name i think amazon guy what's his name what's the name what's his name jeff bezou and then uh this uh this guy what's the name elon musk thank you thank you you are so up to date elon musk they are running some space business if you have the millions to pay you can take you and your children can go to space 11 minutes 12 minutes or one hour you come back but that will not put jesus christ in them disney is good yes take them to disney but take them to supernatural disney like moses mother moses mother was always telling president of moses moses you are a deliverer moses had uh was the word haram of women around him all the beautiful egyptian women moses could have easily become a womanizer because he had them around them you could have become a drunkard you could drink whatever you want but their mother bombarded moses moses pharaoh is paying me to raise you but it's not fair it's god who's doing that remember you are not an egyptian regardless of being the grandson of pharaoh you are the next to the throne you were born a deliverer when you were born the pillar of fire under my own eyes came and hung around the window where you were born your dad and i saw the pill of fire you were born to be a prophet you are born to be a deliverer moses don't look at the things around you but listen to the scroll they didn't even have the screw they have jason because before music music was the one who brought the paper so they even have much to read but they have inspiration in their heart look at abraham he didn't have much in sunday school but you are privileged under the jacks ministry but a smallish ministry but a jerry bader brother troy and all the brother solomon all the ministers the sisters singing songs of zion the atmosphere that is created for you why on earth do you want to leave this atmosphere and go and dwell in a place where pigs dwell how on earth when your dad and your mom have invested in you and you turn around and your little high school friend your high school uh comrade body tells you that if you haven't have sex before you're gonna be a fool is the devil talking and you as a child you as a girl have to stand on your ground take your knife take your gun and fight because when you get to high school they're gonna tell you have you had sex before or you're a dumb you don't have sex you don't have a boyfriend i'm using plain language because i never fight with his birth finger so i'm fighting with my bare fingers so permit me to use those languages you're going to face those sins in high school your friends are going to pollute your mind and i said girl as a boy that i've been raised in church are you going to give your flesh to the devil or you are going to give your flight to jesus christ to use their choice is yours your father can raise your mother can raise you but they cannot put you in a in a box they're gonna keep you in the house all the time you're gonna face the world you're going to hear things in high school you're going to see things even the school programs you're going to situations that are ungodly but as a son as a daughter of god are you going to be like moses and esther who will stay on your grounds that the lord didn't teach me this my father and mother didn't teach me this i'm going to stay clean to the lord gives me my husband or my wife that is your choice amen and if you choose to go and try cocaine try marijuana try girls and boys you're gonna reap that one as well amen because whatever a man does you're gonna reap the result so if the lord by your grace by grace i give you a pastor the word of the lord sunday school you hear the word every day you can listen to bible programs you can listen to the tips you've got the word all around you parents invest your time to teaching the children bring them up in the field of the lord i remember in the old church i said this like every based on your time take one child it doesn't matter how many children you have don't take them the two of them take only one of them take them to the field somewhere out by themselves father and mother or mother or holy father and ask them what is your josiah what is your purpose what do you want to do on this earth abigail what is your purpose on in life observe you what do you want to do what is in your heart and then find out things that is coming from the heart just like my three wise men were telling me they want to be pastor they want to be dickies now you nature and nest that desire upon their heart you remind them because when they get to high school they might be forgotten that they wanted to be a pastor because they're going to hear another language not only from their friends but another language is going to speak from their body hormones and chemicals begin to speak through their body why am i going through this feeling but do their parents have to teach them that it's normal you're a human being you give it to the lord you need the holy ghost baptism to control that feeling you need the holy ghost baptism to go through your tongue you need the holy ghost baptism to keep you away to keep in certain diameter where the devil will not permeate into your life and it has to be you have to be done constantly talk to the children talk to them remind them of their vision i wanted to buy notebooks and bring it but i'll do it next time so that let the children tell you their dreams not dream of being engineered that is great no dream of being a pilot that is awesome no dream of being attacked and pharmacists and nurses that is great but i'm talking about their godly calling in their life just like like my little wise men want to be pastors and dickens i'll be happy if my son or my daughter tells me this that's the greatest thing even if he doesn't go to school if he doesn't get a high grade school sorry first grade education and your son or your daughter said that mom i want to be a woman of god that's the greater blessing and you the parents have to keep him in that path that son daughter you remember you taught this this is your book this your writing you said you want to be a woman of god you want to be like esther you want to be a deliverer you want to be an instrument in the hands of the lord you want to sing in church that is sick like david when demons were tormenting saul through the administration of songs and guitar and whatever david could drive those demons away from saul and saw her deliverance amen so because he allowed his life to be what to be an instrument of the lord jesus christ glory hallelujah to the lord we need to invest time just like mothers invest time into baseball to help them to make millions because the mother knows that when my son become a baseball player i'm going to have living mansions i'm not going to live in this small house i'm going to be living big machines i'm going to be popular i'm going to be traveling all over the u.s and the world with my son playing basketball i'm going to get the fans too you know so if a mother can put that time into a son into a daughter because i don't want to be a basketball player women women basketball this is the women basketball is going up higher mind is money business how much more we believe is why don't we put even three times the time into our children that the word of god they will have nothing but to be bombarded with octol i do succumb no matter how hard the devil will try to harden their heart their word will succumb them amen i want to share testimony let's go to the next slide i'll keep you long when you've done all you could do you've taught them their word you spend their time with them you've helped them to bring their vision out you've prayed for them you've fasted for them you've cried over them you pray wake up night mothers and fathers go lay your hands and pray for them because you're anointed remember by jack you said there was a time i was holy ghost for my daughters i remember that statement you are there holy ghost now they hear it but it's not registered here so you act as their holy ghost when they asleep go to their room kneel down lay hands upon them and pray and let the people of fire be on them without their sleeping in a gun pray over them not one day make it habitual no matter how tight you were in your work mother go lay hands on your daughter your son want to be a pastor you want to be a deacon lay hands on him on her pray for them and you see the fruits of what you are doing in the future but when you've done all you could do they have their choice you cannot force them to be you or to be what meant for them if they said well you told me all you told me but i just want to get go get a boyfriend go do drugs go smoke go drink you still love them you still believe god for them amen of course you're going to take certain actions but your hardest stuff for them and i'll give you a testimony of a young man when i was in texas i think around 2012 2014 a family in from brazil i used to pray with them and they told me one of the assistant son was doing drugs and these guys started doing drugs at the age of 14. that's when he started taking cocaine at age of 14 was taking cocaine and when our when we were praying for me was around 20 something and he has been in drugs for years so there was a time the doctors said that even their mother shouldn't come close to him because he manipulated their mother the mother was soft on him and get the money that he wanted he'd come up like one clean up and then get the money go back to the street go do drugs and he had diabetes which was affecting his body he was actually almost blind or partially blind so even the brazilian government was paying him you know blind people to get paid so he was getting salary from the government because of the blindness but he couldn't could still couldn't help himself still on his drugs on his tracks and we prayed for him the parent the family been praying just about this testimony is about i think shorter than three months not too long ago i went i went for a wedding in san antonio and the family i have their pictures if you want i'll shoot the pictures to you on my phone after the same one this young man god is real this human went to a dimension regions of the lost remember the story about abraham at the job i think 14 when he went to hell he screamed for his father he was a young boy father wasn't there mama mama wasn't there there was nobody calling on jesus he wasn't a religious person he didn't have a pastor but i didn't have a pasta at that time but this man his family his great grandpa sorry yeah great grandpa mother you see the message the pastor in in brazil is called pastor joaquin he just went to be with the lord august of last year and he received a message right after abram went to glory around 1967 so this man received a message and he spread the message in brazil his church was about three to five thousand people huge it's like a company and so he spread the message all around so this boy his family are coming from the message the word of the lord and his parents and aunties uncles they are all believers but he wanted his way with the drugs so he kept the drugs and when he went to that origin of the loss he said you did his testing when i have it in portuguese he came up he came from the from that region and called his brother younger brother i know his younger brother he came to san antonio to visit he's an engineer engineer in brazil he speaks english perfectly he said bro never dream of going to hell is real he said i was tormented and you mean understand torment torturing painful suffering he said people the place is horrible is that the thing that you don't want them to do for do to you they'll do today we're cutting my leg and he screamed crying and he said i want to see but pasadewa king it's a pastor your king is not here. and he was suffering he said what about abraham that's what abraham hears about braham is not here and was in torment torture but the only person that could save him is who the lord jesus christ because that i'll be with you even in you even when you are sinning and in hell because even if you go to hell is it isaiah chapter 45 verse one to seven even wherever you are he will be there amen even if you go to you make your bed in hell you are selling the pumps of his hands you can go to the bottom of hell do drugs do whatever you want to do put cocaine in your blood put in your brain if the seed of god is in you they see this in you amen you're gonna so find yourself in the palms of your sense so you went through this torment and came back and called his brother he's screaming and then there was a in the facility where he was five years he hadn't seen the mother the mother only sent money and things through his brother so there was a person there who was he's a long-distance anchor but they don't even want him to know because he'll manipulate anybody he can manipulate to get his way to get the money to get a drugs so he didn't know that there was an anchor who was working there as a policeman long-distance uncle and he checks on him so he told the anchor that i want to go and buy something in town can you give me a ride he said yes the uncle took him to town he said wait for me i want to buy something here the guy never one hour two hours three hours so he called the pr the mother that hey your son asked me to give me a ride and for three hours i've been waiting i can't find him maybe he's going to the streets and said no he's here he said and he said you want to go to church you know when you lie nobody takes your website nobody takes you because you manipulate people they come to a time when you are you are dying you are on the verge of dying people will think you are just trying to manipulate so he went home and told the auntie that take me to church right now and they felt like he's just like trying to have his own way because the world suspicious that he does things you know and they took him to church and he's going to church and i have a photo of him when the person was preaching he was making notes and bow he sat down and praying he promised the people that he wanted to he has already given his life to the lord you want to tell to make a youtube and give a testimony of what is going through hell so that people will stay away from from drugs so the family said they want to surprise him they bought a message all the messages in in portuguese and they want to give it to him as a gift because he's now listening to the message he can't wait to go to church with his grandmother his auntie's his mom now he's expressing true love all along that i would deceive him for the age of fourteen to the third is now thirty-something twenty-six something years or fourteen plus years the enemy has swept him under the carpet blindfolded him thinking drag the pleasures of light of drugs could satisfy his soul but he was lucky i was so lucky he was protested right so he went to that dimension of original they lost hell and made it back but maybe not everybody will make it back amen and so this day if the lord has given the opportunity to give your heart to the lord to consecrate your life now lord i will save you and you alone all the days of my life take a hold of me let not my peer friends my peers i mean entice me to the world entice me to distraction and you pray and give your heart to the lord the lord will take care of you let's be on our feet musicians you can make your way here [Applause] the lord is good amen a child of god will never get lost you did things that you pay for the price here on earth but you are always in the palms of god's hands amen and
