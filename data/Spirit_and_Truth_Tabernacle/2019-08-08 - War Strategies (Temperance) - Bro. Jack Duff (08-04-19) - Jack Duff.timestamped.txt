[51:21] and I start staring right there because
[51:23] there was a time we couldn't get a
[51:26] dollar so to have seventeen thousand I
[51:32] celebrate that right I celebrate that
[51:37] and if this is my two fish and my five

[51:45] know but my I can do with two fish and
[51:48] five loaves of bread he can feed a lot
[51:51] of folks right so I'm just I just think
[51:55] God for you all and you know
[51:57] as we are pressing our way to get a new
[52:00] building you know we came here you can
[52:03] get that brother Jimmy when we came here

[52:08] it could see the by 60 people the church
[52:14] could seat 60 and we could never have
[52:16] any meetings never right because of you
[52:20] know we just didn't have that that that
[52:22] much space you know y'all remember it
[52:23] you know if you was you know it was just
[52:26] yeah you you come out the pulpit right
[52:29] then you come and you standing right
[52:30] back at the pulpit in the plainest
[52:32] you know so just you know we had we we
[52:36] it was set up you know just for us when
[52:38] we got started Lord my mind going back
[52:41] that isn't I'm going back the system
[52:44] Michelle when she walked in here for the
[52:46] first time I remember system Michelle
[52:49] walking there than at first I mean we
[52:51] even had we wouldn't even have a church
[52:52] at that time we were working on it and
[52:55] sister Michelle walked in there and she
[52:57] talking to us sister cop so y'all got a
[52:59] church yeah we got a little building you
[53:02] know where's that I need to get some so
[53:04] she come and see come in she looked
[53:06] around at one time
[53:08] this is Michelle see I can see myself
[53:13] sitting right there y'all know what's
[53:16] Michelle been sitting here ever since
[53:18] that time praise Allah
[53:20] I remember them I mean man we don't have
[53:23] some precious moments y'all right God
[53:26] God been good man I remember I don't
[53:30] remember the exact year but I know we
[53:31] the first service was open on my
[53:34] daughter's birthday she just celebrated
[53:35] a birthday yesterday thank God for that
[53:37] but it was open on her birthday that's
[53:46] that's 17 years ago 17 years ago that
[53:50] that the church opened and I remember we
[53:52] were there for a roughly five or six
[53:54] years something like that and when we
[53:56] when we decided to come here we
[54:00] necessarily didn't have you know a
[54:03] hundred I mean we didn't have sixty
[54:05] people filling it up right well I think
[54:08] we might have had about forty when we
[54:10] came here
[54:10] and and we came here by faith I rent
[54:13] double when we came we had the same
[54:16] amount of people and I rent doubled
[54:18] right and and when the rent double you
[54:21] know we were we were you know not we
[54:25] were concerned yeah but you know I can
[54:27] see for the past 12 years God has not
[54:31] failed right God has not paid thank God
[54:41] been good to us but God been real good
[54:44] to us and you know and and and you know
[54:47] just just again when I just start going
[54:49] down memory lane to so many things just
[54:51] really speak to my heart you know and
[54:54] and and and and I'm under expectation
[54:57] that our situation will change we're

[55:52] a man we appreciate Joe my daughter Sara
[55:56] a man she would come and sing a song for
[55:59] us on today and you know I was just
[56:03] thinking to myself you know if I can go
[56:05] to Australian to a concert I can show
[56:09] Lee some song service right here in West
[56:11] Palm Beach and so I was I was kind of
[56:15] happy that things worked out the way
[56:17] that they did and I didn't know mom was
[56:19] gonna set me up this morning at the
[56:20] singing but but I think everything God
[56:25] just do you just work everything out
[56:27] right and see you know for me when we're
[56:29] not when I think about going to
[56:30] Australia I was telling the church and
[56:33] thank you brother Jerry
[56:35] he spoke last week at Pinnacle Palms he
[56:38] did a wonderful job a man there praise
[56:42] the Lord
[56:43] it was talking about a burn into the
[56:47] promise I believe so right born born
[56:52] born I got like oh my old man you
[56:54] looking
[56:55] I got doctors writing brother but born
[56:59] into the promise dinky but you know as
[57:01] he was preaching I was just thinking
[57:03] when we were out there pinnacle palms
[57:06] God watches over our faithfulness God
[57:10] remembers faithfulness and he rewards
[57:15] you for faithfulness
[57:17] if I can tell our young brothers young
[57:20] sisters one and when brother Misaka came
[57:22] here and preached that message about
[57:24] faithfulness that was a very important
[57:25] sermon right if there's anything that
[57:28] you you can learn as a young person
[57:31] learn to be faithful and let me tell you
[57:36] something you're not faithful to brother
[57:38] Jack that's just not about brother Jack
[57:41] this is about being faithful to the Lord
[57:44] Jesus he's the one that's done great
[57:46] things for you right you know they're
[57:48] just it's just a place where you can
[57:50] show faithfulness but this is not about
[57:52] doing it for brother Jack so sometimes
[57:54] we get them at my will brother Jack
[57:56] brother Jim no no no
[57:57] it's God that rewards my brother Jack
[57:59] right it's got that does it so I can if
[58:02] I can encourage you to do one thing in
[58:04] your life learn to be faithful faithful
[58:06] and you know what faithful faithful not
[58:09] just showing the church on Sunday it's
[58:12] not just doing that I mean it you as a
[58:14] Christian anytime a church to us open
[58:17] you want you should want to be there
[58:18] that's that's as a Christian anytime the
[58:20] church doors open but but one thing I
[58:22] would encourage you like like what we
[58:24] used to do we got a church 30 minutes
[58:28] ahead of time that was an actually 45
[58:31] minutes at a time because as brothers we
[58:33] were prayed over the sanctuary before
[58:35] the people came in we didn't just do
[58:38] that on meetings we did that every week
[58:41] right so if I could encourage you you'd
[58:43] be faithful I remember not having no
[58:46] degree and I'm taught all of us me my
[58:49] brother my cousin we just graduated high
[58:52] school sister Tina didn't have a little
[58:55] college degrees and then we went
[58:56] straight out the Pratt Whitney and got
[58:58] jobs and we had jobs that we could take
[59:00] care of my family's a man that because
[59:03] of faithfulness oh my God will bless you
[59:08] beyond measure because of faithfulness I
[59:12] remember brother Wescoe when he got his
[59:14] first house and brother Wescoe he was he
[59:17] used to live in an apartment and as a
[59:19] pastor like man we won't want to see
[59:21] pastor bless he had he had an apartment
[59:24] and he was just still Stanley serving
[59:27] and praising the Lord that part with
[59:28] Department him and sister Wesco and one
[59:30] day he invited said I want to come and
[59:32] see this blessing the Lord got me
[59:34] because I did a Martin circle thank you
[59:41] Jesus we were so happy about that house
[59:43] and I remember walking through the house
[59:45] table just I was I was at Meijer and
[59:47] everything and I said it's this come
[59:50] from faithfulness and brothers brother
[59:51] let's go say that struck his heart
[59:53] because he couldn't understand why he
[59:54] got the blessing but when they heard
[59:56] that faithful they should say this is
[59:58] what God gave it to me and God then did
[1:00:00] a double double on talk about being
[1:00:06] faithful I'm talking about I'm trying to
[1:00:10] get out and get my daughter feel he was
[1:00:13] in a position where they told him that
[1:00:15] he could not have the loan because it's
[1:00:17] his income fluctuated as a passive
[1:00:22] income fluctuates you never know when
[1:00:24] somebody gonna get mad at you and you
[1:00:29] gotta keep reaching and you realize
[1:00:32] something that a man God is your source
[1:00:36] everything else is resource all right
[1:00:39] but God is your source but I remember
[1:00:42] the let's go say they told him no he
[1:00:43] couldn't get that loss they said we
[1:00:45] tried we tried we can't get you this
[1:00:46] loan and brother wesco told the man on
[1:00:48] phone he said you keep doing what you do
[1:00:50] and I'm gonna keep doing what I do they
[1:00:52] say well what'd you do
[1:00:54] he say I pray so you keep doing what you
[1:00:58] do and I'm gonna do what I do and a man
[1:01:00] call back a few days later say sir we
[1:01:02] got the loan approve and he walked right
[1:01:03] on in and got their house
[1:01:07] live there faithfully ended up with two
[1:01:10] houses till he sold it sold one and he
[1:01:13] told you how to test them out a few
[1:01:14] weeks ago he got the other house and
[1:01:16] needed $29,000 to close Sarah Gavin I
[1:01:22] don't have it and I didn't hear the
[1:01:25] whole rest of the testimony but but I
[1:01:27] heard him say somebody blessed him when
[1:01:29] he walked in on closing day and somebody
[1:01:30] blessed him with 29,000
[1:01:36] let's see ugh is the if I was meaty I'll
[1:01:38] be honest I look for who the person that
[1:01:41] person went to another you want to get
[1:01:42] to know that man I'm gonna tell you who
[1:01:48] the person is you can get to know him

[1:08:55] much you can turn my mic down just a
[1:08:57] little bit add a little back here
[1:09:01] brother Jerry wanted me to mention that
[1:09:03] the wedding in November was open to the
[1:09:07] church there in Haiti and be the wedding
[1:09:12] will occur there in Haiti and he would
[1:09:15] just need just a number from how many
[1:09:19] people were planning to go there they'll
[1:09:21] give Hotel information so everybody
[1:09:23] would know what it would cost but if you
[1:09:27] you know desire to go what's the date
[1:09:28] again
[1:09:29] November November 16th hey man don't
[1:09:33] forget that date brother Jerry never
[1:09:35] forget that date after you're married
[1:09:41] don't forget that date man but uh so
[1:09:46] November 16th is a date of the wedding
[1:09:48] they're in Haiti and if you desire to go
[1:09:52] just please make sure a man he's
[1:09:55] notified or at least let us know
[1:09:57] something so that there won't be any
[1:09:59] surprises
[1:10:01] on that date November 16th amen
[1:10:04] in Haiti praise the Lord so let's let's
[1:10:08] turn a man in our Bible to 2nd Peter
[1:10:12] chapter 1 we've been reading this a man
[1:10:16] going through our journey here on war
[1:10:19] strategies and today we will focus on
[1:10:23] temperance a man war strategies
[1:10:26] temperance and when I was in Zimbabwe
[1:10:34] for brother simba sister ruse wedding
[1:10:41] one of the brothers was preached and I
[1:10:43] was behind him and he did a little
[1:10:44] something on his phone where he said a
[1:10:47] little timer
[1:10:48] on the phone that kind of so he'll know
[1:10:51] just you know how much time he was there
[1:10:55] in the pulpit so I've been trying to use
[1:10:57] that same little strategy so I don't
[1:10:59] keep y'all too long a man but y'all just
[1:11:02] bear with me I'm not gonna tell y'all
[1:11:05] for how long I said it but it's just a
[1:11:11] little something to kind of keep me on
[1:11:13] tasks and I feel like I can get my
[1:11:15] thoughts you know across a little bit
[1:11:16] better when I do that so just bear with
[1:11:19] me as I'm still kind of getting used to
[1:11:21] this technology but but here in in
[1:11:25] second Peter one has been our one of the
[1:11:31] theme scriptures and I got a couple of
[1:11:32] us that I want to read but here in
[1:11:35] second Peter 1 verse 3 says according as
[1:11:37] his divine power have given us given
[1:11:41] unto us all things that pertain them to
[1:11:43] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:11:44] of him that have called us to glory and
[1:11:47] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:11:50] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:11:51] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:11:55] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:11:57] corruption that is in the world through
[1:11:59] lust and beside this given all diligence
[1:12:02] add to your faith virtue and to virtue
[1:12:04] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[1:12:06] and this is the one we'll be focusing on
[1:12:08] today temperance it says and knowledge
[1:12:11] temperance and to temperance patience
[1:12:13] and to patience godliness and to
[1:12:15] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:12:17] brotherly kindness charity so if these
[1:12:19] things being you and abound they make
[1:12:21] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[1:12:24] unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord
[1:12:26] Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these
[1:12:30] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[1:12:33] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[1:12:35] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[1:12:37] brethren give all diligence to make your
[1:12:39] calling and election sure but if you do
[1:12:41] these things you shall never fall let me
[1:12:43] just slip back over to Ephesians chapter
[1:12:46] 4 this is also a one of the like core
[1:12:51] scriptures as we're going through this
[1:12:52] journey a man and war strategies just so
[1:12:56] that we kind of get where we're pulling
[1:12:58] all these things together Ephesians 4
[1:13:02] verse
[1:13:02] eleven a man says and he gave some
[1:13:06] apostles and some prophets and some
[1:13:11] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:13:13] teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:13:15] Saints this is the purpose for given
[1:13:18] ministry is to bring the Saints to a
[1:13:20] place of perfection all right for the
[1:13:22] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:13:24] the ministry
[1:13:25] that's the continued administrator Lord
[1:13:27] Jesus Christ for the edifying of the
[1:13:29] body of Christ and verse 13 says till we
[1:13:33] all come in the unity of the faith and
[1:13:36] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[1:13:39] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:13:42] stature of the fullness of Christ and
[1:13:45] this is our objective it's not just
[1:13:46] going to church but we're trying to be
[1:13:48] more like Jesus amen we want to be just
[1:13:51] like Jesus amen so the last verse that
[1:13:55] I'll read here is in 1st Samuel 23 a man
[1:13:58] first samuel 23 praise the Lord a man
[1:14:03] just bear with me here little reading
[1:14:06] and then we'll let you be seated
[1:14:08] afterward of prayer here in verse 1 says
[1:14:12] then they told David saying they'll hold
[1:14:15] the Philistines fight against Keela and
[1:14:18] they robbed the threshing floor so here
[1:14:20] the David is being told that the
[1:14:23] Philistines are robbing kealan robbing
[1:14:26] the threshing floors therefore David
[1:14:28] inquired of the Lord so he's praying
[1:14:31] about it a man saying shall I go and
[1:14:33] smite these Philistines and the Lord
[1:14:35] said unto David go and smite the
[1:14:38] Philistines and save Kela and David's
[1:14:41] name said unto Him behold we be afraid
[1:14:44] here in Judah how much more than if we
[1:14:46] come to Kela against the armies of the
[1:14:48] Philistines then David inquired of the
[1:14:51] Lord yet again the Lord answered again
[1:14:52] and said arise go down to Kela
[1:14:56] so he's prayed about it twice arise go
[1:14:58] down to Kela for our deliverer the
[1:15:00] Philistines into that hand
[1:15:02] so David and men went tequila and fought
[1:15:05] with the Philistines and brought away
[1:15:08] their cattle and smote them with a great
[1:15:10] slaughter so David saved the inhabitants
[1:15:12] of Keylong now watch this and it came to
[1:15:15] pass
[1:15:15] when a be a Abiathar the son of Himalaya
[1:15:19] fled - David - tequila that he came down
[1:15:22] with an e5 in his hand and it was told
[1:15:26] Saul that David was come tequila and
[1:15:28] Saul said God have to live it him into
[1:15:30] my hand so he is shut in by entering
[1:15:34] into a town that hath gates and bars and
[1:15:37] saw caught all the people together to
[1:15:40] war alright so here's a war a man
[1:15:43] getting ready to happen and it's all
[1:15:45] going against David alright
[1:15:47] and it was he says called all the people
[1:15:50] together into war to go down to Kela to
[1:15:52] besiege David and his men and David knew
[1:15:57] that Saul secretly practiced mischief
[1:15:59] against him and sent to abiathar the
[1:16:01] priest bring hither the ephod Oh mom
[1:16:05] then said David O Lord God of Israel thy
[1:16:08] servant have certainly heard that Saul
[1:16:11] seeketh to come to Kela to destroy the
[1:16:14] city for my sake will the men Aquila
[1:16:17] delivered me up into his hand will Saul
[1:16:19] come down as I serve and have heard Oh
[1:16:21] Lord God of Israel I beseech detailed
[1:16:24] our servant and the Lord said he will
[1:16:26] come down a man and look at this verse
[1:16:29] 12 then said David will the men of Kela
[1:16:32] deliver me and my man into the hand of
[1:16:35] Saul and the Lord said they will deliver
[1:16:38] thee up so we can see here in just 12
[1:16:41] passages a man or 12 verses of scripture
[1:16:44] here in this one chapter David has
[1:16:47] sought the Lord three or four times
[1:16:49] prayer was a critical component a man
[1:16:53] for David and and what he was doing here
[1:16:56] during this time so let's just remember
[1:16:59] that amen as we go into this thought
[1:17:01] today let's pray father we thank you for
[1:17:05] your the ability to read the Word of God
[1:17:08] thank you for the the inspiration and
[1:17:10] direction and instruction that we can
[1:17:13] get from the Word of God as we prepare
[1:17:15] to endeavor upon the thought Lord hear
[1:17:18] war strategies as we talk about
[1:17:19] temperance a man and becoming a man more
[1:17:23] like Christ we pray that the Holy Spirit
[1:17:25] would anchor these things into us
[1:17:29] that God we would we would take what we
[1:17:32] hear we would apply it it won't just be
[1:17:34] another sermon but Lord it'd be
[1:17:36] something that we can apply to to make
[1:17:37] us more like you change us into your
[1:17:40] very image with your work God is our
[1:17:42] desire and our prayer it's in Jesus name
[1:17:45] we pray amen amen you can be seated
[1:18:01] praise the Lord so as we just again look
[1:18:04] at war strategies we're talking about
[1:18:08] temperance today a man we will open up
[1:18:11] just by reading a quote here from the
[1:18:13] Statue of a perfect man the Prophet
[1:18:15] makes some statements here about
[1:18:17] temperance and it says fourthly fourthly
[1:18:20] and you know and when we talk about such
[1:18:22] of hurt man we're talking about this
[1:18:24] chart here to my very right a man where
[1:18:27] Peter says that faith and virtue and
[1:18:29] knowledge and temperance and patience
[1:18:31] godliness brotherly kindness and then
[1:18:33] love or charity we're there towards the
[1:18:36] middle where it says temperance all
[1:18:37] right and and so let's let's look at
[1:18:40] this as fourthly we'll have to hurry
[1:18:42] because I just feel so good to stand
[1:18:45] here and talk about it a man says you
[1:18:48] have fourthly thank you it says at
[1:18:50] temperance oh my we've come to
[1:18:53] temperance now you've had faith first I
[1:18:56] have to have that to begin with then you
[1:18:59] add virtue to your faith if it's the
[1:19:02] right kind of virtue then you add
[1:19:05] knowledge and as we were talking about
[1:19:06] last week you've got to be a knowledge
[1:19:08] that can realize that the scripture does
[1:19:10] not contradict itself a man and there's
[1:19:13] many scriptures there that we could go
[1:19:16] through but we chose other Branum
[1:19:18] counter pointing out the one on baptism
[1:19:19] so we brought that out last week but but
[1:19:21] understand scripture never contradicts
[1:19:24] itself you got to see it completing Amen
[1:19:26] itself rather than contradicting itself
[1:19:29] it says you add knowledge if it's the
[1:19:31] right kind of knowledge now you're going
[1:19:33] to add 10 primps it says temperance
[1:19:36] doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol amen
[1:19:41] now that's not what tempers mean now but
[1:19:43] when you when you're when you are
[1:19:45] sanctified I'm talking about before you
[1:19:48] even feel what the Holy Ghost
[1:19:49] sanctification should take those things
[1:19:51] away amen it should take lust away it
[1:19:54] should take alcohol away I should take
[1:19:56] smoking away saint of sanctified life
[1:20:00] does not do that hallelujah amen once a
[1:20:04] person reaches sanctification those
[1:20:05] things that go but the Holy Ghost kind
[1:20:07] of come to give you strength so you can
[1:20:09] keep living that life amen
[1:20:11] listen he said teres doesn't mean stop
[1:20:13] drinking out
[1:20:15] here either no no temperance doesn't
[1:20:18] mean alcoholic cure not in this case
[1:20:21] this is Bible temperance he says holy
[1:20:25] spirit temperance
[1:20:26] that's just one of the lusts of the
[1:20:28] flesh so drinking alcohol smoking him
[1:20:30] and all they say that's a lust of the
[1:20:32] flesh and you got to overcome lust of
[1:20:34] the eye lust of the flesh and the pride
[1:20:37] of life say he said that's just one of
[1:20:39] the lusts of the flesh but we're talking
[1:20:41] about Holy Spirit temperance that means
[1:20:44] how to control your tongue Oh glory to
[1:20:48] God
[1:20:48] a man salutare by adding temperance
[1:20:51] we're talking about a person being able
[1:20:53] to control their tongue how to control
[1:20:56] your tongue not be a Tattler alright now
[1:21:00] this is these are this is good
[1:21:02] definition that the Prophet has given us
[1:21:04] not be a tally you shouldn't be in
[1:21:06] everybody's business
[1:21:07] and man you know what temperance would
[1:21:10] say no I don't need to get involved with
[1:21:11] that tippers were saying I'll not
[1:21:14] because the devil can bring it to you
[1:21:16] and if you're looking for you're gonna
[1:21:18] find it but you gotta have chippers Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost temperance that is saying no I
[1:21:24] want to be a part of that Holy Ghost
[1:21:26] tippers will say don't say that amen
[1:21:30] because you might get you might you
[1:21:31] might uh you might be persuaded to say
[1:21:35] something at a certain time amen and you
[1:21:37] know exactly who to say it to but Holy
[1:21:39] Ghost embers say no don't say that the
[1:21:43] Holy Ghost ever said no keep your mouth
[1:21:44] closed on that hallelujah you got to
[1:21:47] everybody got to be able to experience
[1:21:48] that hallelujah alright alright a man a
[1:21:53] man you never want to be known as a
[1:21:55] person that tattles babbles and talks
[1:21:58] all the time you never want to be known
[1:22:00] that way temperance is what helps you
[1:22:02] curb that alright glue and look he say
[1:22:05] he say uh I said that's just one of the
[1:22:08] flesh we're talking about Holy Spirit

[1:23:41] man he says our sister had a feet wet
[1:23:46] when she got to the bottom all of us
[1:23:49] knows sister Shepherd to be charitable

[1:24:00] that her foundation part it says in
[1:24:02] here's now get this lesson say here's
[1:24:06] what's wrong eternal eternal Fitness
[1:24:09] here's what's wrong with the Branham
[1:24:11] tabernac you see there is two different
[1:24:13] kinds of faith he said there's two
[1:24:16] different kinds of virtue as I had it
[1:24:19] the other day two different kinds of
[1:24:21] knowledge two different kinds of
[1:24:24] temperance I love this hey man you know
[1:24:29] if lord help us to even just kind of
[1:24:31] bring that back out a little bit later
[1:24:32] on two different kinds of temperance he
[1:24:34] says one thinks it's prohibition they
[1:24:37] got that ain't the kind of temperance
[1:24:40] that God is talking about so
[1:24:42] you know trying to keep yourself from
[1:24:43] this and trying to keep it from that
[1:24:44] he'd say that ain't the tempers that God
[1:24:47] is talking about is that ungodly listen
[1:24:51] to these words that he used ungodly
[1:24:56] uncontrollable temper you got and things
[1:25:00] of that side fast back fuss so we talk
[1:25:06] about temperance is to notice the words
[1:25:08] you use on godly I got a quote up here
[1:25:12] that lets a temple a man come from Satan
[1:25:16] I don't know if I get a chance to read
[1:25:19] it all but tip I actually come from
[1:25:22] Satan it does not come from God so when
[1:25:25] you use an ungodly uncontrollable temper
[1:25:28] a man in a Christians house a wall
[1:25:31] should not be have a hole in it because
[1:25:35] somebody hit it now the Christians house
[1:25:40] I don't talk about Chris's house you got
[1:25:42] to repair the wall because you hit it
[1:25:45] hello somebody amen glory to God and
[1:25:49] then they just had something in the news
[1:25:50] just recently some guy got so upset he
[1:25:54] was in the dugout a man playing baseball
[1:25:56] something happened on the baseball field
[1:25:58] in and told the televisions up in the
[1:26:00] dugout right a temper I could not and
[1:26:04] when you see a man get that man you
[1:26:05] don't even want to be nowhere near him
[1:26:07] do you think the Holy Ghost want to be
[1:26:09] near when a person get like that hello
[1:26:12] somebody I know this good preaching
[1:26:14] anytime the church get that quiet it's
[1:26:17] got to be real good preacher
[1:26:18] the way we go somewhere October to tempo
[1:26:24] glory to God he color are currently
[1:26:27] uncontrollable come on somebody in in
[1:26:33] traffic what Jews get ready to do with
[1:26:36] that finger
[1:26:40] no you wouldn't I know you one thing
[1:26:42] about doing nothing with that finger
[1:26:44] you're gonna praise God's amen I know
[1:26:48] you were thinking about that ungodly
[1:26:52] uncontrollable and that came from the
[1:26:56] devil
[1:26:57] God didn't send that the devil sent
[1:27:00] there and we just flow right with it no
[1:27:02] no ungodly uncontrollable temper then
[1:27:06] when we say add tempera since what we
[1:27:07] got
[1:27:08] Lord when we see this thing rising
[1:27:09] that's that old nature eyes enough and
[1:27:12] like Lord we gotta we gotta crucify this
[1:27:13] fella
[1:27:14] Amen I don't need him to rise up no more
[1:27:16] I don't want nobody to see that and when
[1:27:18] you say when i'ma just go a little
[1:27:20] further with this thought on two
[1:27:21] different kinds of temperance you know
[1:27:24] because it's what we got one temperance
[1:27:26] when we're dealing with folk in the
[1:27:27] church then we got another temperance
[1:27:30] when we're dealing with people at the
[1:27:31] house hello somebody
[1:27:35] Amen I mean it's a different tempers we
[1:27:38] we can just put up with anything and
[1:27:40] everything with somebody to church but
[1:27:42] let it be a child or spouse or son we
[1:27:44] lose the temperance hello somebody two
[1:27:48] different kinds oh Jesus god help us
[1:27:53] here
[1:27:54] no don't y'all just stay with me long
[1:27:57] enough glory to God don't everybody get
[1:27:58] up and walk out it's a man stay with me
[1:28:01] today with war strategies we gonna give
[1:28:05] you something to overcome the devil all
[1:28:08] right let's just I'm starting to have
[1:28:09] you take that down so fast I'm going on
[1:28:11] in this a man a man he says patience and
[1:28:15] so forth there's a mockery of it pretend
[1:28:18] pretending to be a nature giving faith
[1:28:20] in nature giving virtue there's a nature
[1:28:22] giving temperance amen all these things
[1:28:25] are nature given and the biggest part of
[1:28:28] our faith is mental faith by hearing the
[1:28:31] word it brings us to a mental
[1:28:33] recognition of God but if this coming
[1:28:36] from above oh brother if it ever strikes
[1:28:38] this there is a godly spiritual faith
[1:28:41] then what does that thing do that faith
[1:28:44] recognize it's only the word no matter
[1:28:47] what anything else says it only
[1:28:49] recognizes the word because in a begin
[1:28:51] was the word and the word was with god
[1:28:52] and the word was god in the word is
[1:28:54] still god and the world was made flesh
[1:28:57] and dwelt among us and when the word
[1:28:59] itself is pouring into our faith our
[1:29:01] mental faith becomes a spiritual
[1:29:03] revelation listen and upon this
[1:29:06] foundation I build my church see not a
[1:29:09] part of mental conception of Church
[1:29:10] joining a mental conception of that but
[1:29:13] upon the revelation when the streams of
[1:29:15] grace has poured into that mental faith
[1:29:17] that you've got then upon this spiritual
[1:29:20] revelation I'll build my church and the
[1:29:23] gates of Hell can't prevail against that
[1:29:25] see that shows they would be against it
[1:29:28] but it will never prevail oh what a
[1:29:30] glorious thing now see faith these five
[1:29:33] streams and it goes on a little bit
[1:29:35] there some I want to go to just keep it
[1:29:37] just bear with me I want to just kind of
[1:29:38] set this this little foundation up even
[1:29:40] when it when he talked about he talked
[1:29:45] about he said a lot of us gonna fall off
[1:29:49] before we get started a lot of us gonna
[1:29:52] fall off before we get started I want to
[1:29:54] just kind of show you something about
[1:29:55] this temple now we hit this last week
[1:30:00] and I talked about Elijah right and how
[1:30:04] he'll I sure was calling for a minstrel
[1:30:06] hey man and I actually used minstrels
[1:30:09] last week but the Bible actually says
[1:30:10] minstrel he called for one amen but now
[1:30:13] brother Branham did come around another
[1:30:15] quote he says minstrels and he talked
[1:30:18] about how you know the minstrels have to
[1:30:19] kind of be together but he said buddy
[1:30:21] but in the scriptures minstrel men
[1:30:24] stroll alright he called for one
[1:30:26] minstrel one anointed person and and
[1:30:28] this statement here in the met and the
[1:30:30] message make the valley full of ditches
[1:30:31] let me just kind of read this and y'all
[1:30:34] just bear with me here I got a couple
[1:30:36] things I need to just share and we'll
[1:30:37] get we'll get to where we're going it
[1:30:39] says yes that this poor this poor fellow
[1:30:42] pour water on Elijah's hands yeah yeah
[1:30:47] he was he'd been in good company
[1:30:49] you said go go get him so they got on
[1:30:51] their charity and away they went and
[1:30:53] stood there before the prophet's house
[1:30:55] he come out and he looked at them kind
[1:30:58] of angry way man the Prophet looked at
[1:31:00] them kind of angry he looked all around
[1:31:02] he said wild I said
[1:31:04] jaebum why don't you go to your mother's
[1:31:06] profits back there to the idols of bail
[1:31:09] why don't you get down there to them and
[1:31:12] they said why don't you come to me he
[1:31:14] said if it wasn't that I respected the
[1:31:18] presence of Jehoshaphat I wouldn't even
[1:31:21] look at you now that's a man that's
[1:31:24] pretty upset I wouldn't even look at you
[1:31:26] right so so he says Connie got his
[1:31:29] dandruff up that preacher did you know
[1:31:32] they can do that say said I said I
[1:31:34] wouldn't even look at you but
[1:31:36] nevertheless bring me a mistress II got
[1:31:39] his temper all up so here this prophet
[1:31:41] Elijah is dealing with a temper it's -
[1:31:44] actually he had a pretty bad one Amen
[1:31:47] the prophet Elijah had a pretty bad word
[1:31:49] that when they begin to criticize his
[1:31:52] ballhead the little kids were gonna say
[1:31:55] go up bonehead go and when they begin to
[1:31:58] criticize his ball head he called for
[1:32:01] two she bears to come and destroy all
[1:32:03] these children oh my god his temper did
[1:32:06] that oh my brother branham said that
[1:32:09] when the Holy Ghost in him that one the
[1:32:11] Holy Ghost that his temper day that he
[1:32:13] saying say I got his temper she got his
[1:32:16] tip all up he had he had to get calmed
[1:32:18] down
[1:32:19] and what calmed his temper down was
[1:32:21] actually music anointed music you know
[1:32:25] people can Oh Lord can I just be honest
[1:32:28] with you you can be coming from the
[1:32:30] parking lot all your way to church them
[1:32:33] had an argument and the only thing
[1:32:35] that's gonna get you into the spirit of
[1:32:37] worship it's when somebody coming here
[1:32:39] and playing on it music otherwise you
[1:32:43] ain't got you you you might as well pick
[1:32:45] the devil has robbed you of one service
[1:32:47] when you allow that to happen
[1:32:49] praise the Lord glory to God the devil
[1:32:52] ride the church with you sometime amen I
[1:32:55] mean y'all could have talked about it
[1:32:57] no other time but that time huh but here
[1:33:00] here - devil bring that thing up and
[1:33:02] sometimes people thinking we're ain't
[1:33:04] ain't none but a simple conversation not
[1:33:07] knowing that the reaction was gonna be
[1:33:08] that way and the devil and got it got a
[1:33:11] 10 minute
[1:33:12] has destroyed everybody's immortan then
[1:33:15] you got to come here and get somebody
[1:33:17] with an anointed song that'll help your
[1:33:19] spirit get under control
[1:33:22] Elijah could not prophesy until he had
[1:33:26] good anointed music look at this now he
[1:33:30] says he says God he had to get calmed
[1:33:34] down now you people don't believe in
[1:33:35] music in the church what about that the
[1:33:37] minstrel begin to play in the spirit
[1:33:39] come on the prophecy if music helped
[1:33:41] bring the spirit on a prophet then it'll
[1:33:44] do the same thing tonight all right let
[1:33:47] me go on a little further now this is uh
[1:33:49] yeah I believe that you know what what
[1:33:52] controls the temperate temperance is
[1:33:54] actually when we're filled with the
[1:33:55] Spirit of God the spirit of God gives us
[1:33:58] a different spirit he said give you a
[1:33:59] new heart I'll give you a new spirit and
[1:34:01] then I'll put my spirit in the middle of
[1:34:03] that so God has to give you his spirit
[1:34:05] in order for you to be able to overcome
[1:34:06] your temperance and when you when you
[1:34:08] feel that thing rising up again that's
[1:34:10] when you got to go back in prayer we got
[1:34:12] to go back in prayer I got some quotes
[1:34:14] here brother Branham say to keep this
[1:34:16] thing if you want to overcome it you got
[1:34:18] to commit it in prayer amen glory to God
[1:34:21] not know great somebody nor to it oil no
[1:34:24] you committed in prayer you know that
[1:34:27] thing is in you so you're gonna have to
[1:34:29] commit it in prayer all right let's go
[1:34:31] on now this is a real good statement
[1:34:34] this is out of God's provided way and I
[1:34:36] had to read this from the reason I had
[1:34:38] to read this one is because the Prophet
[1:34:40] actually preached it right here in West
[1:34:42] Palm Beach so when I saw this I said
[1:34:44] Lord I got to read that so I guess this
[1:34:46] is God's provided way look at this he
[1:34:48] says now a righteous man I hope I can
[1:34:52] encourage y'all with this one a
[1:34:54] righteous man is not a sinless man so
[1:35:02] you know I went up what I'm trying to
[1:35:03] get to see someone's gonna make some
[1:35:05] mistakes but God in pushing us to the
[1:35:07] side because we blew our temple no way
[1:35:10] he wants you to do it just bring that
[1:35:11] temper back under control but a
[1:35:13] righteous man is not a sinless man
[1:35:16] listen he says for you notice that
[1:35:18] Elijah was a man subject to like
[1:35:21] passions as we are
[1:35:22] he had his ups and downs and he
[1:35:26] differences and the scripture of his
[1:35:29] life proves that he had ups and downs
[1:35:32] like we do and he had that he had his
[1:35:35] times of wandering and it's times that
[1:35:37] his temple got away from him I'll talk
[1:35:40] about the prophet Elijah he had times
[1:35:43] where his temple
[1:35:45] got away from him and he had a lot of
[1:35:47] things that went wrong but Oh glory but
[1:35:51] he was still a righteous man and I want
[1:35:54] to encourage you yet maybe sometime your
[1:35:57] temper has gotten I gotten away from you
[1:35:59] but you are still a righteous man and
[1:36:02] you are still a righteous woman
[1:36:06] hallelujah glory to God good thing kick
[1:36:11] you to the side because of that and then
[1:36:13] he actually just wants to chip that off
[1:36:14] of you listen but he was still a
[1:36:17] righteous man because he confessed his
[1:36:20] unworthiness and believed in God so
[1:36:23] that's what made him righteous we're not
[1:36:26] righteous within our own selves
[1:36:28] we're righteous through Jesus Christ I
[1:36:30] cannot be sanctified within myself I am
[1:36:34] sanctified through Jesus Christ who
[1:36:36] stands in the presence of God in my
[1:36:38] place it is that my holiness it is his
[1:36:42] holiness amen he says my holiness won't
[1:36:44] work at all but his does because God
[1:36:47] done accepted him and in accepting him
[1:36:50] he had to accept me oh praise God for
[1:36:53] that glory to God he had to accept me
[1:36:57] because I am in him amen
[1:37:00] that's what makes it real isn't it then
[1:37:02] we don't have to depend on ourselves no
[1:37:04] now that doesn't make us say we can see
[1:37:07] in brother if you see in you just away
[1:37:10] from God that's all there's only one
[1:37:12] thing to do is confess it and get right
[1:37:15] with God as long as you desire to sin
[1:37:18] the desire of sin still in your heart
[1:37:21] then it's time to stay down to the altar
[1:37:23] - that thing is taken out says now you
[1:37:25] will sin that's what the Prophet said
[1:37:27] now you will see him you're bound to sin
[1:37:31] because you just can't help it but not
[1:37:34] willful sin I noticed that it knows what
[1:37:36] he just said
[1:37:37] you will sing but not will
[1:37:39] sin will force it when you don't plan
[1:37:40] this thing how you don't plan it you
[1:37:44] know exactly what you was gonna do a man
[1:37:47] before you got it done
[1:37:48] hallelujah I know no snow folk you know
[1:37:51] needs to go to the confession booth and
[1:37:53] they they they axed for forgiveness for
[1:37:56] something before they did it they they
[1:37:59] paid for forgiveness God in looking at
[1:38:02] that type of stuff right God is not even
[1:38:04] accepting a prayer like that so it's not
[1:38:06] willful sin now you will make mistakes
[1:38:08] this is what he said you're gonna make
[1:38:10] mistakes sometimes your temper gonna get
[1:38:12] the best of you but remember you covered
[1:38:14] under his righteousness now that don't
[1:38:16] mean Amen to go out have just counted
[1:38:19] well I'm covered anyway so I might as
[1:38:20] well just let this one fly no you keep
[1:38:22] that one hello somebody hey man don't
[1:38:27] don't don't make grace of disgrace here
[1:38:31] that sense willfully after he received
[1:38:33] the knowledge of the truth there remains
[1:38:34] no more sacrifice for sin but every day
[1:38:36] you're bound to see my notice what he
[1:38:39] says in his next statement says you're
[1:38:40] bound to be backsliding constantly
[1:38:43] constantly so it takes a constant prayer
[1:38:47] to God that's why I was showing you how
[1:38:49] David in that 1 and 12 verses David
[1:38:53] prayed about full times in 12 verses
[1:38:56] every situation David prayed before he
[1:39:00] went down there to face the Philistines
[1:39:02] David prayed when he got down there in
[1:39:04] Keela now even here to rescue these
[1:39:07] people and then he hears that Saul is on
[1:39:10] the way to come in and have war with him
[1:39:12] and he had to pray that Lord where the
[1:39:14] people Aquila and I don't rescued them
[1:39:16] they should protect me but he said will
[1:39:19] the men of Keela deliver me into Saul's
[1:39:21] hands yes they are and then he goes they
[1:39:24] say now Lord oh it's all actually coming
[1:39:28] yes he is so so he constantly pray you
[1:39:31] gotta constantly pray in order to keep
[1:39:34] your temper under control
[1:39:37] hallelujah it takes a constant prayer to
[1:39:41] God listen Paul said I die daily listen
[1:39:47] and if Paul had to die daily how much
[1:39:50] more I'm going to
[1:39:53] man I'm gonna have to stay there and
[1:39:55] stay there dead all the time if Paul had
[1:39:58] to die daily to stay right with God and
[1:40:01] so we'll all have to do that just die
[1:40:04] out to ourself that's getting God's Way
[1:40:07] now there's only two ways of anything
[1:40:09] that's the right way in the wrong way
[1:40:11] and then ways are your ways and God's
[1:40:14] ways and you can't be in your way in
[1:40:16] God's Way at the same time you got to
[1:40:19] forget your own way to get in God's Way
[1:40:22] and you got to get out of your own way
[1:40:24] to get in God's Way for as long as
[1:40:26] you're in your own way you're out of his
[1:40:28] way listen so forsake your way forsake
[1:40:32] your thoughts forsake everything and
[1:40:35] just rely one thing on thus saith the
[1:40:37] Lord that's all then you know you're
[1:40:39] right now you know this temperance is
[1:40:40] it's something that you try it with all
[1:40:42] the time you can take that down you know
[1:40:44] you on your job you try it with it in
[1:40:46] school you try it with it I mean
[1:40:48] sometimes you can you can be in school
[1:40:50] at home you try it with it you can be in
[1:40:52] school and he say well you know I'm just
[1:40:53] I'm just having a hard time with this
[1:40:55] teach I'm gonna change classes in your
[1:40:57] chant classes and the next teacher you
[1:41:00] get actually works let me taste some if
[1:41:04] you if you if you go through a situation
[1:41:07] on your job hallelujah I know this
[1:41:09] happened to somebody recently you know
[1:41:11] they thought of real bad on one job said
[1:41:13] they got up and they left and they went
[1:41:14] to another job and actually got worse on
[1:41:17] the other job now I want to tell you
[1:41:18] some when you see that happening you're
[1:41:20] in your life that's because God is
[1:41:22] trying to perfect something in you and
[1:41:24] you can't run from it you can't run from
[1:41:27] it some time rather than complaining
[1:41:29] about it start thinking God for what's
[1:41:31] going on
[1:41:32] hallelujah you can't run from from one
[1:41:35] job to the next stop thinking things
[1:41:36] don't change you know why spirits don't
[1:41:38] die experience they will anoint somebody
[1:41:41] else and they'll come right against you
[1:41:43] again and you wonder where this came
[1:41:45] from it was God trying to do something
[1:41:48] in you spiritually this ain't got
[1:41:51] nothing to do with the people on the job
[1:41:52] he's got only it's got it's got it's got
[1:41:55] to do a one person that's in that
[1:41:57] building you
[1:42:00] God God only looking at one person in
[1:42:03] the building that's you so he allows
[1:42:05] these situations to occur in order to
[1:42:08] bring out his attributes in you you
[1:42:13] can't run from this as a Christian you
[1:42:16] can't run from this
[1:42:18] hallelujah Church so we gotta learn how
[1:42:20] to just praise God I told you last week
[1:42:22] put it in the bucket right I mean now
[1:42:26] it's one thing when God take you off the
[1:42:28] job you know when God has released you
[1:42:31] from a job amen
[1:42:32] sometimes sometimes we beat God to it
[1:42:35] and I just say now you're gonna take
[1:42:38] something somewhere if you don't want to
[1:42:41] take it there y'all y'all gonna hurt my
[1:42:43] story all the time I'll tell you about
[1:42:45] the man that had to carry a cross right
[1:42:48] and then he had a cross they say Lord
[1:42:50] this cross is just way too heavy I can't
[1:42:52] carry this thumb Oh God
[1:42:54] and he say it say it say okay you don't
[1:42:56] have to carry that one but you gotta at
[1:42:58] least carry one he said okay Lord he
[1:43:00] said I want you to bring that cross into
[1:43:02] this door and I want you to just lay it
[1:43:03] down in this room but you're gonna go
[1:43:05] through it another don't pick up another
[1:43:06] cross so he brought it in he later on
[1:43:08] said okay Lord praise the Lord and he
[1:43:10] went round through the other door and he
[1:43:11] said he looked at a big cross he said oh
[1:43:13] I don't know who got to carry that but I
[1:43:14] ain't touching that one they say that
[1:43:16] that's that just way too much scared
[1:43:18] there oh that ain't no way it kept

[1:43:24] over to get that I said man I got me a
[1:43:26] cross Lord I got me one I'm a carry at
[1:43:28] Lord the Lord said that's the same cross
[1:43:31] you just put down see God know exactly
[1:43:36] what he doing
[1:43:37] right Amen don't try to outsmart God but
[1:43:40] sometimes God is trying to perfect these
[1:43:42] virtues in us so don't run from your
[1:43:45] trials hallelujah this ain't got nothin
[1:43:48] to do it whatever they name is this got
[1:43:50] everything to do with God getting
[1:43:52] something better out of you hallelujah
[1:43:54] amen he have to use your job sometime to
[1:43:57] get it he have to use what happens in
[1:44:00] the house sometime to get it right he
[1:44:02] has to use things that happened in
[1:44:03] school to get it he has to use your
[1:44:06] surroundings to get these things out of
[1:44:08] you praise the Lord search see now
[1:44:12] brother branham just told us in that
[1:44:13] last
[1:44:14] that Paul had to dive daily and you know
[1:44:17] in the first quote that I read out of
[1:44:20] the statute of perfect may he say a lot
[1:44:23] of us gonna fall off before we get
[1:44:24] started also just read how Elijah Elijah
[1:44:27] they had problems with a temper you know
[1:44:29] you can I can go through scripture King
[1:44:32] Uzziah died a leper because of his
[1:44:37] temper King Uzziah died a leper because
[1:44:41] of his temper right brother branham said
[1:44:45] Moses had a temple he threw down the Ten
[1:44:48] Commandments right God just finished
[1:44:51] writing them with the with the finger of
[1:44:53] his hand gives them to Moses and Moses
[1:44:56] takes them and he sees the people
[1:44:57] dancing around an idol God and Moses
[1:45:00] takes the tablets throws them down on
[1:45:02] the ground his temper did that Holly a
[1:45:06] prophet with a bad temper look at this
[1:45:09] now that not only that Moses are thrown
[1:45:11] out of ten commandments but when God
[1:45:13] told Moses to speak to the rock Moses
[1:45:16] went and struck the rock twice brother
[1:45:18] Brennan say it was his temper that did
[1:45:21] that
[1:45:21] oh my god and and when we get from this
[1:45:26] because he lost his temper
[1:45:28] Moses missed the opportunity of going to
[1:45:31] the promised land
[1:45:32] oh I hope we'll stay with that one
[1:45:34] because he couldn't get control of that
[1:45:37] temper he missed the opportunity of
[1:45:40] going to the promised land
[1:45:41] don't let your temper keep you out of a
[1:45:43] rapture all right looking look at this
[1:45:48] Paul had a temper a man he sought to
[1:45:51] arrest and kill all the Christians but
[1:45:53] he was chosen of God even though he had
[1:45:57] this temper problem now now now now the
[1:45:59] other thing we found out about Paul's
[1:46:01] that after he was converted after he
[1:46:02] received the Holy Ghost you didn't see
[1:46:04] those problems anymore this is why the
[1:46:06] Holy Ghost is very important for for all
[1:46:08] of us believers we must receive the
[1:46:10] baptism Holy Ghost and when we get it we
[1:46:12] gotta constantly actually refills
[1:46:14] because we see these things coming up in
[1:46:15] us all the time I want to just kind of
[1:46:18] read this a man because give me
[1:46:21] questions and answers glory to God
[1:46:23] brother branham even confessed to having
[1:46:25] a temper
[1:46:26] he had he had it he had he had a really
[1:46:29] really bad temper
[1:46:30] look at this before he got the holy
[1:46:31] ghost watch this they want someone when
[1:46:34] someone says evil about you say
[1:46:36] something do it I want to say that again
[1:46:39] when someone says evil about you say
[1:46:42] something good if you can't say
[1:46:44] something good about them then don't say
[1:46:46] nothing that's a good one that's a real
[1:46:51] good one amen if you can't say something
[1:46:54] good about them then don't say nothing
[1:46:56] just let it go see and then when you get
[1:46:59] to yourself pray for them prayer is the
[1:47:02] key if there's one thing in my life
[1:47:07] that's helped me to understand that the
[1:47:10] Holy Spirit came in to me down there
[1:47:12] that day has been that I was hot-headed
[1:47:16] that means I got a temper
[1:47:17] fiery Irish on both sides and I always
[1:47:21] could never eat hardly at all my mouth
[1:47:24] was all mass where where somebody
[1:47:27] mastered jumping up where I shouldn't
[1:47:29] jump up I've got some some of my teeth

[1:47:41] said somebody said to me my teacher at
[1:47:43] school said lady I can't help it

[1:47:47] said I can't help it poor old mother

[1:51:39] skip down on a little bit this just put
[1:51:41] me at our paragraph 82 what what
[1:51:43] happened with this teacher Miss Temple
[1:51:45] she gave him the stream to counter so I
[1:51:47] said now anytime somebody hit you say I
[1:51:49] want you to toss nine knots time nine
[1:51:52] knots and and what that was to see Sara
[1:51:54] McGee some that helped control that

[1:52:06] and he took he took the string he tied
[1:52:08] the first night sitting through the
[1:52:09] string down and he started fighting all
[1:52:11] over again he said I can do this
[1:52:14] Amen in my own strength I can't I can't
[1:52:17] keep myself holy he don't need something
[1:52:21] stronger to keep up amen and if you can
[1:52:24] recognize that today Lord I can't do
[1:52:26] this in my own strength
[1:52:27] got on and tried and I keep failing over
[1:52:30] and over and over again I need more of
[1:52:32] you amen I need the baptism of the Holy
[1:52:36] Ghost
[1:52:37] praise God Church the Prophet came to
[1:52:43] that conclusion and this is what he says
[1:52:45] here in this paragraph he says he says
[1:52:51] actually go back up just one paragraph
[1:52:53] he says and I said I can never be a
[1:52:56] Christian
[1:52:57] keep it going sister and I said I could
[1:52:59] never write I get right there I could
[1:53:02] never be a Christian
[1:53:03] amen but let me tell you is that there
[1:53:06] go up just a little bit further okay I
[1:53:11] could never be a Christian he says but
[1:53:13] let me tell you that right down yonder
[1:53:16] on Ohio Avenue when the Holy Spirit came
[1:53:19] into me that settled the temple that was
[1:53:23] over I said I could never do it I could
[1:53:26] never be a Christian because I'd never
[1:53:27] get over that I said something that's
[1:53:29] born in me I said boy my daddy was
[1:53:32] hot-headed and my mother half Indian
[1:53:34] enough temper to find a bus song I said
[1:53:36] me boy anybody that jumps on me is gonna
[1:53:39] get it that's all I said if I have to
[1:53:41] climb up on a stepladder they hit them
[1:53:43] I said I'll sure do it this is pretty
[1:53:47] bad see he says but now you could drag
[1:53:51] me out there what some change but now
[1:53:55] you could drag me out there and wallow
[1:53:57] me and not see not me what am I trying
[1:54:02] to make a point here something happens
[1:54:04] that old power that old William Branham
[1:54:08] died and someone else come in and it
[1:54:11] makes me feel sorry for my enemy when
[1:54:14] anyone does anything wrong to me
[1:54:16] I never pray against them I pray for
[1:54:22] them that's where the Holy Spirit give
[1:54:26] that test the other night in New England
[1:54:27] before this happened out here when it
[1:54:30] gave when it gave power said just speak
[1:54:33] what you what you what you will tell
[1:54:35] them people the way he the way done and
[1:54:37] I figure down there I said I forgive you
[1:54:39] that's exactly what he wanted see
[1:54:41] forgive your enemy see there these are
[1:54:43] spirits that make you evil watch those
[1:54:45] spirits and what he's referring to is
[1:54:47] that church 190 preaching and these two
[1:54:49] young people come in a boyfriend and
[1:54:51] girlfriend they sit right on the front
[1:54:52] row and then just start kissing each
[1:54:54] other and brother and the Holy Spirit I
[1:54:57] warned brother Graham say I got it
[1:54:59] there's a trap set for you there's a
[1:55:00] test set a big test and he can
[1:55:02] understand what the test was and I say
[1:55:04] so he's sitting in the girl just boys
[1:55:06] are important girl just going out he
[1:55:07] said please stop it you in the house of
[1:55:09] God don't do that in the house of God
[1:55:10] and they just kept going got worse than
[1:55:13] where I said please stop you in the
[1:55:14] house of God and I'm no
[1:55:16] nobody could get this little couple to
[1:55:18] stop so finally the Holy Spirit say I
[1:55:20] put them in your hands what you're gonna
[1:55:21] do oh my god I want to tell you God
[1:55:26] God's saying the same thing in your
[1:55:28] situation whatever you facing right now
[1:55:29] there's some family it's been put in
[1:55:31] your hands what you're gonna do
[1:55:33] there's some friends that have been put
[1:55:35] in your hands what you're gonna do
[1:55:38] there's an old boss that has been put in
[1:55:41] your hands what you're gonna do so
[1:55:44] there's some co-workers been put in your
[1:55:46] hands what you're gonna do brother
[1:55:52] branham say the Holy Spirit say it said
[1:55:53] put him in your hands what you whatever
[1:55:55] you say it happened to him right now if
[1:55:56] you would have said you drop dead right
[1:55:59] now they would have dropped dead just
[1:56:01] like that but what he did when in
[1:56:03] resident rather than curse them he said
[1:56:06] I forgive you
[1:56:07] they say the Holy Spirit was pleased
[1:56:09] when he said I forgive you you know in
[1:56:12] order to forgive somebody they actually
[1:56:15] had to do something to you for you to
[1:56:20] Proctor for you to practice forgiveness
[1:56:22] somebody's gonna have to do something to
[1:56:25] you
[1:56:25] amen how you gonna test them out I
[1:56:27] forgive you ain't done nothing see you
[1:56:30] have to work through them emotions you
[1:56:33] have to work through them feelings you
[1:56:35] got to work through I mean that temper
[1:56:37] just kind of Rises and being able to
[1:56:38] kind of bring it back down it shows that
[1:56:40] a different person has come in the Holy
[1:56:43] Ghost is that person that has come in
[1:56:46] and made a change in your life whoa
[1:56:49] thank God for this a couple statements
[1:56:53] that the prophet mate and he was talking
[1:56:56] to his sister that was in a prayer line
[1:56:58] and and as she was coming through the
[1:57:01] prayer line he says you're awfully

[1:57:05] he says you got a lot of temper that
[1:57:07] causes that nervousness the latest
[1:57:11] temper was causing her to be nervous

[1:59:39] you know the Prophet was in a place
[1:59:41] where people could not tell his enemies
[1:59:43] from his friends because they treated
[1:59:45] everybody the same people know your
[1:59:47] enemies you just you just you know we
[1:59:51] all we freeze up we do all kind of crazy

[1:59:59] O some just changed yo your enemy the
[2:00:05] devil's your enemy your brothers and
[2:00:07] sisters not your enemy
[2:00:09] this sermon letting off the pressure I
[2:00:13] just want to read this oh I got just a
[2:00:15] couple things I just need to say it says
[2:00:18] but now he says even Christians is
[2:00:21] bothering them see see see some of them
[2:00:24] all pressured up and snap you off enough
[2:00:27] temple all built up like they're going
[2:00:29] to blow up what's the matter
[2:00:31] something wrong they shouldn't be temple
[2:00:34] comes from Satan everybody is under
[2:00:38] pressure though course I don't believe
[2:00:41] it believe it's this group here
[2:00:43] everybody's under pressure he says no
[2:00:46] but you you know these meetings are
[2:00:49] being taped so it'll go other places you
[2:00:51] see so I'll be I'll be speaking to that
[2:00:53] group that's under pressure now he's
[2:00:56] saying I don't believe it's a group that
[2:00:57] he's talking to he was in Wisconsin
[2:01:00] talking say I don't believe it's y'all
[2:01:01] but the meeting being tape is going
[2:01:02] somewhere now you know the Prophet know
[2:01:04] some people that group that had some
[2:01:06] temper problems but he also knew some
[2:01:08] people that wasn't in that group they
[2:01:10] had temper problems and they needed to
[2:01:12] hear this temper comes from Satan
[2:01:16] you know these meetings are being taped
[2:01:18] it'll go to other places see so I'll be
[2:01:21] speaking to that group that's under
[2:01:23] pressure but I thought you know that
[2:01:25] kind of bothers all groups pressure if
[2:01:27] Satan once can get you under pressure
[2:01:30] he's about got you whipped if Satan can
[2:01:37] get you under pressure
[2:01:38] he's about got you whipped you know you
[2:01:42] know you know when folks start smoking
[2:01:44] and drinking when they under pressure
[2:01:46] when I am the pressure that that's the
[2:01:49] first day they turn to is is a drink I
[2:01:52] smoke on it
[2:01:53] and God want you to turn to him rather
[2:01:57] putting that energy in a smoker drink
[2:01:59] put it in prayer right so he say Satan
[2:02:04] about gotcha whip that's right so much
[2:02:06] pressure people are doing things wrong
[2:02:08] and trying to hide from him well the
[2:02:11] only thing that does is build up more
[2:02:13] pressure it just builds up more pressure
[2:02:16] there's a question in questions and
[2:02:18] answers and this is the second quote on
[2:02:21] questions and answers I won't read the
[2:02:23] whole quote I'll just read just a
[2:02:25] portion of it here and then I'm gonna
[2:02:28] make a quick turn for you all this is a
[2:02:33] makes a statement somebody's accident
[2:02:35] question his brother branham when
[2:02:38] someone gets on me or steps on my toes
[2:02:41] this might be a good one says steps on
[2:02:43] my toes as the old saying is my temper
[2:02:46] rises how can I overcome this thing they
[2:02:50] said my temper rises how can I overcome
[2:02:52] this thing he says I know the Lord will
[2:02:55] have to do it but but what can I do in
[2:02:59] my heart I don't want this thing I want
[2:03:02] to anybody say I want this thing well I
[2:03:05] don't want this thing especially we come
[2:03:08] from the devil I don't want it this is
[2:03:11] his answer sweeten your temper with
[2:03:20] prayer
[2:03:24] it's a simple sweeten your temper with
[2:03:32] prayer I love that then make up your
[2:03:38] mind right after you sweeten with prayer
[2:03:40] make up your mind going back down that
[2:03:42] road no more
[2:03:42] now now now the reason I'm not gonna
[2:03:44] read the rest of that quote he's talking
[2:03:45] about them then boys are they almost
[2:03:47] shot and I just gave you all the story
[2:03:48] of that but now let me just go back
[2:03:50] because I read for you First Samuel 23
[2:03:54] sweeten your temper with prayer I also
[2:03:57] want to try to bring out two different
[2:03:59] kinds of tips I want to break I bring it
[2:04:00] bring it from a different angle
[2:04:02] because the proper talked about
[2:04:03] prohibition but then he also talked
[2:04:05] about the ungodly uncontrollable temper
[2:04:07] now let's go back to the scripture right
[2:04:10] because when we look at a war strategy
[2:04:13] David was about to go to war he had just
[2:04:17] finished a battle a man for Kela they
[2:04:20] that God told him he prayed about it and
[2:04:23] he went down and he helped the frit help
[2:04:25] the brothers down and Kela David is not
[2:04:27] the King David is just a man a man that
[2:04:31] has a reputation because he's defeated
[2:04:33] Goliath right
[2:04:35] so if David comes he defeated Goliath
[2:04:37] people got confidence that somehow David
[2:04:40] gonna get us out of this - so David
[2:04:42] prays before he goes down tequila right
[2:04:45] God gives him instruction go to Kela and
[2:04:48] no way I'm gonna deliver the deliver the
[2:04:50] people who deliver the Phyllis time
[2:04:51] since he has down in Kela oh my god has
[2:04:56] a victory amen Darren Keela and while
[2:04:59] he's there he gets wind or he gets word
[2:05:02] that Saul is on his way to Kela to try
[2:05:05] to come and battle Satan I mean compact
[2:05:07] battle David now now what the property
[2:05:09] tells say it's kind of strange that you
[2:05:12] know David is not the king but look at
[2:05:14] the pressure look at the stress that
[2:05:15] he's under he's fighting the Philistines
[2:05:17] on one side and then he's running from
[2:05:20] Saul on the other side
[2:05:22] but God has saw him in the midst of his
[2:05:24] trial say he gonna be the next king and
[2:05:27] his woman
[2:05:28] be the next king why am I going through
[2:05:30] what I'm going through
[2:05:31] let me tell you something you might be
[2:05:33] trying to figure that out right now Lord
[2:05:34] if I'm your child why am I going through
[2:05:37] the things that I'm going through it's
[2:05:39] because God is trying to bring some
[2:05:41] character out of you is a victory I mean
[2:05:50] you gotta overcome something to get
[2:05:52] character right you can you gotta go
[2:05:55] through a trial amen and actually amen
[2:05:58] defeat that trial in order to gain
[2:06:00] character see before before God was
[2:06:05] gotta allow David them to give it be
[2:06:06] king I mean he's already anointed king
[2:06:09] but before you can go and take on the
[2:06:10] throne this did some character issues
[2:06:12] got to be worked out and God is using
[2:06:15] these trials and what they was doing is
[2:06:16] it's his commitment to prayer and I
[2:06:19] found out that that Saul is coming he
[2:06:22] comes back in he grabs a the father
[2:06:25] begins to pray and say Lord what should
[2:06:26] I do it with Adel it will well it saw
[2:06:29] them to come yes will the men of Kela
[2:06:31] deliver me into his hands
[2:06:32] yes so David takes six six hundred men
[2:06:35] and they leave Kela solids already
[2:06:39] gathered the men for war right and they
[2:06:42] leave Kela and they just matter they're
[2:06:44] sleeping in caves their only run from
[2:06:46] Saul and he's like suddenly people have
[2:06:49] appreciated me for delivering them from
[2:06:52] the Philistines no they're gonna
[2:06:54] actually Amen let they're gonna let fall
[2:06:57] no because Saul killed people that don't
[2:06:59] tell him where David is Saul is a mean
[2:07:03] fellows you want to know somebody with a
[2:07:05] real temple problem so Saul would throw
[2:07:10] daggers at you so a man saw Saul gets
[2:07:14] upset with his own boy because this boy
[2:07:17] is a friend of David's right so let's
[2:07:20] all is a really rough fella my god and
[2:07:23] it's an evil spirit that trouble song do
[2:07:26] you realize that it was a and then all
[2:07:29] the way you could get so calm down y'all
[2:07:32] wit me this morning is he had to have
[2:07:35] anointed music you know his musician was
[2:07:42] this my sex army song got an orchard
[2:07:45] musician so new David was a big help to
[2:07:49] him able to play that heart in them
[2:07:51] spiritually calm down I know that music
[2:07:54] will always calm down a spirit trouble
[2:07:57] get going in your house put on some of
[2:08:00] northern music put on the Word of God
[2:08:02] you'll see that devil come right now
[2:08:05] I said no that music rap music won't do
[2:08:11] that
[2:08:11] country music won't do that rock'n'roll
[2:08:14] won't do that but anointed music will
[2:08:18] change the atmosphere in the house David
[2:08:24] is here since harpus but even while you
[2:08:27] planned solace throwing javelins at
[2:08:30] David you can be doing something good
[2:08:34] can I get can I just say that way you
[2:08:38] can be doing something good and they'll
[2:08:40] still be throwing javelins at you and
[2:08:43] you know what you cannot take the
[2:08:45] javelin out the wall and throw it back
[2:08:52] the only thing you can do is dodge the
[2:08:56] javelin and then thank God you didn't
[2:08:59] get hit Wow David has finished at Keela
[2:09:09] and he's running from Kela because he's
[2:09:13] been told by gods that Saul is on the
[2:09:16] way now if we were to pick him up in and
[2:09:19] in and in first 724 David is hiding in
[2:09:23] caves running from song and I mean just
[2:09:27] day by day trying to get away from song
[2:09:29] he knows Saul is coming and he's doing
[2:09:31] everything and one scripture says all
[2:09:33] just stopped stopped chasing because he
[2:09:34] knew that David wasn't in Keela but one
[2:09:36] day while David I mean my song got in
[2:09:38] order to go look for David again David
[2:09:41] is up in a cave in the dark and so it
[2:09:46] walks into the same cave
[2:09:48] tired weary chasing something that he
[2:09:53] should have been chasing and he lives in
[2:09:56] decay and he lays in the cave and and
[2:09:58] David and one of his warriors cease all
[2:10:00] in the case and it's warriors say oh oh
[2:10:03] oh the day you've been praying for God
[2:10:06] has delivered your enemy into your hands
[2:10:11] right here in this tape David take come
[2:10:14] on David this is it you'll never have to
[2:10:18] worry about this problem anymore you can
[2:10:20] take him out right in the cave this is
[2:10:22] first seventy twenty four nobody'll ever
[2:10:26] know but me and you David and David
[2:10:31] takes the Swart and he just cuts a
[2:10:35] little defeat a little piece of his
[2:10:37] garment off Saul's garment that was
[2:10:40] Temperance that was temperance consider
[2:10:45] you know sometimes your enemy gonna be
[2:10:47] right there and you can say something I
[2:10:48] mean you gonna you don't you're gonna be
[2:10:50] in a spot where you can you but you've
[2:10:52] been saving this for a long time and you
[2:10:54] can finally give it to him but
[2:11:00] temperance say everything no no no no
[2:11:08] just just just no no and David Davis
[2:11:10] today David got convicted from just
[2:11:14] cutting a piece of the garment he sack
[2:11:18] came touch the water knowing it I can't
[2:11:20] do it I just I mean no no no no I can't
[2:11:22] I can't do that you can't kill you can't
[2:11:24] kill the Lord's anointed oh my let me uh
[2:11:31] oh Jesus yeah you can't you can't do it
[2:11:34] so David David David huh
[2:11:35] they were just dead David just take a
[2:11:36] little piece of his garment and saw wake
[2:11:39] up from his sleep and he walks out the
[2:11:41] cave and when he walks out the cave when
[2:11:46] he walks out the cave
[2:11:48] David follows him and he and when he
[2:11:52] follows him out he follow it falls on
[2:11:55] his knees bowser's face to the ground
[2:11:58] say Oh King live forever
[2:12:01] you thought a man with temperance his
[2:12:04] enemy was right there in his hand and he
[2:12:07] let her go say and and then so turn
[2:12:09] around and say is that to David say yeah
[2:12:12] it's me and say you know you can see by
[2:12:15] just this little piece of garment that I
[2:12:16] got the Lord puts you in my hands but I
[2:12:18] just couldn't take your life Saul say oh
[2:12:23] you much wiser than I am David he said
[2:12:25] he said you know what David come on back
[2:12:28] home I'm not gonna I'm not gonna mess
[2:12:29] with you no more
[2:12:30] I'm not gonna mess with you no more
[2:12:32] David you know you're free that spirit
[2:12:36] came right back on and and I think Saul
[2:12:44] wanted to free David okay can I just put
[2:12:47] it this way there's some people that
[2:12:49] actually don't want to treat you the way
[2:12:50] they treating you they don't want to do
[2:12:56] it I was talking to my wife too just the
[2:12:58] other day I mean I've gone through some
[2:13:00] trials with some with some of my jobs
[2:13:02] and and you know hit me with
[2:13:05] brotherbrother whisper said that you
[2:13:07] know as vessels of mercy and vessels
[2:13:10] around some people are designed by God
[2:13:14] to do the things that they do and some
[2:13:17] time when they come in against you God
[2:13:18] had to create that person with that
[2:13:21] ability to be able to do that because
[2:13:23] the average person that knows you would
[2:13:26] never treat you that way
[2:13:28] they just won't treat you that way
[2:13:30] they love you too much but there's an
[2:13:33] anointing that comes from the devil
[2:13:35] that they fall underneath that anointed
[2:13:37] and they have to do what they just did
[2:13:41] that's in order to get things out of you
[2:13:44] that God no he put there before the
[2:13:46] foundation in the world
[2:13:48] here David had a chance inside the cave
[2:13:54] the kill saw but he didn't remember
[2:13:58] that's taking about two kinds of
[2:14:00] temperance because that was first a mere
[2:14:02] 24 first 70 25 David has the opportunity
[2:14:09] to get some food he's out here in the
[2:14:12] fields and you know he the me
[2:14:14] hungry he's hungry he's you know he and
[2:14:17] and he finds out about this guy by the
[2:14:19] name of knee ball having sheeps here in
[2:14:22] time which means it was a great
[2:14:24] celebration it was a lot of food gonna
[2:14:26] be happening around that time and David
[2:14:28] David said now I showed them in and they
[2:14:30] bought some kindness we protected them
[2:14:32] from the enemy so maybe not why he's in
[2:14:34] abundance he'll give us something David
[2:14:36] said his men down there maybe when I got
[2:14:38] to do with David he's just a fugitive
[2:14:42] running from Saul you know he's a
[2:14:44] disobedient you know who we think he is
[2:14:47] I got none for and they both went on
[2:14:49] about his business
[2:14:50] David I told you two kind of differences
[2:14:53] you know why because David had tempers
[2:14:56] for Saul
[2:14:56] but when he heard about naval doing them
[2:14:58] like this his temper is one there see
[2:15:02] that one say sometime you treat the
[2:15:04] people in the church one way but you
[2:15:06] treat your family something different
[2:15:08] that's two different types of temperance
[2:15:10] you want Holy Ghost
[2:15:12] temperance where everybody is treated
[2:15:14] the same the way God would want you to
[2:15:17] treat him nabe all David say get them in
[2:15:21] young y'all get ready we going down hit
[2:15:23] an Eightball house and I'm gonna cut off
[2:15:25] everybody every male in this house we
[2:15:27] cutting them off knee--balls wife got a
[2:15:30] hold over Abigail she she's caught David
[2:15:32] before he came and she brought him some
[2:15:34] food and see she was a very wise woman
[2:15:35] and she stopped him from from summons
[2:15:37] from slaying innocent blood but where
[2:15:41] was his temperance where was his
[2:15:43] temperance she had it with Saul but it
[2:15:46] didn't have a Whitney ball and you know
[2:15:48] what right after the First Samuel 25 you
[2:15:51] go to first timber 26 Saul comes after
[2:15:54] David again this time Saul is in the
[2:16:00] inner valley and David goes down and
[2:16:02] takes his his sword God sent a deep
[2:16:05] sleep on the on Saul and his army and
[2:16:08] David goes down takes his Wars run up to
[2:16:10] the top of the mountain and calls back
[2:16:11] out of Saul and says there who got you
[2:16:13] swore I got it see he was able to
[2:16:16] exercise and when he was down there in
[2:16:18] the valley he had another warrior with
[2:16:21] him and this warrior say no I love the
[2:16:23] way to script to put he's saying David
[2:16:25] permit
[2:16:28] two strikes all cuz see they knew David
[2:16:31] couldn't do it I mean you you too weak
[2:16:33] David
[2:16:34] permit me to strike so hallelujah
[2:16:39] sometimes sometimes you ever made it
[2:16:41] maybe you won't say something bad about
[2:16:43] a person but you allow somebody else to
[2:16:46] say that and you just kind of sit there
[2:16:47] and just as guilty you just this guilt
[2:16:57] is there so what you should do is when
[2:17:00] you hear something stop that right there
[2:17:03] don't don't say another word about it
[2:17:05] and another thing you should have you
[2:17:08] prayed about it cuz I told you prayer is
[2:17:12] a thing that helps you conquer this can
[2:17:15] we stop and pray pray foot no no can't
[2:17:17] we stop afraid
[2:17:18] yeah let's pray and you pray for the
[2:17:20] president and you praying for the king
[2:17:22] king got no king right is you praying
[2:17:24] for all these other people but you ain't
[2:17:26] pray for the person that you got a
[2:17:27] problem with so when you actually say
[2:17:30] let's stop and pray bouncing no no no no
[2:17:32] no no no no no it interrupts them in
[2:17:34] their prayer no I'm we praying for the
[2:17:38] person that you had a problem with the
[2:17:40] one you're just talking about that's
[2:17:42] what we praying for and pray pray
[2:17:44] something pray that God bless them pray
[2:17:47] that gotta open up doors for pretty
[2:17:49] gotta provide in ways that go beyond the
[2:17:52] expectations I mean I mean really
[2:17:54] playful see David had another
[2:18:03] opportunity here this man say you know
[2:18:04] if you permit me he said we cannot touch
[2:18:07] God's annoying I love David's response
[2:18:09] not only am I'm not gonna touch him but
[2:18:13] I'm not gonna let none of y'all that's
[2:18:15] with me touch him he said you can't kill
[2:18:18] him you can't kill him you're gonna let
[2:18:21] God take care of him how low he gonna be
[2:18:24] in our way we don't know until God get
[2:18:28] us to the place that he want us to be
[2:18:29] how long I got to stay on this job I
[2:18:31] don't know
[2:18:32] until God gets you to the place where
[2:18:34] you want what he needs you to be
[2:18:37] and actually he might be using your life
[2:18:39] on that job for somebody you quit if you
[2:18:44] want to you quit if you want to you know
[2:18:48] what happened they end up getting hired
[2:18:50] at the new place you just went to start
[2:18:53] working then you'll know that this is
[2:18:57] from God let me just read a couple of
[2:19:02] things for you this is out of the
[2:19:03] message God's preparation so you sweat
[2:19:06] me is sweeten your temper with prayer
[2:19:08] sweeten your temper with prayer and this
[2:19:10] message out of God's preparation says
[2:19:12] one man one time by the name of David
[2:19:15] who could have killed his enemy God led
[2:19:18] him right up to the enemy and the man
[2:19:21] that was searching for his life and even
[2:19:23] his general said God has delivered him
[2:19:26] into your hands take his life and he cut
[2:19:29] the piece off of his coat went back up
[2:19:32] said god forbid that I touched his
[2:19:33] anointed that's right so don't say
[2:19:37] nothing evil about Christians don't try
[2:19:42] to harm Christians because you'll reap
[2:19:46] what you sow every time touch not my
[2:19:49] anointed do my prophets no harm for it
[2:19:52] was far better for you that you'd have a
[2:19:55] millstone tied at your neck and drown in
[2:19:58] the depths of the sea than to fill my
[2:20:00] anointed is that right so don't say
[2:20:03] nothing about Christians maybe some of
[2:20:06] them don't live just right or do just
[2:20:08] right but that's God's child let the
[2:20:12] father take care of his own kiddies you
[2:20:15] know if we go to fright and one another
[2:20:18] God give us both a whipping maybe see so
[2:20:22] Jeff I mean so let's let's just leave
[2:20:24] the other fellow alone and do what
[2:20:26] pray for him try to love him and correct
[2:20:31] him and maybe God will help him prayer
[2:20:37] is the key to overcome in temper the
[2:20:41] Bible says add to your knowledge
[2:20:43] temperance amen temperance a very very
[2:20:47] key ingredient for Christians
[2:20:49] hallelujah let me finish this a man with
[2:20:54] a couple other statements we want to be
[2:20:57] like Jesus I got a couple scriptures
[2:20:59] that I want to read to you that will go
[2:21:02] back to statue of a perfect man
[2:21:04] paragraph 223 and then I got a couple
[2:21:08] scriptures that I would just want to
[2:21:09] read to you we want to be like Jesus as
[2:21:12] believers we need the have some we got
[2:21:14] to have temperance we got to have
[2:21:15] temperance Christianity should look
[2:21:18] different from the world Christianity
[2:21:21] looks so so much different from the
[2:21:23] world can I offer a word of advice some
[2:21:32] go wrong in your life everybody on
[2:21:36] Facebook don't need to know somebody do
[2:21:40] you wrong
[2:21:41] everybody on Instagram don't need to
[2:21:44] know right
[2:21:46] that's not actually what you're trying
[2:21:47] to do is defame the other person right
[2:21:50] so what you have a lot to do just kind
[2:21:51] of keep some things to yourself
[2:21:53] something you just you just can't let
[2:21:55] folks know because it's gonna make the
[2:21:57] other person look bad oh my I mean I
[2:22:00] just figured let me leave that alone I
[2:22:03] mean put focused posts anything and
[2:22:06] everything I mean they had they had to
[2:22:08] preachers going at it over Facebook and
[2:22:11] Instagram
[2:22:12] why preacher accuse another preach of
[2:22:15] doing something and then this preacher
[2:22:17] got to get back on it and say look I'm
[2:22:18] sorry I mean I didn't mean it that way
[2:22:21] and they going back and forth in the
[2:22:22] whole world got to hear this why can't
[2:22:25] they come to Bible say if your brother
[2:22:26] offend you when you supposed to go to
[2:22:29] your brother come on Matthew 18 but we
[2:22:34] don't practice that no more temperance
[2:22:39] this justice statement he says at these
[2:22:42] things that temperance to it Oh
[2:22:43] temperance how to answer in kindness
[2:22:46] when wrath is spoke to you somebody said
[2:22:49] you bunch of holy rollers down there
[2:22:50] don't jump out and roll up your sleeves
[2:22:55] I was gonna have to put down my
[2:22:57] Christianity I got the wonder did you
[2:23:00] ever have it
[2:23:03] because Christianity like that we don't
[2:23:05] put it down and pick it up and no no no
[2:23:08] no we keep it up all the time right I
[2:23:11] don't know just about roll up your
[2:23:13] sleeves now say this and see not not
[2:23:14] that but talk with godly love oh my
[2:23:18] temperance kindness is that's the way
[2:23:21] you want to be when you when you round
[2:23:23] upon round not back
[2:23:25] let him Christ let him be your example
[2:23:29] he says when they said if thou be the
[2:23:31] Son of God turn these stones into bread
[2:23:33] he could have done it in show he was God
[2:23:36] but he had temperance when they called
[2:23:39] him Beelzebub he said I'll forgive you
[2:23:41] for it that's right they pull handfuls
[2:23:45] of his beard out of his face and spit in
[2:23:47] his face and said come down off the
[2:23:48] cross he said Father forgive them they
[2:23:52] they don't even know what they're doing
[2:23:53] now now you know I I know that there's
[2:23:55] some people there with their with their
[2:23:56] now you know you supposed to be able to
[2:23:58] forgive me no no no I realized that but
[2:24:01] now now now you supposed to not do that
[2:24:03] to make me forgive you so you have some
[2:24:07] wisdom - now amen glory
[2:24:10] since when he had the gift he knowed all
[2:24:12] things for in him was the fullness of
[2:24:15] the Godhead bodily they had seen him
[2:24:17] perform miracles by telling people what
[2:24:18] was wrong with them and so forth like
[2:24:20] that they put a rag around his head like
[2:24:22] that around his eyes and he and hit him
[2:24:25] on the head with a stick and said
[2:24:26] prophesy tell us who hit you will
[2:24:28] believe you will believe you see he had
[2:24:31] temperance now if you got it like that
[2:24:34] add it to your faith cuz I couldn't if
[2:24:37] somebody would put up a put a rag around
[2:24:39] my head and hit me in the head and say
[2:24:41] probably especially I had the ability to
[2:24:43] tell you who hit me how to point you out
[2:24:44] real quick and not only you hit me and I
[2:24:48] want God to get you right
[2:24:50] temperance won't do that temper just
[2:24:52] okay Lord deal out this trial to happen
[2:24:54] I accept it now if you got it like that
[2:24:58] if you gotta like to add it to your face
[2:25:00] if you still blow up and sass and fuss
[2:25:03] and stew and carry on uh-huh you ain't
[2:25:06] got it you ain't you came at that cuz it
[2:25:09] won't have C it won't vulcanized you
[2:25:11] couldn't take a piece of rubber you know
[2:25:12] and vulcanizer
[2:25:14] a piece of iron it just won't work no
[2:25:16] it's got to be flexible
[2:25:18] just like the rubber see and and when
[2:25:20] your faith and your temperance becomes
[2:25:22] the same kind of Holy Ghost temperance
[2:25:24] that he had Christ had then it will
[2:25:27] vocalize with him you're added to it
[2:25:28] when your virtue is like his virtue then
[2:25:31] it'll add to it let me just give you a
[2:25:32] couple scriptures as we bring this to a
[2:25:34] close Isaiah 53 and 7 we want to be like
[2:25:39] Jesus this is our whole focus we don't
[2:25:42] go to church just to go to church a man
[2:25:45] we're trying to be more like Jesus
[2:25:47] Christianity should bring us more a man
[2:25:50] like Christ hallelujah here these
[2:25:52] scriptures in isaiah 53:7 he was
[2:25:55] oppressed and he was afflicted and look
[2:25:59] at this yet he opened not his mouth he
[2:26:03] is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[2:26:04] and as a sheep before Shearer's is dumb
[2:26:07] so he openeth not his mouth there some
[2:26:10] things we're gonna go through and we
[2:26:11] can't open our mouth a man mark 14 verse
[2:26:15] 60 through 63 mark 14 verse 60 through
[2:26:19] 63 it says and the high priest stood up
[2:26:24] in the midst and asked Jesus saying
[2:26:26] answerest thou nothing what is what what
[2:26:30] is it which these witnesses which these
[2:26:32] witness against thee but he held its
[2:26:35] peace and answered nothing again the
[2:26:38] high priest asked him and said to him
[2:26:40] art thou the Christ the Son of the
[2:26:42] Blessed and Jesus said I am and he
[2:26:45] should see the Son of man sitting on the
[2:26:46] right hand of power and coming in the
[2:26:48] clouds of heaven then the high priest
[2:26:49] rent his clothes and said what need we
[2:26:53] any further witnesses here was standing
[2:26:55] before them on his way to cross to be
[2:26:58] crucified he answered nothing a man you
[2:27:01] know what some of the things we're going
[2:27:02] through in life it's a crucifixion to us

[2:30:01] well I know I mean I mean I need to know
[2:30:03] what I'm praying about well you want I
[2:30:06] don't want praying for me then it's
[2:30:13] temperance cuz you don't know you don't
[2:30:14] know how to hold stuff
[2:30:16] hey man and let me tell you another
[2:30:19] thing everybody don't need to know about
[2:30:21] what you're going through
[2:30:22] don't put all your trials out there
[2:30:25] everybody don't need to know that hey
[2:30:27] man let them hear the testimony after
[2:30:29] God bringing you through hey man but why
[2:30:31] are you going through they don't need to
[2:30:32] know about it because here's what
[2:30:34] happens if if you telling everybody what
[2:30:37] you're going through
[2:30:38] then they gonna look at you say now if I
[2:30:40] tell you what I'm going through then
[2:30:42] you're gonna tell everybody else what
[2:30:43] I'm going through
[2:30:45] alright if you tell about what you're
[2:30:47] going through then you'll also tell
[2:30:49] about what I'm going through and then
[2:30:51] what you do is you put yourself in a
[2:30:52] situation where nobody want to say
[2:30:54] nothing
[2:30:55] temperance knows how to hold things no
[2:31:00] no they don't need to know that no
[2:31:02] that's okay sometime I own the only
[2:31:04] person he didn't know is the pastor
[2:31:06] that's the only person that need to know
[2:31:08] don't don't let everybody know your
[2:31:10] business prays a lot alright I'm
[2:31:15] bringing it home for what glory is it if
[2:31:21] Wendy Buffett it for your faults you
[2:31:25] shall take it patiently now you don't
[2:31:27] did something to get in trouble right
[2:31:30] you can't say well god no no you you
[2:31:33] caused the problem and you actually got
[2:31:35] to deliver you from it no you go you'll
[2:31:37] make that thing right right
[2:31:38] but here the scriptures say well what
[2:31:40] glory is that when you be buffeted I
[2:31:42] mean that's struck repeatedly Amen for
[2:31:44] your false you shall take it patiently
[2:31:46] but if when you do well and suffer for
[2:31:52] it
[2:31:53] you take it patiently this is acceptable
[2:31:57] with God for even hero to where you call
[2:32:02] what that mean I'm gonna go through some
[2:32:05] things and I may have to take it
[2:32:06] patiently so here even here are two
[2:32:09] where you call because Christ also
[2:32:11] suffered for us leaving us an example
[2:32:13] that ye shall follow his steps if you're
[2:32:18] gonna call yourself a Christian you got
[2:32:20] to follow Christ who did no sin neither
[2:32:25] was guile found in his mouth who when he
[2:32:28] was reviled reviled not again when he
[2:32:32] suffered when he suffered look at this
[2:32:35] look at this look at this look at this
[2:32:36] when he suffered he threatened not
[2:32:40] Christians can I talk about Christians
[2:32:43] oh what'd you say no had me go get my
[2:32:46] piece what are you talking about how you
[2:32:57] using language like that as a Christian
[2:33:00] the Bible say the Bible say when he was
[2:33:03] reviled reviled not again when he
[2:33:05] suffered he threatened not he threatened
[2:33:13] not but committed himself to him that
[2:33:16] judgeth judgeth righteously now you know
[2:33:20] what that mean I'm gonna commit this
[2:33:21] whole thing to you God what they did to
[2:33:24] me was wrong and how they handled this
[2:33:26] was wrong but you the one that judge
[2:33:28] righteously you know what I did god I'm
[2:33:30] gonna commit it to you I've tried it
[2:33:33] I've tried to go to people when I
[2:33:34] thought I was being wronged I went I
[2:33:37] went one time to a boss and I think you
[2:33:39] know man I just wish I had the
[2:33:40] opportunity just to sit down and talk to
[2:33:41] you you know just to tell you you know a
[2:33:44] few things breakfast brought that but I
[2:33:46] went and when I when I offered I said
[2:33:48] could you just you know let me have a
[2:33:50] meeting with you and man were not
[2:33:51] putting me on his schedule and I
[2:33:54] realized that they were working together
[2:33:56] one time I you know I had a situation
[2:33:59] and I went through them you know they
[2:34:01] tell you on the job if you have a
[2:34:02] dispute then you go through this process
[2:34:04] and you raise it up to this level
[2:34:05] your reason 11 you you know something
[2:34:07] I'm doing every time right now I'm a
[2:34:09] doctor
[2:34:09] and when I get to the levels and the
[2:34:11] Gauchos look they say and I had never
[2:34:14] seen this man treat me that way all the
[2:34:16] time you talking to me so nicely in the
[2:34:18] hall and how you doing today Jack and I
[2:34:20] this and they were like Walden's office
[2:34:22] how you know they did that how you know
[2:34:24] that what you're trying to say now why
[2:34:26] are you talking to me like this then I
[2:34:28] realize they all in cahoots together so
[2:34:32] I got to commit myself not to the
[2:34:35] process that the job got I gotta commit
[2:34:43] this to the one that judges righteously
[2:34:51] who his own self bare our sins in his
[2:34:55] own body on the tree that we being dead
[2:35:00] to sins should live unto righteousness
[2:35:02] by whose stripes you were healed we're
[2:35:07] talking about temperance cuz the Bible
[2:35:09] said add to your knowledge temperance
[2:35:12] and this is the type of temperance that
[2:35:15] God is looking for from us as it brings
[2:35:17] us to the stature of a perfect man
[2:35:19] perfect woman and Christ he told us in
[2:35:24] his word be perfect as I am perfect amen
[2:35:29] let's pray father God did these are
[2:35:37] challenges the word challenges us where
[2:35:40] we are as Christians what we want to be
[2:35:45] like you we want to live like you we
[2:35:48] want to express in our lives the way
[2:35:51] that you would explain it you did
[2:35:52] express why you here on earth you gave
[2:35:55] us an example it's not easy it's not
[2:35:58] easy to live this kind of life it's not
[2:36:01] it's very difficult but that's what
[2:36:03] Christianity is all about we stand out
[2:36:05] because of the lives that we live god
[2:36:08] help it not just to be words that go in
[2:36:12] one ear and out the other but Lord let
[2:36:13] it be something that really registers in
[2:36:15] our in our in our souls let it be
[2:36:18] something that changes
[2:36:19] from the inside we know what you're
[2:36:22] calling for we know what you're asking
[2:36:24] for help us Lord to do that areas where
[2:36:29] we fall short and and and certainly in
[2:36:32] what we can be righteous we could be the
[2:36:35] righteous people Lord because of your
[2:36:37] righteousness but realize that we fall
[2:36:38] short in some of these areas help us for
[2:36:40] it to commit these things in prayer
[2:36:42] that's how we overcome sweeten our
[2:36:45] spirits with prayer
[2:36:49] what advice we could receive from your
[2:36:52] prophet if we want to overcome these
[2:36:54] things Lord we must follow this advice
[2:36:58] bless us God bless us Lord to do what
[2:37:02] you have asked us to do how we need you
[2:37:07] God Jesus name we pray amen amen
[2:37:22] tell you the the Lord certainly has a
[2:37:27] way of just dealing with us right where
[2:37:29] we are he knows exactly what we need and
[2:37:32] when we need it
[2:37:34] and I pray that I pray that this this
[2:37:40] word that he's given us would be
[2:37:41] something that would help change us
[2:37:43] there was a statement
[2:37:48] the Prophet said let the spirit of God
[2:37:50] coming to me condemning me now of all my
[2:37:52] sins and frustrations all my bad habits
[2:37:55] and high tempers and fusses and fights
[2:37:58] and stews and everything I've had and I
[2:38:00] know something that my spirit isn't
[2:38:02] mellow for heaven I love this statement
[2:38:04] my spirit is it mellow for heaven it
[2:38:07] says make me mellow Lord we're not
[2:38:11] taking these bad tempers and stuff like
[2:38:12] that to heaven it won't be there we got
[2:38:15] to get rid of it right here you commit
[2:38:18] it to the Lord in prayer and he'll take
[2:38:22] care of it it'll take care of it
