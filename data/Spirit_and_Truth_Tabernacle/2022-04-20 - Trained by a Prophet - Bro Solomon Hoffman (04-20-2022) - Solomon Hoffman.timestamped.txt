[14:37] i mean you love the lord tonight
[14:39] and i wonder just before we would look
[14:41] to the word of god if we could bow our
[14:43] heads and
[14:44] have a word of prayer and maybe if you
[14:46] have a need upon your heart if you want
[14:47] to lift your hand and make it known to
[14:49] him
[14:50] amen the scripture said that he sent his
[14:52] word and healed them
[14:54] and delivered them from their
[14:55] destructions and so we believe that by
[14:57] the power of the word
[14:58] that your needs can be met tonight so
[15:00] let's just ask him to bless us tonight
[15:02] and just to let his presence be active
[15:04] in the service lord we come before your
[15:06] throne of grace and mercy
[15:08] here tonight lord realizing that we're
[15:10] not just coming before anyone but lord
[15:13] we're coming before the very king of
[15:14] kings and the lord of lords and lord we
[15:17] we don't take it a lot thing to be in
[15:19] your presence but lord we take it one of
[15:21] the greatest honors that we have on this
[15:23] side of eternity to gather and assemble
[15:25] ourselves together lord and to be in
[15:27] your august presence father and we're
[15:29] just asking lord tonight for a special
[15:31] grace and a special mercy lord may your

[15:39] holy spirit would just be

[15:43] tonight lord if there be any spirit that
[15:45] would try to hinder the moving of the
[15:47] holy ghost we want to drive it out in
[15:49] the name of jesus christ and lord we
[15:51] declare victory over this service we
[15:53] declare that god will have his way in
[15:55] the service tonight and we want to put
[15:57] the devil on notice tonight lord that
[15:59] we're not giving him any inch of ground
[16:01] we're not giving him our service but
[16:03] we're here to let you have your way
[16:04] tonight lord i pray that you'd be lord
[16:07] not just a spectator but may you be a
[16:09] participator lord in the service may
[16:12] every word be anointed by the spirit of
[16:14] god lord and may you meet each and every
[16:16] need according to your riches and glory

[16:22] honor we love you and we thank you we
[16:24] ask for your help now lord in jesus name
[16:26] we humbly pray and the church said
[16:30] amen and amen god we should bless you
[16:32] tonight if you have your bibles we'll go
[16:34] straight to the scripture we'll be
[16:35] reading out of the book of first
[16:37] kings the 19th chapter
[16:39] i would like to say it's certainly an
[16:40] honor and privilege to be here with you
[16:42] and
[16:43] to be here with your midweek service i
[16:45] tell you about went crazy just being
[16:47] here and not a whole lot to do until
[16:49] wednesday night and
[16:50] so uh
[16:51] i know we got a time limit but we got a
[16:53] lot of things on our heart and so you
[16:55] just pull you pull fast we'll preach
[16:57] fast and we'll go home fast
[16:59] i mean many preachers say that and they
[17:01] they lie about it but i'm not gonna try
[17:03] and lie
[17:05] amen we sure love and appreciate you and
[17:07] we just say god bless you
[17:09] the book of first corinthians the 19th
[17:10] chapter we'll begin reading at the 15th
[17:12] verse
[17:14] the bible would say in the lord said
[17:16] unto him go return
[17:18] on thy way to the wilderness of damascus
[17:21] and when thou comest anoint
[17:23] hazel to be king over syria and jehu the
[17:26] son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be
[17:28] king over israel and elisha the son of
[17:30] shafat of abel mahala shalt thou anoint
[17:34] to be prophet in thy room and it shall
[17:36] come to pass that him that escapeth the
[17:38] sword of hazel shall jesus slay and him
[17:42] that escaped her from the sword of jesus
[17:44] so elijah's lay and yet i have seven yet
[17:47] i have left me seven thousand in israel
[17:50] all the knees which have not bowed unto
[17:51] baal and every mouth which hath not
[17:54] kissed them so he departed this and
[17:55] found elisha a son of shafat who was
[17:58] plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before
[18:00] him
[18:01] and he that half the twelfth and elijah
[18:03] passed by him and cast his mantle upon
[18:05] him
[18:06] and he left the ox and i want you to
[18:07] notice the scripture
[18:09] after that elijah laid the mantle upon
[18:11] elisha notice what it did he left the
[18:14] oxen and ran after elijah and said let
[18:17] me i pray thee kiss my father and my
[18:19] mother and then i will follow thee and
[18:22] he said unto him go back again for what
[18:25] have i done to thee
[18:26] and he returned back from him and took a
[18:28] yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled
[18:31] their flesh with the instruments of the
[18:32] oxen and gave them to the people and
[18:34] they did eat and then he arose and went
[18:37] after elijah and ministered unto him we
[18:40] pray that god will bless the reading of
[18:41] his word
[18:42] as you can be seated just for a few
[18:43] minutes tonight and by the help of god i
[18:45] want to speak to you on the subject of
[18:47] being trained by the prophet
[18:50] amen being trained by the prophet the
[18:52] scripture
[18:54] i'm the book of first corinthians the
[18:55] 11th chapter uh the first verse paul was
[18:58] speaking here under inspiration of the
[19:00] holy ghost would say these words he said
[19:02] be ye followers of me even as i also am
[19:05] of christ and if you were to look at
[19:07] that scripture in an intellectual
[19:09] standpoint you would say my paul is
[19:11] wanting us to emulate the things that
[19:13] he's doing and to do the things that
[19:15] paul does but but paul is not
[19:17] necessarily saying follow me and my
[19:19] humanity but he's saying you follow me
[19:22] as i follow after god now and we're not
[19:24] here to follow the exact life of paul
[19:26] and because he he was there persecuting
[19:28] the christians was he not and so we're
[19:30] not here to follow after the letter of
[19:32] what paul did but but paul is saying in
[19:35] the scripture be you followers of me
[19:37] even as i also am of christ and the book
[19:40] of daniel the second chapter the 21st
[19:42] verse daniel would say some words here
[19:43] that's a
[19:44] very good instruction he would say now
[19:47] and he changeth the times and the
[19:48] seasons he removeth kings and setteth up
[19:51] kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[19:53] knowledge to them that no understanding
[19:56] so
[19:57] daniel here in the bible is saying that
[19:59] it's god that raises up our leaders and
[20:01] us god that removes our leaders this god
[20:03] that raises up our kings and us god that
[20:05] removes our kings and and looking at
[20:08] this thought here i've always found it
[20:10] amazing how that god god will get a man
[20:12] in his hands and he'll raise him up and
[20:14] use him for an example is that right
[20:17] amen now god has always used the
[20:19] instrumentality of man we don't
[20:20] understand it many times but god he
[20:23] wanted to use man to be a leader to be a
[20:25] guider god has used the instrumentality
[20:28] of a man
[20:30] amen and god amen many of us we could
[20:32] think back in our lives that god would
[20:34] raise somebody to a certain level and
[20:36] they would be like a mentor to us or a
[20:38] guide to us and and daniel here is
[20:40] saying god he puts these men in these
[20:42] positions to be a leader to mentor us
[20:45] and our walk with god and that and
[20:47] that's what amen that's what paul is
[20:49] saying in corinthians be followers of me
[20:51] so so we find that god will use an
[20:53] individual sometimes amen to lead and to
[20:56] guide you amen to a certain place and
[20:59] the message investments the prophet of
[21:01] god would say it like this he says now
[21:03] god he uses an individual now two men
[21:06] will never see the same thing alike so
[21:08] god can only get one person in his hand
[21:11] and then through here like moses and
[21:13] through daniel and through the different
[21:15] prophets so we see that god will use an
[21:17] individual to lead and to guide his
[21:20] children amen for time saying my you
[21:22] could go through many places in the
[21:23] scripture the prophet moses prophet
[21:26] joshua many different prophets uh we
[21:28] could get into this but for time's sake
[21:30] we won't but i want you to see that god
[21:32] will use a man to be a mentor and to be
[21:36] a leader and to be a guider amen and
[21:38] never put that away from your mind that
[21:40] god isn't using somebody to lead you and
[21:43] to guide you but it's actually the the
[21:45] inspiration of the holy spirit that will
[21:47] use a man to lead you and god you know
[21:50] i'll say it like this if it's god doing
[21:52] it he'll always lead you back to the
[21:54] word amen if it's god doing the leading
[21:56] he'll lead you back to the word and
[21:59] and looking at this thought here tonight
[22:00] on being trained by the prophet i uh
[22:02] there's just so much inspiration here
[22:04] when you look at the life of elisha and
[22:07] i just to build a foundation in this i
[22:09] like what happened amen when elijah went
[22:12] to elisha and he laid his mantle upon
[22:14] him the bible says he returned back from
[22:16] him took a yoke of oxen and slew them
[22:19] boiled their flesh with the instruments
[22:21] of the oxen and gave them to the people
[22:23] and they didn't eat that scripture as i
[22:25] studied these things began to jump out
[22:27] at me i thought my why did elisha do
[22:30] what he did after elijah laid that
[22:32] mantle upon him and amen further study
[22:35] and basically what had happened amen as
[22:37] that mantle got laid upon elisha and he
[22:39] realized he realized his new call now
[22:42] brother branham would get in a certain
[22:44] area in this amen he would preach on i
[22:46] believe a reaction to reaction or action
[22:48] to reaction and things upon that and he
[22:50] said see amen even in the wise man when
[22:53] it came down to jesus what they did
[22:55] showed what christ meant to them amen
[22:57] the gifts even the gifts that they gave
[22:59] to christ showed what christ meant to
[23:01] them amen they gave the gold the
[23:03] frankincense to myrrh and it showed what
[23:05] it meant and amen that's exactly what's
[23:07] happening with elisha as he's getting
[23:09] ready to be taught and mentored by amen
[23:12] elijah's the prophet's ministry amen i
[23:16] just love what he did amen he went he
[23:18] took his livelihood and then he killed
[23:20] the oxen killed the instruments of the
[23:22] oxen amen that for the longest time
[23:24] elisha had his own way of thinking
[23:26] elisha did what he wanted to do did he
[23:29] not amon elisha lived after what he
[23:32] wanted to do amen after his own desire
[23:35] but a time would come that he would
[23:36] encounter the prophet of god
[23:39] amen and the mantle would be laid upon
[23:41] elisha and then he had to choose what am
[23:44] i going to do am i going to leave the am

[23:48] leave my farm life and follow after the
[23:51] prophet or will i not amen i love what

[24:31] prophet's ministry brother amen not just

[24:54] somebody that's sold out to this message

[25:15] church attendance tell us what you think

[25:19] looking at a class of people brother
[25:21] that we have given our everything to
[25:23] we've given our all to it but we have
[25:25] sold out lock stock and barrel
[25:28] amen and we have crucified our formal
[25:31] thank you we have crucified our ideas we
[25:34] have crucified what we wanted to do and
[25:36] we have said god we're going to follow
[25:39] the prophet's ministry and where he goes
[25:42] with the word is where we will go with
[25:45] the word
[25:46] hallelujah
[25:49] if he takes us to serpent seed we're
[25:50] going there if he takes us to the
[25:53] godhead we're going there
[25:55] under the prophet's ministry is what
[25:57] we're being trained under
[26:00] hallelujah
[26:02] amen for the longest time elisha lived
[26:04] his own life
[26:05] i'll say it this way amen here he is he
[26:08] encounters the prophet by the jack the
[26:11] prophet takes his mantle lays it upon
[26:13] him amen i just
[26:15] i like to identify myself from the
[26:17] scripture i think of being elijah what
[26:18] it felt like brother solomon amen felt
[26:20] that road draped over him something felt
[26:23] a little bit different brother he
[26:25] realized his new call he realized his
[26:27] life was getting ready to change
[26:30] oh brother amen to the bride of jesus
[26:33] christ we felt that stimulation or
[26:36] revelation of the word
[26:38] and ever since we felt it brother ever
[26:41] since we got that stimulation amount of
[26:44] being a seed of god amen being
[26:46] identified by the message brother and we
[26:49] got that stimulation of the revelation
[26:52] we didn't understand it all no we didn't
[26:54] but one thing for sure
[26:56] something felt different ever since we
[26:59] heard it
[27:00] i said something felt different ever
[27:02] since we heard it we're not able to get
[27:05] away from it we're not able to run far
[27:07] enough away from it but we're hooked on
[27:10] it brother
[27:11] amen we're addicted to it we're tied to
[27:14] it
[27:17] oh god
[27:20] some of y'all know what i'm talking
[27:21] about
[27:22] first time you heard the message a seat
[27:24] on you aiming some light of the world
[27:26] was shining on it
[27:27] i mean you didn't understand it all you
[27:29] didn't know what was happening but one
[27:31] thing you knew for sure something's
[27:33] different i don't understand all of this
[27:35] but i believe it
[27:37] and i'm going all the way with it
[27:40] hallelujah
[27:43] now one theologian would say it this way
[27:45] he said now elijah found elisha draped
[27:48] his cloak around his shoulders
[27:49] recognizing he had been chosen to finish
[27:52] the job begun by elijah now elisha
[27:55] immediately slaughtered his ox and
[27:57] cooked the meat over the fires of his
[27:58] plowing equipment and elisha gave the
[28:01] meat to his fellow family and he set out
[28:03] to follow elijah to become his attendant
[28:06] i mean the message of inspiration
[28:08] brother man talks about it here says now
[28:09] notice amen elijah
[28:12] he knew he was standing before god
[28:14] therefore he was fearless and he got
[28:16] ready to put his robe upon elisha he
[28:18] says now elisha cut loose every
[28:20] shoreline amen i want you to notice even
[28:23] when he encountered the prophet and
[28:26] encountered his ministry amen elisha cut
[28:29] loose every shoreline
[28:31] everything he killed the ox he burnt the
[28:33] sacrifice and he separated from
[28:36] everything
[28:37] not some things not a couple of things
[28:40] but elisha separated from everything to
[28:43] follow god and he says that's the way
[28:46] we've got to do it that's the only way
[28:48] there is a coming to god another place
[28:50] he says it this way after the great
[28:52] prophet was taken elisha took elijah's
[28:54] place he said now i can imagine the type
[28:57] of being a witness when they started off
[28:59] he seen elijah he threw his mantle over
[29:02] on him and blessed him he killed the ox
[29:03] made the sacrifice showing that all the
[29:06] things of the world was dead to him he
[29:08] says now that's the way you come to god
[29:11] is you kill everything behind you
[29:14] you burn all the bridges don't lay up
[29:17] the bottle till tomorrow
[29:20] don't lay up the bottle so you'll find
[29:23] it tomorrow don't lay up the other thing
[29:26] tomorrow he says but get rid of the
[29:28] thing and burn it up a man be a real
[29:31] witness he says come out brother
[29:33] barefooted that's the way excuse those
[29:36] expressions that's the only way i know
[29:38] to say it i mean the prophet's giving a
[29:40] good teaching here he's saying if you're
[29:42] going to follow after god i mean you
[29:45] either follow him all the way or don't
[29:47] follow none of the way amen listen
[29:49] church if we're going to follow this
[29:51] message
[29:52] let me just give you a little command in
[29:54] this if you're going to follow this
[29:56] thing brother please do it all the way
[29:59] amen follow after god all the way if
[30:02] you're going to come to church amen go
[30:05] all the way give it everything you got
[30:07] brother amen and cut loose anything that
[30:10] can be a hindrance to it amen and give
[30:13] everything you've got
[30:16] amen that's exactly what elisha was
[30:17] testifying amen if this thing is worth
[30:20] following it is worth going all the way
[30:23] amen now studying these things you find
[30:25] the call of elisha begins in first kings
[30:27] chapter 19.
[30:29] amen and after you read first kings
[30:30] chapter 19 brother there's chapter after
[30:33] chapter you don't even find the name of
[30:35] elisha
[30:36] i thought my i wonder how come you don't
[30:38] even know where elisha is and you don't
[30:41] even amen his name's not in the
[30:42] scripture all the way until second kings
[30:44] chapter two i mean i'm again thinking on
[30:46] that brother jack i thought my where is
[30:49] elisha i wonder where he is and then it
[30:52] hit me all of a sudden i thought i know
[30:53] where elisha is he is wherever elijah is
[30:58] amen i i know where elijah is i mean i
[31:01] know where elisha is he's well amen
[31:03] every place that elijah went as well
[31:06] elisha went also
[31:09] now i say this i guarantee he learned a
[31:11] lot of things
[31:13] seeing how the prophet of god handles
[31:15] situations
[31:16] amen seeing what he said i mean maybe
[31:19] amen hear some of the sermon that said
[31:21] amen elijah the great prophet preached i
[31:23] say this i'm sure he learned a whole lot
[31:25] amen and historians believe it to be
[31:27] brother joy about six years that elisha
[31:30] followed elijah i thought my god to be
[31:33] right there right behind elijah for six
[31:36] years i mean imagine the encouragement
[31:39] that he got now i thought well you know
[31:41] i imagine the battles that he had did he
[31:44] understand everything as a man i'm sure
[31:46] he didn't did he know everything i mean
[31:49] did he know where elijah was going to
[31:50] take him to
[31:52] i'm sure he didn't understand that i
[31:53] mean i say this maybe he got discouraged
[31:55] in the way sometimes following after
[31:58] elijah's ministry let's just get real
[32:00] for a minute and preach on this and
[32:02] maybe he got discouraged by the troy in
[32:04] the way maybe he saw his faults and
[32:06] failures and thought my i ain't even
[32:08] worthy to follow elijah and his ministry
[32:11] i remember maybe he had enough good
[32:12] enough preaching from elijah to say
[32:15] elisha i don't care what comes and what
[32:17] goes god has got to work for you and you
[32:20] follow me elisha i don't care what
[32:23] happens to you i don't care if you fail
[32:25] god i don't care if you make a mistake
[32:28] amen elisha even if you get a little
[32:30] ways behind me and you do follow elisha
[32:33] as long as you get back up
[32:36] as long as you get back up elisha and as
[32:39] a man i'm sure he had battles he had
[32:42] struggles he had disappointments he had
[32:45] misunderstandings
[32:46] but the prophet elijah probably told him
[32:49] no matter what happens oh boy don't you
[32:52] give up don't you give in don't you stop
[32:55] but you keep on following me for god has
[32:59] a double portion waiting on you
[33:02] come on little bride don't stop fighting
[33:05] don't stop battle for god has got a new
[33:08] jerusalem for you
[33:12] hallelujah
[33:14] amen don't stop fighting do we get
[33:16] discouraged yes do we have battles sure
[33:19] we do
[33:20] but get back up
[33:24] get back up
[33:26] amen i'm sure elisha had battles come on
[33:28] he was a man
[33:30] but he kept on going
[33:33] he got back up he kept on pressing he
[33:36] kept on fighting
[33:39] hallelujah
[33:41] i'm sure he heard a lot of powerful
[33:43] sermons
[33:46] thank you sir
[33:49] amen elijah had been in the way six
[33:51] years
[33:52] everybody didn't stop going
[33:55] hey man he didn't know why the rapture
[33:57] hadn't happened yet
[33:59] but he didn't stop
[34:01] amen he couldn't explain everything amen
[34:04] but he didn't stop i mean if he could
[34:06] hold out long enough there'd be a double
[34:09] portion waiting on him
[34:11] amen there'd be a double portion waiting
[34:13] on him
[34:14] hallelujah
[34:16] amen i'm sure he had battles amen but he
[34:18] didn't stop going amen he was determined
[34:21] brother after this new commission after
[34:24] this new call
[34:25] everywhere he goes amen everywhere the
[34:28] prophet goes i'm going to follow all the
[34:31] places he goes that's where i'm going to
[34:32] go amen church maybe i could say it this
[34:35] way elijah didn't have no quit in him he
[34:38] didn't have no get up in him i i'm no
[34:40] give up him i mean maybe he'd been
[34:42] taught that way
[34:44] i mean maybe the prophet's ministry told
[34:45] him no matter what give up amen church i
[34:48] just want to put the devil on notice
[34:50] i mean because he comes to us does he
[34:52] not he battles with us does he not amen
[34:55] he sits on his shoulders and says you
[34:57] ain't going to make it i mean never been
[34:59] there but i want to put the devil on
[35:01] notice devil and then we do not know the
[35:04] sound retreat
[35:06] we don't know the sound turned back
[35:08] i remember the troy we don't know
[35:10] i know this song turned back but but in
[35:13] fact let me say it this way amen as
[35:15] elijah
[35:16] but he burned up his formal life he
[35:19] burned up his own way of living
[35:21] because maybe he knew
[35:23] oh brother maybe he knew when the going
[35:26] got hard that i would go back to my own
[35:28] life maybe he knew in humanity
[35:33] oh maybe he knew in humanity that if i
[35:36] get weak following the prophet's
[35:38] ministry if i hear something i don't
[35:40] understand and i want to go back i mean
[35:42] so what i'll do
[35:44] i make it to where i got no way to go
[35:46] back
[35:47] so i'll burn up everything
[35:50] so even when i'm weak
[35:52] i still can't go back
[35:55] even when i'm low
[35:57] i still can't go back
[35:59] because the consuming fire of god
[36:02] has burned up my old thanking he's
[36:05] burned up my own life
[36:09] and i believe i'm looking at some
[36:10] elisha's
[36:12] amen y'all didn't just lay up the bottle
[36:14] but you let the fire of god destroy the
[36:15] bottle y'all didn't just lay up the sin
[36:18] but you let the fire of god consume the
[36:20] sin
[36:21] amen i just want to let you know tonight
[36:22] that the fire of god is still a
[36:24] consuming fire
[36:26] but if you get near the fire of god but
[36:29] it'll consume things like you've never
[36:30] thought it would
[36:33] it's still a consuming fire
[36:36] i like what i heard one time there was a
[36:38] i mean there was a boy you know how you
[36:40] got the army amen they'll go out and
[36:42] they'll have the trumpet player send
[36:43] them out in front of the army i mean
[36:45] he'll be tooting the horn and playing
[36:46] the song keep on going aiming a song of
[36:49] charge keep on battling keep on pressing
[36:52] amen and
[36:53] i mean the story went as the champion
[36:55] the captain of the army he said boy i
[36:58] want you to listen the battle's getting
[36:59] really hot
[37:01] amen we might lose so so what i need you
[37:03] to do is i need you to play the song on
[37:05] your
[37:07] i horn retreat
[37:07] the boy kept on playing the victory song
[37:10] kept on playing the charge song kept on
[37:12] playing the march song about that the
[37:14] battle kept on going and sure enough
[37:17] they ended up winning the battle
[37:19] i mean they ended up winning the war
[37:22] amen the captain infuriated came to the
[37:24] boy said boy the battle was hot we
[37:26] barely made it out of that one how come
[37:28] you didn't play the song retreat and as
[37:30] that's what sir when i was learning
[37:33] music they never taught me the song
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:39] but solomon why are we still here we
[37:42] don't know the song retreat but jack why
[37:45] are you still here they didn't teach you
[37:48] the song betrayed
[37:50] well solomon why are you still running
[37:52] with it because my prophet
[37:55] did not teach me give up
[37:58] he didn't teach me turn back
[38:00] but he said draw your sword and when the
[38:03] battle gets hot
[38:05] keep on fighting and keep on slaying
[38:07] every devil
[38:09] hallelujah by the way i'm just going to
[38:11] get ahead of myself might as well but
[38:13] let me say this our elijah prophet he
[38:16] did not train us how to get defeated
[38:18] he didn't train us how to be a barely
[38:20] make it at church he did not train us to
[38:23] be a defeated church
[38:25] but the prophet elijah in our generation
[38:28] he was training a bride with the word
[38:31] to go up
[38:33] not to go down to have the victory not
[38:36] to have defeat
[38:38] that's what he's trained us for
[38:42] [Music]
[38:44] hallelujah
[38:48] amen i begin to think on this
[38:51] amen
[38:52] why didn't elisha even follow elijah in
[38:54] the first place
[38:56] good question
[38:58] what was he doing i mean why was he
[39:00] submitting himself under the mentorship
[39:04] of a prophet
[39:05] why was he being the protege of a
[39:07] prophet amen what's going on why why is
[39:09] he doing what he's doing but why is he
[39:11] following this prophet's ministry
[39:15] amen so they're coming here to a scene
[39:18] amen in the scripture in second kings
[39:20] the second chapter
[39:21] amen so uh amen elijah comes to this
[39:24] point with elisha he's following him
[39:26] amen so elijah thought well you know
[39:28] what i'll do is i'll give elijah a
[39:30] little test
[39:32] i mean i'll give him a little test to
[39:33] see where he's standing at the bible
[39:35] says in second kings two and one it came
[39:37] to pass when the lord would take up
[39:39] elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that
[39:41] elijah went
[39:42] with elisha from gilgal and elijah said
[39:45] unto elisha terry here i pray thee for
[39:48] the lord hath sent me to bethel and
[39:50] elisha said unto him as the lord liveth
[39:54] and even as i so liveth
[39:56] i will not leave thee
[39:59] amen i will not leave thee so they went
[40:02] down the vessel amen and the sons of the
[40:04] prophets that were at bethel came forth
[40:07] to elijah said unto him noah how that
[40:09] the lord will take away thy master from
[40:11] the head today and he said yeah i know
[40:13] what hold ye your peace
[40:15] amen this actually happens three times
[40:17] in the scripture as the lordly amen amen
[40:20] elijah here is telling him i've got to
[40:22] go to such place stay back i've got to
[40:24] go to such place stay back and it
[40:26] happens three places in the scripture i
[40:29] mean every single time elijah would do
[40:31] that his same response was as the lord
[40:35] liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not
[40:38] leave thee amen so they came to jericho
[40:42] amen what what a response to have amen
[40:44] no matter what amen now now it showed it
[40:47] showed the attitude of elisha here again
[40:50] we find the heart and the attitude of
[40:52] elisha he said elijah i'm not staying
[40:54] right here i'm going where you're going
[40:59] i'm not staying here i'm going where
[41:01] you're going amen our elijah would pick
[41:03] it up he said you see what he was doing
[41:06] i'm not staying here at sanctify amen
[41:08] justification
[41:09] i'm not staying here justification but
[41:12] i'm going up to sanctification will you
[41:14] just stay right here i'm not staying at
[41:17] sanctification i'm going on to the
[41:19] baptism of the holy ghost will you just
[41:22] stay back here no i'm going all the way
[41:26] hallelujah and the elijah in our
[41:29] generation he said don't you stop amen
[41:32] adjust justification and don't you stop
[41:35] just that sanctification but go all the
[41:38] way
[41:39] to the baptism of the holy ghost and go
[41:42] beyond the motion let me say this church
[41:44] of the living god i have been taught by
[41:46] a prophet's ministry amen to go beyond
[41:49] justification to go beyond
[41:51] sanctification to go beyond the motion
[41:54] to go beyond sensation but to go to a
[41:57] true word
[41:59] experience with the living god
[42:01] hallelujah brother he taught that a true
[42:05] word experience was possible
[42:07] so we'll receive it
[42:10] we'll receive what he taught
[42:14] amen nobody he was testing him
[42:16] will you go all the way will you keep
[42:18] going
[42:19] amen god commissioned moses i remember
[42:22] him talks about that scenery there he
[42:23] said i can think of all elijah
[42:25] i mean elisha throwed his or elijah
[42:27] throwed his man upon him said come
[42:28] follow me amen and he goes on amen the
[42:31] old prophet went with the young went out
[42:33] there to the school of the prophets
[42:34] luther's sacrification or our wesley
[42:37] saying occasion through the
[42:38] justification he says and elisha or
[42:40] elijah came and said you better turn
[42:42] back
[42:43] and but as your soul lives i will not
[42:45] turn back he was going to stay with him
[42:47] amen
[42:48] and the prophet will cover this in many
[42:50] different places he said you see amen he
[42:53] had the attitude of i'm going all the
[42:55] way
[42:55] i mean he had the attitude of i'm not
[42:57] stopping short but if god has more for
[43:00] me
[43:01] i mean if god has more for me to get i'm
[43:03] going to go get what he has for me i
[43:06] mean i begin to think on those scripts
[43:08] i'm in the scriptures how elijah was
[43:10] telling him to stay back and i thought
[43:12] you know i wonder why brother troy that
[43:14] that elisha would stand there and say
[43:16] you stay back here i thought you know
[43:18] maybe he was just testing to see where
[43:20] he stood and i thought it paralleled so
[43:22] beautifully with jesus in the scripture
[43:26] you say how so even because jesus when
[43:28] he came to the multitude he was there
[43:31] preaching and then what did he say he
[43:33] was going to see where they stood with
[43:35] them he was going to see us they would
[43:37] go all the way with them so it gave them
[43:39] a real hard teaching that they didn't
[43:41] understand
[43:42] [Laughter]
[43:45] i and my father won amen unless you
[43:47] drink my blood unless you eat my flesh
[43:50] you don't have any part with me
[43:53] i mean the word was seeing where they
[43:55] stood
[43:56] amen they said we can't go where he's
[43:58] going
[43:59] we don't understand this this is too
[44:01] hard we're going to have to go back
[44:04] so the bible records that a multitude
[44:07] turned and left
[44:09] and then he turned to peter turned to
[44:11] the disciples and said what about you
[44:13] guys you're gonna leave two
[44:15] and brother they had heard the message
[44:17] that he preached they had heard the
[44:19] revelation that he preached did they
[44:21] understand it no they
[44:23] didn't they know all about it no but one
[44:26] thing for sure
[44:27] one thing for sure brother when they
[44:29] heard him preach
[44:31] when they heard him teach
[44:33] they said lord where will we go
[44:37] where will we run to
[44:40] for you and you alone
[44:42] you're the only one that has words of
[44:45] eternal life
[44:47] hallelujah we've listened to other
[44:49] preachers we've listened to other men
[44:52] but there ain't none of them that's been
[44:54] able to open the blinded eyes there
[44:56] ain't been none of them that's been able
[44:58] to raise the dead there ain't been none
[45:00] of them that had the power that your
[45:03] words have
[45:08] so they said we're going all the way
[45:11] amen we're going to go where you go
[45:13] you're the only one that has words of
[45:15] life eternal so we're going with you
[45:18] do we understand what you said no we
[45:20] don't and but eventually the spirit of
[45:22] god would come back down after he was
[45:24] lifted on the cross and that same spirit
[45:27] would lead and guide them unto all truth
[45:29] and later bring them the revelation of
[45:31] the word
[45:32] hallelujah so you see there was a
[45:34] multitude that wasn't willing to go all
[45:37] the way
[45:39] but there was a few
[45:40] i said we're going all the way
[45:42] we're going where he goes
[45:45] hallelujah
[45:47] amen we're going where he goes and
[45:49] brother ram says this in the master
[45:50] separation relief he says ahab see he
[45:53] was a borderline believer just a fellow
[45:55] that believed enough to make him
[45:57] miserable
[45:58] my did you ever see people like that
[46:01] well well they have a conception they
[46:03] like to go to church and do right and
[46:05] they feel well maybe it'll make them a
[46:06] better social person in their social
[46:09] lives maybe for the sake of their
[46:11] children that they think they ought to
[46:13] maybe belong to a church he says why
[46:16] isn't that the most miserable person i
[46:18] know if i tell you he says the best
[46:20] thing i mean the best thing is to cut
[46:23] loose on shorelines and latch out into
[46:26] the deep or don't go at all he says just
[46:29] simply stay home or either go all the
[46:33] way for christ he says god wants
[46:35] somebody that'll really go all the way
[46:38] and give all you god soul body and
[46:40] spirit to the service of the lord
[46:43] amen all through the message you'll find
[46:44] this amen go all the way with god
[46:50] amen that's exactly what elisha was
[46:51] taught to do is to go all the way amen
[46:53] another prophet in the bible by the name
[46:55] of amen of joshua he was trained by the
[46:57] prophet moses
[46:59] amen now now elijah's here he had been
[47:02] trained what six years amen here we come
[47:04] to another scene and joshua amen is
[47:07] supposed to continue the work and
[47:09] continue the work of moses he had been
[47:11] trained 40 years
[47:13] i mean you find this in the scripture in
[47:14] the book of numbers the lord saying unto
[47:16] moses take thee joshua the son of nine a
[47:18] man in whom is the spirit lay your hand
[47:20] upon them and set them before eliza the
[47:22] priest before all the congregation and
[47:25] give him charge in their sight amen i
[47:27] won't read all the scripture but here
[47:29] even we're finding the call of joshua
[47:31] amen now he had been actually reading
[47:33] the scriptures very powerful amen read
[47:35] the life of joshua
[47:37] amen in exodus 33 and 11 the bible talks
[47:40] about joshua here that had been trained
[47:43] and mentored under moses the bible says
[47:45] the lord spake unto moses face to face
[47:47] as a man speaking unto his friend and he
[47:49] turned again into the camp but his
[47:51] servant joshua the son of nun a young
[47:53] man departed not out of the tabernacle i
[47:57] mean a couple of historians will read it
[47:58] this way they said wherever moses's tent
[48:01] was was where joshua's tent was
[48:04] amen wherever moses was was where joshua
[48:07] was and wherever that prophet was amen
[48:11] joshua was nearby amen being taught and
[48:14] being mentored
[48:16] under the ministry of moses aiming to
[48:19] pick up where moses left off is that
[48:21] right
[48:22] amen hallelujah abraham talks about it
[48:25] in the spoken word he says notice how
[48:27] god did not move israel until his own
[48:29] appointed time he says now this is going
[48:31] to mean something joshua waited for that
[48:33] time now no matter how many people might
[48:36] have said now god gave us the land he
[48:38] gave us the promise now let's go up and
[48:40] take it he said well they might have
[48:41] said joshua you lost your commission you
[48:43] all washed up why are you not doing
[48:45] something like you used to but he was
[48:47] waiting for that thus saith the lord in
[48:50] a moment to find the will of god and god
[48:52] sent the prophet that knew the promise
[48:54] of god and he was going to wait for that
[48:56] promise
[48:57] amen and when the time had come god gave
[49:00] it to joshua who stayed with him by the
[49:03] word he could not trust others but he
[49:05] could trust him now brother i'm saying
[49:08] here he couldn't trust others but he
[49:10] could trust joshua and the reason he
[49:13] could trust joshua with his commission
[49:16] is because he had been taught by the
[49:18] prophet moses amen to continue on
[49:22] among the work that moses would leave
[49:24] amen he had been taught he had been
[49:26] mentored and to carry on the work amen
[49:29] that moses had started with the children
[49:31] of israel
[49:32] amen now i want you to notice joshua
[49:35] amen joshua's training mother troy i
[49:38] mean he knew the whole entire time i'm
[49:41] not being trained for a picnic but i'm
[49:43] being trained for a war i mean i'm not
[49:46] being trained just to take it easy but
[49:48] i'm being trained so that when moses is
[49:51] dead and he's not here anymore i'm going
[49:55] to pick up where moses leaves off amen
[49:58] now listen church joshua knew
[50:00] that he wasn't trained just to sit there
[50:04] he wasn't trained just to sit there and
[50:06] let moses do all the preaching let moses
[50:09] do all the praying let moses do all the
[50:11] casting out of devils amen he knew
[50:14] he was being trained to work
[50:17] he was being trained for battle he was
[50:19] being trained for a war
[50:21] amen
[50:22] hallelujah i mean what about it that
[50:24] angel came down amen immediately brother
[50:27] that angel came down i didn't put his
[50:29] hand on his sword and what'd he say are
[50:31] you forced or are you against us and it
[50:33] was the captain of the host of the lord
[50:36] emma see church he was ready for battle
[50:39] because the prophet had taught him
[50:42] at any time be ready for war this ain't
[50:44] a picnic joshua this is a battle this
[50:47] ain't a picnic this is a war i mean
[50:49] that's exactly what joshua knew even now
[50:52] the time had come amen that joshua amen
[50:55] he'd been through all the training
[50:57] amen and then joshua 1 the bible says
[51:00] moses my servant is now dead
[51:02] so now josh was like well
[51:06] moses ain't here no more moses can't
[51:08] preach no more you ain't here moses
[51:10] can't leave no more he ain't here so
[51:12] joshua
[51:13] i like this the time had come for joshua
[51:17] to pick up where moses left off
[51:20] so he took the responsibility
[51:23] aiming to finish the work
[51:25] to keep on preaching to keep on battling
[51:28] he said well what'd he do preacher this
[51:30] is what he did he kept leading and kept
[51:33] guiding the children of israel but he
[51:35] had been prepared for that moment he had
[51:38] been taught for that moment he had been
[51:40] trained for war amen and we find there
[51:43] they are in one of the greatest battles
[51:45] brother sister they're here in the heat
[51:47] of the battle and joshua stands here
[51:52] joshua stands here in the heat of the
[51:54] battle amen and the
[51:56] and the people that are fighting is
[51:58] getting ready to win the battle
[52:01] so here he has been trained for this
[52:03] moment and he sees the sun
[52:05] amen sitting up there
[52:07] and he knows brother troy that in any
[52:10] moment if that sun goes down they're
[52:13] going to win this battle
[52:15] if that sun goes down they're going to
[52:17] defeat us and they're going to win this
[52:20] battle but he said you know what i've
[52:22] been trained
[52:23] for such a time as this i have been
[52:26] mentored for such a time as this i mean
[52:29] you know what he did
[52:30] he got out his phone moses moses moses
[52:34] couldn't do it he was dead deacon deacon
[52:36] deacon where are you at where you at
[52:37] deacon wasn't there i mean preacher
[52:39] preacher preacher where are you out i
[52:40] need you i need you to pray deacon
[52:43] wasn't there they said you know what i
[52:45] had been trained
[52:47] oh god i have been trained
[52:51] so what did he do he stood there as the
[52:53] seed of abraham as the son of god that
[52:57] had been prepared for war
[52:59] and the sun was there and he said son
[53:02] you stand there over the hill of gibeon
[53:05] and moon over the hill of agilent and
[53:08] has stood there brother he had been
[53:10] taught for it and let me say this the
[53:13] bride of jesus christ we have been
[53:15] taught for battle we have been taught
[53:17] for war and when the need is there we
[53:20] say devil you stay in your place
[53:23] you can't take another step devil you
[53:26] stay in your corner you can't take
[53:28] another step we have been trained
[53:32] for such a time as this
[53:36] god i'm
[53:38] i'm not ready to blow up on this
[53:40] i mean listen church he didn't have to
[53:42] call brother jack
[53:44] he had been trained himself
[53:46] he didn't have to call the deacon
[53:49] church i'm trying to help you tonight
[53:51] the oldest to the youngest person in
[53:53] here
[53:54] amen you have been trained by a prophet
[53:58] you have been trained by a prophet
[54:01] amen you don't have to cause somebody
[54:03] else to pray through for you but you can
[54:05] pray to yourself you know i have to call
[54:08] somebody else to draw the sword and to
[54:10] get the devil out of your house but i
[54:13] believe i'm looking at young people i'm
[54:15] looking at signs i'm looking at
[54:17] daughters that brother the devil
[54:19] literally shakes in his boots
[54:22] when you realize who you are and you
[54:24] realize you've been trained for it
[54:28] oh come on church we've been trained for
[54:31] this moment i mean we've been trained
[54:33] for this hour amen the prophet of god
[54:36] would stand there and tell that dream
[54:37] amen he said there the brother was had
[54:39] that dream that the devil come to him
[54:41] was saying boo
[54:42] boo
[54:43] boo and here he is going down in the
[54:46] corner down in the corner down in the
[54:47] corner amen kept getting smaller and
[54:50] smaller and smaller now listen church
[54:52] elijah tells stories for reasons
[54:56] and when the prophet's telling a story
[54:58] for a reason he ain't saying it just to
[55:01] say it he said but you know what that
[55:03] man he said there was in the dream and i
[55:06] and something in me began to change and
[55:08] so what i did is i said boo back
[55:12] and then he started getting smaller he
[55:14] said what was the prophet doing the
[55:16] prophet was trying to tell you your
[55:18] enemy
[55:20] the prophet was training you to tell you
[55:23] your enemy is only as scary as what you
[55:26] let him be
[55:28] he's only as big as what you let him be
[55:31] the prophet was saying it's time that we
[55:34] start saying boo back
[55:36] oh yeah hey when the prophet was
[55:38] teaching us it's time that we stop
[55:41] letting them get us in a little corner
[55:43] but let's stand up by sons and daughters
[55:45] of god and say devil don't boo you
[55:49] you get down where you belong
[55:52] [Music]
[55:54] we've been trained for it
[55:56] hallelujah
[55:57] we've been trained for it
[55:59] amen he would tell the stories he'd tell
[56:01] the scriptures i mean all of it was to
[56:04] train a bride
[56:06] to dress her with the word that's
[56:08] exactly what it is and church we have
[56:11] been underneath this training but the
[56:13] time has come let's start using what
[56:15] we've been trained for
[56:17] i mean i'll tell you i i'm not trying to
[56:20] beat you up on this but you have some
[56:21] people i mean they'll come up and be
[56:23] prayed for
[56:24] i've got nothing against that i mean we
[56:25] believe in praying for people let's say
[56:27] brother the devil's been telling me this
[56:29] or brother the devil's been telling me
[56:31] that he's been he's been running his way
[56:33] in my family
[56:34] amen and he does that if you let him
[56:37] i mean that's a ministry of the gospel
[56:39] i've been trained to cast that spirit
[56:40] off and to tell them as a son or
[56:43] daughter of god
[56:44] listen you've been trained better than
[56:46] that you don't have to let the amen you
[56:48] don't have to let the devil run your
[56:49] household you don't have to let them sit
[56:52] on your shoulder and whisper in your ear
[56:54] and when you don't have to have anything
[56:56] to do with him
[56:58] hallelujah i'm in church we have been
[57:01] trained for this we have been trained
[57:03] for war we have been trained for battle
[57:08] hallelujah
[57:11] amen stood there and told the son to
[57:12] stand still
[57:14] he said why'd he do it he was trained
[57:17] for it
[57:18] and you know
[57:19] and the beautiful part in this amen
[57:22] you find joshua and caleb was two out of
[57:25] the original the original generation
[57:27] they were the only two that went into
[57:29] the promised land
[57:31] there was millions bro i mean i mean
[57:33] hundreds and hundreds of people amen and
[57:36] just two people was the only ones that
[57:39] went into the promised land he said why
[57:41] was it only two
[57:43] i even brought because they'd been
[57:45] trained for it
[57:46] they hadn't been taught that that
[57:47] promised land is theirs they had been
[57:50] taught not to look to reasoning they had
[57:52] been taught don't look to the giants
[57:53] looked to the promise
[57:56] i mean they had been taught better than
[57:57] that and they knew better amen no matter
[58:00] if there was giants no matter if there
[58:02] was problems no matter if there was a
[58:04] battle in it they knew that land was
[58:07] theirs amen no matter what and the
[58:11] church of the living god we know that
[58:13] the promised land is ours we know that
[58:16] the promises are ours amen no matter
[58:19] what devil stands in our way between us
[58:22] and the promise we know that the promise
[58:25] is ours
[58:27] it's the giants they're sure they are
[58:30] it's the battles they're sure they are
[58:33] hallelujah but as caleb stood at the
[58:36] mountain he said give me my mountain
[58:40] amen give me my mountain you say why did
[58:44] he do it preacher because he was trained
[58:46] for it he was trained i aiming to
[58:49] inherit his promise
[58:51] oh brother we are trained to inherit our
[58:54] promise and we ought to stand as caleb
[58:57] of old and say god
[58:59] give me my mountain
[59:04] hallelujah
[59:08] and back to elijah
[59:10] and elisha was there trained
[59:12] him and to do what the prophet did
[59:16] i mean you said preacher what what do
[59:18] you mean by that that's what i mean by
[59:19] it i'm in the six years that elisha had
[59:22] been trained and mentored been guided
[59:25] been leaded by a prophet he said what
[59:27] was happening he was being shaped and
[59:29] being honed
[59:32] he was being prepared
[59:34] so so so that when elijah was ready to
[59:37] go up
[59:38] and the spirit of elijah was ready to
[59:40] come down
[59:41] he was cut and fit
[59:46] he was cut and fit
[59:48] to handle power
[59:50] is that right
[59:51] now we know when our elijah taught us
[59:53] that power without character is satanic
[59:57] so that's why he was being trained
[59:59] let me just say it this way when it was
[1:00:02] time for elijah to leave
[1:00:04] amen well
[1:00:06] there's so much in this it's so amazing
[1:00:08] i remember but when elijah's getting
[1:00:10] ready to leave he turns to elisha and
[1:00:12] says what will you asking me and what he
[1:00:14] replied said i asked that i would have
[1:00:17] your spirit in a double portion
[1:00:19] amen what was elijah's response you have
[1:00:21] asked for a hard thing
[1:00:24] it took you off into another area i
[1:00:27] thought mom maybe he'd been taught to
[1:00:28] ask god for big things
[1:00:31] hallelujah
[1:00:32] i mean maybe he'd been taught by a
[1:00:34] prophet ask god for big things
[1:00:37] hallelujah so he went ahead and asked
[1:00:39] for a hard thing might as well
[1:00:41] so he asked for it he said well if you
[1:00:43] see me when i leave then it'll be what
[1:00:45] you've asked for amen the church is such
[1:00:48] a beautiful picture in the bible even
[1:00:50] the chariot of fire whips down out of
[1:00:51] the heavens picks elijah up carries them
[1:00:53] off amen elisha sees that man on
[1:00:56] circling back down to him he said well
[1:00:58] islam did it fit him and if
[1:01:00] it fit him perfectly
[1:01:02] i mean he said why did it fit him
[1:01:04] because he'd been trained for it
[1:01:06] he'd been mentored for it but he had
[1:01:08] been shaped for it i mean so when the
[1:01:10] mantle came upon him but he had been
[1:01:13] trained so long
[1:01:15] that it fit just perfectly he said
[1:01:18] brother solomon what are you saying in
[1:01:19] this this is what i'm saying hey when
[1:01:21] the word of god has been training abroad
[1:01:25] it's been shaping a bride it's been
[1:01:28] holding your bride brother amen so that
[1:01:30] third pulled power
[1:01:32] amen that's here to operate but the only

[1:12:24] and to show what the status of an
[1:12:26] adopted son and an adopted daughter of
[1:12:29] god is able to obtain amen god didn't
[1:12:32] raise it up for us to see
[1:12:34] and to see just a one-man ministry is

[1:16:14] it to you pastor
[1:16:26] praise the lord
[1:16:28] uh i certainly appreciate the word of
[1:16:31] the lord on tonight
[1:16:32] um thank god for brother solomon
[1:16:36] and he was just
[1:16:38] just kind of
[1:16:39] encouraging us and
[1:16:41] we've been trained
[1:16:42] we've been thoroughly thoroughly trained
[1:16:45] that when different situations arise
[1:16:48] we already know how to respond
[1:16:51] and i love the way he just used
[1:16:54] joshua and how he knew to use the spoken
[1:16:57] word he knew he had that he actually
[1:16:59] sought an operation
[1:17:00] in the ministry of moses you know
[1:17:02] everyone in place was the spoken word
[1:17:05] right and uh so joshua saw that and when
[1:17:07] it came time for him to use it he
[1:17:09] exercised now he might not have had as
[1:17:12] many um
[1:17:14] opportunities as moses had because moses
[1:17:16] was the example the god but he still
[1:17:19] used the power
[1:17:21] right and um you know and i was just
[1:17:23] thinking there when we were just there
[1:17:25] in in
[1:17:26] in england there was a powerful
[1:17:28] testimony
[1:17:30] of a sister that had come to serve his
[1:17:33] sister maddie was a name
[1:17:35] and uh and that night i was preaching i
[1:17:37] just felt led to share sister tonya's
[1:17:40] testimony how she say i'm not gonna let
[1:17:42] the doctor operate on me until i could
[1:17:46] get prayed for
[1:17:47] it's a meeting happening i'm gonna get
[1:17:49] prayed for it then i'll come back and do
[1:17:51] the surgery and uh and and and and
[1:17:54] somewhere between here and there
[1:17:56] between the prayer amen and by the time
[1:17:58] she got ready for surgery the thing had
[1:18:00] disappeared
[1:18:02] the growth had disappeared and i was
[1:18:03] just sharing that testimony and this
[1:18:05] sister say i can only come to one
[1:18:06] service
[1:18:08] one service and why is it that the one
[1:18:09] service she came to was a service that i
[1:18:12] shared that testimony and she came to
[1:18:14] that service and says you know she told
[1:18:16] the sisters after say okay i won't see
[1:18:18] y'all anymore
[1:18:20] uh i got to go to surgery emergency
[1:18:22] surgery in the morning you know because
[1:18:24] of a condition and one sister say no you
[1:18:27] can't go without being prayed for
[1:18:29] you've got to be prayed for before you
[1:18:31] go so they come and got me and say and
[1:18:33] she told me what was going on and me and
[1:18:34] brother gwynna just
[1:18:36] began encouraging the faith and
[1:18:38] i say look the only thing i know is that
[1:18:40] god told us to lay hands on the sick and
[1:18:43] they shall recover that's our part
[1:18:46] that's what we've been trained to do
[1:18:47] just pray lay hands on the sick they'll
[1:18:49] recover that's what god said it's not

[1:23:33] father we are
[1:23:34] appreciative of
[1:23:36] what we have heard tonight
[1:23:38] our our spirits have been uplifted
[1:23:41] and um god we don't know what it is that
[1:23:44] we will face but we know that we'll be
[1:23:45] ready for it
[1:23:46] uh whatever comes we know that we can
[1:23:49] use the power and authority that you
[1:23:51] have given us as sons and daughters of
[1:23:53] god
[1:23:54] uh we
[1:23:55] serve the most high god where's uh his
[1:23:58] children and god there's a uh i mean
[1:24:02] there's just
[1:24:03] there's a status that we have god and
[1:24:05] it's if we just only knew who we were
[1:24:08] the prophet said when the bride
[1:24:09] recognizes who she is
[1:24:12] then the rapture would go so lord help
[1:24:14] us to recognize who we are
[1:24:16] i think about elisha when he knew that
[1:24:18] he had the mantle he went right back to
[1:24:21] that same jordan that he crossed and he
[1:24:24] struck it with the mantle and said
[1:24:26] where's the lord god of elijah
[1:24:28] god he spoke it and there the waters
[1:24:31] parted amen and he walked through on dry
[1:24:33] ground and lord even the um the critics
[1:24:37] had to identify
[1:24:39] that uh that that the spirit of elijah
[1:24:43] was resting on eli
[1:24:45] shah and god we realized that it's the
[1:24:48] same holy ghost today that is resting on
[1:24:50] us
[1:24:51] uh my
[1:24:53] that's even greater if we can recognize
[1:24:56] that it's not just the spirit of elijah
[1:24:58] it's the spirit of almighty god
[1:25:01] amen the spirit that was in the lord
[1:25:03] jesus christ is resting on us and god
[1:25:06] how it certainly brings us into a a
[1:25:09] certain place it causes us to act like
[1:25:11] jesus to talk like jesus to walk like
[1:25:13] jesus to be like jesus and god we
[1:25:16] help us not to to
[1:25:18] forget our place in our position as our
[1:25:22] sons and daughters of god may we
[1:25:24] not not just those that are here but
[1:25:26] those that are streaming lord any time
[1:25:28] any time we come against something help
[1:25:30] us to take the word that has been given
[1:25:32] to us
[1:25:33] and use it
[1:25:35] our prayers are being heard
[1:25:37] i love how he said tonight maybe elisha
[1:25:39] was discouraged sometimes and didn't
[1:25:42] think that he would uh maybe god won't
[1:25:44] hear my prayer knowing elijah had to
[1:25:46] encourage him just stay encouraging and
[1:25:48] just keep pressing on no matter what god
[1:25:50] made a promise you the seed god his seat
[1:25:53] will possess the gates of the enemy so
[1:25:55] lord we we know we're and and we're
[1:25:58] anchored by that sworn promise so god we
[1:26:00] help us to walk in that to live in it uh
