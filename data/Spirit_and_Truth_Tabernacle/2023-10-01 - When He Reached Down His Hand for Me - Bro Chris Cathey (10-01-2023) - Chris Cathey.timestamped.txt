[6:39] light in the my God my God that is who
[6:46] you are
[6:53] praise the Lord
[6:56] Hallelujah
[6:59] amen that song becomes more real all the
[7:02] time
[7:04] praise the Lord I had a Psalm I wanted
[7:06] to read with you but let's let's turn to
[7:08] Psalms 91.
[7:10] this was a little portion
[7:13] this was a little portion of our
[7:15] devotion earlier in the week and I
[7:17] remember
[7:18] when covet first came out this this
[7:20] Psalm was everywhere
[7:23] everybody was reading this song
[7:25] and I got to thinking me and my wife
[7:27] were talking
[7:29] I think it was last week talking about
[7:31] the children of Israel how they had to
[7:33] fight
[7:34] all these amorites and amalekites and
[7:37] perizzites and all these different
[7:39] things but now we fight
[7:42] hepatitis bursitis
[7:44] tendinitis all these irises
[7:48] amen diseases everywhere
[7:51] so that threw my mind to a quote
[7:54] [Music]
[8:10] [Music]
[8:14] praise the lord well that threw my mind
[8:17] to a quote
[8:19] it's a very short one so I want to read
[8:21] that before we read this Psalm because
[8:23] it made this song become more real to me
[8:26] says you think cancer is something
[8:29] the Bible said there is coming a time
[8:31] when men will rot right in their flesh
[8:34] and buzzers will eat off their carcasses
[8:36] before they even die
[8:38] cancer is a toothache to what's coming
[8:41] but remember that horrible thing was
[8:43] forbidden in that day to touch those who
[8:45] had the Seal of God that's our promise
[8:48] right there
[8:49] that's what we're striving for now to
[8:51] get in in and be positionally placed
[8:54] into the kingdom of God before these
[8:56] horrible plagues strike oh how good the
[8:59] dispensation of time fullness of time
[9:02] the inheritance
[9:04] and that right there it just made
[9:07] Psalms 91 more real to me
[9:10] when we see what we're facing the
[9:12] different things coming upon the Earth
[9:14] and and we think that these these are
[9:17] not natural diseases these are man-made
[9:19] diseases
[9:20] and God will destroy those who destroys
[9:22] the Earth
[9:23] amen so Psalms 91.
[9:26] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[9:29] the most high shall abide under the
[9:31] shadow of the almighty now we can thank
[9:34] God for the Seal of God
[9:36] I will serve the Lord he is my refuge
[9:39] and my Fortress my God in whom I will
[9:41] trust
[9:42] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[9:44] spirit of the fowl and from the noise
[9:46] and pestilence
[9:48] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[9:50] and under his wings shalt thou Trust his
[9:53] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[9:55] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[9:58] by night nor for the arrow that flies by
[10:01] day
[10:02] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[10:05] darkness nor for the destruction that
[10:07] wasted at Noonday
[10:09] A thousand shall fall
[10:12] at thy side and ten thousand at that
[10:14] right hand
[10:15] but it not it shall not come neither
[10:18] we think about that during the time of
[10:20] covert
[10:22] thousands die
[10:28] but it shall not come neither
[10:31] we have to believe God
[10:33] whatever comes our way his word cannot
[10:35] fail
[10:37] we must believe God
[10:39] that's about his
[10:41] we won't go any further

[58:58] and but the prophet told us in the
[59:03] message it says anything
[59:08] that can help the human race is
[59:13] Godly and then he went further in that
[59:16] same quote and it says you got to look
[59:18] at things
[59:20] sensibly
[59:23] and that was just a a quote that uh that
[59:26] that delivered me amen so there are
[59:30] things that I know that the Lord has

[59:48] some of these tools amen that we can use
[59:51] to help not just marriages but families

[59:56] grateful for the opportunity and that'll

[1:12:45] very very familiar scripture burka Ruth

[1:12:50] verse 2 chapter 2 verse 10.
[1:12:54] we'll start at chapter 10 this morning
[1:12:59] let's see where we go first uh chapter 2
[1:13:02] verse 10
[1:13:03] ruse says uh she says then she fell on
[1:13:06] her face
[1:13:07] she says and bowed herself to the ground
[1:13:10] and said unto him she's speaking to Boaz
[1:13:14] she says why have I found Grace and nine
[1:13:16] eyes
[1:13:17] and you know I believe that well we can
[1:13:19] say that today I believe we are the
[1:13:22] children of God I believe that all of us
[1:13:23] can say how have we found Grace in the
[1:13:25] sight of God
[1:13:27] and so I said thou thou shalters take
[1:13:29] knowledge of me seeing I'm a stranger
[1:13:32] you know we're all strangers we're all
[1:13:34] born shaped and iniquity and sin but but
[1:13:37] God's called us out Amen in verse 11 it
[1:13:40] says and Boaz answered and said unto her
[1:13:42] it has fully been shown me all thou has
[1:13:45] done unto thy mother-in-law since since
[1:13:49] thy death of thy husbands and that hell
[1:13:51] the house left thy father and thy mother
[1:13:54] and land and Nativity and their art
[1:13:56] common to the people which thou knowest
[1:13:58] not they're uh here there uh therefore
[1:14:01] verse 12 it says the Lord recompense thy
[1:14:04] work on that full reward be given unto
[1:14:07] thee of thy Lord God of Israel unto thy
[1:14:10] Wings Thou Art cometh of the of to trust
[1:14:14] you may uh you may be seated amen God
[1:14:17] bless you may God has blessings on this
[1:14:19] word
[1:14:20] I just want to speak on a few minutes on
[1:14:23] uh when he reached on his hands for us
[1:14:25] all right
[1:14:26] when he reached down his hands for me
[1:14:29] when he reached out his hands for you
[1:14:30] this morning I want to bring you back to
[1:14:33] a place where the devil wants to tell
[1:14:34] you you know you've done this and you've
[1:14:36] done that but I want to remind you who
[1:14:38] you are this morning I remind you more
[1:14:40] you're more than conquerors in Christ
[1:14:42] Jesus you're not just coming through
[1:14:45] this world passing through but you've
[1:14:47] gotten purpose and a place to be here
[1:14:50] you're not just filling up air this
[1:14:52] morning you're not just taking up oxygen
[1:14:54] this morning it's not just for the
[1:14:56] minister this morning the Evangelist
[1:14:58] this morning it's for every one of us
[1:15:00] this morning we're not just riding down
[1:15:02] the road just to be another day it's
[1:15:05] another god-given day to make it count
[1:15:08] oh every time you wake up it's a time to
[1:15:11] make it count for the Lord not just on
[1:15:13] Sunday not just on Wednesdays but every
[1:15:16] single day you get up when you're at the
[1:15:19] gas pump or you're in the the you're
[1:15:22] eating lunch with your fellow workers
[1:15:23] this morning wherever you're at you are
[1:15:26] shining the light from this Darkness oh
[1:15:28] they know something's different they
[1:15:31] know something's in your life has become
[1:15:33] reality you know not just to say I
[1:15:36] believe a message the devil knows the
[1:15:38] message is he knows the quotes he
[1:15:40] trembles at it but I tell you what it's
[1:15:43] the life behind the name it's the life
[1:15:46] behind the name that makes the devil
[1:15:48] tremble he knows where you stand in your
[1:15:51] life he knows behind closed doors today
[1:15:54] oh but it's the life behind the name but
[1:15:58] think about it brother Brown said he
[1:15:59] said that the weakest Christian gets on
[1:16:01] their knees and the devil trembles think
[1:16:04] about a light that surrendered to God
[1:16:06] think about a wife that's in the word of
[1:16:08] God daily it's a daily dying out it's a
[1:16:12] daily walk I tell you it's a rugged it's
[1:16:15] a tough life but I tell you greater is
[1:16:17] he that is in me than he that's in the
[1:16:21] world oh we're fighting every devil
[1:16:23] every spirit in the world but he's
[1:16:25] called you out
[1:16:27] he's put you in Heavenly places today in
[1:16:30] Christ Jesus oh and you have a purpose
[1:16:33] this morning young kids you have a
[1:16:36] purpose when the devil says you can't
[1:16:38] have the Holy Ghost you say it's for me
[1:16:42] all the promise is like the ocean
[1:16:44] through a pipe he said he wants to give
[1:16:46] it to you more than that oh think about
[1:16:49] the ocean through a two inch pipe all
[1:16:51] right oh he wants to give you more than
[1:16:53] that he wants to refill you this morning
[1:16:55] if your Joy's gone ask God to restore it
[1:16:58] this morning
[1:16:59] oh I'll tell you we ain't even got any
[1:17:02] descriptions brother Jack we're going to
[1:17:04] go through here
[1:17:06] oh praise God but like what she said
[1:17:09] verse 10 then she fell on her face and
[1:17:11] bowed herself to the ground and said she
[1:17:13] said unto him why have I found Grace in
[1:17:16] thy eyes have you ever asked that you
[1:17:18] ever rode down the road maybe it's only
[1:17:19] me this morning I'll be like yeah why do
[1:17:22] I find Grace I came from a broke up home
[1:17:25] that didn't believe God
[1:17:27] think about it I come from the the worst
[1:17:30] of the worst sinners
[1:17:31] but I tell you I'm like Paul I'm the
[1:17:33] least of these disciples this morning
[1:17:35] but I tell you your father in Heaven
[1:17:37] chose you from the foundation of the
[1:17:40] world
[1:17:41] and his grace he went to the junkyard
[1:17:43] have you ever been to a junkyard or a
[1:17:45] trash can before and you drop off his
[1:17:48] smelly you know they come back and they
[1:17:50] they you just look at all the trash and
[1:17:53] you you look at the trash in some reason
[1:17:55] he picked that piece of trash up me and
[1:17:57] you today
[1:17:58] and he put He just picked you up and
[1:18:01] said hey brother Jack that shoe right
[1:18:02] here that shoe he didn't pick up all the
[1:18:05] trash
[1:18:06] he didn't pick up all the trash he
[1:18:09] picked up you and me this morning
[1:18:11] he didn't pick up the church over here
[1:18:13] he picked you up this morning he gave
[1:18:16] you the spirit and the truth
[1:18:18] all these same people free this morning
[1:18:21] he said family's free I'll tell you what
[1:18:24] I'm so thankful I'm so thankful to come
[1:18:27] from the Myra clay where a family didn't
[1:18:30] believe the truth but when that eagle
[1:18:32] heard the voice
[1:18:34] it was caged up one day
[1:18:36] oh I tell you I think the devil cages us
[1:18:39] up sometimes in our life yes sir he
[1:18:42] wants to cage you up this morning he
[1:18:44] wants to cage you up and find a new job
[1:18:46] or about paying your next bill but do
[1:18:50] you know who your daddy is do you know
[1:18:52] he owns a thousand a catalog A Thousand
[1:18:56] Hills
[1:18:57] oh so we were in we read brother Dandy's
[1:18:59] the other day and this guy was saying
[1:19:01] this brother owns this and this guy owns
[1:19:03] this and man he's so rich I said do you
[1:19:05] know who my daddy is
[1:19:07] you don't want my father owns
[1:19:10] oh he created this world
[1:19:13] he said I'm going to prepare a place oh
[1:19:17] think about it we were on the water the
[1:19:19] other day eating with my wife the other
[1:19:20] night and I was sitting there eating and
[1:19:22] I said honey I just catch me at the
[1:19:24] River of Life on that day all right I'm
[1:19:26] out of water
[1:19:27] I'll tell you it's tempting to move here
[1:19:29] brother John
[1:19:31] brother I love
[1:19:33] Floridians have arrived he said that's
[1:19:36] the Northerners I said brother don't
[1:19:38] call us the northerner
[1:19:40] because we're from the south brother
[1:19:42] Solomon we're from the south praise the
[1:19:45] Lord y'all know how to Worship the Lord
[1:19:48] praise the Lord but I thought about
[1:19:50] Ruth's life and I'm just going to bring
[1:19:52] us home today try to see if we can get
[1:19:54] through this about how how comparing us
[1:19:57] to Ruth and comparing us that we had to
[1:19:59] have a kinsman redeemer in our day and
[1:20:02] we we had to have a uh the nearest
[1:20:05] Kinsmen redeem us and that's why he had
[1:20:08] to send the son the most innocent
[1:20:10] Oneness the sister was talking about the
[1:20:12] blood right and I started to think about
[1:20:14] the blood and I started to weep and I
[1:20:16] thought about if it wasn't for them
[1:20:19] if it weren't for the blind brother
[1:20:21] Abraham even said in one place that the
[1:20:23] blood went before him one time and he
[1:20:26] started talking about a situation and he
[1:20:28] wanted to rebuke this uh this lady that
[1:20:30] was drinking and she was ate up and all
[1:20:33] of a sudden he said okay said I don't
[1:20:35] know how my family can live in this
[1:20:36] situation you ever been in that
[1:20:38] situation I've been in my heart where I
[1:20:41] say oh Lord I don't know how my kids can
[1:20:43] live in this mess but then he said God
[1:20:45] started bringing back his sins
[1:20:47] and all of a sudden he said a blood of a
[1:20:50] Mist a bumper of blood started coming
[1:20:52] around his life and he said he just made
[1:20:55] them think about the purchase price they
[1:20:58] didn't think about what Jesus Christ did
[1:21:00] for us it's nothing young kids it's
[1:21:03] nothing we're going to do on that day
[1:21:04] when we enter in it's going to be paid
[1:21:06] and Authority paid it's by the blood of
[1:21:09] Jesus Christ think about it when we get
[1:21:12] on that day he said that people would
[1:21:13] say I've done this in your name I've
[1:21:15] done that brother Jack there ain't
[1:21:16] enough that we've ever done in his name
[1:21:20] I tell you I just want to narrow at his
[1:21:22] feet and say Lord I love you Lord oh
[1:21:25] there ain't nothing I could say I drove
[1:21:27] this smile or I flew here or I've done
[1:21:29] that I just want to lay at his feet and
[1:21:31] say Lord ain't nothing that I've done
[1:21:33] but I do love you Lord
[1:21:35] as the prophet said if you send my soul
[1:21:38] to hell I'll still serve your gods or
[1:21:41] when that becomes a revelation in your
[1:21:43] life oh no devils in Hell could keep you
[1:21:46] bound oh we got to realize that today he
[1:21:50] said well I have a Grace in nine eyes
[1:21:52] that's us today
[1:21:53] that they'll show us take knowledge of
[1:21:56] me seeing I'm a stranger and Boaz

[1:22:01] been shown me all that have done it
[1:22:02] today mother-in-law think about it she

[1:25:24] have we you know what you wanted to fake
[1:25:26] Satan I tell you I believe it it says
[1:25:28] faith come by hearing the word of God
[1:25:30] I tell you our faith is low because we
[1:25:32] don't fill it up enough
[1:25:34] we don't say in the word enough and I'm
[1:25:37] preaching to me today I'm not just
[1:25:39] preaching to you
[1:25:41] I'll tell you what I said Lord I don't
[1:25:43] want to say that Lord help us all
[1:25:46] verse 15 and when she was risen up to
[1:25:49] glean Boaz commanded his young men
[1:25:51] saying oh listen to this let her glean
[1:25:54] even among the cheese that approach her
[1:25:56] not think about it he was a protector as
[1:26:00] well
[1:26:00] always like hey Reapers let her clean
[1:26:03] think about it and he goes he says and
[1:26:06] he risen up in verse 16 and he let fall
[1:26:08] he said let fall also some handfuls of
[1:26:11] purpose for
[1:26:12] and leave them not she may glean them
[1:26:15] and rebuke her not oh I believe God is
[1:26:18] dropping off a handful of purpose this
[1:26:19] morning every time you come in the house
[1:26:22] of God he's given you a handful of
[1:26:24] purpose oh not just on Sunday or
[1:26:27] Wednesday but every day of your life
[1:26:29] he's dropping handfuls of purpose he's
[1:26:32] giving you quotes and scriptures and
[1:26:34] saying hey keep pressing on
[1:26:37] amen oh keep pressing on
[1:26:39] oh I'll tell you we're like boy we're
[1:26:42] like Ruth today think about it we're
[1:26:45] thinking about Boaz the Kinsmen but the
[1:26:47] near Kinsmen have to come we had a near
[1:26:49] Kinsman in our day amen Jesus Christ
[1:26:53] think about it I thought wrote these
[1:26:55] notes down I was writing these down I
[1:26:57] put she starts the story as worthless
[1:26:59] and ends the story as well
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:02] oh she starts as a pulper but she ends
[1:27:07] as a princess oh think about it today
[1:27:09] she starts the story as bitterness but
[1:27:13] is the story is being blessed oh think
[1:27:17] about it
[1:27:18] oh she starts the story as a widow but
[1:27:21] she ends it with a wedding
[1:27:23] oh think about it today oh you came
[1:27:27] worthless the devil wants to tell you
[1:27:29] you're worthless but I tell you you are
[1:27:32] in Heavenly places today oh your name is
[1:27:35] Miss Jesus Christ
[1:27:37] oh if we can realize our Authority today
[1:27:41] oh we're more than conquerors
[1:27:43] we puke every head brother brother uh
[1:27:46] brother Brown said another quote he said
[1:27:48] you need to tell the devil to give it
[1:27:49] back stop giving thanks to the devil
[1:27:53] oh I tell you I was telling Rachel it's
[1:27:55] like Amazon
[1:27:57] think about it you order Amazon did they
[1:27:59] ask you to sign for the package
[1:28:01] they just drop it off
[1:28:03] think about it oh it ain't certified he
[1:28:07] just drop it off in the front door and
[1:28:09] we just gladly take it but where are you
[1:28:11] checking the name
[1:28:13] think about it you grab the package you
[1:28:16] set it down and you start to open it you
[1:28:19] don't even look at the name
[1:28:21] oh that's the same thing the devil does
[1:28:23] in our life he drops things off in our
[1:28:26] life and you don't even check your name
[1:28:29] oh you should put Miss Jesus Christ on
[1:28:32] top of it every saint of hell would
[1:28:35] tremble every every depression every
[1:28:37] whatever you have this morning would
[1:28:39] fall
[1:28:40] even he said even brother Solomon said
[1:28:42] it's a drop nothing will be a drop in
[1:28:44] the book of the Cancer all right he said
[1:28:46] if you would only believe
[1:28:48] all things are possible
[1:28:50] oh if we could just get to a place where
[1:28:52] we could Channel our minds and our soul
[1:28:55] to only believe
[1:28:57] oh but we just accept the devil's
[1:29:00] packages
[1:29:01] we just say hey devil drop them off
[1:29:02] we'll take it
[1:29:04] but you know what good the prophet said
[1:29:05] in one place he said he won't do
[1:29:07] anything with it until you get done with
[1:29:09] it
[1:29:11] he said he'll take it and let you take
[1:29:13] it right back how many times do we in
[1:29:15] our lives we want to figure out the
[1:29:17] situation
[1:29:19] how many times do we want to take the
[1:29:20] situation brother Jack when brother
[1:29:22] Solomon we take this situation and we
[1:29:25] say Lord let us figure it out and God
[1:29:26] will give it back to you well hold on
[1:29:29] hold on let me fix that no he says give
[1:29:31] it all to me
[1:29:33] oh he will take care of the situation oh
[1:29:36] but we want to fix this or we want to
[1:29:38] make this right or we want to do this
[1:29:40] but no brother Brown says hey just give
[1:29:42] it all to him and he will fix it I'm
[1:29:45] thankful for that I'm paraphrasing today
[1:29:48] but what a picture of Amazing Grace
[1:29:51] this picture Bud Brown says in the
[1:29:53] king's a redeemer he said now what we
[1:29:55] what what did we did they do he said
[1:29:57] they got married and through they got
[1:30:00] this great thing then Ruth was rewarded
[1:30:02] but by by getting Christ he says getting
[1:30:06] Boaz for her husband he said which the
[1:30:09] church is rewarded by the coming of the
[1:30:12] Lord when the lord of the Lord shall
[1:30:14] come he said that bright and cloudless
[1:30:17] morning were resting we're waiting the
[1:30:20] prophet said we're resting we're waiting
[1:30:22] oh I believe that every morning we
[1:30:24] should be looking for is coming
[1:30:26] he said that between that six to nine
[1:30:28] hours and I'll tell you why every day we
[1:30:31] should be looking for his coming you
[1:30:33] know what we're always going to fail
[1:30:35] young kids were always going to fall but
[1:30:37] I tell you to get up
[1:30:39] don't stay in the mug in the Comerica
[1:30:42] when you make up when you make a failure
[1:30:44] just repentance say God I move on those
[1:30:48] people in brother Brown's lines out here
[1:30:50] they were coming through the lines and
[1:30:51] they were repent and they would say well
[1:30:53] you didn't call him out for that sin
[1:30:55] he'd go well I didn't never saw that sin
[1:30:57] it must have been under the blood
[1:31:00] oh think about it oh we just need to go
[1:31:03] let the devil start beating you up
[1:31:05] sometimes and say Lord I'm sorry I've
[1:31:07] done this I've done this Lord but God's
[1:31:10] grace is sufficient
[1:31:12] oh he's called us out this morning
[1:31:15] Barb says and God has provided a way he
[1:31:18] said no there's coming back he said have
[1:31:20] heard to come over and sit under the
[1:31:23] shade and eat some of the food with us
[1:31:24] oh if we had to put some emphasis on
[1:31:27] that notice Boaz looks upon her he says
[1:31:31] he sings She's singing it was a
[1:31:32] victorious woman big virtuous woman he
[1:31:36] says that she surely must been a
[1:31:38] Holiness oh so he walked around and said
[1:31:42] to all the Reapers he said now you
[1:31:44] brother says this when this young lady
[1:31:46] is coming behind you not letting her
[1:31:49] know it said but now when she's getting
[1:31:51] behind you every once in a while drop an
[1:31:54] extra handful so she can get it
[1:31:58] oh think about it that very service you
[1:32:01] missed could be the very handful purpose
[1:32:03] that you need that your kids need that
[1:32:07] your grandkids need oh I tell you he
[1:32:10] changed Moses in five minutes what could
[1:32:12] he do to you what can he do to your kids
[1:32:16] oh there's not a service we should try
[1:32:18] to miss if we can make it
[1:32:20] oh I'll tell you I understand if you're
[1:32:22] sick and you got to stream God bless you
[1:32:25] but if you can get out of the house of
[1:32:27] God there's been days brother Jack I
[1:32:29] ain't feel good Rachel's like I'm going
[1:32:31] to church and I'll sit there I'll just
[1:32:33] be honest and I'll say well and I'll say
[1:32:35] hold on honey let's go
[1:32:38] there's been time we go out of town we
[1:32:40] were somewhere and I we were doing some
[1:32:42] we were traveling night for service and
[1:32:44] she said what do you want to do tonight
[1:32:45] I said well let's go home I did I she'll
[1:32:47] tell you we're driving home all of a
[1:32:48] sudden I said oh let's go to church
[1:32:51] we had we had Sunday morning but we
[1:32:53] found the Sunday night service
[1:32:55] I'm not saying you had to do that but I
[1:32:57] tell you if it's inside of you you want
[1:33:00] to be around Believers you want to be
[1:33:02] around the cream of the crop you want to
[1:33:04] be where the devil can get off your life
[1:33:07] oh I tell you what that's where you find
[1:33:09] victory
[1:33:11] we don't get our Phillips at work we
[1:33:14] don't get our Phillips at the gas
[1:33:15] station but we get our Phillips in the
[1:33:18] house of God
[1:33:19] I tell you what we need more Phillips
[1:33:21] than Jesus Christ oh we got too many
[1:33:24] people in the message that drive by and
[1:33:26] say well I'll listen to this tape that's
[1:33:28] all I'll do
[1:33:30] I don't know why I'm going here
[1:33:33] but we just listen to a tape if that's
[1:33:35] good enough you know the devil uses that
[1:33:38] I have family or even their own family
[1:33:40] and things they get there and say well
[1:33:42] we'll just listen to this so we'll
[1:33:43] listen to that tape
[1:33:45] it's fine to listen to the tapes I'm not
[1:33:47] saying it's wrong with the tapes
[1:33:49] but but just to do that only
[1:33:53] and before you know it they're they're
[1:33:55] the devil's got them caught up at home
[1:33:57] or at their house on the couch in their
[1:33:59] pajamas
[1:34:00] think about it and before you know it
[1:34:03] they're they're sipping on coffee
[1:34:06] they're eating a piece of cake from last
[1:34:08] week and before you know it they're just
[1:34:11] sitting there not even a handful of
[1:34:13] purpose
[1:34:15] because there's something about when we
[1:34:17] get together
[1:34:19] oh when the spirit moves and brother
[1:34:22] Solomon brings the presence of God
[1:34:24] I tell you what there's something about
[1:34:26] our skin together

[1:36:00] that you know I'm not putting a b little
[1:36:01] in the virus but I'll tell you we need
[1:36:04] to put God higher than that virus higher

[1:36:31] take a situation and turn it so bad I'm
[1:36:34] way off my notes but he can take a
[1:36:36] situation and go to the airport and we
[1:36:38] look like dummies

[1:36:43] sudden you got to stand five the lady
[1:36:45] would stop me and go son you need to
[1:36:47] step back there we got the stickers

[1:36:59] sardine can and we're going to be two
[1:37:01] inches apart

[1:37:07] this morning he wants to say a bunch of
[1:37:10] lies that you need to be eight foot
[1:37:12] apart I say hey give me give me sign my
[1:37:15] brother he said lay hands on the sick in
[1:37:16] the shower covers

[1:37:21] breathe the same air and it's reconcinct
[1:37:24] people coughing and it goes right to
[1:37:25] your eye

[1:37:29] scene and I'll tell you never walked on
[1:37:31] a plane and you ever looked I always do
[1:37:33] this brother Jack always look who's
[1:37:34] flying the plane Rachel walks on she

[1:38:09] flip in the air three times she'll still
[1:38:11] be sleeping
[1:38:13] and before you know it I'm going down
[1:38:15] every single aisle praying for everybody
[1:38:17] they say so you need to put your belt on

[1:38:22] she'll tell you
[1:38:24] should tell you I don't know where I'm
[1:38:26] going this morning but Lord knows
[1:38:30] it's so so ridiculous what the devil
[1:38:33] wants to sell you
[1:38:34] he wants to sell us but but when he
[1:38:37] reached his hand down for us he's gave
[1:38:38] you every Divine gift yes
[1:38:40] he's gave you everything you have need
[1:38:43] of to get over there
[1:38:44] he's made you more than conquerors it
[1:38:47] says the bride has made herself ready
[1:38:49] oh and it takes preparation to get ready
[1:38:52] oh the bride you think about what she
[1:38:55] has to go through to get married it's I
[1:38:57] mean you brother Solomon your wife they
[1:38:59] do the weddings and take photos it's a
[1:39:01] lot of work it's endless hours of work
[1:39:05] what work are you putting in to get in
[1:39:08] what work are you doing to I'm not
[1:39:11] saying it's a work react but what are
[1:39:13] you doing to get in the word of God
[1:39:16] what are you preparing are you preparing
[1:39:18] to go home are you building your
[1:39:20] Treasures down here
[1:39:23] oh I thank God for it
[1:39:25] I thank God for the truth amen but I
[1:39:28] thought about you know we go through the
[1:39:30] airport sometimes and you get in there
[1:39:31] and the devil wants to say you hey will
[1:39:33] you stand this far apart and you do this
[1:39:35] and I'm telling you Rachel will tell you
[1:39:36] we were flying somewhere right in covert
[1:39:38] and this guy was laying literally on my
[1:39:40] Shore snoring
[1:39:41] but she wouldn't let me stand seven feet
[1:39:43] apart or six feet apart and boy I
[1:39:46] started praying for him for a sudden I
[1:39:47] said like this moved them out of my way
[1:39:49] but so many times the devil wants to lay
[1:39:52] on your shoulder
[1:39:54] yeah he wants to lay in your life and
[1:39:57] say you know what you need the Holy
[1:39:58] Ghost you know what he's not for you
[1:40:02] he wants to tell you your sickness today
[1:40:04] you can hold on to it oh but I tell you
[1:40:07] this morning to rebuke Satan and all his
[1:40:10] tricks from Satan of hell because he's
[1:40:12] called you out you are more than
[1:40:14] conquerors he's called you out but the
[1:40:18] problem is we carry our baggage too much
[1:40:21] we get to the airport and we carry the
[1:40:24] baggage a lot of y'all I'll tell you I
[1:40:26] love when I check it in and throw it at
[1:40:27] the belt and I was like you know what
[1:40:29] but we got to get actually we get to the
[1:40:31] Belt how we're leaving then when you get
[1:40:32] that 50 pounds off of you but some of us
[1:40:35] want to check our bag and you keep it
[1:40:36] with us
[1:40:38] think about it we want to keep our our
[1:40:40] anxiety and all our depression and
[1:40:43] everything we got today and we want to
[1:40:45] hold on to it
[1:40:47] when the devil says rebuke their spirits
[1:40:50] oh Lay Your Hands on the sick
[1:40:52] I'll tell you you got to realize who you
[1:40:54] are today
[1:40:55] I'm just here this morning to remind you
[1:40:57] who you are you're a child of God no
[1:41:00] matter what color it wasn't going to
[1:41:01] shape whatever you come from who your
[1:41:04] mother is our father is the king all of
[1:41:07] our father is the king this morning
[1:41:10] I'm thankful for that
[1:41:12] the prophet of God says in the redeeming
[1:41:14] Redemption he said look Don't Run Away
[1:41:16] stay in Christ
[1:41:18] he said don't go after gifts and
[1:41:20] everything stay with the giver he said
[1:41:23] God will take care of the gifts stay
[1:41:25] there yes he said stay in the field he
[1:41:28] said pick up a few of the gleaning
[1:41:30] behind he said don't you leave this
[1:41:33] field he says stay right here I believe
[1:41:36] that's the day we're living in I see
[1:41:38] people leaving here and leaving there
[1:41:39] saying well this message was true you
[1:41:42] know what it's always true
[1:41:44] I'm like sister how do you write this is
[1:41:46] nothing but saith the Lord I tell you

[1:45:06] left he he let fall on some of the
[1:45:08] handfuls of purpose and he and leave
[1:45:10] them and she made glean and rebuke her
[1:45:12] not
[1:45:13] and verse 18 and she took it up and went
[1:45:16] into the City and her mother and law saw
[1:45:19] what she had gleaned and she brought
[1:45:22] forth and gave to her and she had
[1:45:24] reserved after she was sufficed think
[1:45:27] about it I'll tell you this morning you
[1:45:29] get suffice first
[1:45:31] then you share it with others
[1:45:33] you know what she got sufficed and then
[1:45:36] she shared it with her mother-in-law
[1:45:38] oh don't share something that you don't
[1:45:40] have
[1:45:41] when you get filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:43] and he becomes Your Life share it with
[1:45:45] others
[1:45:46] share with someone you think hey they
[1:45:48] might not look the parts
[1:45:50] they might not have the dress and the
[1:45:52] hair and all this but guess what we're
[1:45:54] still looking for that wine
[1:45:57] I'll tell you I was once in that world
[1:45:59] shaped in iniquity
[1:46:00] speaking lies
[1:46:02] but God I tell you God grace rich in
[1:46:05] Mercy is calling people out
[1:46:07] he's calling I'll tell you we're living
[1:46:09] in a gleanful time today oh we need to
[1:46:12] glean on everything we can with the Holy
[1:46:14] ghost-filled pastor
[1:46:16] with a church that's got a backbone
[1:46:18] today that's standing strong for the
[1:46:21] word of God that stand is strong for the
[1:46:23] message of the hour
[1:46:26] oh I thank you Lord but think about it
[1:46:29] just to bring it back a little bit in
[1:46:30] verse 1 chapter 1 of Ruth just to lay a
[1:46:34] little Foundation think about it she
[1:46:36] came from a for it came from famine was
[1:46:38] in the land verse one he said she was in
[1:46:40] famine in the land in this verse 1 and
[1:46:42] it says a certain man in Bethlehem Judah
[1:46:45] went to sojourn in the country of Moab
[1:46:48] and it also means wash pots and his wife
[1:46:52] two sons think about it and then verse
[1:46:54] two it says the name of the man was
[1:46:56] amalek in the name of his wife Naomi and
[1:46:58] think about it they had two sons think
[1:47:00] about this verse 3 and amalek Naomi's
[1:47:04] husband died and she left her two sons
[1:47:06] and he took the wives verse four he took
[1:47:09] his wives of the woman of Moab and the
[1:47:12] name one was orpa and then the other one
[1:47:13] was Ruth and then you got the two sons
[1:47:16] macalon and Chilean died think about
[1:47:18] that they both died
[1:47:20] and I'm going to tell you when you get
[1:47:21] to a place of famine in your life when
[1:47:24] you get the place to of a spiritual
[1:47:26] deadness in your life I'll tell you it's
[1:47:28] a time to start praying
[1:47:30] it's a time to get back to the Altar and
[1:47:33] say Lord fill me up
[1:47:35] I'll tell you don't make decisions in a
[1:47:37] time of famine
[1:47:39] don't make decisions when your family's
[1:47:41] going through hard times
[1:47:43] oh trust God
[1:47:45] it's a time to to hunker down and
[1:47:48] believe God with all your heart you're
[1:47:50] going to go through times of valleys
[1:47:52] times of mountaintops but when you're
[1:47:55] going through the valleys in a time of
[1:47:56] famine just keep trusting God
[1:47:59] just keep trusting God
[1:48:02] think about it they died and they
[1:48:04] returned by the verse 8 and they only
[1:48:06] said unto her sons of two
[1:48:07] daughters-in-law go return to their
[1:48:09] mother's house and the Lord dealt kindly
[1:48:12] with thee with you as you have dwelt
[1:48:15] with the dead and with me but verse go
[1:48:17] verse 11. and Naomi said turn again my
[1:48:21] daughters
[1:48:22] he says why will you go with me she said
[1:48:24] hey why would you go with me I can't
[1:48:26] have any more signs I can't have any
[1:48:28] what are you what do I have I can give
[1:48:30] you it's what she's saying verse 14 and
[1:48:33] she lifted up her voice and went
[1:48:34] beginning Arbor kissed her mother-in-law
[1:48:36] by Ruth clavon to her
[1:48:39] verse and that's us today it says and
[1:48:42] and she said behold thy sister-in-law is
[1:48:44] gone back to her people and into her
[1:48:47] gods
[1:48:48] think about it one of them went with her
[1:48:51] and one of them went back out to the
[1:48:53] world
[1:48:54] think about it
[1:48:56] she going back into the people into her
[1:48:58] gods and returned now to their
[1:48:59] sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me
[1:49:02] not to leave thee or to return from the
[1:49:05] following entity for whether thou goest
[1:49:07] I will go
[1:49:09] because she knew who her God was
[1:49:12] think about it she said we're the
[1:49:14] largest I will Lodge thy people shall be
[1:49:17] my people and thy God be my God that's
[1:49:21] where we gotta get in our life if you're
[1:49:23] the only one standing he's still your
[1:49:25] God
[1:49:27] a matter for the last message Church
[1:49:29] standing here in West Palm Beach he
[1:49:31] still are God
[1:49:33] that's where we got to get no matter how
[1:49:36] many people I believe that's how it is
[1:49:37] today we got message people turn into
[1:49:39] the left going to the world it's because
[1:49:42] it never became a revelation to him
[1:49:45] it was just a head knowledge it's got to
[1:49:48] be more than a head knowledge there's
[1:49:50] got to be something on the inside that
[1:49:53] gives you Revelation and brother bear
[1:49:55] says pray for Revelation more than
[1:49:57] anything
[1:49:58] I say Lord give us more revelation
[1:50:01] reveal it to us Lord
[1:50:03] verse 17 it says where thou dieest I
[1:50:06] will die and there where I'll be buried
[1:50:08] the Lord do so with me and more so and
[1:50:11] if ought be death be part part thee of
[1:50:14] me he says oh when Verse 18 when she saw
[1:50:18] that she was steadfastly minded whole
[1:50:21] church we got to get steadfastly minded
[1:50:24] oh when she saw she was steadfastly
[1:50:27] minded to go with her then she left
[1:50:29] speaking unto her
[1:50:30] man oh well what does God do with our
[1:50:32] lives we say we believe this truth we
[1:50:35] say we believe this but we got to be
[1:50:37] steadfastly minded
[1:50:39] oh no matter if our kids leave our
[1:50:42] family leaves our wife leaves we still
[1:50:44] believe in his church
[1:50:47] oh it's nothing but the truth amen but
[1:50:50] we got to stay steadfastly minded you're
[1:50:52] going to go through roller coasters in
[1:50:53] life you're going to go through valleys
[1:50:55] you're going to go through mountaintops
[1:50:57] but I'll tell you do the mountain think
[1:50:59] about it sometimes through the valley
[1:51:01] it's a lot better of you because you can
[1:51:03] look up and see everything that you're
[1:51:06] going through but then when you get up
[1:51:07] to the top all you see is just clear
[1:51:09] skies but sometimes I love when he
[1:51:11] brings us to the mountain Through The
[1:51:12] Valleys in our lives and you send you
[1:51:14] when you get up to the mountain you look
[1:51:16] back down and see what he's brought you
[1:51:17] through
[1:51:18] oh I'm thankful for that today I'm
[1:51:21] thankful because he's he I was really
[1:51:23] listening a message this morning he's
[1:51:25] shaping our Victory this morning our
[1:51:27] character is our Victory this morning
[1:51:30] and he said that's the only thing you're
[1:51:31] going to take with you is your character
[1:51:33] I say Lord help me Lord to have a
[1:51:36] character like you
[1:51:39] so think about it she came from Moab she
[1:51:41] came from a place uh she came from
[1:51:43] Bethlehem a house of praise is what it
[1:51:46] means she was in a a place just like us
[1:51:49] a MOAB a place of sin a place where lot
[1:51:52] was a place of bad sudden condition
[1:51:55] within God but but then God sent a
[1:51:58] kinsman redeemer
[1:51:59] he's done the same thing with you this
[1:52:01] morning
[1:52:02] he sent you a kinsman redeemer to pull
[1:52:05] you from from the worlds of sin oh we're
[1:52:08] still of the worlds tell a boy the other
[1:52:10] day I said Son we're still of this world
[1:52:12] I said but we're not of the world
[1:52:15] I said aren't you thankful son that he
[1:52:17] called us out
[1:52:18] aren't you thankful I said Son you love
[1:52:20] the word of God in this message more
[1:52:22] than you love me
[1:52:24] I said when you get a revelation of that
[1:52:26] us his son no Gates of Hell will prevail
[1:52:31] but I thought about I like what the
[1:52:33] Bible says it says in verse 1 it said
[1:52:36] verse chapter one it said Ruth was
[1:52:37] deciding in the topic number two Ruth
[1:52:41] had to serve think about it she had to
[1:52:44] serve she had to go in the fields and
[1:52:46] glean and they dropped a handful of
[1:52:48] purpose verse chapter three for time it
[1:52:50] said Ruth rested
[1:52:53] she rested at his feet oh sometimes that
[1:52:56] would do us some good to go through all
[1:52:57] these four chapters it ain't long
[1:52:59] but to rest in Jesus Christ
[1:53:02] oh when you're going through a trial
[1:53:04] don't get all upset and get out of been
[1:53:06] out of shape but just say Lord I'm
[1:53:07] rested in your wings
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:10] I'll tell you we were driving here
[1:53:11] brother Jack and we were driving down
[1:53:12] the road
[1:53:13] probably shouldn't say this but I'm
[1:53:15] going to say it so we're driving down
[1:53:16] the road
[1:53:17] and there's these buzzers in the road
[1:53:20] I didn't know how slow they moved
[1:53:23] but I started driving towards them
[1:53:25] this Eagle started driving towards
[1:53:27] buzzards and I was driving towards them
[1:53:30] and I didn't let off the gas I didn't
[1:53:32] speed up but I didn't let off and I was
[1:53:34] like you don't move and literally one
[1:53:36] just said it was like five of them it
[1:53:39] felt like a bowling ball hit the hit the
[1:53:40] car Rachel said Chris them things are
[1:53:42] like hidden deer
[1:53:43] I said well you know what that's okay
[1:53:45] didn't move out of the way but a lot of
[1:53:47] times that's like the devil in their
[1:53:49] lives
[1:53:50] that's like the devil is our lives we
[1:53:51] let these buzzers get around us but I
[1:53:54] tell you we're more than a buzzard this
[1:53:56] morning you're an eagle this morning
[1:53:58] he's called you to live higher and you
[1:54:01] know how slow they move I didn't realize
[1:54:03] how slow they move they literally when I
[1:54:05] got into it Brother Jay that thing said
[1:54:07] like this thing like that but you're an
[1:54:09] eagle this morning you're so higher than
[1:54:12] any sin any disease any cancer whatever
[1:54:15] you have this morning you fly higher
[1:54:18] than these buzzers
[1:54:19] [Applause]
[1:54:21] but I thought about it this morning when
[1:54:22] I was driving I said Lord thank you
[1:54:24] Jesus I hit that thing and the one went
[1:54:26] flying where it would fly these cars
[1:54:28] were looking at me like Lord he just hit
[1:54:30] the big old buzzer
[1:54:32] I said y'all don't understand we're
[1:54:33] Eagles today get the buzzers out of the
[1:54:36] way get them out of the road I said get
[1:54:39] the trash out of the road when the
[1:54:41] Eagles are coming to church oh but
[1:54:44] that's what our life is you're more than
[1:54:46] a buzzard this morning you're an eagle
[1:54:49] and he's called you to live higher amen
[1:54:52] oh but it was easy eating carcasses and
[1:54:54] eating no dead stuff but I tell you you
[1:54:57] got Heavenly manner today
[1:54:59] you got heavily married every message
[1:55:01] everybody from Jesus to Revelation has
[1:55:05] been revealed to you
[1:55:07] oh but so far so far higher than these
[1:55:10] buzzers I don't know the Lord was going
[1:55:13] to use that this morning I don't know
[1:55:14] how but I said Lord you're going to use
[1:55:16] it you spoke to me Rachel thought well
[1:55:19] my is that rental car okay I said that's
[1:55:22] why you take insurance out
[1:55:25] praise God
[1:55:27] but I tell you what we're flying higher
[1:55:29] than these buzzers
[1:55:31] but I just thought about it for a minute
[1:55:33] I just said man they got to be faster
[1:55:34] than that Rachel said they're not fast
[1:55:37] they're real slow they're sluggish but
[1:55:40] that's how the devil's Spirit wants to
[1:55:42] get on you he wants to just get on you
[1:55:44] real slow he wants to put a TV in your
[1:55:47] house he wants to put Facebook all over
[1:55:50] your life
[1:55:51] oh think about it he wants to slowly
[1:55:54] work little sins in your life
[1:55:56] think about it how the devil just wants
[1:55:59] to slowly say it's okay Mommy it's okay
[1:56:02] to play these games all the time
[1:56:04] before you know it you're not even
[1:56:05] reading your Bible you're not even
[1:56:07] listening to the messages because he's
[1:56:10] slow he's slow at putting things in your
[1:56:12] life one by one
[1:56:14] but I tell you we got to rebuke
[1:56:16] everything that's in our house I'll tell
[1:56:18] you everyone was some good to go home
[1:56:20] and do a house cleaning
[1:56:22] get the spirit out of our house get
[1:56:24] things off our wall and put things that
[1:56:26] that only Rejoice but I'm saying you
[1:56:28] could go by a person's house or read his
[1:56:30] Bible and tell you where he stood
[1:56:33] Paul where do you stand this morning
[1:56:35] oh but the Bible says in John 15 12-20
[1:56:39] 12-13 he said that this Commandment that
[1:56:42] you love one another as I Loved You
[1:56:45] greater love that no man than this to
[1:56:49] lay down his life for his friends think
[1:56:51] about it he laid his life down for me
[1:56:53] and you
[1:56:54] how thankful we should be
[1:56:57] but like I said I read in verse 2 it's
[1:57:00] suffice she was suffice after she she
[1:57:02] gleaned all day and they dropped a
[1:57:04] handful of purpose it met every need she
[1:57:06] had think about it this morning
[1:57:09] uh Matthew 5 6. I was writing these down
[1:57:12] and said blessed are those who hunger
[1:57:14] and thirst for righteousness for they
[1:57:15] shall be filled
[1:57:17] Psalms 42 1 as the heart painteth after
[1:57:20] the water books so pain of my soul after
[1:57:23] thee oh that's going to be our life this
[1:57:26] morning
[1:57:27] but number two when she reached on her
[1:57:29] hand she was filled up
[1:57:31] I wrote that down this morning when she
[1:57:34] reached on her hand she was filled up oh
[1:57:37] he's filling you up more than you think
[1:57:38] this morning oh it might be simple this
[1:57:41] morning but he's filling your life up
[1:57:43] he's filling you up
[1:57:45] he's getting you filled up to share it
[1:57:47] with someone else
[1:57:49] oh think about it the prophet that God
[1:57:51] says he says do you see that young lady
[1:57:53] that's right behind you oh let the
[1:57:56] gleaning be heavy
[1:57:58] every once in a while drop a handful of
[1:58:00] purpose Prophet says I love those
[1:58:02] handfuls don't you he said gleaning
[1:58:05] behind the Reapers he said drop a
[1:58:07] handful of purpose that she could get it
[1:58:09] he said oh how Ruth felt when she
[1:58:12] grabbed the whole handful
[1:58:14] amen he said the reaper turned around
[1:58:16] and said it's all right he said it's all
[1:58:19] right oh when God gives you an
[1:58:21] old-fashioned pouring out of the Holy
[1:58:23] Spirit a handful he said do it on
[1:58:26] purpose

[1:58:30] after that the day was over she beat out
[1:58:33] all of her wheat
[1:58:35] and put it he said she'd put it in her
[1:58:37] little apron and brother Brown says
[1:58:39] until he took it to her mother-in-law
[1:58:42] and her mother-in-law advised her he
[1:58:45] says if you want to find out advice on
[1:58:48] how to how to do it Paul said after
[1:58:50] giving in Hebrews chapter 10 the great

[1:58:59] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:59:02] every weight every sin and run for the
[1:59:04] race with patience that set before us

[1:59:10] way in sin rather that so easy besets us
[1:59:13] and run with patience

[2:01:23] didn't take Boaz Boaz took Ruth
[2:01:26] the same thing Jesus done with you today
[2:01:28] he chose you from the foundation of the
[2:01:31] world he took you as your bride
[2:01:34] oh so Boaz took roof that she was with
[2:01:36] his wife and when she went up with her
[2:01:38] and the lord gave her conception that
[2:01:41] she bear a son

[2:06:48] churches are in here but they would do
[2:06:50] anything to have the key that unlocks
[2:06:52] the door
[2:06:53] I thought about it brother the church's
[2:06:56] name is perfect spirit and Truth I'm so
[2:06:59] thankful for it
[2:07:02] when you grow up with a family that
[2:07:03] doesn't believe God and never believed
[2:07:06] God they drop you off on Sunday or
[2:07:08] Easter and whatever they call it Easter
[2:07:10] in uh Thanksgiving or whatever it was
[2:07:12] Christmas
[2:07:13] they drop you off just a special service
[2:07:16] and Dad will drop you off and he'd come
[2:07:18] back and say hey call me when you're
[2:07:19] ready
[2:07:20] I looked at the boys last night we're at
[2:07:22] the banquet we're at the youth banquet
[2:07:23] brother Jack
[2:07:24] and I started weeping
[2:07:27] and I said Lord I Thank you for letting
[2:07:29] me have the truth
[2:07:31] thank you for saving my soul because my
[2:07:34] son wouldn't be in the atmosphere today
[2:07:37] I said if it wasn't for the grace of God
[2:07:40] he would be out in the world
[2:07:42] it wouldn't be the grace of God I
[2:07:44] wouldn't have him in this atmosphere and
[2:07:46] I told Rachel I'll drive every single
[2:07:48] mall that I have to to keep them in the
[2:07:50] presence of God that keep them around
[2:07:53] Believers as long as I can live
[2:07:57] hey I tell you young kids you stay
[2:07:59] around godly people amen I don't know
[2:08:02] where your skills schools you're in or
[2:08:04] where you're at but you know what you're
[2:08:05] living a higher age
[2:08:07] you're Eagles this morning you don't
[2:08:10] have to listen to that trash in the
[2:08:11] schools they do
[2:08:13] I don't know why I'm going here but I
[2:08:14] tell you I tell you this you live a
[2:08:16] higher life than that
[2:08:18] don't live around them kids that talk
[2:08:20] bad and talk trash
[2:08:22] that want to de-ground the Bible and I
[2:08:25] tell you they don't have no godliness at
[2:08:27] all anymore
[2:08:29] imagine what our school looks like today
[2:08:31] we picked up a god brother of the other
[2:08:34] day and he got the car hey God bless you
[2:08:35] if you got to take them or wherever you
[2:08:36] got to take them each to your own but we
[2:08:38] picked up this brother the other day he
[2:08:40] looked at me he was doing homeschool he
[2:08:41] got in the back seat I said how's school
[2:08:43] going he said Chris it's terrible
[2:08:45] he was probably what 12 years old
[2:08:48] 12 years old he said Chris is terrible
[2:08:50] the things I hear the things I see he
[2:08:52] said it's law they lost everything a 12
[2:08:55] year old
[2:08:57] and I looked at them and I said brother
[2:08:58] and he said brother I need the Holy
[2:09:00] Ghost more than ever
[2:09:02] he said brother Chris pray that I get
[2:09:03] the Holy Ghost he said because I won't
[2:09:06] make it
[2:09:07] a 12 year old look at me in my eyes and
[2:09:09] said in this ate up World in these ate
[2:09:12] up school systems he said Chris they're
[2:09:13] training us in a way to do to worship
[2:09:16] Satan
[2:09:17] and it really just tore my heart out
[2:09:21] so I'll tell you protect your kids
[2:09:24] protect them today
[2:09:26] surround them by godly people
[2:09:29] and you know what we're all going to
[2:09:30] make mistakes I'm going to make a steak
[2:09:32] brother Jack's going to make mistake
[2:09:33] brother Solomon all of us are going to
[2:09:35] make mistakes
[2:09:37] but you know what you get back up
[2:09:39] and you know what there's no perfect
[2:09:41] Church
[2:09:43] you're gonna come in some days you're
[2:09:45] gonna get upset and you're gonna leave
[2:09:47] and you're gonna think well I ain't
[2:09:48] going back there
[2:09:49] but you know what you go back to Walmart
[2:09:51] every time someone makes you upset
[2:09:54] [Applause]
[2:09:55] think about it you go to Publix when
[2:09:58] someone makes you upset
[2:10:00] you go through there they make you mad
[2:10:02] you're back there shopping next week
[2:10:05] I don't know why I'm going here but I'm
[2:10:06] here to tell you I tell you we're all
[2:10:08] unperfect people
[2:10:10] but I tell you when we're in his
[2:10:12] presence he's made us Perfect by the
[2:10:14] blood
[2:10:15] he's made you perfect this morning by
[2:10:17] the block
[2:10:19] oh I tell you you can find the steaks
[2:10:21] find excuses in everyone's life but I
[2:10:23] tell you the closer you get to God
[2:10:26] the more you look to the cross
[2:10:29] when I see you I see Perfect People
[2:10:33] I see children of God
[2:10:35] oh I see the boy When I Look to You I
[2:10:38] see children of God that's going to make
[2:10:40] it oh I tell you the closer you get to
[2:10:43] God your eyes to become like that
[2:10:46] right oh you don't look at your brother
[2:10:47] and sister and Bash them in the ground
[2:10:50] when they're going through a hard time
[2:10:51] you pick a phone up and say hey can I do
[2:10:53] anything for you
[2:10:55] then call sister and say hey you know
[2:10:56] what she did last week
[2:10:58] or what they did last week you know why
[2:11:00] don't you call them up and say hey hey
[2:11:02] I'm sorry you're going through this but
[2:11:04] hey what can I do for you
[2:11:07] that's where we are should be in our
[2:11:09] life
[2:11:10] oh we're called to a higher living
[2:11:13] but when he reached down he changed
[2:11:15] their future think about it she came
[2:11:17] from Moab and then she marries she
[2:11:20] marries Ruth and it saves her whole
[2:11:22] family think about it Caesar Caesar
[2:11:25] mother-in-law and everybody and I'm
[2:11:27] thankful for that we'll read this
[2:11:30] we're about to close I'm gonna read this
[2:11:33] she goes I wrote this down she goes from
[2:11:35] a nobody in Moab to a name to a true
[2:11:38] name
[2:11:39] think about it she had she had the son
[2:11:41] of a Obed
[2:11:43] and then the son of Jesse and then the
[2:11:44] son of David think about the lineage she
[2:11:46] started
[2:11:47] Think About by surrendering her life to
[2:11:50] Jesus and letting Boaz become her uh her
[2:11:53] Kinsmen and he only he took a Kinsman
[2:11:55] and I brought this this morning and it
[2:11:57] was in my Bible I just felt like it was
[2:11:59] timely this is Brother branham's notes
[2:12:01] on the woman at the well and the
[2:12:03] Pharisees
[2:12:04] and it shows brother Brown when he wrote
[2:12:06] it out he shows the Pharisees how they
[2:12:09] got to Jesus but they didn't go no
[2:12:11] farther
[2:12:12] but think about the woman that the whale
[2:12:13] all sinned ate up she got through the
[2:12:16] she got through Jesus but she went
[2:12:18] through the Bible and the word she went
[2:12:20] all the way
[2:12:22] and that's the difference of brother
[2:12:23] Brown's notes this is actually brother
[2:12:24] Brown's notes that I got it says it
[2:12:26] shows the woman of the well she got all
[2:12:28] the way to the word
[2:12:30] she didn't just stop at his Works she
[2:12:33] didn't just stop she believed on him she
[2:12:35] believed for her salvation
[2:12:38] and that's where you got to get this
[2:12:40] morning you got to get to that spot in
[2:12:42] your life brother Branham where he
[2:12:43] brought up the Pharisees all they could
[2:12:45] see was works but she went all the way
[2:12:47] all the way in Jesus Christ
[2:12:50] oh she was ate up but I'm thankful that
[2:12:52] this morning that we go all the way in
[2:12:55] Christ
[2:12:56] and that's what God's doing today he's
[2:12:57] calling you out he's called every one of
[2:13:00] us out and no matter what you go through
[2:13:02] I'm not if I'm not back for a year or
[2:13:03] whenever I tell you to keep pressing on
[2:13:06] keep pressing on it's a tough time
[2:13:10] every devil in hell is pointed at you
[2:13:13] but I tell you greater is he that's in
[2:13:16] me
[2:13:17] as the musicians come
[2:13:20] greater is he that's in me the he that's
[2:13:22] in the world
[2:13:23] aren't you thankful for that the prophet
[2:13:26] that God says like he says this
[2:13:28] he said he said it's not of the world
[2:13:30] system even as we are not of this world
[2:13:32] he said that's the reason we act
[2:13:34] different from the world our citizenship
[2:13:37] is in heaven
[2:13:39] we reflect the spirit of the world of
[2:13:42] our rebirth where Jesus is the king
[2:13:45] he said that is why our women and our
[2:13:48] men women do not dress in men's clothing
[2:13:50] or cut the hair cosmetics and then he
[2:13:52] goes on say every Kingdom on Earth is
[2:13:55] going to be torn down but ours will
[2:13:57] remain
[2:13:59] aren't you thankful for that
[2:14:01] as they play something Softly
[2:14:04] I pray there was something that was said
[2:14:06] this morning maybe just with our eyes
[2:14:08] closed for a minute
[2:14:11] how thankful we should be this morning
[2:14:14] how thankful we should be for a Kinsmen
[2:14:16] Redeemer
[2:14:17] how he's called us out
[2:14:21] how he's called us help maybe there's
[2:14:23] someone that is telling my voice young
[2:14:25] old middle age
[2:14:26] we just lift their hands and say Lord
[2:14:29] fill me with the Holy Spirit
[2:14:31] oh God my hands are up Lord
[2:14:34] oh Father may you fill us afresh this
[2:14:37] morning

[2:22:06] I wanted to just say something
[2:22:09] encouraging to those that might be going
[2:22:10] through a little something in your body
[2:22:13] brother Chris read a quote there this
[2:22:17] morning
[2:22:18] brother Branham made a statement he said
[2:22:21] the Lord Jesus was sick like we are
[2:22:27] and you imagine you know just Jesus he's
[2:22:30] the one that's going around healing
[2:22:31] everybody and you can never see him as
[2:22:34] being sick but the prophet a man goes
[2:22:38] into a deeper Channel and says he was
[2:22:41] sick just like we are
[2:22:44] and um in in the scripture that he
[2:22:47] applied to it is where Jesus says people
[2:22:50] say physician heal thyself
[2:22:56] don't let the devil tell you you ain't
[2:22:58] got faith
[2:22:59] [Music]
[2:23:01] don't ever let the devil tell
[2:23:04] got faith it's just simply that we have
[2:23:07] to go through certain things but we
[2:23:09] still apply to blood we still believe
[2:23:11] God for our healing amen we're going to
[2:23:14] praise him while we're waiting on our
[2:23:16] healing
[2:23:17] praise God Amen but don't let the devil
[2:23:20] uh uh uh try to rob you of your faith
[2:23:23] eat our Lord and savior had to go
[2:23:26] through things just like we did and this
[2:23:29] is why the Bible says he's able to
[2:23:30] secure
[2:23:32] he's able to help those because he
[2:23:35] understands exactly what you've got what
[2:23:37] you're going through my God my God that
[2:23:40] was that was that was life-giving amen
[2:23:42] just just seeing that little statement
[2:23:44] there from the prophet that was very
[2:23:46] life-giving amen and I know it was for
[2:23:48] me I I I've been criticized for a man
[2:23:52] taking medicine amen like what you get
[2:23:56] credit I said well I say all I can say
[2:23:58] is anything
[2:24:00] [Music]
[2:24:02] the health the human race
[2:24:05] is Godly
[2:24:07] brother random say burn that burn up the
[2:24:09] hospitals if it ain't Godly if it's not
[2:24:12] helping a human race just burn them up
[2:24:14] right let's say anything we got the
[2:24:16] approach thing so sensibly
[2:24:19] amen you just keep pressing on keep
[2:24:21] claiming your healing keep claiming it
[2:24:23] by faith God will manifest he was
[2:24:25] wounded for your transgressions he was
[2:24:27] bruised for your iniquities amen the
[2:24:31] chastise gonna get pieces upon him and
[2:24:33] with his stripes you are healed
[2:24:37] keep confessing it until it manifests in
[2:24:40] your body but don't let the devil amen
[2:24:43] try to weaken your faith until you ain't
[2:24:45] got no faith the devil is a liar
[2:24:47] even my Lord went through some of the
[2:24:49] things I'm going through
[2:24:51] amen and he was king of kings and Lord
[2:24:53] of lords oh Almighty all powerful he was
