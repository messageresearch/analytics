actually your faithfulness lord jesus but just move upon the people tonight bless your word lord and move all flesh out of the way forgive us for our sins lord anything in our life that's not like you lord let us have a invisible union in you tonight in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray that church say amen amen we will jump right into the word let's turn to um the book of numbers the 14th chapter you know what let's back up to 13 and um verse um verse 31 numbers 13 and 31. if you ever say man the bible says but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land though which we have gone to search it is a land that either the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great statue and and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight now they were afraid of the giants who had enough courage to go talk to them and see how they look in the eyes chapter 14 verse 1 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of israel mumbled against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this wilderness let's go to job chapter 3. and i just want to read um let's read verse 25. the bible says for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that which i was afraid of is come unto me amen may the lord a blessing to reading of his word you can have your seats and i just want to quote another verse of scripture as you're sitting first john chapter 4 and 18 he said there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear have torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love amen tonight i'm sure you can tell by the scriptures i've read that we're going to be talking about fear tonight you know and and we want to kind of make it in a statement to tell each and every one of you tonight cast down fear you know because god has not given us the spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind but if we examine the believer you know and if we would just uh look at the scriptures real quick if we go and i'm gonna kind of backtrack a little bit but if i go if we go back to the book of numbers right here and we see the children of israel you know the whole reason the whole reason how they got to the land to see the giants was based upon believing god's promise you know and i think sometimes we get we get uh um a little bit overzealous on the journey where we see things not going our way but one thing you got to realize if you find yourself in a certain place and you backtrack and you're here was that step a step of faith or fear and for them to get to the promised land was a step of faith but they brought fear with them so if we think about a church how often us as believers we supposed to be creatures of faith but we're bringing fear with us and it's too many times that we change god's testimony based upon our own imaginations of fear now if you look right here uh if we just go to chapter 13 uh by god's grace you know um they clearly said i'm just kind of paraphrased but they clearly said uh in verse 27 he said they told him and said in chapter in chapter 13 they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sent us and surely look at that they speaking faith right now they went into the land whether thou sent us and surely surely without a doubt surely god what you promised surely god what i seen truly god what i heard it is there there's no doubt it's there i don't care what they say about the message surely it's there i've tasted it i've held it i put it in my hands i've seen god do it surely church this is their testimony they're speaking faith right now why because they see what god promised them hallelujah church how often do we see what god promised us but we get a little discouraged on the journey and then we change he says surely it flowed with milk and honey he had the evidence of the promise not just them but every even the ones that brought up a false report surely those that are saying that malachi 4 was a prophet surely they seen it they see it some of the preachers then gave testimonies about what god has done surely surely the lamb floored with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it church not only did they see it they brought it back it's time for us to stop doubting god hallelujah god has done so many great things for us he's given us evidence he's giving us proof we're bringing it back to church church you think about this you are not to be discouraged hallelujah you have to be discouraged god has done great things for the people of god what is another church building to god [Music] he owns a cat on a thousand heels hallelujah i was in trinidad one time and i made that statement and i said i said i said god our god owns a count of a thousand hills and i said y'all ain't got that y'all i said y'all don't have that idea in trinidad and the brother looked at me he said brother d that statement now we have a lot of hills i say but do you got cattle on it you got to heal but do you have all the characteristics that makes up god see that's what we want holy we want everyone every portion of god we want all the things of god but church you look by god's grace i'm gonna be too long tonight y'all know i'm about to close now just as fast as they spoke faith look at the next verse it says nevertheless the people be strong they haven't even fought a battle yet where is it coming from where is the strip coming from hallelujah they be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walls and very great and moreover we saw the children of attic that was the problem they hadn't fought anybody but the problem was the imagination of the eyes took over their destiny don't let your eyes take over your destiny because surely they believe what god said but in the next verse they're looking at what they saw in the land and it changed their whole thought not only their thought it changed their perception of who god is how often because of what we see in the natural changes who we are in the spirit amen cast down fear because of fear they hadn't even fought a battle yet and they said the cities are great the children of anak are there that was the whole problem the problem was hollywood look they had all the evidence they had the fruit everything that god said was true but because the children of anarch were there because it wasn't something they had to fight for because they had to fight for it it changed the whole complexity of the promise holy but god does that on purpose god will promise you something and then he wants you to fight for it why because you fight for it and win that'll deal with your fear hallelujah if you fight and win when you go to the next battle you go with a testimony that i can do this hardly that's what david did by the time he got to goliath he didn't have no fear why because he already defeated a lion and a bear holy his fears were already overcome in those two testimonies hallelujah so it wasn't church david's strength that defeated goliath it was his testimony hallelujah so cast down your fears and step back into your testimony because you know i was preaching a message at the home church and my title was i seen them do it you can't come to me and tell me god ain't no healer i've seen them do it you can't tell me god can't create a child i see them do it you can't tell me god can't put checks in the mail i see them do it hallelujah you can't tell me in a pill of fire i see them do it you can't tell me angela a provider i see them do it [Music] this is a time where you are to be celebrating your god y'all got to be afraid church we seen him do it he is still jehovah let me let me get away from that let me get away from that but church look look at this verse chapter 13 look at them now that first they had a testimony of faith then they go into a testimony of fear but then it took a believable to come in verse 30 saying caleb steal the people before moses and said let us go up at once let's get all this fear out to camp let's get all this fear out of the church we have seen god do some great things see there has to be somebody in the midst of the people that can steal the people hardly when you see things going on in church don't get caught up in the negative amen stay away from negative people hallelujah because negativity is a sign of fear hallelujah hallelujah but you know church there has to be somebody that can stand up and say i will not be afraid hallelujah hallelujah fear is not an attribute of the believer hallelujah because church if if if by the grace of god i can show you something tonight you know if we think about the whole concept of fear and where it comes from hallelujah you know in the beginning god created man and when he created man holy it was a sovereign act of god when he created man he was in his image and likeness he looked just like god but you know that something happened one day where the woman hallelujah began to have a conversation with the serpent hernia and she went on and went on with the serpent look church how could she have a conversation with the serpent and do what the serpent asked her because she was being deceived see there's no fear in deception that's why we can look at something we'll say i'm not going to do that because we see the truth but then there's somebody else to say i don't believe this and i don't believe that god ain't just in god ain't that it's because they deceived that's why they don't fear god hallelujah and when i say we fear god we fear him with a reverence we don't fear him to run away from him hallelujah so church hallelujah when you see people leave this truth and they're not afraid of god's judgment it's because they're being deceived because a person can easily go into something when they don't understand the consequences that's why a woman can cut a half she can dress all kind of ways a man can do sinful things commit adultery and do all these things because they're living under a life of deception and they they don't have a chance hallelujah to be caught up in fear because they're being deceived holy and in those moments listen church god told them the day you touch of it you gonna surely die so why didn't eve the first time she committed to act with the serpent say oh my god what have i done she couldn't say it she was under an act of deception and that's how satan normally does holly if you can easily go out there commit sin and do all kind of crazy things it's because you're under a deception hallelujah but look holly she came and she gave to adam and once she gave to adam hallelujah adam he took off he did the same thing but look they were together everything was fine till god came down and when god came down he didn't come down a different way holly see god don't change he came down like he always done but now because they got sin in their lives they begin to fear the coming of the lord hallelujah when they never feel god in a life what caused them to fear their sin the act of sin brings fear into the human being's life oh my in church from there holier adam holly heard god calling his name even with sin in his life and you know i get sick of people using those excuses where i got this and i got that if god can call the name of the two who started sin and they hear him what's your excuse cause they committed the first act of sin which caused all of us to be in the condition we in but in their sins they still heard god calling their name adam allen where are thou and listen to their response adam says we heard you calling us and we were afraid we were afraid church why am i dealing with this because the prophet of god said we got to get the fear out of people's heart hallelujah listen even though they were created in the image of god they could still because of their sins be overcome by their fears and now church in this moment hallelujah adam say we heard you calling us and we realized we were naked they always was naked so why are they now afraid it's the act of sin in their life but what i want you to understand what's so powerful about this church in this moment you think about the believer what's the first attribute of sin it's not spoken it's not drinking hallelujah what's the first attribute it's fear first thing we see at the adultery hallelujah that caused the whole thing to down sparrow was the attribute of fear because god came down call their names and begin to have a meeting with them like you've always done because god is faithful hallelujah so there was nothing but god there was nothing about god that changed but now they're in a different situation and they're looking at god different fear will make you look at hollywood look at the one that love you look at the one that gives you strength look at the peace giver different and in this moment god never changed but now because they got fear in their life they're running from god cast down fear so what's happening what's happening church they never even had a reason to be afraid of god because god never had to bring judgment but now with fear and all these sins is changing god's testimony unto them holly but now they're not looking at him as the great god of worship they're looking at him as god they're terrible we got to go hide ourselves because he's going to kill us and he's going to this and he's going to that god going to do this and god gonna do that see now fear is a perversion in your imagination and now their imaginations are creating all these these these thoughts and patterns of god and they say we ran and hit ourselves and put on fig leaves you know and all these things but i like god's response if you go back and you actually they talking to the lord first thing god says is who told you you was [Music] yes naked your nakedness my nakedness is not a surprise to god god know the areas in our life that we're weak god know the areas in our life that are uncovered hallelujah but where there was doubt sin it was just innocence to god but as soon as sin came in it changed the whole scope of how god had to deal with his people but you look what he said he said who told you was naked see god didn't act surprised god didn't say you're naked oh my god oh my adam what are you doing adam you're naked oh my god eve you're naked he said who told you you was naked see god already knows hallelujah what your fears are all about who told you you was naked and you know what people do when they're afraid it was the woman that's what fear does fear will never hallelujah take the act upon itself it'll always push it off because you don't want to be found out he was a woman he said he was a serpent the serpent couldn't accuse nobody so he had to take it and from there man began to carry fear and faith in the journey at the same time hallelujah if you even go hollywood we if we just take some bible characters and go on up a little bit let me show you even though hello moses was born a special child wasn't he he was a special child but don't you realize he had fear in his life he was born a deliverer so he had a gift of faith already laying there to believe god when that thing came to maturity but at the same time he had fear because when god calls him holy moses made every excuse in the book i can't talk i can't just i can't do this and the people ain't gonna hear me at all what's talking fear he's afraid to make a mistake he's afraid that he's gonna fail trust me god will never call you to lose you you might be saying what about this person what about that person what about it that's right what about it that's right who can understand the mind of god trust me in the kingdom of god nothing is out of order hallelujah but church at that point moses making all kinds of excuses you know what god had to do to deal with his fears first thing god told me to do was shut up moses stop talking all that unbelief shut up and what god does when we talk fear when he know the element of faith is there holy he changes the way we begin to think about ourselves by speaking over us and then what he tells moses moses making all excuses and he tell more he said moses who made your mouth see now god's gonna elevate his thinking hallelujah he's gonna get rid of the fear and deal with some faith hardly he begins to tell moses a lot of good things about himself but then he takes moses into a place he wasn't expecting that's gonna deal with his fears forever hallelujah and he tells moses he's like look here do what we gonna do holy let aaron be your prophet and you be god when was the last time you see god afraid that's what he does church hallelujah god will come and elevate our thinking holy to cast down our fears [Music] and that's what he does to moses and moses the prophet of god say hallelujah he goes back as a one-man army all before that he was running running for his life running fear even though he wasn't the liver of he was running the element of fear but once he tapped into that pill of fire once he tapped into the voice of god and god showed him who he was fear was cast down and a man went down there with a dry stick yes my god is greater my god is stronger god you are higher than any other moses went back down there like that why because god dealt with his fears what did god do god gave him a sign hallelujah god said drop that stick turn into a serpent put your hand on your bosom hallelujah turn the lipstick take it out put it back in his heel what was he doing getting rid of his fears so moses comes back down there under the anointing of faith holly why because god cast his fears down steps into pharaoh's kingdom and says hey let my people go why these ain't my people because god told him you be god aaron's your prophet you be god let my people go whoa church it's time for us hollywood to claim our inheritance and stop living under fear oh my hold my church but you look from that point there was an element of fear in there if we back it all the way up if we go back to abraham huddly god told him he said abraham you and sarah will have a child holy and the first thing they did was got gripped by fear because they started looking at it from the natural i'm old you all sarah even laughs fear make you laugh at the truth last night and he was talking about speaking god's word in the line of duty and he and he began to say that you know when you find yourself identified with bible characters the way god did it in the scripture he has to do it the same way in your life and to be true to be the truth we got a real live witness in here hallelujah you know they was missing their plane y'all know where i'm at they was missing their plane totally and the people say y'all ain't going and you know somebody was gonna get you know somebody's gonna get towed off somebody's gonna get you you must you must be don't know who i am but then in the midst of all that god begin to remind them who they are just take a step back hallelujah remember the woman in memphis tennessee now i remember her because she had a need hallelujah that god dealt with her fears and began to speak faith hallelujah she wasn't worried about her son dying because she went to god in prayer and she began to remind god who she is she said lord eyes just like that shooting might harley jack and errol say lord we just like that woman in memphis tennessee y'all know the story did the plane take out no why because their faith made it back up and come back up to the to the plate holy when you find yourself identified with bible truth it has to operate the same way but this brother said he ran out of gas on the highway something's wrong with his gas meter he ran out of gas on the highway late in the early in the morning just got from work something like two three o'clock in the morning whatever it was pitch black dog he said man he said i'm not getting out here walking to no gas station his dog out here fear he said his dog i ain't ham i ain't doing this he said but then at the moment something started to click and remember when you finally find this in the bible he said he went to his trunk he had no gas in there all he had was water holly but then he began to remember the scripture one day they was at a party jesus is the king of kings messiah is the lord of lords jehovah is the king of kings they just had to wear it and you know what they were doing they were drinking and it got so good they ran out of drinks sarah and they said they ran to jesus they said lord lord we need some more drink we got in this drink all they had was water whoa hallelujah all they had was water you know what jesus did he turned that water into wine and when that brother looked in his truck all he had was water he said lord you turn water in the wine i need you to turn this water in the gas hallelujah church that he was he was crazy enough to believe god he was crazy enough to believe the word and he took that wall pulled into this gas tank and drove all the way home [Applause] why because he cast down his fears and believe god i wish somebody would believe god tonight church these ain't just bible stories it's a lifestyle you know how you keep the weight off it has to become a lifestyle hallelujah and the same thing with the word of god the word of god has to become a lifestyle because in those moments when you're in the line of duty and you're in need hallelujah god will allow you to tap in over your fears and remember abraham hallelujah who was the father of faith yeah he was the father of faith when god called him god told him i'm gonna bless you your seed and y'all gonna possess the land and everything and right out of there abraham gets up and gets afraid all right get out of that looking at his wife saying man you're looking good and his fear instead of his faith saw the outcome in his mind now keep in mind that didn't change the promise gave to him see he still was the father of faith but he had to overcome his fears holy where does your fear come from your own imagination fear is false oh yeah fear ain't even true fear i'm gonna blow your socks off now fear ain't even real you say brothers i'm afraid of a dog that's your imagination because you realize who you are god gave you authority over a dog hallelujah why does a dog attack you because he can sense your fear hallelujah they got clips on youtube with me and walking up to a lion pack take they fool and walk away you know the lights look at them and run those men realize who they are hallelujah we got we got we got stories and clips of brother branham going into the woods getting a wolf putting a rope on them and bringing them back in town hallelujah hallelujah when you realize who you are hallelujah and cast down your fears you will do and operate in the way god created you hallelujah but church what is it it's it's fear overcomes us even though there's a genuine seed of faith inside of you see abraham he didn't have a false seed of faith he was the father of faith but in his journey there were fears he had to overcome so he gets there he looks at his wife and now his imagination starts to run sister tina all right now girl you're looking good the king will want you if he find out you my my wife he gonna kill me he's already creating his own outcome and how many of y'all didn't done this if i don't pay this bill they're gonna cut this if i don't pay this they gonna take this they're gonna do it because you're creating that scenario in your mind harley we know the symmetry for fear false evidence is appearing real hard fear is real no it's not fear is a perversion of faith for to be real it has to be something god created hallelujah and if god didn't create it that means it came from satan therefore it has to be a lie see we know these things but what we have to do we have to keep it in our bundle sack and travel with it but you know church hey you look at abraham he comes to the place and he says hey all right now this is how we're going to play this thing out his fear even made him overlook the body change of sarah he saw the body change but he saw it in a fearful negative light well he should have saw it like girl you ain't oh no you looking good oh my it's time for us to have a child all right but his fears prolong the promise of god my my whole life in church just like he thought just like he created in his mind the king saw the king saw sarah and he said i got to have him why did he say that why did he think like that because abraham already spoke it your fears can create things in your life just like your faith can amen so his fears created a scenario where the king come take his wife to spare his life and just like he thought just like he imagined the king came down there hallelujah say i got to have a say who was this he said it's my sister she said this is my brother he tucker and went back to the house but just like he imagined hallelujah it happened but one thing he failed to realize god will always protect his promise so even when you're fearing god is there to make it turn out like it's supposed to hallelujah hallelujah and then that particular thing in his life is only going to be a stepping stone so now the king comes to get his wife then god steps in hollywood why why does god step in because you can't make god your fear is not going to make god look like a liar hallelujah so god has to step in give the king a dream and tell him to say hey you don't give a back you're as good as a dead man and god ain't playing around with his word holy he said you're dead man if you give back what did he do he talked to man who wasn't afraid and made him afraid he put the fear in the right place the fear is not supposed to be in the believer's life it's supposed to be hallelujah in the unbeliever's life [Music] hallelujah so god comes and he puts the fear in the right place and the man that god you know my integrity and all these things and blah blah blah god said give him back are you dead and then he didn't stop what he did he magnified abraham's thinking again even though he was lying because he was afraid god didn't give none of that no strength god ain't even addressed that because god know that wasn't a part of his promise that that wasn't a part of abraham the reason why that happened was because of his fears and fear is something false hallelujah so god's looking at that he's saying that ain't abraham that ain't who he is i know him amen i know him i know who he is he's the father of faith hallelujah everything's gonna come out of him he got an isaac he got a jacob a joseph hallelujah he got a lineage coming out of him i ain't worried about that little false little thing right there he tells the kids hey give it back and go let him pray for you let him pray for you cause that's my prophet [Music] in the very moment of 211 change the testimony from a liar to a prophet don't worry about what the devil's saying is god is the one speaking over you hallelujah church and from there from there abraham listen to good now from that point abraham never feared another man are you in the book every other time from there it didn't matter who was on abraham's side he said y'all wanna fight let's go we ain't cr we ain't creating no scenarios we ain't making they didn't talk a lot who with me y'all with me let's go king said well i give this you ain't giving me nothing cause you will say that you gave me something god is my exceedingly reward church from that point abraham never feared again why because god conquered his fears in that moment and that's all he'd be trying to do for us he puts us in certain positions where things happen that you can't explain hello you don't know why it's happening hallelujah he's trying to deal with your fears hey man hey let me let me show you another we all right let me let me show you another church listen holly the reason why i read the book of job job said job said for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that which which i was afraid of is come unto me so the very thing he was afraid of was come upon him and then church he's standing there watching it all play out oh my i want to read you some of the prophets saying about job harley if i can find it he says look in the book of job this is in the message um uh perfect faith he says in the book of job it says here job feared and what he feared it actually happened what brought it now he said what brought his fear he said what brought it his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept it from him holy he said but his fear brought it to him he was scared he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now if it'd been he knowed it would happen it wouldn't have happened see see what i mean he said if you're afraid when you come by the prayer line maybe i just haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen don't worry see but if you know it's going to happen it'll happen y'all know what y'all need to start doing y'all make sure that the furniture stuff y'all took out the old church i'll keep it clean [Applause] somebody need to go by there and make sure it ain't dustin if it's in the storage room make sure it's ready to be satin [Applause] [Music] because when god do something it's just like you ain't missed a beat [Applause] and what you might need to do you might need to go buy a little bit more chairs [Applause] cause he's the god of plenty not a god of less but church he said it was joe's fear that brought it holy he said see it's a substance of something job had a fear that these things will come upon him and they did if you have a fear that your disease is going to leave you that your disease is going to leave you or won't leave you it won't if you have a faith that it will see so even on your journey right now there's only two things you're carrying with you is either faith or fear but i'm going to make the devil mad though but my fear is working for my faith because when satan jump on us to make us fear god jumps on him to show us it's a lie if you got something in your life that you're fearing your fear is working for your faith hell yeah because god has to prove himself right to be all the time so what he does he always shows up the devil's lie to show his truth holy so whenever the devil shows his fear god shows his faith oh yeah because church hallelujah in the mind and the mystery of god satan thought he was doing something hardly so because he thought he was doing something by allowing fear to come into man's creation no fear was working for faith hallelujah because fear came in so the plan of redemption can usher in so god let the devil loose hallelujah just to let himself loose so he let hallelujah fear the attributes of fear come like sickness and sadness and bondage and all these things so god can come in with the opposite hallelujah healing deliverance and saving power holly so fear was working for faith hallelujah oh my god look at the church hallelujah amen there had to be a goliath why because there was a david [Music] goliath who would have never come on the scene if there was no david hello so god allowed there to be a david hallelujah amen to show a goliath hallelujah that he could be defeated and look how he does the church amen look at god oh my i feel the holy ghost movement look at god church what he normally does he lets your fears come out first he let the fears come out first conquer your fears and then move into a higher level in god that's what he did at church he let goliath come out boast post scream and holla did he get smart and say nobody's look ain't nobody got to die we ain't got to do that look ain't nobody got to die you say i know all y'all afraid of me ain't nobody got to die you know you just bring out your champion this and that blah blah blah he's talking cause he know everybody afraid of him but there was one person was going to hear him who had no fear wow church that's what you got to realize when you look at the life of david david ain't had no fear david he wasn't afraid of saul he was just honoring his position david had at least three times he could have killed him but he didn't he was just honoring david was like man i ain't afraid of you i can kill you at any time he hit army and absalom come trying to take the kingdom and different stuff and he started plotting he said hey that's what we're gonna do we're gonna ambush your daddy and this and that and blah blah blah and they gonna judge like you you know who you talking about we talking about david he said no i'm good y'all go ahead i'm good oh good and this is what i like to say church when david killed goliath he didn't just kill him he made a show out of it he killed goliath and tuck his head can y'all imagine david going to the next battle hollywood and now he's using the fear as faith hallelujah goliath made everybody afraid now he's going to take the same thing hollywood and scare off the enemy holly through faith amen before he gets to the battle he probably came i just hey y'all look look i'm sure there's been a misunderstanding i don't want to have to kill y'all but just in case y'all don't know who i am just in case y'all don't know who i am no i ain't talking about my statue who i am i'm a man of god's very own heart so all i got to do is ask god for it in his mind [Applause] hallelujah church oh my i got to close i got a closed church but look church if we go back to job i'm going to try to close with joel and we're looking here at church through the scripture and what the prophet god said he said if everything he feared came upon him but look church from the beginning they say the sons of god were to present themselves before the lord and the devil came also but look at how god looked at job he told the devil have you considered my servant job and listen what he say he's perfect but job looking at himself he afraid [Music] he's a perfect man walking with fear because he's not looking at himself how god is looking at him god told satan before they even go through any battle any tests he's perfect and there's nothing like him in all the earth that's god's testimony about job but job looking at everything he's going through it's oh my lord i can't let my kids sin against you so i'm gonna offer up the sacrifice just in case pre-adventure pre-adventure they see it in their heart see he got all the stuff going on in his mind and god talking to the devil saying he perfect praise god i wonder what he's saying about you while you're out here walking all afraid hold on coronavirus didn't mess up my money i can't i can't get paid like i used oh lord i roll the vine we ain't free though mother governor church job began to create things all that stuff was going on he lost his children he lost us he lost that and god didn't already say it man you're perfect then told the enemy you're perfect listen i'm gonna read you one more scripture and i'm gonna close luke luke chapter 21 and we're gonna close by god's grace church the whole just of this message tonight is whatever you're afraid of you shouldn't be you might not know the outcome of it that don't mean be afraid look right now we're in a we we we uh we're just football season right now and you know everybody before they get on that field they have to be believing as a team that they can win they can't go out there afraid oh boy tom brady he'd go we can't beat him they already didn't loss they already lost you know if it was me you know he'd be like yeah he's a goat and i like curry goat he's gonna get ate up tonight he's gonna be done tonight we gonna fry him that's how i be in my mind i'll be creating scenarios where i get the best of them in church that's what we have to be doing as believers life is supposed to be live holiday in the faith of god but church as as you as we think about the world and the season and things we end luke 21 right now don't forget where we at we're in the last days and the scripture says hallelujah let's read it luke 21 i think i want to read verse 25. listen luke 21 to 25 it says and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations are we there with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring means hearts failing them for fear and for looking at those things which are coming on the earth see they're afraid because of what they see happening next but the scriptures tell us that these things are supposed to happen but as its happenings men's hearts are getting perplexed they're getting they're getting afraid the scripture says it says the earth distress of nations with perplexity now i look at that word perplexity perplexity means to be without resources now i want you to understand i'ma take this word perplexity and i'm gonna tie it into the fear the number one fear on earth right now you know the number one feeling of right now coronavirus perplexity men's hearts are perplexed and it's crea it's failing them for fear why because they are without resources they don't know how to stop it that's right oh my is that to be in straights they got all these different variances of it coming out it says to be left wanting this is this word perplexity means it says l and this is the one i love before i say this i'm gonna just say i'm gonna just say this right here before i read this next one all i'm gonna say is johnson and johnson to be embarrassed i know everybody said i don't care what they make we ain't taking it they can test it they can reprove it they can do whatever who made it johnson john i want nothing to do with it i enjoy it take it off the market just heard them the other day they begging for another chance people like now we good to be embarrassed to be in doubt church the whole world is in doubt right now because the number one fear this coronavirus see church don't be mistaken corona what is all about is producing fear because they know once they get everybody in fear they can control the whole world and i remember one of the first clips i seen on the news or youtube or whatever it was wherever it was over there in thailand or china whatever everybody had on white suits their white suits and masks and spray gear they just shh it's all over it's in the place [Music] and then they come out the the first way they come out with and i ain't gonna hit this too long but the first way they come out of it somebody the man was eating some bad soup come on we black people if that's how you get corona we good we good cause we definitely ain't gonna be eating no bad soup i don't care who say it's good bad suit foolishness and you know they had people believe in that mess what was it fear the imagination of what cnn and all these people were pushing i didn't go too much in this because we're going to dive in a little bit more tomorrow what church do you think about it harley the elephant the the the element of fear that they're using with this colonovirus you know one of the silliest ones to me is the six-feet yeah that's rule that's stupid it's just don't it's dumb it don't i'm gonna show you how silly it is come here buddy what's your name joseph come here joseph i want you stand right here joseph stand like this all right just stand right there joseph me and joseph about six feet apart right about six feet a little bit less a little bit more about six feet okay they say we need to be six feet apart make sure you don't get it right so me and joseph in line and we at the grocery store and joseph first joseph you didn't cash out you got your stuff now go back you see i'm next right if this is how you get it i got it because i didn't stepped in here six feet and the person behind me stepped in my 16 and on and on and on if they saying it's in the air you know what make you get it the imagination of fear in your mind now don't get me wrong i ain't saying people ain't had it but what did you do when you got it i give you a little bit more you just take the traits of it now you know people been getting the uh uh just by a short hand whoever had the flu pretty much everybody most of us had a cold thank you same thing okay well let me ask you with your cold you ever had chills you know one of the symptoms of the viruses chill been here forever church every year 80 to 100 000 people get chills before there was any vaccination you know what you ever had a fever anybody ever had a fever hand chills you know what corona got those same symptoms then let me ask some did you overcome it did you get a shot was it a mass to help you overcome it you overcame it how you fought through it right and you know if you have a cold or a flu or whatever it is too long you know what to happen you get pneumonia and what does that do it produces fluid in your lungs corona do the same thing though this ain't that new that's right it's been here it's been here oh i ain't named no new symptoms ain't ain't nothing new it's all been here ever had a runny nose it's been here ever burnt your tongue lost your taste it's been here you got it back though didn't you he's been here so church what's making this corolla thing so strong fear the imagination of what they're pumping in the minds of the people and he's over things but i got family members who got who who passed on from it let me put that in the right perspective it was their time i'm not being insensitive it was their time he said the devil took their life no the devil's not the death angel god is he said when i see the blood i'll pass over now when the devil see the blood he gonna pass over he said when i see the blood harder so who's bringing judgment on those houses that didn't have the blood god so god was controlling death whoa that's why he went down he said hallelujah he got the keys to what death hell and the grain so what am i saying in night church you are not the fear holy cast down your fear and let your fear work for your amen [Applause] church and my last one i want to say says to be in doubt perplexity now to be in doubt not to know which way to turn that's where the world is they don't know what's next they don't know what's going to happen holly why because they're operating on the fear but church in my closing right here look the prophet of god said everything adam lost was restored in who christ so when jesus christ holly died on the cross hallelujah he put all of us back in our position before the fall earlier so we have the power to operate as adam did without any fear hallelujah he said tree get up and got up hallelujah he said this happened that happened it happened water flowed his way it flowed hallelujah why because there was no fear in adam holland he was created an image and likeness of god and so are we amen by god's grace church cast down fear and every thought of your imagination that exalts itself above the knowledge of god see when you confess the lord jesus christ as your savior it ain't up to you to remain safe you confess him as your savior so it's up to him to save you from yourself it's up to him to save you from your fears harley and look god allowed all of his believers all the different ones to go through situations where they would be afraid just to conquer it so they won't have to deal with it anymore you go all the way back from abraham to moses to jacob to joseph all of it hardly and look how god dealt with their fears hollywood to put them in a place where they never have to go through that same thing twice it might move down through the generations but that same power to conquer move down through the generation because you know isaac feared what abraham feared holly and god dealt with his fears just like he did with his father's fears holly so you can't see that it's my daddy's fault it's my mama fire it because my home broken and all that stuff no give it to god come on musicians i'm closing give it to the lord let the lord deal with your fears scripture says perfect love cast out all fear so fall in love with god in a deeper way hell yeah and he'll give you the strength to overcome hallelujah to overcome all these things hardly that we are so afraid of because in my in my opening text hallelujah am i opening scripture look they confess that everything god said was in the land it's there everything is there and we got the fruit of it the sad part about the church they were eating the greeks they were eating the grapes and the bible says taste and seed of the lord is gracious they was tasting they were seeing hallelujah and they let that fear come into camp and say we can't we can't do it we can't do it i don't know about them but i said well i want some more of them grapes you ever been in the grocery store and you didn't taste the grapes you know how we do our tea you don't just buy now you want to see your day sweet hey take that great i need another one he's like yeah yeah yeah i'm about to do eight by five of them yeah you gonna buy you're gonna buy them but you're looking for a certain quality hallelujah and that's what god does he allows us to taste it hallelujah so we can see the quality of it holly and once you taste the quality of it the only thing that's going to stop you is fear the prophet god said the only thing stopping from getting the holy ghost he was 12 years old was a spirit fear hallelujah church we are greater than that hallelujah he's not giving us the spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind and even right now in this service we all may have some things that we're dealing with you know they're they're they're there and i'm closing they're there there there's a word that we've been using and it has gotten so common we don't even realize we're speaking of spirit in our life you know you hear people say all the time oh my anxiety my anxiety you know that is your fear you're confessing fear over your life i've heard preachers say that my anxiety what you're doing you're confessing fear over your life to have dominion in those moments hell yeah fear the prophet of god say fear is a demon because fear leads to what torment when satan gets full control of it it becomes torment it becomes something you can't conquer hey man i'm trying to close but y'all pulling real good we just not hitting 9 o'clock i'm gonna tell you a story of fear a friend of mine she's like a social worker she she got a fear of dogs cause one day she went to the mailbox i thought she got bit by the dog she went to the mailbox and a dog was on the hill seen on the hill got deeper deeper louder louder he's still on the hill though in her mind he gonna chase me he gonna bite me let me get in this house and from that moment it created something in her life that she's never shaken and to this day every time she goes to the mailbox and you know what's crazy her neighbors ain't even got no dog but fear will create scenarios that's not even there and this and then and check this out the kind of work she does she's like a social worker where she relates with people's fears why because she has them it's almost like a hypocrite because like how you gonna help me when you got the same problem so we were talking one day and i said you mean to tell me you ain't never even been bit by a dog she said no but can you imagine a dog on the top of the hill and he's barking and and growling and all this stuff and i'm thinking yeah they used to happen all the time in my neighborhood we would ride by they chase you on the bike but it never did anything to me where it would me and that's what fear does it'll your walk it'll your life and now and now she's plus you know a grown woman real grown i won't say i ain't i ain't gonna call her old she might see the tape or something but she's real grown still got the same fears church y'all play something soft i'm closing look you can have things that happen in your childhood something that happened to you when you use a young girl a young teenager and it produced a fear in your life and you carry that thing carried and carried you know what you carry that in your marriage you raise your children with that same fear all right don't you be careful when you go to the mailbox because it's something you never dealt with because of different issues people are afraid you know uh you you take a man who may have a fear he's been done wrong and he'll carry that very thing into his life carry that into his marriage he'll never be that that man who's loving and comfort because he always got to keep his guard up because of that fear church don't let fear dictate your steps but let your fears work for your faith let's pray is [Music] lord jesus father we thank you right now lord [Music] we're no longer slaves to fear but we're childs of god lord god we pray that in this moment lord there be anything gripping and holding your people that you'll give them strength right now lord to give it to you lord to put it in your hands father you will conquer that thing and they'll be loosed from it never to fear it again like you did abraham like you did moses and the different saints of god that were in the scripture lord god we pray with the people tonight lord that the wave of the holy spirit will come down in such a way of jehovah shaman the lord is with thee lord you see you know and you hear all about us lord and lord is is just such a powerful thing that you can call us knowing that we have different things in our lives that we have to overcome but that never changes the seed it never changes your decision when you first called us but it's those things that make us stronger in our christian journey lord we pray for this church and all that they're trying to do father you just continue to bring them into greater and greater light in the precious name of jesus christ we pray the church say amen i am a child of

a hand of praise [Music] thank you jesus you know um i've heard the sermons on fear uh many times and um but there was a lot that just kind of came out here tonight that just really just just blessed me you know just never really looked at uh what happened in the garden of eden and and how um it's when they began to you know it was when when she was being deceived she didn't she was not afraid of nothing right but when uh when they knew god was coming down to visit him just kind of change their perceptions change about god and and that fear you know that they begin to live on this just something that's just hell mankind even to this day we have problems with and i love the statement that brother diggs made that um in order for fear to be real it has to be something that god created so we know it's not real it's something that satan uses against the people right and uh and we never want to find ourselves walking underneath that i mentioned this some time ago it's uh it's a very fine line when we cross the line of faith and start walking in fear we want to be very very careful of that very very careful that but i just thank god for the word tonight and just appreciate it just a real blessing amen to our souls cast down fear cast down fear blessed be the name of the lord god bless you brother diggs amen thank you so much for yielding to the lord thank you for yielding to the lord i mean i also just want to say so good to have our precious brothers and sisters amen with us tonight good to have you all amen and trust that you'll come and be with us again amen god is good god is god is good uh that testimony the the brother just pouring water amen in his car and you know what what i'm gonna tell you what fear will do uh after something like that happens fear say you put water in your you're gonna mess up your engine right but he didn't put water in his car he asked god to turn the water to gas so what you have to do is speak back to i know i didn't put water in my car tell me satan did they drink water did they drink wine he put himself in scripture right so if they drunk wine because that's what the bible say i didn't put water in my car i put gas in my and all he did was turn the water into gas hallelujah you got to cast down you got to cast down fear anytime the devil comes with anything cast it down oh my god my god sister bernice say anything that rises against the word of god i cast it down oh my my my praise the lord amen let's bound a word of prayer father we are certainly appreciative of the word that we've heard here tonight encouraged a man in our spirit to cast down fear not to think lord evil thoughts and wicked thoughts fear does not come from you you did not make it and and as the bible clearly states fear is a spirit lord it's a spirit and and the bible says you have not given us the spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind even as we're navigating through this seasons i was just sharing with the sister lord we're we're going through times that we've never gone through before we're facing things that we never faced before and and for people to think it's going to go back to be like it used to be no it's a different world that we live in but yet you remain the same so we can trust you god even in the midst of all it is help us father not to operate in fear lord but to operate with wisdom oh god that you would just lead and guide us through this season amen that you knew was coming your prophet already said that there would be germ warfare coming through the land and father we we know that these things were supposed to be as the scriptures read and looked there just the different things that were coming to perplexity that would be upon man god we got a confidence and a god that we serve that he will keep us in the midst of all of this so lord help us to keep our faith and our trust in you to watch what your promises amen have spoken to us god and to know that what you've spoken it will come to pass god i pray that you bless each and every ear that heard the word tonight those that were hear the recording a little bit later god bless them may our hearts draw closer to you
