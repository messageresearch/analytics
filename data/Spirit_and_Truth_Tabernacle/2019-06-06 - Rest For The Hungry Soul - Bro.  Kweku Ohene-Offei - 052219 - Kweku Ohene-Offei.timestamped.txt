[29:14] come on to you why do you buy bread well
[29:16] doesn't satisfy why do we buy food that
[29:19] doesn't satisfy us come and eat free of
[29:22] charge without money you know you can't
[29:25] just pop into the restaurant and present
[29:27] your mouth and your stomach by hey I'm
[29:28] here to eat you need to have your money
[29:31] fast to pay for what you're gonna eat
[29:34] now about this restaurant you don't need
[29:37] any money to go to this restaurant you
[29:39] know need any ticket you don't need
[29:42] credit card but you need just to present
[29:44] yourself and you can eat as much as you
[29:46] want to eat amen and that is the word of
[29:49] the Lord and many a times we eat things
[29:51] that doesn't satisfy our soul sometimes
[29:54] we take we were born into the cosmos
[29:56] world and all we know we look at the
[29:58] world we think maybe education can
[30:00] satisfy you we think maybe job will
[30:03] satisfy you riches can satisfy you
[30:06] families can satisfy you but none of
[30:09] them can satisfy your soul amen
[30:12] nothing beside Jesus Christ can satisfy
[30:16] our hungry sauce amen
[30:19] so the Lord beckons us to come unto me
[30:22] my people why do you live up for things
[30:25] that doesn't satisfy why do you struggle
[30:27] with your strength you buy things we
[30:29] spend things we spend our time if we
[30:32] break our time that we're going to spend
[30:33] on this earth let's say God give
[30:35] 120 years like Moises so out of the 120
[30:39] years we spend part of the time to sleep
[30:42] there's not no question about it maybe
[30:45] when you're a child you have to sleep
[30:46] like 10 hours 8 hours as you grew it
[30:48] reduced to maybe eight hours is normal
[30:50] sometimes you don't get eight hours six
[30:51] hours sometimes four hours some time
[30:53] whatever you can get you go to wake we
[30:56] work 15 hours 20 hours
[30:58] just name it twelve hours eight hours
[31:01] overnight daytime morning whatever they
[31:04] are part of this cosmos what we needed
[31:06] but Austin would not satisfy the basis
[31:08] can do for you is to buy put roof on top
[31:12] of you put dust in your mouth so what do
[31:15] you say does food is dust just calcium
[31:18] potassium just nutrients put some cotton
[31:22] on your on your skin and put some metals
[31:25] and some rap rubbers and plastic vehicle
[31:28] around you to move about Oh Jules but
[31:33] it's not going to do much to you that
[31:35] would just for the flesh that do not
[31:37] satisfied their heart they do not
[31:40] satisfy the hungry sue but there's
[31:43] another bread another bread of life not
[31:46] a bread that we eat not a bread we buy
[31:49] from the grocery but it's a bread from
[31:51] heaven that was ordained that was baked
[31:54] just for your teeth amen that was
[31:57] designed that was done by the bakery the
[32:00] way you like it
[32:01] amen just like human means we like the
[32:03] whole idea coffee in a setting where
[32:05] people idea bread in a certain way
[32:06] people I bread with Annie people I bread
[32:09] with different different different
[32:11] shapes and types and and forms the Lord
[32:14] has ordained a world to satisfy our
[32:16] hungry heart amen so as I said that why
[32:20] do you buy bread who doesn't satisfy you
[32:21] come on to me I'm the bread of Living
[32:24] Waters I'm a fountain of living waters
[32:27] come and buy without price and without
[32:30] money
[32:31] amen if God should put a price tag on
[32:34] the food on the bread of heaven no human
[32:36] being can buy it even if God would put a
[32:39] price tag on the oxygen that we breathe
[32:41] no human being can survive you know God
[32:45] hasn't put no price like tag but he said
[32:47] come and eat
[32:49] that used to be satisfied amen that is
[32:52] the bread of eternal life now what is
[32:58] rest in a human language we know rest as
[33:01] getting tired maybe from work from your
[33:04] Labor's from working from a certain kind
[33:06] of job then you need to sit down
[33:10] sleep stop stay away from the latest
[33:12] from your wake and relax and rest amen
[33:16] now in Genesis 1 God Genesis 2 sorry if
[33:19] what we read Sunday Genesis 2 chapter 1
[33:23] even God needed a rest how can God be
[33:26] nice pretty the rest God was the great
[33:28] fountain of spirit but he wanted to find
[33:31] a rest in the 60 elements in the eighth
[33:33] his own creation amen
[33:36] so God created Adam so that he could
[33:38] have a rest the Bible said that God
[33:40] rested on the seventh day God is a
[33:42] spirit guided in take mortar and
[33:46] construction
[33:47] Mateusz to control the world know it
[33:49] just by his thought and by his weight
[33:52] the way the world came into an existence
[33:54] but then God couldn't get a rest until
[33:57] he created a man he created you and I
[33:59] amen
[34:00] you are Adam I am Adam we came from Adam
[34:02] so that is when God had a rest so when
[34:05] God created man and he incarnated or
[34:08] moving to a man God found the rest that
[34:10] his soul was longing for but then we
[34:12] know what happened Genesis chapter 3 the
[34:15] serpent came in to disrupt the rest of
[34:17] God brought therefore brought all the
[34:21] chaos we can see on the planet it came
[34:24] through Genesis chapter 3 that's when
[34:26] the serpent came in so the rest that God
[34:28] gave to man give to himself that race
[34:30] was taken away but I was gassed all part
[34:33] of God's program the law of contrast
[34:35] because God had more attributes than
[34:37] just rest in Adam he was a savior so if
[34:40] nothing false he cannot see if he could
[34:42] deceive so God has to let go the race if
[34:45] nothing falls down if this one is here
[34:48] is here this way it's supposed to be but
[34:50] then one is false I'm going to look for
[34:52] it pick it up and bring it back to we're
[34:54] supposed to be that is a race so God put
[34:57] his arrest in place not in trees not in
[35:00] shrubs
[35:01] not in material things but what he
[35:04] himself created human beings amen
[35:07] so you are the rest of God so Genesis
[35:09] three came in to destroy the rest of God
[35:11] but then God through his programs over
[35:14] the years was all trying to bring back
[35:17] the rest where man and God will become
[35:19] one amen if we read efficient chapter
[35:23] three sorry
[35:25] efficient chapter four thirty he said
[35:27] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God which
[35:30] seals you on to your redemption the Holy
[35:33] Spirit is your seal that is Christ in
[35:36] you is your cilantro redemption and
[35:38] until Christ comes into the human heart
[35:41] there's no red there's no redemption so
[35:43] gasps redemption is to have a nice place
[35:46] in you and I amen praise God hallelujah
[35:49] so God had to come into a man tourists
[35:52] now when man created when man was
[35:54] created after they fall in that Garden
[35:57] of Eden man lost not rest
[35:59] so man is now seeking God to come in and
[36:03] find race initially God was that the
[36:06] grid goddess himself is the rest the
[36:08] fountain of the Spirit but God didn't
[36:10] had a vessel to stay in and rest so
[36:13] gotta to create a flesh and wrist now
[36:16] the flesh is there but the flare doesn't
[36:18] have the wrist doesn't have Christ so
[36:20] god him Amin is now crying in his heart
[36:24] all that we do on earth people do around
[36:27] is because there's something in their
[36:29] heart that is calling for a risk but
[36:32] because human being doesn't give his or
[36:34] her had to God the devil put in the
[36:36] wrong not rest but on risk into the
[36:39] person's heart the devil put drinken s
[36:41] puts all kind of spirits think and I'll
[36:44] bring the race but it doesn't satisfy
[36:46] that their heart on to Jesus Christ
[36:49] comes in amen praise God hallelujah
[36:56] glory to God how can God rest let's read
[37:00] another scripture from Isaiah chapter 40
[37:02] verse 1 and 2 as I have forty one and
[37:06] two
[37:11] I said chapter 14 verse 1 in to okay
[37:20] comfort comfort my people says the Lord
[37:22] says God speak he comfortably to
[37:25] Jerusalem Jerusalem means God city of
[37:28] peace
[37:28] Giroux means God Sally means Shalom
[37:31] peace and Kryon to her that her warfare
[37:34] is accomplished that her iniquity is
[37:37] pardoned for she had to receive of the
[37:40] lost hand double for her sins amen
[37:43] so the Lord is calling yet comfort he
[37:46] comforting my people God is calling for
[37:48] a day of comfort for you and I amen
[37:51] because we are the people of God but we
[37:53] didn't have the comfort without the Holy
[37:55] Ghost a man doesn't have a rest we don't
[37:58] have the comfort so the Holy Ghost comes
[38:01] into the human heart to bring the
[38:03] comfort that we have been longing for
[38:05] over the years amen glory hallelujah
[38:08] let me give my example maybe for for
[38:10] somebody it will help somebody when I
[38:12] was a child I was a kid going to high
[38:14] school I got this guy here that was my
[38:17] biggest problem I wanted to study and
[38:19] invent and discover things I love books
[38:23] and God bless you
[38:26] which was my world so I steady and I
[38:29] remember one time a hot price my high
[38:30] school was like Lissa from about four
[38:34] hours drive I don't know that is done
[38:35] from here to a land oh so that's what I
[38:37] went to high school in the hospital was

[38:41] had good prices I was going for my price
[38:43] and switching price giving the way vice
[38:46] president and big man were coming so I
[38:48] was so happy
[38:50] sat on the bus and when I start on the
[38:52] bus something told me to go to the back
[38:54] back seat or the bus because I was going
[38:56] to sleep it was going to be a night
[38:57] night drive so I wanted to make sure I
[38:59] have my house of money with me so I
[39:01] wanted to make sure I mean I had a safe

[39:09] to go and see my friends was boy so I'm
[39:11] going to see my friends and we shout and
[39:13] yell and be happy with each other then
[39:16] there was this accident on the way one
[39:18] of the deadly assassin service in my
[39:20] life that was the
[39:21] video viewed that the little one bit so
[39:23] how do you call it little right they had
[39:26] a little one and came to crash my bus
[39:29] hit the bus with the top terrific speed
[39:31] and the engine was moving in the air two
[39:35] people died on the spot and the word
[39:38] change from because been a lot of child
[39:39] I thought really my New Testament was
[39:41] good enough
[39:41] Lenny my books that's what I wanted I
[39:43] love books but something put a question
[39:46] my band are you ready to go to heaven if
[39:48] you died well you ready I wasn't living
[39:50] in sin I wasn't drinking I wasn't
[39:51] smoking I was in running after woman but
[39:53] I wasn't ready to go to where my maker
[39:56] wanted me to be so he put their call let
[39:59] me know that their books and the
[40:01] knowledge would not give me rest
[40:03] I needed a rest and in the Holy Spirit I
[40:05] had been baptized in Father Son and Holy
[40:08] Ghost I had my baptismal certificate I
[40:10] was a happiest when I was baptized I
[40:12] think middle school so I thought that's
[40:14] all I got to do read my neutral
[40:16] I didn't understand the Old Testament so
[40:17] at least I could read the New Testament
[40:19] and get some understanding but God the
[40:22] Father the gridview funny was calling
[40:24] you my son books would not give you rest
[40:26] amen the rest is the wait until I
[40:30] encountered the Word of God the message
[40:34] sent from the father above and I was
[40:36] along in there was a cry my heart do I
[40:38] was go to bed cause a change
[40:40] I couldn't find a rest that I was
[40:41] longing for speaking in tongues didn't
[40:44] give raise and even it wasn't the
[40:47] tongues that you were forced to speak I
[40:49] was never able to speak in tongues
[40:50] because when I was in that whole change
[40:52] the rest which is not a true raises
[40:56] speak in tongues when you speak in
[40:58] tongues you've got Christ because on the
[41:00] upper who spoke in tongues and who speak
[41:02] in tongues and the life is billion miles
[41:04] away from what happened in the upper
[41:06] room but I was praying sincerely for a
[41:09] rest until one day in the church a voice
[41:12] said that look they were selling I don't
[41:15] go into details but I want to just use
[41:17] it for example that there were
[41:19] Salinger's line the time of Jesus they
[41:21] were selling the church was being used
[41:23] for money
[41:24] to make a long story short and I said I
[41:26] thought it's a church I'm supposed to be
[41:27] what do I go where do I get a rest and I
[41:31] was praying asking people do you know
[41:33] the truth because I know that was true
[41:35] someway
[41:35] I asked my friends before that I thought
[41:38] they were religious report you know the
[41:39] truth when the truth is until the Lord
[41:42] Himself gave me the truth through my
[41:44] brother I remember one time my brother

[42:02] scriptures because I took it for a class

[42:08] rattle it the four gospel they call a
[42:10] synoptic gospel Matthew John Mark and
[42:13] Luke I could tell you all the stories

[42:18] coming from repent and be baptized in
[42:20] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye
[42:23] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[42:26] so what the scripture day I've read it
[42:31] over and over and over and over and in a
[42:34] span of three years I've read this book
[42:37] of Acts our could encounter number of
[42:38] times what I probably thousand times
[42:41] well was this creature coming from but I
[42:43] had already been baptized and I said I

[42:59] okay I've got my wrist but that wasn't
[43:03] the rest I need the baptism in water is
[43:08] just an outward sign a good question
[43:12] towards the Lord Lord

[43:16] making a vow to a woman you have just
[43:18] been engaged but the life of the man is

[43:57] the earth but in the sky and he beckoned
[44:00] me to come up and I could go go all the
[44:03] way I got hung up I come back to the
[44:05] earth and I go I come back about three
[44:09] or something times I came out of the
[44:11] dream as I don't have to only go see it
[44:13] cuz I couldn't get to where the Lord was
[44:15] and I begin to pray more and pray I
[44:18] began to pray and fast and pray and fast
[44:21] and I think I had that dream twice again
[44:23] and the last one I had I was caught in
[44:25] the arms of the Lord amen that is the
[44:29] rest for the heart and when you get a
[44:32] rest the Lord he gives you the rest he
[44:34] will let you know that he's in you amen
[44:37] things that you didn't understand that's
[44:41] what the Bible said only believe when
[44:42] you believe the understanding will come
[44:45] amen
[44:46] even understand everything the pastor
[44:47] preaches but you believe with all your
[44:49] heart is the man of God God has given to
[44:52] you believe what a minister's tell you

[45:05] didn't know whether they know they have
[45:07] got experience with a lot amen
[45:08] so I got from there like Paul my life
[45:13] wasn't the same anymore
[45:14] amen that is a heavenly vision God has
[45:17] for you and I my mind about books and
[45:20] learning the Lord took it away the Lord
[45:23] turned my world upside I wanted to be
[45:24] the biggest neuroscientist I wanted to
[45:27] invent and discover but a lot ten things
[45:30] are around for me that my son that is
[45:32] not where I want you to go invention and
[45:35] discovery is not your world but in
[45:38] Christ
[45:39] preyus offering and the word is what I
[45:42] have for you amen that does give you
[45:45] your satisfaction
[45:46] that gives a satisfaction to the heart
[45:48] amen of course we have to work and get
[45:51] money to live and also don't quit your
[45:53] job no but that would not give you
[45:55] satisfaction
[45:57] I went to but satisfaction will come
[45:59] from when Christ is embedded in your
[46:02] heart when the voice the Holy goes to
[46:06] the preeminence in your heart that is
[46:08] when you have the satisfaction that is
[46:09] what you can walk fearlessly you can
[46:11] walk in darkness in daytime there's no
[46:14] fear in Christ amen you are not afraid
[46:16] of death
[46:17] because you have already died that is
[46:20] behind you amen
[46:22] you are not afraid of what are you gonna
[46:24] resurrect or not because you're already
[46:25] alive so how can you be alive when you
[46:28] have no even died well how can you be
[46:29] resurrect when you are not dead the
[46:31] resurrection is a supernatural direction
[46:33] is no resurrection from the ground but
[46:35] iteration from the world of cosmas and
[46:37] unbelief amen resurrection from
[46:41] tiredness and worry and stress and the
[46:44] world God put the Holy Ghost in you to
[46:46] resurrect you to bring you to an
[46:48] awakening to bring you back to the alive
[46:50] the original life God given to you amen
[46:53] praise God hallelujah the Lord is good
[47:01] let's read one more Scripture
[47:09] praise God hallelujah can we read
[47:15] Genesis 3
[47:29] Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 so now this
[47:37] red truck really for a man praise God
[48:25] amen
[48:26] and that is what brought mankind onto
[48:29] death and on to distraction amen
[48:33] so God commanded give us give his
[48:35] command commandment of conditional love
[48:37] that do not eat this tree when you eat
[48:39] it you're gonna die of course man eat it
[48:42] and it brought death unto man and God
[48:45] knows a man cannot keep a promise it's
[48:47] not a nature of him and me to keep
[48:48] promises you're gonna break it
[48:50] so the only way for you to keep the
[48:51] promises he will keep it in you amen
[48:55] if you just buy a lot don't do this do
[48:57] this don't do this all mankind will fall
[48:59] but then when God comes to dwelling you
[49:02] pasta the life that I live is no longer
[49:04] i it's not the human being so who used
[49:07] to persecute Christians by Christ in me
[49:10] he brings his life inside out amen so
[49:14] the greatest event is the restoration is
[49:17] to resurrect by the Holy Ghost baptism
[49:19] by dying to yourself how do you doubt
[49:21] yourself you were born with a nature God
[49:24] a God makers three Rams
[49:26] three fold beans we've got a flesh we've
[49:29] got a spirit and we're gonna sue amen
[49:32] the flesh is just help you to contact
[49:34] the earth City smell feel and what else
[49:39] attack
[49:40] not just to contact your earthly home
[49:42] the spirit is to help you contact the
[49:44] spiritual home sweet reward memory
[49:46] affection reasoning imagination and
[49:48] conscience every human being has both
[49:50] caution animals do not have conscience

[49:57] got only one Inlet or one outlet that is
[50:00] Christ or sittin born-again or the old
[50:04] bath

[50:08] caricature amen
[50:09] you can act a Christian you can act a
[50:13] child of God you can act to me a good
[50:15] person God is not even looking for good
[50:17] person is looking for Christ amen you
[50:21] can be as good as anybody anybody but
[50:24] without Christ on the inside that is not
[50:27] what God is looking for he's looking for
[50:29] unconditional love amen
[50:31] where you just say Lord let your will be
[50:33] done and you circumcise your heart and
[50:36] you dwell in you and you use you for the
[50:40] purpose that he brought your life on
[50:41] earth for
[50:42] amen giving rest for our soo how many
[50:46] are looking for rest
[50:49] how many want more of the rest of God
[50:52] how many want to become the supernatural
[50:54] being of Christ how many want to be like
[50:57] the day of Pentecost when the men and
[51:00] women came from the upper room and they
[51:02] were drunk with the Holy Ghost baptism
[51:04] they were not freed and shy of nobody
[51:07] but the Holy Ghost himself used them
[51:10] amen the lot begin to manifest himself
[51:13] the spoke in tongues and remove here in
[51:15] them they thought oh I know this woman I
[51:17] know this man what is wrong with them
[51:18] and when they went closer to them they
[51:21] found out what was wrong with them was
[51:23] Jesus Christ in them amen
[51:25] and God is looking for one person just
[51:27] one that would surrender his or her
[51:30] heart to the Lord and that one person is
[51:32] you and I amen
[51:34] God is not looking for million bright
[51:36] one person to marry that is you if you
[51:39] give your heart to the Lord Lord take
[51:41] over me amen
[51:43] take over my mind take over my worries
[51:46] take over my sickness to cover all my
[51:48] troubles and you have your own way in me
[51:50] you see the supernatural been walk-ins
[51:53] my step in your life amen all the things
[51:56] that you used to wonder about you so
[51:58] trouble about there'll be nothing the
[52:00] troubles of this world the worse of life
[52:02] will be behind you amen and he loves you
[52:06] your second is you set your loved ones
[52:09] free you prosper you you bless you
[52:12] intend it to be yours
[52:13] amen eternal life is living for others
[52:16] when Christ is in you you don't think
[52:19] too much about yourself but you think
[52:21] about who Lord who can you help who can
[52:24] you help me to help amen who can i
[52:27] impact who can I pray for and you ask
[52:31] God you aren't you walking step by step
[52:33] with God you I Libra what card you are
[52:36] gas business man and women God put his
[52:39] business proposal that's what you're
[52:40] gonna do and you execute it bring it to
[52:43] manifestation amen
[52:45] we're gonna find that you are more way
[52:46] higher so now when we read the people in
[52:48] the Bible we think yes they were great
[52:50] men and women of God but your covenant
[52:52] is way beyond the covenant of Hannah
[52:56] Mary named Miriam Elizabeth Ruth and
[53:01] esta Amen because what you have now they
[53:05] didn't have it when they were here
[53:07] amen more has been revealed to you the
[53:09] fullness of the word was not for for yet
[53:11] but for you God has given you the
[53:14] fullness of the world everything in the
[53:16] man of grass and the man of Christ has
[53:18] been emptied into your heart and if you
[53:21] can't take it and eat it
[53:22] belief means the leaf become their life
[53:26] eats it and let it become out your life
[53:29] be live believe it's different from the
[53:35] way the Bible took the human language to
[53:37] express spiritual language belief in
[53:40] human language means just one second
[53:43] this is read I believe or this is white
[53:47] I believe is your mind no but in the
[53:50] spiritual language believe is not okay
[53:53] this is white yes I believe is white
[53:54] with your mind believe means it's big
[53:58] leaf let it be your life take it and let
[54:02] it become your life
[54:05] leave and that's what God want is to
[54:08] believe his weight you might understand
[54:10] here but you receive it in your heart
[54:13] and Interbrand understand into your
[54:15] heart glory hallelujah
[54:17] what is resurrection resurrection means
[54:20] what dead and become a life risk from
[54:23] death the hakama is read when I'm not
[54:25] dead I'm not in a graveyard
[54:27] in the human mind resurrection means
[54:29] when somebody died we put him in the
[54:31] tombstone like Lazarus then the person
[54:33] comes to this natural life that is
[54:35] resurrection in the supernatural meaning
[54:37] in the Bible meaning no does no relation
[54:39] is relation is what when you are walking
[54:41] on your two feet you think you've got
[54:43] life but in a man of God you are dead in
[54:46] sin and unbelief and Christ Himself come
[54:49] and consume the man of sin the soul of
[54:52] darkness the old man the old husband the
[54:55] osoo the old nature the old character
[54:58] got consumed it and been a completely
[55:00] from you
[55:01] then he dwells here and manifest then
[55:04] you become a live person you become
[55:06] resurrected amen
[55:08] that is resurrection so remember Jesus
[55:09] Christ Lazarus died and went to an - to
[55:13] see him in his sister's Mary and Martha
[55:15] and it's a Lazarus is not there but it's
[55:18] living the machina said now we know this
[55:21] guy's crazy your passes crazy we've been
[55:23] telling this man is crazy you never
[55:25] believe it
[55:25] your brother is dead and he's telling
[55:27] you that he is what he's sleeping let
[55:31] him go and wake him up this is okay get
[55:33] all the unbelievers are we cloud on the
[55:37] leaf clay all your own belief here and
[55:40] he went with Mary and Martha even he has
[55:44] to work on Martha cause Martha was
[55:46] putting the Word of God in the past and
[55:49] in the future but God want to put a wet
[55:52] believe it in your heart
[55:55] so Martha said yes my brother is dead
[55:58] history and in the last day he
[56:01] resurrects
[56:02] future but Jesus Christ Hebrews 13:8
[56:06] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[56:10] and forever so if you take the
[56:13] the history the past and the future and
[56:16] you bring it together you get a present
[56:18] in Jesus so the lawsuit is Thomas and
[56:23] Martha I am their life and a
[56:27] resurrection so we're going to tick
[56:29] I mean easier from the from the amount
[56:31] of system our matmata and matters a lot
[56:34] I believe okay if you believe then let's
[56:37] put it to wake so the Lord took Martha
[56:39] and Mary to the grief site and a lot
[56:42] wanted her to believe with action amen
[56:44] the lockwood of this spook and the end
[56:47] egg and stone the rock will remove say

[56:52] woman but putting put your feet in
[56:54] action it's a road a stone so tamata
[56:57] been and she wrote is true and maybe
[56:58] with a Mary and when they did is okie
[57:01] you've done your part when you forget
[57:03] your love to God His grace takes over
[57:06] amen
[57:07] Mary loved Jesus so she put her laugh in
[57:10] two ways and a lot greed took over shall
[57:13] you see your brother Lazarus come back
[57:16] from the grief and a man who was dead
[57:18] for four days
