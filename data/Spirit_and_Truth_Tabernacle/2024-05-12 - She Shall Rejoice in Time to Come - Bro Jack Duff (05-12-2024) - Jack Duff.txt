the Lord hallelujah amen Christ is Enough amen the one thing needful is Jesus Christ amen we can never have enough of him praise the Lord he's all we have need of Amen let's open our Bibles praise the Lord I wanted to read something a little different we're going to turn to Matthew 21 and let's start at verse 8 happy Mother's Day to all your mothers amen I was reading this little portion of scripture earlier in the week or maybe last week and I thought this would be real nice for the mothers amen we'll start at verse 8 the scripture says and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and straw them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosana to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosana in the highest now I got to think and I was like oh these parents are really doing something it's going to affect their children down the road amen then verse 10 says and when he and when he was come into Jerusalem all all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee and Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and said unto them it is written my house shall be called The House of Prayer but ye have made it a den of Thieves and the Blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them and when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children cried in the temple and saying hosana to the son of David they were so displeased and I got the thinking oh my these children recognized something the wonderful things that Jesus was doing the children knew that this was a son of David before we saw the parents worshiping on their way to church but now the children are in church because of the influence the prophet of God was saying that the mother is the first teacher so these children were learning from their mothers how to worship God and how to recognize the works of the Lord so I thought that was very beautiful and then verse 16 and and said unto him hears thou what these say and Jesus sath unto them yay he acknowledged yes I I hear what they're saying have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and suckings thou Hast PR perfected praise and he left them and went out of the city into Bethany and lodged there amen and I got to thinking how different this is from those 48 children that came out talking to Elisha because of what they learned at home but here you see another example of Godly Parents showing their children how to worship and teaching them at home how to worship and recognize the Messiah when he was a come and I thought it was a beautiful text because of the mothers God bless you and happy Mother's Day to you amen we love you for everything that you do praise the Lord amen sometimes Housewives they may never know how much they mean to this world you never know you sit there you get to thinking how am I impacting this world the children that you are raising to send out and to the world that's how your work is being made manifest when you see doctors and lawyers and policemen and soldiers coming forth It's because of what you put in those children but when you see preachers and deacons and pianists and song leaders and different ones it's because of the influence that you had on their lives never take what you do for granted and you're the backbone of this nation amen God bless you praise the Lord let's bow our heads and pray Heavenly Father we thank you so much Lord that we can come before you and give praise and honor because of who you are and

wonderful service on Friday night thank you musicians appreciate you all amen uh brother brother Quinton Jr just did a a fantastic job uh and ministering to the young people and and and as I'm sitting there just grinning from ear to ear like my God man where you get these things from but uh it was just a wonderful wonderful uh service and uh a very grateful for uh what the help that God has given our church amen it's it's it's it's it's a real blessing praise the Lord uh also you know we had a little problem there with our drums on the Friday night so you know the um uh brother Quenton and brother Quenton went out and got a new set and put it all together uh for uh brother Josiah amen and we thank the lord we found out it was just a a power cable and uh but that's okay we've been we've been um getting along for about 3 years I mean screws falling out and all kind of brother Josiah be up appearing the drums just falling apart on them so uh brother jiah we tried to take care of you brother and and I'm glad that uh the Lord has blessed us with this this new set amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so God is good now I I'll tell you I'll might as well get this out um and I shouldn't probably say it publicly but I I'll say this I I watch um Xander is that right Xander after every service be running over here to these drums or here'll run to the keyboard and when I see something like that in a in a young person I want to invest in that right so um we're going to have to figure out something for brother Xander amen and and I'm working on something uh but I I I like to see when they pull like that everybody don't do that you have to watch the ones that do it so everybody don't have that interest they hear it and like you know but for him right after serving and I mean right now I I tried to give him a little test can you do this he like I I I can't but I still draw to it that's okay we going we have to get you some lessons and they'll give you some things to work on and we'll develop amen another drummer I told yall replication is big for me amen and and and there two things that that that are requir one is uh well the most important thing is you got to have a life you can't do nothing for the Lord uh you can't serve God and Mammon at the same time but you got to have a life serve God give him everything give him your talents give him your gifts he's the one that put the gifts in you now give that back to him and uh and just serve him that's that's all we require just a life just a life a life a life amen I ain't the only one in here got to live right that's right amen everybody got to live right so uh but we want to invest in that young man and we going to figure y way so let me leave it like that amen let's let's turn to a very familiar passage of scripture this morning proverbs 31 amen proverbs 31 and um I will just read one scripture out of this and I'll let you be seated I mean we'll have a word of prayer and I'll let you be seated uh verse 25 uh everybody's very familiar with this proverbs 31 the uh virtuous woman uh passage that is there in the scripture and and if the Lord um if if we have time we'll kind of go through most of it but this verse is what I want to highlight today uh verse 25 strength and honor are her uh clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come come amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray father we thank you for the ability to read scripture we thank you for this uh Mother's day that you have uh allowed us to come Lord and just uh participate in and it's not often that we get a chance to just speak to the mothers so I I thank you for just a little Sermon Just to help them in life's journey I pray God that you would take control over the thoughts that are being presented as well as the thoughts that are being received uh we appreciate your anointing that has been in this Sanctuary uh this morning and father we ask that you would just take us further amen into that anointing as we hear the word of the Lord I also want to remember a prayer request that came in Sister Irma asking for prayer for brother Raphael uh an infection that occurred but God we ask that you would touch him you've done so much for him uh Lord so we just believe that you'll complete the work that you started and we bind the hands of the enemy that's attacking our brother's body and father may he be made completely whole uh in this situation in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you amen you can be seated sister Irma also sent her Mother's Day greeting to all the mothers as well amen we want to take for a uh topic on today amen she shall rejoice in time to come amen we're pulling that right from verse 25 in Proverbs 31 she shall rejoice in time to come amen um and I think it's very obvious that uh um uh a lot of every mother has something that she's she has gone through or is going through and um you know especially when you have uh kids uh you know there's different things that kind of come up in in the home uh you get to you know as a mother you know even I have to say it like this as a parent there is no book on parenting uh that if you do this it'll always work out like this and if you you know that that book don't exist uh the other thing you find in parenting is that every child is different so what you have done with one child it don't work on another praise the Lord you know um I can remember when you know Dad would have to uh you know drop dro the hammer down on us cuz Mama done told them something that we done did and uh just to kind of prove to you the differences in and children uh we as boys knew that uh when Daddy got home there was going to be no discussion just going to be uh he tell us to go get the belt we got to go pick out the belt that we going to get hit with this is you know a little uh challeng in here so we go get the smallest one we can find uh and daddy said you know that's not the one I'm looking for and you know he would pretty much I mean he he go get the belt the strap you know for us but the the difference uh is that my brother uh he was um a different kid praise the Lord my brother would find he knew the beating was coming he knew the spanking was coming but my brother would find things to put in inside of his clothes to prevent the the straps from hitting him right and and uh and and he knew how to act that thing out that when Daddy would swack he would he would jump and ouch and and then Daddy kind of figured wait a minute boy you know something ain't right about this and and and and when Daddy found out what was really going on that was it was trouble then right but kids are different I never thought to do nothing like that with my daddy but my brother thought differently so so so so so kids are different and you got to realize that you have to rais them differently and uh and so there's no book on these things right but uh as parents we do the best we can and sometimes uh mothers you uh have done the best you can with your kids and then they get to a certain age and my they don't want nothing to do with the Lord no more and they done took off and they this and they that and and you didn't let me do this and you didn't let me do that and you didn't let me I mean you just get blam for everything praise God rather rather than saying thank you that I didn't go to jail right thank you that I'm not six feet under like my friends right rather than saying thank you just get blamed for everything but I'm here to tell you this morning you will rejoice Lord in time to come blessed be the name of the Lord here uh the prophet tells us something here in the message mother's day and uh I always like quoting from this sermon there's a couple quotes I like to read out of Mother's Day uh when we hit Mother's Day I think it's just so perfect uh but here brother brandom says mother is so great it says uh you know the first one that receives you uh uh this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart and she is the first to know you praise the Lord uh and the first to in this life to hold you then when you're born she's one of the first hands that touch you and wipes back the tears out of your eye she's the first one to Pat you and to love you and to cool over you amen and I want to tell you something I don't care how old you get your mama going to continue to cool over you little little boys when they being dropped off the school by mama and they don't want mama to give them that kiss in front of everybody you got to understand it's just Mama coing over you and and and one day you're going to want Mama's kiss so you might as well enjoy it now don't wipe it off your face and things like that just enjoy mama let Mama cool over you Hallelujah amen says uh she's the first one uh to to Pat you and to love you and to coup over you in this life is your mother now I think that there's not enough honor that we could give to a mother praise the Lord amen it says mother is the first with the child and she has she's a great responsibility to what that child will be and brother brother brother Solomon was just kind of talking about that in the scripture that he read how those mothers were worshiping amen uh with the the the flagging of the you know waving the the the palm branches and everything and and and and their kids ended up in church because mama was going to church right Mama Mama is the first one uh with the child she has a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel look mother has the responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's why mother has a special little touch now it's Mama's responsibility to place them on the right road but it's it's it's it's it's um you know I think uh I think we all realize that even though we place our kids on the right Road they don't always follow the right Road hallelujah amen but the promise of the word of God says that if we train up a child in the way that they shall go amen when get old they will not depart so at some point in time you got to realize if I've done what God has asked me to do then I'm going to rejoice in time to come yes sir amen amen glory to God here are a few statements that

Christian mother is a treasure to a human heart that's never forgotten we thank God for mothers and I want to tell you that you're going to rejoice in time to come there was a a mother I want to read a quote about her out of the message Abraham and um this mother as we read it you'll know the story as I get to it but uh there was a Rejoice going to happen for her rejoicing going to happen no matter what the outcome of this situation was let's read this amen you'll be familiar with it brother random says now what happened one day while Abraham was sitting there along about 11:00 in the day I imagine you look coming up through there and here come three men with dust all over their clothes walking along you know there's something about it you can pass right by God's blessing and not know not know it if you're not prayed up I I want to make sure we get that you can pass right by God's blessing and not know it if you're not prayed up you want to be ready at all times amen knowing when God is trying to bless you you know I I was just telling a brother here you know I was uh having dinner with him just the other day and um and he was telling me he says he got this great job making really really good money you know on the job and uh but for some reason they keep coming to him asking him to apply for other jobs and he you know and he's like uh these other jobs pay a lot more than what I'm making but I don't really need a lot more I'm I'm I'm good where I'm at and it says I'm I'm going through my mind and just trying to make sure it's not me and my flesh getting in in in into this and I just want to make sure this is the right thing it's not my flesh just trying to you know seek after these things I said brother I I I said so they're coming to you and asking you for you know granting you these opportunity he said yeah I said are you a faithful TI pair he said he said yeah I said okay well I can tell you what's going on then it says because God said that he would open up the windows of heaven and pour you out blessings where you had room not enough to receive he rebuke the devour for your sake I say so all God's doing is fulfilling his word in the midst of your situation and you got to be able to recognize when a blessing is coming your way amen he says you know there's something about it if you can pass right by God's blessings and not know it if and and and not know it if you're not prayed up I think about that prayed up there was a little Irish woman come over from Ireland not long ago and they said she was on a ship and she was along about about time uh they was getting in New York a great typhoon swept across the ocean and the ship was just sending out SOS and it was just diving from place to place the bands had been playing they've been doing all the rock and rolling that that they could and all like that and they started the band started uh playing the captain said everybody prayed cuz this you know sending out these SOS signals they knew that it was rough say everybody prayed everybody to pray what the the way you do in [Laughter] church stop whatever you doing and everybody start praying right now they changed the scene right it says and the band begin to play Nearer My God to thee and they all began going on a little Irish woman began walking up and down the floor and the captain said if we can only hold this storm for 30 minutes we'll come into the harbor and drop an anchor set but if we can't hold it for 30 minutes minutes said we'll be at the bottom of the sea the little Irish woman said glory to God hallelujah so the captain walked up said lady did you understand what I said she said I I understood you plainly sir he said I said in 30 minutes from now we may be in the bottom of the sea if we can't hold out 30 minutes in this in in this In This Storm said I understood what you mean said Hallelujah praise God said why don't you pray my God hallelujah she said I'm prayed up I I ain't got to start praying now because I'm going through some I'm prayed up prise Lord hallelujah so so when when a trial strike all I do all I begin to do is just worship God in the midst of my trial because I'm prayed up we need some mamas to be prayed up we need some daddies to be prayed up not not shook up but prayed up amen hallelujah the devil sent this and the devil sent that but I'm prayed up so I say hallelujah I say praise God he says I understood what you meant said hallelujah praise God said why why won't you pray said I'm prayed up don't have to do any any any more praying said I was prayed up to begin with Hallelujah well said uh why could you why could you say hallelujah like that knowing that you might be in the bottom of the sea she said sir I'm on my road from Ireland to see a daughter of mine that lives in New York she said I got a daughter in glory and one in New York if we go down I'll see that one up there if we land I'll see that one there I'll see one of them in 30 minutes brother when you prayed up it gives you confidence that no matter what happens I'm going to rejoice in time to [Applause] come [Music] Hallelujah glory to God says if we go down I'll see that one up there if we land I'll see that one there I'll see one of them in 30 minutes that's right prayed up amen that's the way to stay prayed up be ready for it she was going to meet one of them in 30 minutes she knowed it either it didn't make any difference to her up there or down down here it it uh she was going to see one of them in 30 minutes now that's good that's fine that's the way the church ought to be all the time prayed up glory to God hallelujah amen you will rejoice she shall rejoice in time to come Amen Let me uh there's a a scripture here in Proverbs 31:30 and again we may go through uh uh some of this in a little bit but verse 30 says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised brother random makes a statement out of the sermon the choosing of a bride he says when a man chooses a certain girl out of a family he must not rely upon Beauty amen he must not rely upon Beauty for beauty is deceiving he says a beauty modern worldly beauty is of the devil oh let me just say that again uh a modern worldly beauty is of the devil amen praise the Lord uh our sisters will never compete with uh these ladies of the world and and and sometimes Brothers you go on your job and you see these different ones in in the world and you thinking that no no no no no no our sisters will never ever compete with with any of that amen our sisters and and I'm going say it like this they ain't just got character right don't don't we we these sisters ain't just got character these are beautiful ladies right with character hallelujah amen natural beauty born beautiful didn't have to add nothing to it praise the Lord amen glory to God but but but but but but brother brandom tells us that beauty is deceiving so when a young man's looking for a wife he can't go go looking at Beauty I told you one thing to look at look at the mother the character of the mother you see the character of the mother then you know what you getting in a wife praise the Lord I'm going tell you one of the things you see that mother is a prayer Warrior now your wife might not be like that yet wait till she get some kids when she gets some kids something going to activate and and and the activation come from what she saw her mama doing praise the Lord and now she become a prayer Warrior and look let me tell you your mother-in-law was always a prayer Warrior something happened in her life that activated that right you got to know there are certain genes that's already there spiritual jeans that's already there and they'll be activated in time to come true amen watch that character right praise the Lord when a man chooses a certain girl out of a family he must not rely upon Beauty for beauty is deceiving and Beauty modern worldly beauty is of the devil oh I hear someone say out there be careful here preacher I say that these things on this Earth that's called Beautiful is absolutely of the devil I'll prove it to you then in the light of this remark let's search God's holy world word to see it it's see if it's right or not some of you women wants to be so pretty see where it comes from in the beginning we find that Satan was so beautiful till he deceived angels and he was the most beautiful angel of all of them showed it lays in the devil praise God you know and same thing happened with with Absalon how he uh swayed the hearts of the people because he had this long hair beauty this this fellow was all about beauty right but that thing was that was very deceitful look at it it say and he was the most beautiful angel of all them showed it La in the devil Proverbs said Solomon said beauty is vain that's right sin is beautiful certainly it is it uh it it it is it's attractive so we don't want to go after Beauty we want to go after character the scripture said that a woman that fears the Lord is worthy to be praised I always have to take a moment Amen in these Mother's Day sermon to give credit uh to my mother amen who taught me the things of God uh mama was uh mama was uh the Christian in the house when rest of us weren't Christians my daddy wasn't serving the lord uh but I I know my daddy knew some things he knew not to get on Mama's bad side so uh certain things that that that that events that we wanted to go to and and we would we would you know we we were kids too we played our parents against each other and we know Daddy would let us do certain things we went to Daddy but daddy always had this this response go ask your mama daddy now you know what the answer going to be and he know that we know what the answer going to be so he just want to put it all on Mama right and when Mama have to put her foot down and say no I don't feel led that y'all should be a part of nothing like that nothing we can do right but I have to give credit to Mama who taught us the things of God uh she encouraged me to read The Book of Proverbs as a young man and and much of what I read helped shape the decisions that I made in my life amen as I read through Proverbs so from what my mama taught me I teach that to every young man read the Book of Proverbs read The Book of Proverbs just keep going over every day if you new to the Bible and a new Christian and trying to trying to understand the Bible just start in the Book of Proverbs start in the book of Psalms just start there and then go to the the the first four gospels to learn about the life of Jesus but you'll get wisdom from this book right uh Mama's correction and teaching kept me out of jail and off the streets I thank God for that uh she even discouraged me from going into the military m set me up I had no idea I I went to uh church one night and I was doing fine but I I thought to myself say I'm going to the military I'm getting I'm just I'm just getting away I'm just getting away and um and and mama said no please don't go in the military that's not a life for you see my mom was a marine my mom served in the Marines and and so she had already gone through what was happening there she like that ain't a life for you I I wouldn't want you to go through that and she even told I feel like God got something else for you to do in life but don't go to the military and I was you know just a young man I said n mama don't really know I mean for a woman I can understand might not be for her but I'm a man the military is for me you know and uh so one one night I go to church and when I get there my pastor you know I knew I had done nothing wrong but my pastor say I like to see you after church I'm like you want to see me what you need to see me for y'all know how y'all do when I say I need to see you but I said I ain't doing nothing wrong so I walked into the office and the Pastor said you know your mama told me that you was thinking about going to the military and I said yeah yeah yeah I'll be going I'm going down to sign the papers I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that yeah I'll be going and uh he said you sure about this yeah yeah yeah yeah my uncles have served and this when Serv and I want to I want to be in the military and he asked me one question that I could not answer he simply asked me says have you prayed about it and when he said that I honestly I haven't prayed for about it this is my decision right I haven't prayed to ask God if that's his decision for me and when he said that that stuck with me and I realized that I had not prayed about it and God had not given me an okay so you know what I did I didn't go to the military but I found myself in another army yes sir a army greater than the US Army praise the Lord a air force greater than the US Air Force for and I'm flying with some [Applause] Eagles my mom remained committed to praying for her family even while we were walking contrary one other things about my mom I I have to give credit to she was searching for truth spiritually and eventually found something that stabilize her family my mama was the one the first one to come to this message and our family and by mama coming to this message uh it actually helped all of us and everyone of her children has been exposed to this message they might not be living it but they know what truth is and and my brother would be the first one to tell you that even when i w living it you you couldn't get me to uh he he would tell it they say you you know people would invite me to the to to denomination churches says but to ask me to join the Church look I know I ain't living right but this is one thing I will not do I know that this is not the where the place I'm supposed if I'm going to go to church I know where to go back to is because these things were instilled by a Godly example that we had in front of us I also say this about Mom she's always been a source of love for all of her children grandchildren and now even her great grands I just watched Mama how you know so this event pop up in this child's life Mama there this event pop in this child's life Mama there and she's always making sacrifices to be wherever she need to be for her children for her grandchildren for her great grands I mean just recently we had this trip planned to go to England and and mama was all set to go but when her daughter when her daughter you know had this little uh situation Mama canceled all that say I know where I need to be and she'd already had the time off so it's very easy of her to be at the hospital with her daughter while she had the time off see these are the sacrifices that a mom makes amen amen the Bible said in Proverbs 31:25 strengthen honor of her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come rejoice in the in the dictionary says is to feel or show Great Joy or Delight oh m i I know that many of y'all have had some very sad days some hard days but there's a Time coming where you're going to show Great Joy or Delight amen uh there's there's different mothers here in the scripture that we can look at that had some situations amen where they showed great joy and Delight let's look at amen 1st Samuel chapter 2 1st Samuel chapter 2 verse 1 Glory Glory Glory Glory amen I'll just read just a a couple verses uh from here but this is uh uh the the story of of Hannah and I like uh the way the scripture speaks about her CU you know Hannah was in a situation where um she was Barren and could not have children she loved her husband her husband loved her but for some reason she just couldn't have children and and one day they were going you know to the temple to one year I would say they was going to to the temple to to to worship and and to take their offering and everything and and while she was there at the temple Hannah just began to get secretly you know to herself and she began to pray and just just talk to the Lord she she was so fervent in her prayer that the priest thought that she was drunk and like no no no no I'm not drunk but I'm I'm asking the Lord amen to to to give me a child because my husband comes with his other wife and they come with all the children and I'm always coming bar and they just pick at me and they they they they sh me and they say this about me and make me feel so bad and and there's not a word that my husband can say to comfort me I only think of comfort me is that God gives me a child Hallelujah she was so so so uh uh uh um you know she she just had this burden in her heart that she just wanted her child so she just began to pray and when when Eli heard the request of her he prayed for her and he said you know God grant you to desire of your heart well a year later here God blesses Hannah and she has a child and let's look at at this verse amen praise God uh verse one says and Hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth I I like this I like this you know uh there's a time where you pray and you're asking God to meet a certain need but then there's another time where you pray to start thanking God for what he's already done amen Hannah prayed amen and rejo and said my heart rejoiceth in the Lord my horn is exalted in the in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation there is none holy as the Lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any Rock like our God Amen here here here here Hannah has an opportunity she moves from amen this this this place of just being uh discouraged and and upset but now she moves to a place where she's rejoicing because God has heard her prayer mothers I'm telling you this morning God has heard heard your prayer and you're moving from this time of sadness you're going to rejoice in your time to come sir no matter what your circumstance is the word of God says that you will rejoice in your time to come not only did Hannah Rejoice for having a child but not God God God does things double amen he not only gave her a child gave a son but he also made this son a prophet Hallelujah God know knows how to make you rejoice in time to come your prayers are being heard there was another you know um uh I won't read the scripture but we know the the story of Elizabeth in the scripture another woman that was Barren and and uh just could not have children for years of her life did not have a child but here you know um her husband gets a visitation from the angel of the Lord and say your wife is going to have a child it goes home and he tells her and uh and and and in her her old age she conceives and she's having a child and again not just a child God gives her a prophet God knows how to double amen your uh he he knows how to double the blessings when you've been going through things amen oh hallelujah hallelujah God knows how to double your I mean you might be getting a lot of trouble God know how to double those blessings Hallelujah it makes it make it makes it worth everything you went through when God doubles it up like that but Elizabeth got uh uh got got pregnant and but here's the problem in in uh El Elizabeth's pregnancy during the pregnancy John stopped doing the things that he was supposed to be doing glory to God but when she heard from Mary praise God and Mary just began to tell her that I've been visited by an Angel and and the angel told me that I'm going to have a child said well so you and you and Joseph got got married said no we ain't married yet well how you going to have this baby with the angel say the Holy Ghost going to overshadow me and I'm going to have a I'm going to have a child and not only and and you can imagine maybe Elizabeth having a hard time believing Mary story Hallelujah but he say he she he said the angel also told me that you were pregnant well how you know that I've been in hiding all this time how you know but the angel told me that you would pray and the angel also told me something else you going to call your son Jesus and when Elizabeth heard that she said wait a minute now I couldn't believe everything you said but but I believe this because when you said the name Jesus the Babe leaped in my womb see God was allowing Elizabeth to rejoice in time to come yes sir amen amen sometimes you go through some difficult things some difficult trials but the word of God say you're going to rejoice in time to come we I know mothers that have lost babies amen and sometimes they get a little discouraged about being able to to to to keep a baby and not have to go through losing a baby again I want to tell you mother you're going to rejoice in time to come because the Bible says this the Bible declares that you will rejoice in time to come God will bless you with that baby when we was over in in in in uh in London brother brother whisper made a comment and I just want to Echo that he says we're dealing with something it says we're dealing with this Spirit of barrenness and we're coming against the spirit of barness Amen every mother that desires a child she'll be like Hannah she'll be like Elizabeth she will re Rejoice I speak it by faith she will rejoice in time to come amen amen amen glory to God Amen there was another mother will read this quote out of the message love man she rejoiced in time to come let's read about her story in the message love my god brother brandom says this he says well I went into the den room on the side and sat down kind of put my hands up like this and began to rub my head I thought I don't know what to do with that AP possum perhaps maybe I don't want to kill her because she's a mother and I don't know what to do about her I was rubbing my head like this something said I thought you preach about her yesterday and see what what brother brandom had said the the day before um uh he was he was telling brother Gio uh Jean and brother Leo he says uh you know this this this little posum

mother here this this old posum the way that she's acting I know that she's not uh here dangerous there's something wrong but I don't know God ain't revealed everything to me but he said but the way

better month so brother Brandon was talking about this pume to brother Jean and brother Leo now he says um he says you made a text out of her I said I I did do that and said well as a mother dime as a real lady she's laid out she's laid at your door for 24 hours waiting her turn to be prayed for Glory to God I said well I didn't I thought what's the matter with me and I'm am I talking to myself I thought who was I speaking to well I thought that must have been God so well I opened the door and went out I shook my head and I thought why I was talking to somebody and somebody was talking to me

apost all gathered up and tail Twisted sideways walked on that crippled leg just as straight as she could right down to the gate little Becky was standing there I put my arm around her that old apost looked back as to say thank you sir right down the road she went with her babies over to the woods he says God in heaven knows that the truth that was printed uh the world round and it's the truth the newspapers packed it the business impacted it says while it was God he knows and if that if God could lead that old aosom up there to be prayed for because she loves her babies how much more will he

I I I I I thank God that aosome a mother aosome could rejoice in time to come let's pick up another scripture aen of a lady that rejoiced in time to come let's go to First Kings 17 Hallelujah she shall rejoice in time to come First Kings 17 and I want to start at verse 17 the Bible declares and it came to pass after these things now I I I I always have to stop when I see you know the the the phrase after these things after what things what happened before this and what happened happened before this was there was a mother who had one child and uh when she had this child this this mother also lost her husband so she was a a widowed woman and uh when she lost her her her husband there was a famine in the land they were uh they were running out of food they were running out of everything and um and it just so happened she had no idea that God had told a prophet to come to her house and that in her house God God told the prophet I have sustained her to be able to take care of you now this lady didn't have nothing to take care of the Prophet with so when the prophet shows up said would you mind fetching me some water and she said now I think we can get that so she went looking for some water and she said now and and on your and by the way as you're going to get the water would you do me a favor yes sir would you bake me a cake first she say wait a minute now hold on hold on hold on the water was no problem but I'm going to have to speak up now because uh I'm I'm getting ready to to to to bake my last cake and me and my son are going to eat this cake and then we're going to die because we have nothing else left after we eat this cake we know that death will be waiting for us so so let us just enjoy our last meal and the prophet say I understand that you're going to bake amen your son a cake and you all are preparing for it say but but if you don't mind just bake me a cake first just bake me a little bit first and and and and and and and and and and the lady something struck her heart and she said I she didn't know whether it's a man of God or not but she said you know I'mma just be obedient I'mma bake this man a cake first and she went and she baked the cake first and and praise God when she brought it to the prophet she went back Hallelujah and there was some more oil amen and there was some more meal for her to bake another cake and every time she turned around and go that spot where the meal and the oil was amen she went back and there was enough to bake another cake and there was enough to bake another cake I'm not sure if God just had an overflowing but sometime the way God do things he do things he just meets your need as you have need of it hallu Hallelujah but in her obedience she got a cake and and she got sustained through a famine because she obeyed the prophet's voice amen she rejoiced in time to come but here the Bible says and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the Mistress of the house fell sick and there was no breath left in him now I was as you think about this this woman had already been obedient to the Lord and providing the prophet the the cake and God sustain her she said say we going to die after we eat this cake but God sustained them and now we find later on that this boy actually ends up dying now look at this she said unto Elijah what what have I to do with thee Oh thou man of God Art Thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son it says and he said unto her give me thy son and and oh my and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he where he Abode and laid him upon his own bed and he cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my God hast thou also brought evil upon uh the Widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her son and he stressed himself upon the child three times and Cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my God I pray thee let this child's Soul come into him again and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came uh into him again and he revived and Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him into his mother and Elijah said see thy son liveth and the woman said to Elijah now by this I know that thou art a man of God and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth this woman rejoiced in time to to come after her son was struck dead amen uh she rejoiced she rejoiced the first time because she she was sustained through a famine but now she rejoices again because her son has been resurrected from the dead amen I want to say something a natural Resurrection would cause any mother to Rejoice a natural Resurrection would cause any mother to Rejoice a spiritual Resurrection will give her the greatest peace and the ultimate satisfaction Mom I'm here to tell you you going to rejoice in time to come yes Lord you remember the story of the mother in Mexico how she rejoiced in time to come and her her son was raised from the dead amen we also remember the story of the woman in Memphis Tennessee how she re because a son received healing and salvation he was on his way out but because she prayed she said I'm yes shunamite but where's your Elijah just so happened Elijah was flying over the top of the city and that plane got brought down right there in her City and brother Brandon went walking down the street and and she says good

I'm just going to ask that you touch this boy and say amen and he say I'm probably going to miss my flight going back but uh but he got up off the floor said amen and start walking out the door and he heard the boy say mama mama it's light in here it's light in here it's light in here it's because of the the the the the the the position of a Praying mama who could get in contact with God young people young people you want a mama that can get in contact with God you never know what you going to go through in life you need a mama that can get in contact with God Amen she rejoiced in time to come blessed be the name of the Lord I told you I want to go back to this list of characters we did this a little while ago in Proverbs 31 and but I want to give you these 22 points again about the excellent wife of proverbs 31 verse one proverbs 31 tells is that she I'm sorry in verse 10 of proverbs 31 uh this this this this this this wife is rare she's rare who can find a virtuous woman her her her price is far above rues that means she is she's rare you don't find this type of woman everywhere glory to God she's rare she's a jewel sir verse 11 tells us that when it says the heart of a husband th safely trust in her so that she so that he shall have no need of spoil it says that she is trustworthy this this wife is is trustworthy praise God he ain't got to worry about going to work and somebody tipping into his house while he at work is is trustworthy you got to worry about when we got kids mama left the kids at home all by thems and not there taking care of him she's trustworthy verse 12 she would do him good and not evil all the days of her life this means that she is constant in her love this woman is constant in her love verse 13 she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands that means she's industrious she's zealous she's diligent amen you want a you want a mother for your kids that's going to be like this she willing to work with her hands glory to God I I I know some mothers that M they put all the weight on the husband and know that he can only do so much get full jobs if you have to get five jobs but she might have an internet business that she can do that and let her stay home and still raise the kids and still provide a little income to the house she's industrious in verse 14 um it says she is like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from afar that means she is Thrifty good woman going to be Thrifty verse 15 says she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her matings um her maidens this means that she is self-starting she see what need to be done and she make it happen she's self-starting number uh uh seven of this 22 points in verse 16 says she consider a field and buyeth it and with the fruit of her hand she planteth a Vineyard that means she is enterprising uh uh she has initiative and she don't mind taking on projects um verse 17 it says she girth her loins with strength and strenge strengtheneth her arms that means she's willing to do hard work hello somebody Good Wife good Mama going to be willing to do the hard work Verse 18 she ceth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night that means she's willing to work long hours the next verse verse 19 says she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff here um she's willing to do monotonous work now you know monotonous work especially when you're raising kids sometimes it's the same thing over and over and over again but Mama willing to do that to express her love praise the Lord amen when when you got newborn babies some of the monotonous work is that diaper need to be changed again and um daddies you got to learn how to change your diap and and especially when it when it's messy Hello daddies you're going to have to learn how to use your baby wipes and and help Mama out by changing that diaper mama always willing to do the monotonous work and and daddies sometime take advantage of that they see that child and really I mean now now oh this just a number one I got it I got it I got it I got it but when stuff seeping all out the diaper uh the baby you G have to take care of the baby no no no no no no you take care of the baby help your wife out sometime let's go on to the next verse uh verse 20 she stretches out her hand to the poor yay she reacheth forth her hands to the needy that means she is a compassionate woman she's compassionate verse 21 it says uh she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with Scarlet this means that she's prepared for the future she's prepared for the future the 13th quality here is in found in verse 22 she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple and they they describe as being she's a good seamstress and if you ain't if you ain't never experienced that with having a a mother that's a good steam stre maybe something done popped but mama's able to take that little thread and that needle and fix it all back together real real quick and and because mama got you wonder why Mama even got that in her purse it's for emergencies daddy don't carry instruments like that but mama got that in her purse it's for emergencies Hallelujah she's a good seamstress the 14th quality uh it says this in verse 23 it says uh her husband is known in the gates when he sth among the Elders of the land and this simply mean that she's married to a leader she's married to a leader number uh the the 15th quality in verse 24 she maketh fine linen and sth it and deliver girdles unto the merchant praise the Lord she is an entrepreneur glory to God mam know how to make it happen she is an entrepreneur uh the the 16th quality here found in verse 25 strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come and this simply mean that mama is not swayed by circumstances God has made me a promise that I'm going to rejoice in time to come so I'm not swayed by what my children are going through right now I'm going to hold to what God told me in his word I will rejoice in time to come and like I said a a natural Resurrection oh that'll make any Mama Rejoice but when they when they rise spiritually it's the greatest and the ultimate satisfaction that a mom can have number 17 uh out of verse 26 she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness and here we find that she is wise and she is kind the 18th quality here in verse uh 27 she lookth well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness she is Duty conscious she's Duty conscious the 19th quality amen verse 28 her children arise up and call a bless you know one time Mama you went through a season Where Your Children rose up and thought that you were the worst thing that ever happened but the Bible says your children going to rise up and they're going to call you blessed her husband also and he praiseth her glory to God Amen here we find that she is blessed by her family and if uh you don't mind uh I want to just pass a couple blessings on to my wife and I'll read the rest of this in a second just keep me there I think I'm going to verse 29 next but I just wanted to just mention my wife has sacrificed in prayer for her family you know we do these Tuesday night prayers um and and all that was birthed from my wife uh Desiring to have prayer with the sisters and um you know and and and and I'm I'm grateful for that I I believe a lot has come out of that I mean we we get people that are on that prayer line that's not even a part of our church and uh but they have uh they have been blessed by one one particular sister that comes on that line uh the only Fellowship she get is the fellowship she get when she join the sisters on the prayer line so it means so much to her that every other Tuesday when them sisters are there she's right there on the prayer line it has given her strength for the journey that she's in but all this was birth out of a desire for my wife I have to give her amen her props amen I've also watched my wife sacrifice and buying things for the children even when she needed to spend the money on herself she did this with her hair and clothes or whatever whatever else she deem more important I watched her give give give to the kids before she would spend on herself I thank God for that quality the prophet speaks of how mother is happiest when all the kitties are gathered at the table and I see this firstand and my wife when we all gather if if uh if that makes her happy on Earth glory to God I Know M she just get so excited when when the kids kids come over on Thursday nights just to just to eat and she be rushing to get home to get a meal prepared I'll just be watching so she'll go through anything to get that meal prepared for her kids if Mama get happy just by sing her kids at home to eat a natural meal it's going to make Mama more happy when she see her kids over in heaven my wife I I watch her even in cooking you know uh I told you we all different and uh I mean I like certain things and but my my my daughter likes other things and my mother-in-law needs other things my wife would sit there and make almost two or three different meals in one night to make sure everybody's satisfied now if that was me either you going to eat or you just going to fast tonight but I ain't making but one meal hello somebody see it was back at those days my my mom kind of did it that way she only made one meal every you either eat this you don't eat that you just don't eat that's how we that's how we realized cereal was a good dinner yes you get full off cereal praise the Lord but my wife I watched a sacrifice that make sure everybody was happy in the house with whatever their likes were I thank God for that I've watched her get paid no more than $200 a week to teach the children of others and I believe she's made a difference in many lives for many families her sacrifice might might not have been noticed by others but it was certainly noticed by God I watched my wife Delay school and a career in order to take care of our family she desired to be a nurse that was what she wanted to go to school to be was a nurse her aunt was a nurse she wanted to follow in her aunt's footsteps and she probably would have been a a really good lawyer had she gone to school but God chose for her to be the first lady of spirit and Truth Tabernacle and has blessed her to co-lead a home health business she wanted to be a nurse but now she co-lead in the home health business see God is always mindful of our desires I want to just say she's a virtuous woman and she's marked with courage and personal heroism let's finish reading this Amen in the scripture verse 29 many daughters have done virtuous virtuously but thou excellest them all that means she's not satisfied with the mediocre she wants to do her best number 20 uh the the the 21st uh statement here about a a Godly mother and wife uh verse 30 it says favor deceitful beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised she is a woman of God and verse 31 give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates she's praiseworthy for all the things that your mothers have done she's praiseworthy uh Young men I pray that you are taking your mothers out to eat today I pray and if you're not taking your mama out to eat today because you ain't got no money I'm going to uh mention this to you next year Mother's Day is coming around again start saving right now that you'll be able to take your mama out to eat if you can't take your mama out to eat how you going to be able to take your wife out to eat amen practice with your mama and take her somewhere nice amen my my my my grandmother told me and I'm I'm going read something here in a second let me just uh let me line up this last last two quotes go to expressions and then uh Mother's Day those last two quotes but I remember my grandmother sharing something with me and it helped me um I was a young man I was doing very well I wasn't married I had a a very good job uh but I was spending it all on me I remember I think Mother's Day come around and Mom had mentioned something about wanting a purse I couldn't understand why she want a purse I mean she got a whole bunch of them you know in a closet why Mama want a purse and she didn't want just just no purse she was really talking about a purse she wanted one of these name brand purses and uh and I remember uh thinking myself no I just can't see that that's a lot of money spent on a purse you know I I I can't see that so I don't know how this worked out but I ended up having to take my grandmother to the thrift store and it was my job to go pick her up and take her to the thrift store somehow on the way to the thrift store grandma got a hold of me and she said now your mama desire purse and you work you got a real good job and you can buy that purse for your mama and your mama is worth every penny that you spend on her and by the time Grandma finished talking to me I said okay I went and found that purse and got it for my mama you know but sometime we need to realize that our M are worth every dime every dollar every flower she's worth it all thank God for a Godly mother in this message Expressions brother brandom says I want to ask a special Lord just now for these boys sitting here in the uniform Blessed Be those boys as they'll have to return back into their ranks but I I pray Lord that on that day we appreciate these uniforms they wear now but may Mother's Prayer be answered may they be dressed in the Holiness and righteousness of Jesus Christ at that day the girls and all together Lord that's what we want to be Christian Soldiers real strong faith guide us and direct us until that day Lord when we meet again we thank you for her life now and pray that you'll be with be with all of us until we meet at thy feet in Jesus name we ask it amen the way mama's going to Rejoice is not just by seeing her son in a military suit but what's going to cause Mama to Rejoice is when she sees a son robed in in Holiness and righteousness and serving God what brings the greatest joy to any Godly mother is to see their children serving the lord she shall rejoice in time to come this is my final quote that I always like to read to the mothers mama I don't know what you're going through but I want you to be encouraged you will rejoice in time to come this message Mother's Day brother random says then as we see him we will not be as we are now will know how to love him more we not stand back with a little fear because we'll be like him well he will be more of a relative to us than he is now we'll understand him better because we're so far away in the Mortal bodies then we'll have a body like his glorious body we'll know how to worship him when we see what the presence of his being has done to us changed us the old back young all the deformed straighten out oh will understand then why his power healed us the question that's been in our mind how can he do it what would this somehow mysterious mysteriously they'll all fade away the knots that's been tied in the back of our minds will will it be this how could it be somehow another Majestic fingers will just untangle unravel those knots and it'll Fade Into the one big crown of Love see and our kids are the ones that have these knots in their minds but somehow majest and they ask questions that you can't you don't you don't even have an answer for but Majestic fingers will unravel the knots Hallelujah and it'll fade into one bit crown of Love brother brandom goes on to say then we shall see him then we shall be like him then we shall worship him then we shall see mother as God wants her and I want you to notice this is my one of my favorite statements that brother Brandon makes mother would not be complete there without her family it's going to be hard for you to Rejoice over there if your family's not there with you so I'm here to tell you God going to somehow some way unravel these knots and you're going to rejoice in time to come mother would not be complete there without a family cuz the greatest time of all her life is to see the children around the table and all of them healthy and happy and to see her pour the coffee or whatever she does and fixes up and her dad sat down and what's the happiest time in Mama's life see her kitties all at home I I I watch my wife anytime she just get with all her kitties in the same little spot it just does something for her you miss your kides when they get up grown and they they go away and you miss them you miss them you you miss those things but when they all get back together it shows that you know you looking for something greater it's not just this this Earthly Gathering but there's a Heavenly Gathering that we're going to someday mama won't be complete if all her children are not there Mama you're going to rejoice in time to come he says this now don't miss don't be missing that day let the great CH chain of your family be hooked together link by link let every spoke be in the will and then when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of Eternity what a day that will be then will understand I I I I I I I simply tell you what the scripture tells you she shall rejoice in time to come the Lord richly bless you amen happy Mother's Day [Applause] let us pray father we are grateful
