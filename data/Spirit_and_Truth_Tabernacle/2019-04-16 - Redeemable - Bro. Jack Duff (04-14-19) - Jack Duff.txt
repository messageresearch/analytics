there's just a little small taste of heaven man there's just a little small taste but man we get to the other side we gonna be rejoicing Church [Applause] so we want to thank the Lord for brother and sister green being with us a man in Tucson Arizona so nice 14 day Cruz and the final destination was Miami Florida and they said well we come in the West Palm Beach they come to be in fellowship with us all today so I'm not gonna take too much time we'll go right into the word of the Lord today if you always stand with me a man I'm so good they have everybody in the house the Lord good to see brother Jeff a man you all keeps us the birds of Prayer the way I had earlier this week we had a young a relative up in Atlanta her daughter Maya t70 is a granddaughter she was riding her bicycle out of ten years old she was riding a bicycle and was coming down one of those heels in Atlanta and and as she was coming down she was trying to stop but just couldn't stop and got thrown from the bike and then the bike hit her in the midsection and caused some bleeding and and they could not stop the bleeding and you know so at ten years old we lost her and so they went up to the homegoing service on yesterday if she is sister Virginia and sister Ashley they're driving back this morning so let's just keep them in prayer and keep my cousin Amanda amen keep her in prayers well in the loss of her her daughter ten years old that is Dennis that is that's big you know that's big certainly what we call a freak accident but God knows all things a man in our prayers that somehow some way God would get glory and man out of this and some might have come to know Jesus so a man just keep them in prayer will say a word of prayer for them as they are making their way back let's just turn to to passage of Scripture here Matthew 12 and then also John 4 or just a couple versus a man from both of these chapters just a little thought that I have in my heart today and just believe in God to help us bring it together we want to talk on the subject of redeemable a man redeemable Matthew Matthew 12 verse 22 is where we will start it says then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and He healed him and so much that the blind and dumb both spake and saw and all the people were amazed and said is not this the Son of David but when the Pharisees heard it they said this fellow does not cast out Devils but by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if I by Beelzebub cast out Devils by whom to your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges but if I cast out Devils by the Spirit of God and in another passage there when one of the other verses where the stories recorded he says by the finger of God right he cast out there was about a finger of God that day that's something that really know your your position in Christ you gotta wrestle with Devils you gotta fight with devils and you just point until Devil's where'd it go hallelujah you gotta say a word just point a man and actually you know you know when we really know who you are the devil come using that please don't don't don't cast me and then be asking permission can we go to pigs please don't take me to the can I go to pigs right that's power hey man we gotta know who we are in Christ he says but if I cast thought that was by the Spirit of God then the kingdom of God has come unto you and let's turn over here to John chapter 4 we want to try to bring these things together in this thought redeemable I'm just reading just the first four verses of John Ford it says when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples in John though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and departed again into Galilee and he must needs go through Samaria they men the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bound a word of Prayer father we thank you for the opportunity to read the word of the Lord but we prayed at the Holy Spirit with Mal make your work clear to us as we just enter into this little thought for today we want to pray traveling mercies for sister firs and sister Virginia and sister Ashley as they're making their way back from Georgia God let them arrive here safely keep them over the dangerous highways and we just ask that you stay the hams and the enemy that would would try to attack them in an awake just we just printed their arrived safely if God as we would just embarked upon the start let the Holy Spirit take complete control over everything that would happen here today thank you for the anointing that is in this place now up north the word as it goes forth to our hearts today state every captive free father jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seen I just wanted to take this thought redeemable a few things that we'll get to that a quote that I heard recently from the Prophet and this just kind of stirred up something in my spirit a man and as we are you know coming into Easter we were already in the season of Easter you know we realized that it was this whole purpose was going for going to the cross a man was to come an extra Dean a man and come to bring those that were lost and make a way after Adam is fallen in the garden Jesus being the second Adam was making a way for us to come back into the presence of the Lord and it was it was just straight Redemption a man a beautiful story of redemption and you know but we want we want to talk about that you know I don't know if you those of you that have a t-mobile apps your service provider a man for your cell phone every every Tuesday they get they give you t-mobile Tuesday and every once while you might get yourself a little something on there that you can go redeem a man and one of the things I love redeeming is Dunkin Donuts somebody can say man but I love to go to Dunkin Donuts in uh you know and I first pull it up on my on my app a man now you got to understand this in order for it to be redeemable there's a couple things that need to align hallelujah hey man you can't be with AT&T t-mobile you can't be with Sprint you gonna have to be with t-mobile I'm sorry but you don't have to be with tmobile if you if you want to use this coupon and so there are certain things that must align first you have to be with t-mobile then you have to have their app and then when you have their app then you have to actually press on you know the the little thing that they give you you got the antenna to this thing right and once you've entered in then you get a little something on your screen say now you can take this to any Dunkin Donuts hallelujah and you can redeem it praise God so when you win it when you get this thing don't try to go amen to Starbucks don't go don't go the Jupiter doughnuts right don't go to no other donors don't go to Publix trying to get doughnuts with this hey man you you this thing has to line perfectly hallelujah Amen because if you go to Starbucks with your Dunkin Donuts you know reward they not gonna honor it hallelujah I pray the Lord help us with this hey they not honor and I want to tell you that amen denominational teaching not gonna be honor this thing got to be just right man you got to have you have a t-mobile service the t-mobile app Amen you got the press on it and then you have to take it to Dunkin Donuts and that's where you can redeem this little thing that you got its redeemable and I want to just tell you if you if you show up at Publix it's not redeemable if you show up at Starbucks it's not redeemable if you don't have the t-mobile service it's not redeemable everything got to be aligned just right in order to be redeemable stay with me here today all right so I want to just start off by reading a little scripture here amen from Exodus 13 verse 11 through 13 then I'm going to read a quote from Redeemer through Redemption Exodus 13 verse 11 there's a statement here in scripture that I want to make because brother branham's gonna refer to the statement in this quote so it says and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites as he sware unto thee into thy fathers and shall give it thee that thou shall set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix and every first thing that cometh of a beast which thou hast the males shall be the lords and it goes on the scripture goes on saying every first thing of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb so Redemption is going to happen through the lamb all right thou shall redeem with the lamb and if that will not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem and that word redeem I'm just looking up in the Hebrew lexicon it means to ransom to rescue to deliver alright to ransom somebody's paid the price for you to rescue you know that you will lost you needed someone to rescue you you were in bondage so somebody set you free and deliverer hey man that's what that's what Redemption is all about Oh Rita God hey man I mean I'm trying to hold off some things but I want to tell you a man true Redemption only happens when you hear the word and respond to it you can be in denominational bondage rather than in the Egyptian bondage Amen but it's still on this nevertheless so when you hear the word and you respond to it then you'll experience true Redemption that in order to experience true Redemption you first had to be redeemable alright stay with me here I just want to read a little bit glory to God you had the be redeemable hey man let me read this this is not a message to redeem or redemption says that's the way a lot of people are tonight friends you just been in seeing so long serving the enemy till you think you're still tied when you really you're loose right you say let's go to Calvary tonight get out of the things of the world oh he's wonderful know that we are free he who the Sun has made free is free indeed and you was free to Calvary when jesus paid the all sufficient price to God the Father when his suffering and flesh and died paid the price for your Redemption that you could be redeemed back to God many of you know the story of redemption in the Bible many of you scholars see of students ministers teachers and many time's little housewives that's not teachers really read the Bible how that God's plan of redemption I used to tell when I was at my Tabernacle the story is speaking on Redemption about on the law Redemption he says that gets out of Exodus of course and Leviticus - the vehicle laws so I used to say if an old mother horse gave birth to the little mule and when the little fellow was born and its ears was broke down now that's a bad mule to begin with he was cross-eyed not neat his his tail stuck right straight up what a horrible looking mule if the mother could look around to that little fellow and he could see him stuff he say oh oh they'll never feed me saying as soon as the master comes out and finds me they'll probably just kill me because I'm not worth feeding he's looking at his conditions looking at a situation say he's not worth feeding he says well that's just about the way we sinners ah did you know that did you know that just not worth very much to God's kingdom but you know if that old mother understood and could speak back to her little coat she could say but wait a minute son you were born under a birthright so see by him being firstborn he could be redeemed right no matter what he looked like no matter no matter how ugly he was he was redeem abode simply by being first born you are redeemable by being born again listen say so since you were born on the birthright you are my first you were born on the birthright and just because that you were born that way you know the priests will never see you the only thing that will happen the man of the house will have to go put a go out into the flock and get a limb that's perfect and without a blemish own it and take it over and the priest will never look at the mule hallelujah he'll examine the lamb because the mule is born under the birthright so the land without a blemish has to die for the mule that's so disfigured I think God he talking about me my sin disfigured me but there was a lamb that took my place amen says in the land I've a perfect lamb dies so that this figure mule can live it says what a beautiful pic what a beautiful picture of redemption on my the perfect Lamb of God died that we poor alienated this spigot human beings could live again what a picture of redemption why that little mule could just kick his heel little heels up in the air and jump around have a big time why because he's Rodina man he can dance he can shout he can jump he can got a worry about what other people say about him what other people think about him because he knows he's redeemable he was first born and as first form and put him a man there was a law that if the animals first important that they be put to the side they would not be offered that on the lam I have to take that that that animals place and I thank God there was a lamb that took our place redeemable I want to go on a little further here let's go into another look quote this is not about a God it is its own interpreter just bear with me as we just kind of set our foundation for where we want to go glory to God I I got some really sharp things a man that I have to say and one of them is everybody's not redeemable everybody's not redeemable that's right a man and you know the profit makes these statements here and we got even pick that up even a scripture you know we want to tell everybody that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son for everybody no God Jesus did not die for people that he knew was not gonna accept salvation amen he only came for those that he knew would accept salvation praise the Lord so so we you know we're gonna get into this a little bit but but lord help us he said in this message God is his own interpreter hallelujah amen he says this now all we are today is the display of his attributes amen every one of us that's it here we are a display of his attributes amen first he was not even God Amen God we would just call him the eternal one he wasn't God because the word English word God means object of worship and there was nothing to worship Him so he was the eternal one the main fountain of all intelligence and in this fountain of all intelligence there was not an atom molecule or nothing like nowhere star moon nothing else God what we know as God the Great Spirit that was eternal never did begin never did in he was there and in him was attributes hallelujah it was attributes to be God there was an attribute there to be God and before he could become God he had to have something that were worship Him yes hallelujah glory to God so he goes and saved it's a did this attribute to be father attribute to be a son attribute to be a savior attribute to be a healer all these attributes was in him now these things that that is unfolded since Tina just his attributes being made manifest now let me just stop there just for a second you know because the Prophet actually tells us now there was an attribute in him to be God hallelujah now before he can become God my mind just think about that he was the self existing when L know him all by himself he was not even God yet you can take that down a man he was not even God yeah until he created something to worship it's like you understand so the first thing created two words that were angels hallelujah a man saw the angels worship and they still worship they I mean they never get tired of worshiping Amen that's what they were created for just to bring honor and glory and worship to God hallelujah but but still in God it was not enough just to be caught it was all taken it wasn't just good enough just to be caught I want to be a father a man you know even you know even you know sometimes we have the same same things we grow up in life and you know we get these little baby dolls and play with them and we play you don't even have to teach kids you don't have to tell them how to play then give the baby doll and start playing house all by yourself this is mama this is Danny this is this these are the kids they this is something that's in them that they also unexpressed the same attribute something I want to be a father amen I ain't even got no Sun she's already thinking about when my son is poor a woman that ain't even got no daughter she's already thinking about when my daughter's born I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that when I had I'm gonna do this but I have they already thinking about that and when that child is actually born that child become an attribute of your thoughts do you want to be a father he wanted to be a healer and in order for him to be a healer well somebody I mean even it feels only one person but somebody had to be sick and ought open this attribute to be expressed you understand hallelujah in order for him to be a deliverer somebody had to be bound and all of them express their attribute of deliverance to set them free hallelujah amen if somebody was lost a man then he can express the attribute of redemption my God my God all right so let's let's let's go a little further with this these attributes were saying God right these attributes was in God now he goes on in this statement he says what I mean attributes was his thoughts he says what I mean is the next paragraph what I mean attributes was his thoughts and a word is a thought express man you have you have young sisters that'll be calling out they children's name before they even have them before even married yeah right they thinking about when I get married that my son gonna be named this and my daughter gonna be made only problem with us is that we don't know where there's gonna be sons or daughters we don't know that because I mean you might be wanting all boys but you love with all girls you might be warned all girls and in love with all boys any man you see but God was perfect in his thoughts God was not like that he knew this was gonna be a son this was gonna be a girl God knew those things and by knowing that he could predestinate all right says what I mean attributes was his thoughts and a word as a thought Express and then that was his thinking when he said let there be and there was let it be there was says now look he says now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was the world you were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking it says before there even was a world you were in Christ I like that before there was a world you were in Christ amen in God in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects amen and the whole thing is God himself materialized himself tangible so he could be handled seen and so forth that's what God is the whole thing I love this you know as I thought about this a little bit you know the scripture of Jesus used and I believe the script you can be applied to all of us he says I come from God yeah and I'm going back to God I believe that's that that's something that each each of us can claim what's right once we come in contact with the true revelation of the word we understand we come from God we were an attribute in God's thinking I didn't just like I say I didn't just stumble into this message I just stumble here no say man God predestinated for me to be here I mean there was something inside of me that was redeemable so when the world was presented to me I couldn't reject it hey man it's like and listen when I take my coupon in here to a mentor to Dunkin Donuts and it's a Dunkin Donuts amen you cannot reject me for bringing it in there it's gonna be trouble if it is right give me a manager I gather to save Dunkin Donuts this Dunkin Donuts I want the coffee I want the donut and I will not take no for an answer [Music] two dollars and no two dollars I ain't taking no for an answer I'm in the right place in order to in order to redeem this to party how are you so when God presented the word to you I'll just work with me here and no matter how you gather you can think about somebody witnessing to you that brothers word God didn't force this on you he does presented it to you some others begin to talk to you a little bit about things in the spiritual that you had never seen before they did not preach Malik at 4:00 in your church they didn't preach revelation 10 7 in your church we sing 17 and 30 in your church those things were not talked about but women when they begin to break this open to you and notice now the reason God had to send a person to you it's because brother Branham tells us the feed word passes through the body Amen it's got to be something and happy with the mom and daddy amen the father carrier seed the mama carrier egg and they gotta make contact in order for a child to comfort but spiritually if a child gonna be born the seed word it's gotta pass through the body see they see word somebody somebody just begin to talk to you a little bit about the message that was a seed word it's passing through the body somebody else lips write to you in abrupt birth they brought a birth it man it brought a connection they said say I can identify with that what church you go to I want to go holla because everybody can't do that there's many other people that were here this word and they will reject it you following a man no no no no no that's you're missing it and then all actuality if you want to leave it there we all following some man if you say Paul said you following a man right we all following somebody but I just rather be like Paul follow me ass Louie because everybody game following Christ oh my stay with me here today you know we came from God we're attributes a man in his mind and those attributes that win his mind they lay in us a man we were redeemable we were seed and therefore we could be quickened correct hallelujah we come from God are we going back to God and I wanna I wanna I want to tell you that you can be religious and still not redeemable we're going to that in a second you can be religious and still not redeemable and we're gonna pick this up with the Pharisees the Sadducees and Herodians they were very religious but they were not redeemable but we also go see a woman at the well she was redeemed can we go back to Matthew 12 and just kind of pick up let me let me just see something here oh my god actually you know before I hit Matthew 12 let me let me just give you this little statement the prophecies are predestinated and this is either massachusetts milk every day he says the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption yes sir the predestinated is the only one that is considered in Redemption people let actually you know what I can't let me let me read that before y'all because this was a good quote they would stay with Matthew 12 but I'm going back to this this quote here I've just got to bring this to you notice what he say here says the natural burst is in three it says what's the first thing happened to the woman having a baby what breaks first water what breaks next blood what's the next process life water blood spirit right what happens to the plant rots what's the first thing stalk what's the next tassel what's the next shuck then the grain comes out of that just the three stages of it till it gets to the grain that's exactly God vindicates that that's always been right god vindicates it to be true so plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption let me go on a little further did you get it let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption people might be making like think they are but the real redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back is that right to redeem is something to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original place so if we come from God and we're redeemable then we go back hallelujah how do you so it's only the predestinated will be brought back because the others didn't come from there right it's gonna be some hard things that I gotta say in a day the others did not come from there that's why they can't go back there hallelujah so you know you can um if you're gonna talk somebody about man yeah I wish you come back home I wish you'd come back home you start explaining what home was like but if they never been there they don't know what home is like all only people that's been there can't understand what home is like and they know what it feels like to go back to a man I know what Heaven's like because I come from me and I'm going back there and this morning I felt a little bit of heaven in here to me Matthew 12 let's pick this up see everybody is not redeemable alright only two predestinated now when we look at this in Matthew 12 we're seeing a man a couple of things I won't read the whole chapter but just you know from first one to eight I'll just kind of summarize what was happening there here the disciples were with Jesus and you know it was the Sabbath day and they'd be getting to walk through the fields a man they began to walk through the fields and they were Jesus and and as they were walking through the fields there's corn there that's growing in the field and the disciples were hungry the scriptures say that they were hungry so they begin to break off some of the corn and then begin to eat and now I don't know how the Pharisees saw him eating the corn I don't know if they do you think if they showed up at church with corn around their mouth I don't know what what happened but somehow these Pharisees knew today we're eating corn I don't know if there were some spy Pharisees right there with that we're following them in the cornfield I've just kind of spying to see exactly what they're doing hallelujah because you know you got folk better follow you and try to spy on what you doing no matter how much you claim to be a Christian as soon as you make one mistake hey man as soon as you Sue's you as soon as you made me raise your voice maybe you got in an argument with somebody oh dang the way Christians act amen you're gonna argue with them let them know that there's a limb that died in your place Amen hallelujah are redeemable and there was a lamb that died in your place so get your eyes off me put your eyes on the lamb [Applause] shouting and jumping because he realized lamb took his place it's not me don't give me a license seeing those but I know that if I make a mistake there's somebody that took my place so so here these the Pharisees alone you know upset that they'd eaten on the Sabbath day they're upset you're not supposed to eat corn on the Sabbath day don't go to the fields and pick corn and eat that that's wrong and here they're coming to Jesus with all kind of questions to me he said now come now now you're going to remember how David and and they went to I mean they here I'm gonna pick it up here now verse 3 and 4 says but he said to them have you not read what David did when he was a hunger and they that were with him and how he entered into the house of God and Dini the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the priests right he says or have you not read in the law how that on the Sabbath days the priests amen in the temple profane the Sabbath in our blameless that the priesthood is their blameless but I say to you that in this place is one greater than the temple but if you have known what this means I will have mercy and not sacrifice you and I have condemned the guiltless for the Son of Man is Lord even another Sabbath day now just begin to come against their their their teachings Yeah right this was this was really coming against some of the things that they stood for and what they've been kind of keeping the people under captivity about you know so so you know that the Pharisees are starting to develop a problem with the reveal word they're having a problem with the reveal where they say there's one standing in your mist that's greater than the temple breeding in this temple I'm the one that gave instruction on how to build a temple I gave Moses the pattern in heaven Moses brought it down to earth he made an even when the temple was destroyed they knew how to rebuild it again and y'all still you're worshipping around this temple but that's one great standing right here in your myths [Music] look at that can't process this oh Jesus they're having a hard time processing a man who did who is this man hallelujah now the next thing happens is they're they're in church and a Bible say that they were in a synagogue and I think Jesus is very strategic about when he does certain things and not only way to does it but where he does it he's in the synagogue here these people to teach him and there's a man with the withered hand and he comes into the synagogue this Dan and Jesus seem just teaching it and nobody's paying attention to this man but but Jesus tell them say now is it lawful on this type of day he actually questioned look at look at verse 11 hallelujah amen since I actually first 10 it says behold there was a man which had his hand with it and the acts of saying is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days that they might accuse him listen and he said unto Him if so so now now they recognize that this man has a neat hallelujah sir they they recognize let me go a little further yeah I might not yeah I might not yeah I'm a shorter scripture so I know you have to agree with me not only did they recognize that this man had a meet they were actually able to take care of his knee stay with me remember that statement there not only to be recognized he had a meet but they were able to take care of me now you say brother Jack why you say that because Jesus asks the question later on he said y'all say I cast the devil out by Beelzebub he said how do your people [Music] get results if you say what I'm doing is of the devil how are they kidding results this is what Jesus is asking all right so he asked so here they know they know that they have something to do but they want to try to trick Jesus on the Sabbath now look just I just love his wisdom look at it here verse 11 he says unto them what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheet and if it fall into the pit on the Sabbath day will he not let nightly hand not me hold on it and lift it out how much then it's a man better than a sheep wherefore is it lawful to do well on the Sabbath wherefore is it lawful to do well on the Sabbath days then said he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched forth and it was it was restored whole like ask other a man like any other so here you know on the Sabbath day they got a problem that you don't fit you disciples day out they are picking corn we got a problem of that not you healing people on the Sabbath day you're doing well good things on the Sabbath day we got a problem with that they're seeking to try to kill them and one is sort of scripted they say they got together with the Herodians the Pharisees got together at holy the Herodians looking for a way that they could bring death to Jesus I want you to watch this because you know these demons are uniting against the truth right right these demons are uniting against the truth and I want to tell you in this season you're gonna have demons uniting against this proof that you stand for but I want you to understand I don't care how religious they are everybody not redeemable so your honor when you understand these things then you're not shoot by the trial right look at it look at it let's go on a little further so the third thing that happens in this passage you know after the disciples have eaten corn now we see a man with a withered hand that's heel and now that the last day before the the the the the Pharisees come to the conclusion that you are Beelzebub right I mean you you are you are of Beelzebub they want to say Jesus you are you are Beelzebub which means he was a prince of Devils rather than that the son of God they call him a prince of Devils that's what this is what the religious leaders thought of him and this is what this is the word that they were going to spread amongst the people that this Jesus is the Prince of Devil's what I want you to see brother branham makes a statement he says they say he called it and he used this term first life in second life he says in their first light the outward appearance oh my god it looked like these guys had it going they were very religious they're very pious and men look like they had everything together in their first life he say but in their second life the one that was behind what everybody could see he said it was so dark down there they could not receive the word but the woman in the way after well her first life was very dark hallelujah Amen hallelujah she went to the well at a time of day where no women went with a pure woman we're not going to the well she had to she had to go at a time of day when women I mean she could be identified with somebody that was virtuous somebody was she cannot even hang out with people like that her first life was dark second life was full of lights glory to God s catch that God was not looking at your first life it was what was behind that first life that's why this word [Applause] foundation and the word will put you out there I don't even care what your position was in the church but what's the word found you you want to come out Jack can you say that because Moses he was second in charge but we need winning when the word struck him he came out left his position I mean you think about it because we say man leave all this yeah when the word find you you leave all that I talk about when the word get ahold of you you leave it all you're forsaken all further for the cause of the word oh hold on to this whirling got nothing to offer everything you hold no into this world when you die you've done with that book so subscribe for things that he turn live for things that eternal Amen so we picked this up here in the scripture Matthew 12 they had this problem and I believe what caused these these these Pharisees a man to reject the words because I have a people who's receiving the word watch this Matthew 12 verse 22 he started there say then was brought unto him one possessed with the devil glory to God blind and dumb and He healed him and so much that the blind and dumb both spake him saw and all the people were amazed and said it's not this a seven Davis so now the people starting to be you know they're starting to recognize some things and they're like wait a minute now we know according to script we expected Messiah expected us to expecting that say is this it's not this man right here the son of David and you know I had I have some questions here who else yeah could fit the description the time was right so so so who else would fit the description the people starting to a mentor to make sense of these things and and before and then the Pharisees can can allow two people to walk in this full light they have to come up with a lie and call them Beelzebub and they use their influence to pull the people back down amen who else could fit the description of son of David and my other question which Pharisee had the same size and Werner's in his ministry now I noticed this when they when genomes at the temple they even though these Pharisees have this type of bility to cast out Devils amen nobody brought the blind man and the dumb man to the Pharisees they brought the man directly to Jesus and if you got a problem I want to encourage you to do something take it directly to Jesus hallelujah my paths ever religiously go directly to Jesus because he's the only one that can resolve it you know Acts these questions oh my god I even said this to myself so which which Pharisee had the same signs and wonders in his ministry that could compare to Jesus and I said this collectively all of them together their ministry still cannot touch the Ministry of Jesus Christ collectively oh my god can I go a little further with this thing because we've seen the Ministry of Jesus return again in the last days one prophet according to Malachi 4:5 and according revelation 10 7 he sent a prophet according to his word and he used that profit so supernaturally I wanna I wanna ask what ministry compared to that ministry together can't even compare do you realize that even in most of those ministries when they ran into a real issue when they ran into a real issue go see William Brett I'm happy to make it recognize that God gave somebody else a little something greater amen now I can pray for you but you still ain't got well maybe this man could discern and tell you what your issues go see William Branham all right I can appreciate Amanda to do that rather than somebody that will not stand up and say we got a ministry on the earth that can help you with your problem what I'm trying to get you to see with these Pharisees no matter how religious they were how highest they were they were not redeemable right because they rejected the word yes the revealed word for their day now they had what we call the written word it's like everybody got a Bible yeah that's right and you know let me just be honest there's two ways to understand the Bible one is receive a prophet and let him just now not that the prophet went scripture by scripture but his talk if you catch the Prophet so let me let me I gotta say some things tell me what not that now that a prophet when scripture I scripture that's what theologians do yeah so so so you have the option to either hear a prophet to get understanding of Scripture or you go to a theologian and what a theologian does because he can't understand that these and the Dow's and the dumbest what does he do he puts it in modern-day language and when they put in about any language they actually take the meaning of what it really meant they take that away because they were not catching it by revelation they kind of by intellect the Pharisees had this thing by intellect and with intellect they reject it they reject it the manifestation of the word for their games you can't catch this by intellect now I want to also say something else you there's just something the Lord gave me know I was thinking on this message faith comes by oh yeah y'all they whip me yet y'all they whip me yet faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God so it's gonna be important for you not just to read the message you have to learn how to hear the message hear what the Prophet is there because faith comes by hearing I got I got I got all Saul in his messages don't see these that's recorded I got so many that I could go back and just listen to I can see how he said that not just brother Brett upset by how did he say that worry the God and then because my faith is gonna come I mean I'm gonna get a revelation by how I hear these things unless they stop reading yes you must read but they can't come back hearing so sometimes put on a tape I don't even know what I'm listening to but I'm gonna just put this tape on by faith in God to speak to me why are you going to bed at night just put on the tape you'd be surprised at what was what's what's coming into your subclass is gonna be an annoying about what to hear everybody I mean everybody sitting within the sound of my voice amen mostly Oliver got anchored because you have heard the words yeah yeah that's right anybody give to tell you something at the prophecy it might not even be what he said but when you're hearing it for yourself see this way you know my study pattern I have read through the Bible umpteen times I can't even count now I forget when I started I had a Lord God help me Jesus years ago Amen I was uh I was so faithful reading my newspaper before I go to work I would get that paper and you know I want to read on the job you know back in the day when they'd have cell phones on the job nowadays everybody be at work just you know I mean you know you we didn't do that back in the day I mean that was you a lazy employee you were fired you did something like that nowadays the boss do it you sit in a meeting with the boss and he I'm trying to talk to you back in the day so so you know I'm like I mean we're not gonna read our paper we here to work so you know I said I was you know I were getting the paper now to read I wanted to keep up with the sports a man so I could have something to talk to people about when I got the word the guys want to talk sports I want to talk sports what about talking to word with them all right but you know I want to keep up with all this information so you know I get I get the results of the game so now I feel like I'm qualified to go ahead and talk to somebody all right well one day I was going down to pick up that paper and was downstairs I went to go pick it up pick it up in and I heard a voice say if you read your Bible as faithfuls you read the sports page you'll be much further of the room I said oh now I know the devil didn't tell me that oh no the Devil Went seen that like that I know the devil will encourage me to read the Bible I said I just heard the voice of God yeah and he only said it once that's all you got to do say it once you remember for the rest of your life when God speak peace speech if you read your Bible Spacek faithful as you read this newspaper you'll be much further up the road I say okay so that very day I found myself a one-year Bible reading plan and I start reading the Bible every day I read through the Bible that first year I got addicted to it start reading it through the next year and I've been doing that for umpteen years now umpteen but I'm gonna tell you even in reading your Bible when I go back and I'm reading something and something strike me and I get it I don't care all right what what helps me filter it yes right right is when I hear what a prophet when I hear what vindicated see that's why I can read to you Exodus Amen 12 what I just read to you earlier I can read them and help you understand what that means because the Prophet just kind of spoke about now hey now I can take that same thought he might've tired of the extra 12 but that same thing gonna be with Leviticus it's also over in numbers so I can follow that thought from Exodus all the way through right as well as they fake come by hearing here in the world here in the world hey man all right listen I'm talking about being real I'm talk about redeemable yeah all right so now these disparities here they got a problem Jesus rebukes this devil he heals to the the man that's blind the man that's dumb he gives them both the sight and his ability to speak and and when Jesus does this David say you know it's just a son of David and this is where they come out and begin the cross I know this man is not Beelzebub and this is where Jesus makes these comments let's go back to verse 25 here verse 24 says but when the Pharisees heard it they said this fellow does not cast out Devils but by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils now Jesus had to do this if I could also use this term that he had to show them the sign of Mosiah he had to show them signs of Mosiah a man and by by showing him sons of Mosiah it gives them the opportunity to accept it or reject it they men if they had come from God they would have received it and they would have been going back to God but because they did not come from God they rejected it all right look at this he says but when the Pharisees heard it they said this fellow does not cast out Devils but by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto him every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself and I mean he fighting itself listen say how she'll then his kingdom staying yeah and Enoch then it goes I'm saying I if I by Beelzebub cast out Devils by whom do your children cast them out Jesus is telling y'all get results - but how y'all doing this if I was doing this by the devil how y'all doing this why I said they had a ministry right they had things that they were taught even Jesus identified that they had something oh my god but what they didn't have was the reveal words come at this limit let me just be honest with you I'm not just looking for signs and wonders I'm not just looking for signs of Wonders I'm looking for truth signs and wonders yeah so now now we get to the story of the woman at the will you see see how this I see how the holy ghost just bring it all back together because cuz you know when Jesus ran into her I told you that her first life was just dark dark I mean and I won't read the quote I don't have time to read all this but but brother Branham actually speaks of this this first time he there's a message call when their eyes were open they knew him out of Beaumont Texas and man hates he calls it her first life was up there blackens it could be her first life he or she was a ill-fame woman right but but I love the way the scripture puts it a man I don't care where you are and how dirty your life is can I say something god no where you at God knows exactly where you are amen so so so - waiter scripture puts it is that you know the Pharisees are creating all these problems with Jesus in and now they're trying to create a disturbance in the church amen you know we find that Jesus is actually a baptizing more people than John right so they're trying to create a sense of jealousy in the church and what does Jesus do when the spirit of jealousy begins to come in Jesus withdrawals himself yes so so sometimes if you see a spirit of jealousy coming amongst brothers or sisters hello somebody I'm preaching real good right there when you feel the spirit of jealousy coming what you gotta do is be like Jesus withdrawal yourself amen just pull yourself out of the situation look let me take some your gift can always make room for hallelujah you gotta push yourself to do nothing God gonna make sure he put you in place to do what he told you to do but don't fight with Gela spirits just went throw yourself so jesus withdraws himself in and in the midst of his withdrawal the Bible say he had need to go by Samaria I loved the words he had need to go buy some Mary and Jesus whole need was just to go visit one person yes can I can I can I put it this way one redeemable person he was on his way to that Dunkin donut the most religious city with the most religious people but yet they were not redeemable and now he's on his way to some city on the side with a woman that cannot be identified with everybody else but he said I got me to go buy some Mary maybe in the vision he see the woman there by herself so you have to kind of come up with something watch I'll go get some vittles sinner disciples oh go get some food go dude I mean God I mean y'all y'all can't be here when when this woman is here right so so here he's these there and he's waiting and and here she shows up to the well it says go get me a drink let me give me a drink you say first you say now look your people and my people yeah we don't even communicate like that now you are no better than that yeah go get me a drink I'm not see I'm not exposed to be I have fellowship one with you like and they just had to start having count he say you say you know if you drop some of the water I got you would even come to this well no more to drink what kind of water you got sir so you don't even have anything to go get my water I be well with man she probably think these are pickup lines but in all actuality it's a spiritual pickup he said did she say anything got nothing to get get water underwear with high down 3-1 senses no no no the water that I give its from from within you inner flow like I'm living water just say what live in the water say now what is this so you know sir I need some of this water at your table I so I figured you'd be action and you know I wanna I want to say something here too when you present in this gust but because the Steve word passes through the body yes but it has to be a receptive I mean my god you know like if I want to plug in for power I gotta have a receptacle somewhere yeah yeah I just I mean when you go to look up ow amen all the walls just gonna take your cord and just land up against the wall you're gonna get nothing you don't have to find the receptacle somewhere and let me tell you every wall don't have a receptive everyone got a receptacle so you gotta know where to plug in to get some some receptacles the inside right is all messed up inside that denomination is all mess so you can't plug in there and get enough of me so so so so you know I thought that I had in I'm trying to present it the right way to you all I can say is like nowhere to plug in it's like a salesperson a salesperson is designed to not get to get discouraged because of a no they're trained not to get discouraged because you said no not only that a real salesperson is designed to take 1,000 nodes to one yes what gives them few is the yes yeah one yes gives them enough fuel to cause them to want to go back out and knock on another thousand doors they never get discouraged with knows and let me tell you it's gonna be more nose than yeses when you're presenting this work it's gonna be more nose than yeses but I'm not discouraged as the notes I'm looking for yes yes Lord I agree with this father yes we're looking for yeses we're not discouraged by news right everybody's not redeemable this woman had the will she say sir give me this water he say he said he said okay well alright I'm gonna give you some of this water but I need you to do something for me first go get your husband and come here and she had a couple things she could do one of them was she could have went back home and got the man that she was living with that was not her husband right and tried to bring him to the will yeah Amen but she actually confessed and said I don't have a husband he said truth truth they say I'm the one you livin with right now is not your husband she say now rather the hug get upset cuz nowadays you testing about it man you know that man you live without your husband you need to stop living with that man hello and rather than you know I mean nowadays we don't do nothing about that we can hear it over and over again we don't do not we don't make no changes to our situation we just stay right in it huh the one you live with is not your husband she said man I perceive I thought sin has been revealed yeah she said I perceive thou art a prophet he say he say he say you know she said she said I we you know we we we actually we've been looking for a prophet to come I mean if your total Sunday school class that the problems come but I preceding that the things that you just showed me you got to be a prophet you've got to be and you know and so I asked she said but now y'all know Jews y'all worshipping y'all say God is there in Jerusalem that's where you gotta worship but but I'll father said worship in these mountains years he say say look it's not the mountain it's not the place that's not what we talked about one way to come to worship hallelujah it's the condition of the heart oh my god and the condition of the heart is that you got to worship in spirit and in truth yeah not just have manifestations you got to have some truth if you don't have truth with the spirit you your worship in a room this condition of the heart one does a place it's not these mountains not Jerusalem it's you got to come into spirit and in truth he see say say say my father is seeking those that will worship him in this manner she say she say my god so this got to be the Prophet say he said he said he said we're looking for the prophecy you know you've got to be the one she said he said the I am he that speaks to you that lady dropped a water pot took off running went inside to sit in for further Branham says that this lady even though her life was dark to the outward appearance that I her life was so dark but on the inside the reason he hadn't need to go by some air because she was there and once he presented the gospel to her just one messianic sign one Messiah signed to her set her free yes so he's went running to the city come see a man that has told me first she told everybody he told me everything I did it's not this the very Messiah one one conversation this lady left it's not this time aside she didn't call him Beelzebub this is Messiah and say she said III don't know about the rest of y'all I don't gave my life to Him but the rest of y'all need to do so much all life the whole city had a revival yeah one testimony set the whole city on fire all right I wish we can just get one testimony here that's just one of what God did that's all God me there's one all God need is one yes and there to turn a lot of those into yeses oh my god can I just read a little bit Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my okay I want to go to the message the mighty God unveiled before us the mighty God and veil before us the Prophet makes the statement sister God in the beginning was life the eternal one in him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back if he has to bring it back it had to somewhere it had to be somewhere here to be brought back to so you see all people all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning in God's thoughts I don't mean we stopped praying for people we don't know who that is but I'm gonna keep offering this see I mean sell sells people offer products we're presenting the gospel we're gonna keep presenting the gospel until we get it yes the only reason we're still here is because we haven't found that last for that's never seen so every time I see some of it oh is this - last one well let's keep presenting the gospel today finally yes I never heard that but yes glory to God when I said faith come back here and I also want to say this faith don't come by reading what you see on the internet if you're gonna read Google and what Google to say about the Prophet would you also give just a equal comparison by at least listening to one tape the faith don't come by reading what Google said they've come by hearing so just hear it one time fine one tape and actually let me let me let me let me let me advise you one tape that you can listen to my life story just make that your first tape just ax ax anybody do you have brother branham's my life story could you just give me that one let me let me read let me hear that one just just listen to it one time my life story what he's telling you is what happened in his life i'ma just be honest you can't tell me what happened in my life I don't care what they put out on Google you can't tell me Cougars it well this what happened brother Jack was born in in 1952 you alive I was born in 60 I know where my mama know when I was born you can't you can't just make up stuff oh just make up anything you didn't take Oh any anybody just take it and run with it right I know you can't do that so so so sorry if a person giving their own personal story about their life you got to trust what they say yeah oh yeah I would assume you ain't gotta tell me if you lie about your birthday is that to lie about your birthday right all right have mercy glory to God so you know faith come by here and so listen and then one is the first message I playlist to my life story just listen to them only man listen to that glory to God see what gods say after that hallelujah so got a beginning okay I got that so so you see all people never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning then God stops see he goes on says look at the press look at the priests when they when they see him expresses up exactly with the word what he was they said it's Beelzebub that show where their nature was it was in the modern thought of the day so now you know I've had people I had the kind of question say are you now you see all these manifestations and brother Brandon's life I mean here you know prayer lines and prayer line after prayer lines City after City Place he never been before just walked into the city and he's telling people where they where they you know you from here you from being one brother half brother branham invite him come preach him and brother bram stoker be there and i say okay and told the dates that he be there and so the brothers expecting brother branham to call him before he got so he can tell him where the hotel was his brother see I mean where brother brain of man he'll sit expecting to be here so he finally start looking around confronted he went to the hotel says brother branham here said yeah he checked in hours ago so he's like brother branham you never been to this city before how do you know where to hotel that God got a way of showing me things yeah God showed him that I'm I what I'm trying to tell you we had a prophet where you wouldn't even need it ways you wouldn't need it Google Maps I mean with him you wouldn't need it none of that you could have been in the backwoods of some jungle yeah yeah what time to happen like this forgive me for the he was he was in Africa no man is from Kentucky he's in Africa and and in Africa they had a little situation I think it was a certain disease that if a person got a disease if if you if you had the cough and maybe the other people in the village didn't have a copper Tuesday only one with a car and this person contact disease they would take your car and take that man to the hospital which would be days drive to get him to the hospital so so you know brother branham's Jeremy's witness brother said my brother if this if a person had this disease you know we'd only ones with this car here what do you think I happen a man say brother brother branham their meetings to be cancelled because would be stuck here and this in this area with baby but we wouldn't be able to get to means we'd be stuck in this area today brought the car back to us they've come take the car run take the car and we'll be stuck here it says okay you told that brother that on one day the very next day okay after brother out of hand said come come with me went running through the bushes in Africa and there was and while he running through he said oh can I stay right here and the brother stopped and when he stops he said he saw a group of men carrying a man running where they running to to get that truck this man was sick so brother banners say stop and he said he told a brother lay hands on ya and the brother lay hands are prate and they still ran and got the truck when they got the truck they turned around and came back because the man was healed they would have been stuck for days God had a weight of showing him these things now with manifestations like this in his life yeah was this of God of the devil that's why if you if you if you if you if a smart man like it like Jesus actually was John the Baptist from God Oh what is this they say what we came tailed that's a good answer it's better for you to say something like that I'll read it in a come again scar can I be honest with you you're not fighting brother talk about redeemable the question is are you redeemable and the way you can tell is whether you can respond to the were denied let me keep reading I'm almost there I promise few more things to read and I'm I'm a I leave it I thank God for it no I think he says but uh can you slide up just a little bit oh now say look look look at the priests there you go right there look at the priests when they see him express himself express yourself exactly with the word what he was they said Espio Beelzebub that showed where their nature was it was in the modern thought of the day but when the little prostitute that he met at the gate until her expressed his messianic sign by telling her what she had done why she said sir I perceive it that that you are a prophet we know the Messiah when he comes he would tell us all these things she was recognizing him as Messiah The Anointed One because he met the scripture qualifications that's the thing that's what I look at they brother branham meet the scripture qualification i'ma tell you they can't say yes or no to that to what they say is that John the Baptist will feel that Malachi 4 John the Baptist in at Luke 1 yeah I got you on that I know John the Baptist to feel a part of it yeah what about this other part yes well John that lets say okay they say John the Baptist fulfill its every so when Jesus said that Elias has come I mean the last will come and has come already so then he said and there was John the Baptist I'll see ya we read that too for what about the will come the hath come already what's John the Baptist but the will come is who and not only will come will come and restore all things what did John the Baptist restore yeah I haven't studied that I mean let me just be honest with you there is nothing to study yeah there's nothing to study Jesus knew exactly what he was saying yes restore all things all right already got so he goes on here in this quote he says sir I perceive your prophet we know Messiah when he comes to tell us all things she was recognizing him as Messiah knowing when he met the scripture qualifications don't you see the two pieces of people were coming together see we see we know that when the Messiah cometh now God might have had to interpret this and that to get this certain thing king of the Bell like the molder but when Jesus turned said I am he that speaks with you there was no such no such an expression as Beelzebub she left her waterpot ran into the city and said come see a man who told me the things that I've done isn't this the very Messiah see now what did this put in the old scripture with the experience that Jesus was given to her what did it do it may the Messiah did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking at the beginning so it redeemed her or brought her back when she sing the expressed scripture manifested of Jehovah what he was what he is my god no matter how dark her life Jesus had need to go by Samaria in order to get that lady out of there because she was the one in Samaria that was redeemable she was a thought of God a man and if you come from God you're going back to God I don't care what church you might be in what ball you might be in if you're thought of God you got to come out you've got to come and when this word strikes you it will bring you out cuz you ain't gonna hear nothing like this nowhere else that's right glory to God yeah alright he goes on to say this action I have to tell you what I'll leave that I'll leave that right there oh my so let me finish with this last quote out of the church age book and I'm going to paragraph 152 1 but actually it would be a little bit just before that it'll be at 1 paragraph before that so just type in 150 to 1 and I'll just go to the paragraph right before it it'll say in very plain language the true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not Express until each came forth in their designated decree season and this is your season and as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body yeah thus this bride is the literal spoken word see Bride and though she is feminine and designation she's also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and it's now manifesting God and a mini member body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ it goes on says now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos was man fest in the Sun and in Jesus what all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in the flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts and our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifest in the flesh and those eternal thoughts thoughts now manifested flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called so we can call ourselves sons of God and we can call ourselves eternal folks of God right he says even as we're so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the lip can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened hey that's the reason you can sit here today that's right I mean I'm telling your first life no matter how dark it was the reason you can come to this message no matter how you got here it's because you received something there to quicken any man listen in non seat there's nothing to quicken that's because our holdest careful in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed blood brought back his own he broked he bought back the spoken word Sea Bright my sheep hear my voice word so as you listen to the tape you're not listening to brother Branham and listening to God's voice through his prophet my sheep hear my voice word and they followed me you always were sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there's no change in specie as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come update and I pray today is that day there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father colors remember I started off saying it was an attribute in him to be a father in order to be a father he had to have some children a man and so you have to become aware that dad is calling a way of the father called us and recognized that we are the sons of God we heard his voice and we cried out as did the part of the song son save me oh my father I am returning to the church in order to be redeemable you had to be there in God's thoughts before this world ever began and you're coming here every time you come here it's not a mistake every message that you hear from this pulpit it's not a mistake all right right I mean none of your life has been a mistake God has been orchestrating every step that you've taken hallelujah Gloria and I don't care how messed up life was for you that's why I wouldn't put anybody down I don't care some time you look at people that man they just ain't gonna make it you don't know who gonna make a new knot you just better be worried about yourself am I don't make it right but I can tell you this much no matter how messed-up life may seem and glory to God I can I can raise my hand say I'm redeemable thank God not not only that he presented the message to me but he had something in me that was a receptacle I could receive it thank God for that thank God Pharisees could receive it but you have something in you that could receive it god bless you redeemed musicians that you would come in man let's bow in the word of Prayer dear God we're thankful for your word Lord your your prophet has brought some things to our attention and we realized oh god that if it had not been us being a thought an eternal thought of God we would not be in the place we are today there's no way we could sit here no matter how dark life may be sometimes and God we can we can look like that little mule could look just because he was born on a birthright he when he was first born my he was first born he didn't have to worry about dying because something else innocent lamb died in his place and God sometimes we look at ourselves we realize yes our we're not worried that it's stabbing your presence we're not because of the sand that separates us from you but when we're washed in your blood you make us worthy father even today as we stand here Lord if there's things that are in our life God that we that have displeased you think that we've done we want to apologize even right now in your presence God would

proposition she was sweet right then she was forgiven God we lead that forgiveness Lord to flood our souls and God made me rise up from this day in and not only not only claim that we're redeemable but begin to walk in that live like we have been redeemed talk like we have been redeemed Oh God let us live that way thank you for your blood that was shed at Calvary the cross thank you for your
