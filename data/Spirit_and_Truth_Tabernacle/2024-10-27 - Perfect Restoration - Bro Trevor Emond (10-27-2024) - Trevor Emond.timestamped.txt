[56:15] morning if you have your Bibles turn to
[56:17] um Second
[56:19] Timothy chapter
[56:21] 3 we'll read verses 16 and 17 together
[56:30] just a wonderful atmosphere this morning
[56:34] wonderful time of worshiping the Lord
[56:36] Jesus
[56:40] Christ so second Timothy chapter 3 ver
[56:44] 16 and 17 all scripture is given by
[56:48] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[56:51] Doctrine for reproof for correction for
[56:54] instruction and righteousness that the
[56:56] man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[57:00] furnished unto all good works so there's
[57:04] a there's an aim or a desire that the
[57:08] Lord has had for us and that is that we
[57:11] might be
[57:13] perfect and how will that happen well
[57:16] the word of God would come to our hearts
[57:20] all right let's go to the Lord in prayer
[57:21] father as we look at your word father we
[57:24] realize that you've given to it to us
[57:26] for our instruction for our Repro Lord
[57:29] for all of these things but father that
[57:31] you wanted us to be perfect and
[57:33] thoroughly furnished unto good works and
[57:35] so father that's why we come today Lord
[57:38] to as as we talked Friday night about
[57:40] you wanting to express yourself father
[57:42] that as we look into the word we get to
[57:44] know you more and see that expression so
[57:47] that we can uh reflect that expression
[57:49] in our own lives as well father change
[57:52] our hearts uh just Lord may we yield to
[57:55] you and may you
[57:57] supernaturally uh give us that portion
[58:00] that we have need of by your Holy Spirit
[58:02] Lord as you promised and we thank you
[58:05] for these things now anoint the service
[58:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[58:09] your glory amen amen you may be
[58:12] seated also would like you to turn to
[58:14] Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 yes sir
[58:20] seems like everyone probably knows what
[58:22] that scripture is oh my what have I just
[58:28] my reset my timer
[58:32] here there we
[58:35] go everyone knows what a timer is
[58:38] for tells you how bad you're doing
[58:40] that's that's what it's for so anyway
[58:44] um so Joel chapter 2 verse 25 I will
[58:47] restore to you the years the Locust hath
[58:50] eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar
[58:52] and the Palmer worm my great Army which
[58:54] I sent among you and ye shall eat and
[58:56] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[58:57] name of the Lord your God that hath
[58:59] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[59:01] shall never be ashamed you want to back
[59:04] up one verse really fast I want to focus
[59:07] on something for just a moment um the
[59:09] Lord is telling us he's going to restore
[59:11] and then at the end of that next verse
[59:13] he's going to say my people shall never
[59:14] be ashamed but in the middle
[59:17] there all these the Locust hanker worm
[59:20] caterpillar Palmer worm all of these
[59:22] things that that that have come and
[59:25] destroyed and taken parts of the faith
[59:27] away and how terrible that is and where
[59:30] did those come from who sent that all
[59:32] right read
[59:34] it my great Army all right which I sent
[59:39] among
[59:40] [Music]
[59:44] you struggle bust
[59:47] today my wait a second Lord like what's
[59:51] he talking about like he's he's telling
[59:53] I'm going to restore their in captivity
[59:55] all right right they're going to be sent
[59:57] to captivity but God says I'm but don't
[59:59] worry I'm going to restore and when I
[1:00:02] restore what I so I'm bringing this Army
[1:00:05] among you but when I restore you after
[1:00:09] the
[1:00:10] fact you will never be
[1:00:16] ashamed Hallelujah because after the
[1:00:20] restoration after the completion of
[1:00:24] restoration you can no longer be
[1:00:28] ashamed glory amen as we talked about
[1:00:32] last night we looked at Acts chapter 1
[1:00:34] verse 6 when therefore they were
[1:00:36] therefore come together they asked him
[1:00:38] saying Lord wilt thou at this time
[1:00:39] restore again the kingdom to Israel and
[1:00:43] and also we looked at Luke 17 and verse
[1:00:45] 21 neither shall they say Lo here Lo
[1:00:47] there for behold the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:00:50] is within you and so we talked about the
[1:00:52] Kingdom of Heaven coming into your heart
[1:00:55] amen and being restored and when that
[1:00:57] restoration happens that restoration is
[1:01:00] happening in your heart and so we want
[1:01:02] to kind of look at these at this idea a
[1:01:06] little bit more this morning and uh I I
[1:01:09] didn't give a title Friday night but
[1:01:11] that was um the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:01:13] within you amen um but this morning I
[1:01:16] want to talk about
[1:01:17] perfect
[1:01:20] restoration
[1:01:21] perfect restoration Hallelujah so we
[1:01:24] want to talk about perfection
[1:01:26] right and what does it mean that
[1:01:28] something is perfected and you know I
[1:01:32] most of you know me well enough by now
[1:01:34] to recognize that I ask questions and
[1:01:37] and I challenge the assumptions that we
[1:01:40] hold right like Perfection
[1:01:44] hello right brother Trevor's asking
[1:01:47] what's Perfection like like we're fourth
[1:01:49] graders or something like that we're
[1:01:50] just learning how to SP p e r f e c t
[1:01:54] perfect um come on brother the state of
[1:01:57] being perfect no what well what does
[1:01:59] that mean what is what is it what we're
[1:02:01] saying when we say something is perfect
[1:02:04] and is there variation in in what we
[1:02:06] mean by perfect and so often we talk
[1:02:09] about perfect as in you know uh nothing
[1:02:11] wrong you know no errors and we would
[1:02:15] say yes absolutely perfect means no
[1:02:18] errors but does that but is there more
[1:02:21] than just the the state of not having an
[1:02:24] error in it is there is there more there
[1:02:28] and so we want to we want to look at it
[1:02:30] so so let's look at Psalm umap 19:7
[1:02:33] don't put it up there yet sister just
[1:02:35] find it hold it there because I have to
[1:02:38] ask a question before that gets
[1:02:40] displayed to
[1:02:42] everybody is the law perfect
[1:02:47] wow I instant replay cam right there
[1:02:51] show it right here yes that question
[1:02:52] what are you doing to us now this
[1:02:54] morning brother Trevor in this service
[1:02:56] like is the law perfect and you know
[1:02:59] it's like well you know who's going to
[1:03:02] say nope the law is not
[1:03:04] perfect it's like well you could you you
[1:03:07] could you could reason it's like well
[1:03:09] but you know uh Romans 8:3 you know the
[1:03:12] the what the law could not do and that
[1:03:14] it was weak through the flesh though the
[1:03:15] law was perfect but through my flesh you
[1:03:18] know God sending his own son in the
[1:03:20] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:03:22] condemn sin in the flesh so the law
[1:03:24] couldn't do that but was the law perfect
[1:03:27] it's like yes the law was perfect so we
[1:03:29] look at it in Psalm chapter 19 and verse
[1:03:32] 7 that the law of the Lord is perfect
[1:03:36] right converting the soul right the
[1:03:39] testimony of the Lord is sure making
[1:03:41] wise the simple so the law is perfect
[1:03:45] Glory
[1:03:48] yes hallelujah it's not it's not me it's
[1:03:52] not me saying it right the inherent God
[1:03:56] breathed inspired word of God saying the
[1:03:58] law of the Lord is perfect we're all
[1:04:01] together now that's right okay so let me
[1:04:03] ask a question now though that as we
[1:04:04] stare at this saying that the law of the
[1:04:07] Lord is perfect does so let me ask could
[1:04:10] could the law then a perfect law could
[1:04:13] it be
[1:04:15] magnified but but it's perfect pastor
[1:04:18] says yes anybody want to disagree with
[1:04:20] the pastor could the law the perfect
[1:04:23] law could it be made more
[1:04:29] honorable but it's perfect come on
[1:04:31] brother it's perfect how can it be
[1:04:33] magnified it's perfect how could it be
[1:04:35] made more honorable but I could direct
[1:04:38] your attention to Isaiah chapter
[1:04:49] 42 Isaiah 42:
[1:04:53] 21 the Lord is well pleased for his
[1:04:56] righteousness sakes sake he will magnify
[1:04:59] the law and make it
[1:05:03] honorable so what you're telling me
[1:05:06] then Isaiah what you're telling me is
[1:05:09] that that while David said the law of
[1:05:11] the Lord was perfect all right it was
[1:05:14] yet without honor wow he's going to make
[1:05:17] it honorable wow God is going to make
[1:05:20] his law honorable and so I I want to I
[1:05:23] want to bring you then to to the Jews
[1:05:25] right there at at Jesus's time they had
[1:05:29] the law and as we said last your Friday
[1:05:32] night like they had Moses culture that
[1:05:35] they developed around the law but that
[1:05:37] law was that law when it was when it was
[1:05:40] practiced and exercised by those
[1:05:44] Pharisees was it
[1:05:46] honorable amen instant replay cam right
[1:05:50] there yes help me preach now right
[1:05:55] no no it was not honorable were they but
[1:05:59] did they have the law of
[1:06:01] Moses was it like look it was perfect
[1:06:05] like right Exodus 20 when God gives the
[1:06:08] law to mooses written by the Finger of
[1:06:10] God you know then Moses what are we
[1:06:12] trying to say that Moses broke the
[1:06:13] tablets then and then when he went back
[1:06:16] to get them you know that then there
[1:06:17] were some transcription errors on the
[1:06:19] second set like no the law was
[1:06:22] perfect amen they had the perfect law
[1:06:27] but yet even if they've been given the
[1:06:29] perfect law they're struggling with it
[1:06:31] being
[1:06:32] honorable it has not yet been made
[1:06:35] honorable so Jesus comes and there he is
[1:06:38] on the mount uh uh you know preaching in
[1:06:41] Matthew Chapter 5 67 you know and he's
[1:06:44] saying blessed are the peacemakers and
[1:06:46] blessed are the merciful and they're
[1:06:47] like
[1:06:49] what what the law says eye for an eye
[1:06:52] all right the law says tooth for a tooth
[1:06:55] come on you know the law says hey you
[1:06:57] know and then and then Jesus you know
[1:06:59] you forgave that woman that was caught
[1:07:01] in adultery on and the law says she
[1:07:04] should have been
[1:07:06] stoned right the perfect law said that
[1:07:10] woman should have been
[1:07:12] stoned and then you come walking in here
[1:07:15] tell us you're the Messiah and you won't
[1:07:18] honor the perfect
[1:07:21] law but what I tell you this morning is
[1:07:25] that when Jesus came with Mercy in his
[1:07:28] heart and asked all of them if you don't
[1:07:32] have like whoever doesn't have sin you
[1:07:34] cast the first stone when Jesus said
[1:07:38] that he made the law
[1:07:42] honorable he magnified the idea behind
[1:07:46] the
[1:07:47] law he came and man he was the The
[1:07:50] Living manifestation of the entire
[1:07:53] expression of God from before the
[1:07:55] foundation of the world walking in shoe
[1:07:58] leather and now came and took the law
[1:08:02] and made it honorable no longer was it
[1:08:05] overly harsh or applied incorrectly but
[1:08:09] now the very Heart Of God was walking in
[1:08:13] full knowledge and revelation of that
[1:08:15] law displaying what it meant to the
[1:08:19] people
[1:08:21] God so the perfect law became honorable
[1:08:26] hallelujah amen
[1:08:28] amen he begins to go through the law in
[1:08:31] that Sermon on the
[1:08:33] Mount you it it has been
[1:08:36] said you know you shall not
[1:08:41] kill but I say unto you that's right but
[1:08:45] I make the law more honorable to you
[1:08:48] that he that hates his brother Without a
[1:08:52] Cause right it has been said Thou shalt
[1:08:57] not commit
[1:08:58] adultery but I say unto you but I bring
[1:09:03] you the honorable portion that somehow
[1:09:05] you
[1:09:07] missed that if you look upon a woman
[1:09:09] with lust in your heart right that's the
[1:09:12] point amen yes sir amen so he makes the
[1:09:17] law more honorable he takes a p a
[1:09:21] perfect
[1:09:22] law and he magnifies
[1:09:25] and makes it
[1:09:28] honorable so let me ask you
[1:09:33] this was was
[1:09:36] Jesus
[1:09:40] perfect and nobody going to say
[1:09:43] no was Jesus Perfect When Jesus came and
[1:09:47] was born and laid wrapped in swaddling
[1:09:49] clothes and laid in that manger was he
[1:09:52] perfect yes he was when Jesus was 12 12
[1:09:55] and he was disputing with the Pharisees
[1:09:57] and this and and the priests in the
[1:09:59] temple was he perfect yes yes he was
[1:10:02] perfect when he was when he was filled
[1:10:04] with the spirit there and the baptism
[1:10:06] and the Dove came down God said this is
[1:10:09] my beloved Son whom I'm well pleased was
[1:10:12] he perfect yes sir yes he was yes he was
[1:10:16] but I I would like to turn your
[1:10:19] attention to Hebrews chapter
[1:10:23] 5 verses 8 and nine and you can go ahead
[1:10:27] and just throw that up there sister
[1:10:28] because I'm done asked the question
[1:10:31] already Hebrews chapter 5 though he were
[1:10:34] a son yet learned he
[1:10:37] obedience by the things which he
[1:10:39] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:10:43] became the author of Eternal salvation
[1:10:44] unto all them that obey him brother
[1:10:48] brandham says in plain language the very
[1:10:50] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:10:53] suffering and according to Paul he left
[1:10:55] his church a measure of suffering too
[1:10:57] that their faith in God while suffering
[1:11:00] for him would come to a place of
[1:11:04] perfection so even Jesus himself as as a
[1:11:08] man is going through though he's perfect
[1:11:10] though he's sinless yet he's becoming
[1:11:14] even more perfect by the things that
[1:11:17] he's suffering that on the day like like
[1:11:21] like you could say that on the day he
[1:11:22] died and was nailed to that cross on
[1:11:25] Calvary he perfected
[1:11:29] love he was he became the Perfection of
[1:11:33] Love itself he became the full extension
[1:11:36] the full absolute expression of what it
[1:11:38] is to love because Greater Love have no
[1:11:42] man than this that a man laid down his
[1:11:45] life for his
[1:11:47] friends he doesn't just ask you to do it
[1:11:49] he's already walked through it for
[1:11:52] you and so he became perfect
[1:11:55] by the things that he suffered the
[1:11:58] expression that was there in the mind of
[1:12:01] God back before the foundation of the
[1:12:04] world before he created light before he
[1:12:07] created galaxies the heart that was
[1:12:09] there in God now comes to its full
[1:12:13] expression of love and that love is now
[1:12:16] made perfect because it's fully
[1:12:20] known amen
[1:12:22] hallelujah amen because
[1:12:26] isn't isn't that just amazing yes sir
[1:12:30] yes sir because the thoughts of God are
[1:12:32] now fully expressed in human flesh my
[1:12:36] that that's that's just amazing you
[1:12:40] know
[1:12:42] amen I just I okay I have to segue here
[1:12:45] into the thoughts of God H the the
[1:12:48] thoughts of God you know when when when
[1:12:51] God said let there be light he spoke and
[1:12:55] he believed his own word and it was
[1:12:57] created right so so and we know that
[1:13:01] that the that the life that comes inside
[1:13:03] of us is the same as this Angel speaking
[1:13:06] to Mary and she believed the the word
[1:13:10] the Angel's word the messenger's word
[1:13:13] come on somebody okay and and and and
[1:13:16] believed it and it created life inside
[1:13:20] of her so so the spoken word of God
[1:13:23] creates light creates
[1:13:26] life okay so where does the spoken word
[1:13:29] of God come
[1:13:31] from well the spoken word of God then be
[1:13:34] before you can speak anything it's it's
[1:13:37] got to be in your thoughts it's and we
[1:13:40] know the thoughts of God are
[1:13:43] Eternal you know there goes my thoughts
[1:13:45] you know like how do you have an eternal
[1:13:46] thought when did that thought start you
[1:13:48] know like I just started thinking about
[1:13:50] what we might have for lunch but that
[1:13:51] just now happened but but but God's
[1:13:55] thoughts don't have a just now
[1:13:56] happen they were Eternal and I just you
[1:13:59] know I can't I can't handle that so but
[1:14:02] but so the Eternal thoughts of God but
[1:14:04] where did those thoughts come
[1:14:07] from where does where does your thoughts
[1:14:10] come
[1:14:11] from you say well you know your brain
[1:14:15] thoughts thinking happens in the brain M
[1:14:19] and so then I would ask you like okay
[1:14:21] but but where do good thoughts come from
[1:14:24] your brain
[1:14:25] because we said thoughts came from the
[1:14:27] brain okay where do bad thoughts come
[1:14:29] from your brain so is your brain bad or
[1:14:33] good ah but there's there there's an
[1:14:36] element of not brain in there right
[1:14:39] because because if you're going to say
[1:14:40] that it's good or bad it's coming from
[1:14:43] some other place in your body that is
[1:14:46] not your brain because the scripture
[1:14:48] said as a man thinketh in his heart so
[1:14:53] is he is he good or is is he bad depends
[1:14:56] on his heart so if you're if you're
[1:14:59] thinking good thoughts it's because your
[1:15:02] mind is connected to your
[1:15:05] heart so so I want to go back a second
[1:15:08] now so then where are the thoughts of
[1:15:10] God coming from they're coming from the
[1:15:13] heart of God so what we see expressed is
[1:15:18] the very Heart Of God
[1:15:21] expressed and so and so when Jesus comes
[1:15:24] and dies for you the the heart of God
[1:15:28] that existed that that that created the
[1:15:30] mind of God if I if I can say it that
[1:15:33] way just in a way that we can grasp it
[1:15:36] right is the the those thoughts that
[1:15:38] were Eternal thoughts of God came from
[1:15:40] the Eternal Heart Of God which became
[1:15:44] expressed and acted out and lived before
[1:15:47] us in the form of Jesus Christ and now
[1:15:50] wants to express through you amen the
[1:15:53] very Heart Of God coming to the believer
[1:15:56] to be expressed and this is restoration
[1:15:59] that ultimately we're talking
[1:16:02] abouten so Jesus became perfect not that
[1:16:05] he wasn't created sinless but that he
[1:16:08] became the perfect expression of the
[1:16:11] heart of God that was before the
[1:16:13] foundation of the world amise
[1:16:17] god brother Brenham goes on in the
[1:16:20] Philadelphia and church age in the
[1:16:22] church age book he says these things
[1:16:25] saith he that is true now this word true
[1:16:27] is a wonderful word it does not mean
[1:16:29] true in the sense that it is opposite to
[1:16:32] false right right it expresses the
[1:16:34] perfect realization of an idea
[1:16:37] contrasted with its partial realization
[1:16:42] right right right so we can talk about
[1:16:46] things and we could go through examples
[1:16:48] and I could leave details out and it'd
[1:16:50] be a partial realization of what
[1:16:52] happened but it wouldn't be the perfect
[1:16:54] realization well there were other people
[1:16:56] there were other things there were you
[1:16:58] know there were other things that had
[1:16:59] happened right and so Jesus is the true
[1:17:02] and so uh he says for example we recall
[1:17:05] Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you
[1:17:08] not that bread from heaven but my father
[1:17:11] giveth you the true bread from heaven so
[1:17:15] so Jesus was the true bread amen right
[1:17:19] am and so so then if you're hungry
[1:17:25] which would you rather have I mean
[1:17:27] really hungry now like haven't eaten in
[1:17:30] days kind of
[1:17:32] hungry and then I were you know I were
[1:17:35] to give you the most perfect
[1:17:38] bread you know I don't know if anybody
[1:17:41] here is into the like the sourdough
[1:17:44] there's the the there's the sister Erica
[1:17:47] is not okay but I like sourdough you
[1:17:51] know but nowadays you know it's it's
[1:17:52] very trendy on all the socials you know
[1:17:55] you've got you've got groups of sisters
[1:17:57] getting together and making sourdough
[1:17:59] bread you know and they've got the
[1:18:00] little scoring knife and they're making
[1:18:02] the little designs on the bread on the
[1:18:04] dough you know and they've wrapped it
[1:18:06] and rolled it and all this stuff now and
[1:18:07] they've put it in the little basket and
[1:18:09] they've done the little designs and they
[1:18:11] stick it in the oven you know and then
[1:18:13] and then it comes out of the oven you
[1:18:14] know and it's got man it's just so
[1:18:15] perfect you know the and then and then
[1:18:17] of course you let it cool for just a
[1:18:19] little bit you know and then it's like
[1:18:20] hey get the camera you know and now we
[1:18:22] squeeze the bread you know and it's just
[1:18:23] this little bit of CR crunchiness that
[1:18:25] you can tell is on the outside but yet
[1:18:27] it sponges back when you let go and you
[1:18:29] know there's substance here man this is
[1:18:31] this is not Bunny Bread from the store
[1:18:33] you know cuz you squeeze that Bunny
[1:18:35] Bread from the store and it's not coming
[1:18:40] back so so now we're see so what we're
[1:18:44] what we're establishing here is that
[1:18:46] sourdough you it's beautiful looking
[1:18:48] it's crunchy it's it's got sponginess to
[1:18:50] it it's it's like perfect bread I mean
[1:18:51] if there was bread that was perfect it's
[1:18:54] getting pretty close to you know you
[1:18:55] could add some cheddar and jalapeno in
[1:18:57] the dough and then maybe we'd really
[1:18:59] have something you know and then man
[1:19:01] this is now we're getting as close a
[1:19:03] perfect bread as you can possibly have
[1:19:05] and if you're hungry like two days
[1:19:08] haven't really eaten and I've worked
[1:19:10] hard today kind of
[1:19:12] hungry and I were to tell you I've got
[1:19:15] some of this I could slice this bread
[1:19:17] here it's still warm out of the oven and
[1:19:20] we could throw some butter on that you
[1:19:22] know and maybe I don't know know some
[1:19:26] Peach jalapeno jam we just got some of
[1:19:27] that the other day that was really good
[1:19:29] but or maybe Nutella I don't know I
[1:19:31] don't know what what it might
[1:19:34] be and your two days kind of hungry I
[1:19:38] said here I've got this I mean as close
[1:19:39] to perfect bread as I can give you would
[1:19:41] you would you like this or would you
[1:19:43] rather have
[1:19:48] Jesus cuz I want to tell you this might
[1:19:50] be perfect bread as perfect as man can
[1:19:53] make bread this is perfect bread in your
[1:19:54] hungry but Jesus is the true
[1:19:58] bread uhhuh and it's church so you're
[1:20:01] like yeah yeah yeah give me Jesus Give
[1:20:03] Me Jesus but I want to tell you in two
[1:20:05] days
[1:20:07] time you
[1:20:09] like you want to tell me that Jesus whom
[1:20:12] I can't see and can't physically eat is
[1:20:16] somehow going to solve this hunger
[1:20:18] problem that I'm feeling very physically
[1:20:20] right now and you want to tell me that
[1:20:21] Jesus is the true bread and not that
[1:20:24] buttery
[1:20:25] squeeze spongy crusty
[1:20:32] goodness which is the true bread but I
[1:20:35] just ask you like after you eat that
[1:20:36] slice of bread and you've been two days
[1:20:38] hungry do you think one one slice is
[1:20:39] going to do it for you no one slice of
[1:20:42] that perfect bread is not going to cut
[1:20:46] it you're going to need two three four
[1:20:50] five half a loaf whole loaf
[1:20:56] and what about the next day is it going
[1:20:58] to keep you no the whole loaf in going
[1:21:02] to keep you for 24 Hours come on
[1:21:06] bro come on
[1:21:09] brother but it's as perfect bread as man
[1:21:11] can make now let me ask you something I
[1:21:15] could I could if I gave you a lifetime
[1:21:18] supply of that bread and that Nutella or
[1:21:21] whatever it is what is it for you like
[1:21:23] what would you want on it just butter or
[1:21:25] just butter okay and and some really
[1:21:27] good Farm Fresh
[1:21:29] butter uh salted or unsalted salted
[1:21:33] butter
[1:21:35] okay and I'm going to give you a
[1:21:37] lifetime supply of that but with that
[1:21:41] you have no satisfaction in I I'm going
[1:21:45] to take away Joy I'm going to take away
[1:21:46] peace I'm going to take away
[1:21:49] hope going to take away
[1:21:51] patience I'm going to give you a
[1:21:53] lifetime supply of perfect bread with
[1:21:54] butter salted Farm Fresh
[1:21:57] butter but you don't get you don't have
[1:21:59] joy you don't have peace you don't have
[1:22:01] which which one satisfies you I just
[1:22:04] want to ask you which one satisfies you
[1:22:06] not the
[1:22:07] bread not the bread so which so if if if
[1:22:11] I've got if there's hunger in my in my
[1:22:14] stomach it can be satisfied one way but
[1:22:16] true hunger that we would give up the
[1:22:19] bread for is the hunger of the heart and
[1:22:22] it's that which the true bread can truly
[1:22:26] satisfy and the reason that it can
[1:22:28] satisfy is because it is the heart of
[1:22:32] God he it is the heart of God being
[1:22:35] given to you so if you want joy you
[1:22:39] should find it in the one who can say I
[1:22:41] am Joy if you want love you might want
[1:22:45] to find it in the source where it
[1:22:47] actually came from from the one who
[1:22:49] could say I am
[1:22:52] love if you want peace and you want to
[1:22:55] cure your anxieties and all of these
[1:22:57] things well find it in the one who is
[1:23:00] the Prince of
[1:23:03] Peace Glory you see he is the true bread
[1:23:07] he is the true satisfaction he is the
[1:23:11] the true and perfect realization of the
[1:23:14] entire desires of your heart when you
[1:23:16] wake up in the morning and begin to
[1:23:18] dream about maybe the greatest vacation
[1:23:21] and how wonderful it might be and all
[1:23:23] that you might want like like it's not
[1:23:25] like you don't want to just go to the so
[1:23:28] you guys are all in Florida I you guys
[1:23:29] don't like to go to the beach I know
[1:23:31] it's so crazy you know I go and preach
[1:23:33] on the islands and no one swims and it's
[1:23:36] like but like people from Indiana like
[1:23:40] Middle America you know we come to your
[1:23:44] place to swim and you guys
[1:23:48] don't I don't
[1:23:50] understand so I don't know what the
[1:23:52] perfect vacation looks like like for you
[1:23:55] but you know like all like you you know
[1:23:57] okay you go on a cruise so you're in
[1:23:58] water but not in water and and you know
[1:24:01] and and you got all the
[1:24:03] food you know and you got the buffets
[1:24:06] and the steak that's you know I don't
[1:24:08] want a steak on the buffet I know I want
[1:24:10] you to go and cook my steak perfect
[1:24:12] right now and give me that perfect piece
[1:24:14] of meat you know and slice it down and
[1:24:18] juice is
[1:24:19] H but what is it that you're looking for
[1:24:22] in that vacation you're looking for for
[1:24:25] a break from from the monotony you're
[1:24:28] you're you're looking for that
[1:24:29] excitement what is it it's something
[1:24:30] your heart is crying for you're looking
[1:24:33] for rest what is that there something
[1:24:35] your heart is crying for you're looking
[1:24:37] for a moment of Peace it's something
[1:24:39] your heart is crying for you're
[1:24:40] definitely looking for Joy but it's
[1:24:42] something your heart is crying for so
[1:24:45] even your vacation is an is an
[1:24:47] expression of the need for Christ in
[1:24:49] your heart to satisfy your every longing
[1:24:52] now I'm not saying stoping eating bread
[1:24:55] I'm not saying stop taking vacations but
[1:24:57] to recognize where the true satisfaction
[1:25:01] really comes from for your heart is to
[1:25:03] recognize Jesus Christ is the source of
[1:25:07] all of those things because the because
[1:25:10] he is the physical expression of the
[1:25:13] true source that was there in the heart
[1:25:15] of God before all before all creation
[1:25:20] amen okay we are going to get through
[1:25:22] notes we we we got to start talking
[1:25:25] about that Army at some point in time so
[1:25:27] so so so we talk about restoration and
[1:25:30] and we see God is the true source of of
[1:25:33] that restoration
[1:25:35] but but but but we talk what's like
[1:25:38] restoration means to be to be bought
[1:25:40] back or to be restored back to an
[1:25:43] original condition that's right now now
[1:25:46] so so so I'm going to contend that our
[1:25:49] original condition is the heart of God
[1:25:52] before creation you were in the mind of
[1:25:55] God which meant you were in the heart of
[1:25:58] God but we look for in the physical re
[1:26:02] realm we start at Eden and we go oh man
[1:26:06] was
[1:26:08] perfect right was Adam created
[1:26:13] perfect oh and so we want to go back to
[1:26:16] being perfect because we realize that
[1:26:20] because Adam was perfect and he had Eve
[1:26:24] who was created
[1:26:27] perfect somehow those perfect people
[1:26:30] still
[1:26:31] fell Now Eve was deceived and Adam chose
[1:26:36] willfully went with his wife as a type
[1:26:38] of Christ that's wonderful it's
[1:26:40] beautiful right but we think okay I I
[1:26:43] want to be restored back to Adam and Eve
[1:26:46] conditioned before the fall all right is
[1:26:49] that what you're looking for all right
[1:26:51] okay so so and let me read a quote here
[1:26:53] before I asked the next question so in
[1:26:56] in the beginning when man was used used
[1:26:58] to walk in the early age with God in the
[1:27:00] Garden of Eden when the first Man was
[1:27:01] created the great Cathedrals Under The
[1:27:03] Palms you guys know what that's like he
[1:27:05] and his wife when the cool of the
[1:27:07] evening come along they come out and
[1:27:09] worship God and had a perfect Fellowship
[1:27:12] God Longs for Fellowship he yearns and
[1:27:14] he wants people to speak with him to
[1:27:16] talk to talk with him and you might sing
[1:27:18] too much or preach too much but there's
[1:27:19] never one one thing you'll never be able
[1:27:21] to overdo and that's pray and the Bible
[1:27:23] said I will let men pray everywhere
[1:27:25] lifting up holy hands you'll never be
[1:27:26] able to have too much fellowship with
[1:27:28] God and God Longs for his creature who's
[1:27:29] created in His image to fellowship with
[1:27:32] him wouldn't you love to have lived in
[1:27:35] that time when the Great Fellowship God
[1:27:38] had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of
[1:27:39] Eden to come down in the cool of the
[1:27:42] evening and talk with them and
[1:27:44] fellowship with them wouldn't that be a
[1:27:46] wonderful restoration Lord put me back
[1:27:49] in the Garden of Eden and in the in the
[1:27:51] cool of the evening come and walk with
[1:27:53] me Lord
[1:27:54] how wonderful that would be what a
[1:27:56] restoration that would be and I how many
[1:27:59] want to be restored back to that I mean
[1:28:01] what a perfect condition but I just but
[1:28:04] so okay but I have so is that is that
[1:28:06] what you want then that's like and is
[1:28:08] that
[1:28:10] enough is that enough remember remember
[1:28:13] it's brother Trevor who challenges your
[1:28:14] assumptions and all the right answers
[1:28:17] are no longer the right
[1:28:19] answers because if I go back to what
[1:28:22] Adam and Eve have could I fall again
[1:28:27] if I'm merely restored to what they had
[1:28:30] right then a fall can happen again
[1:28:35] amen yes sir and I I want I'm sorry I
[1:28:38] want more amen I want their
[1:28:42] condition though they were created
[1:28:45] perfect I want it
[1:28:47] magnified I want it I want it more
[1:28:50] honorable I want I want the restoration
[1:28:54] to put me to a place where I could never
[1:28:57] be ashamed and by promise that's what he
[1:29:01] said he would do but what he did so that
[1:29:04] you could get to a place that you had
[1:29:06] what Adam and Eve have but in a place
[1:29:08] where you have what they had plus the
[1:29:10] ability to never be ashamed ever again I
[1:29:14] will send my great Army among you and
[1:29:18] they will afflict you and cause these
[1:29:20] problems but the growth
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:25] the expression now becomes magnified
[1:29:29] because before in the Garden of Eden we
[1:29:32] didn't know that God loved those that
[1:29:35] were not perfect Adam didn't know that
[1:29:38] because it hadn't yet been
[1:29:40] expressed though it was there and God
[1:29:43] had it it was true that God loved those
[1:29:47] even those that weren't perfect yet
[1:29:49] nobody knew it because there was no
[1:29:52] ability yet for God to Express the full
[1:29:55] depth and width of all that his love was
[1:29:59] so he sends his great Army among them to
[1:30:03] to create a situation where it's dark
[1:30:06] and it's it's evil and it's there's
[1:30:08] troubles so that now the heart of God
[1:30:11] that was always there before the
[1:30:13] foundation of the world can come and be
[1:30:15] fully expressed and then when you get to
[1:30:19] a place now where you've come into full
[1:30:21] view of that entire expression you see
[1:30:24] all that he is now that expression can
[1:30:28] be fully realized in you and you can be
[1:30:31] in a place where you will never be
[1:30:34] [Applause]
[1:30:37] ashamed but it took the great Army which
[1:30:40] God sent Among Us wow wow to show that
[1:30:45] truth ex to show that reality and then
[1:30:49] when we come through that now we can see
[1:30:51] him in a place where we'll never be
[1:30:53] ashamed ever
[1:31:06] again brother brandham
[1:31:09] says continues that quote on he says
[1:31:13] wouldn't that be marvelous we would all
[1:31:14] like to have that time and now I Believe
[1:31:16] by God's word I can prove to you that we
[1:31:18] can come right back on them terms again
[1:31:21] with God tonight right straight back to
[1:31:24] that kind of
[1:31:25] Fellowship so we can have that
[1:31:27] Fellowship
[1:31:31] again
[1:31:33] amen so if we can have that Fellowship
[1:31:36] now then because because of Calvary this
[1:31:40] Fellowship has been restored back to us
[1:31:42] and we can have this Fellowship now then
[1:31:45] then why why aren't we at a place of
[1:31:48] that restoration what is it that we're
[1:31:51] waiting for why is that restoration
[1:31:53] dragging
[1:31:54] out what's what's what's the point
[1:31:57] what's going on here so okay I just ask
[1:31:59] that question and we hold that thought
[1:32:00] in our minds because we have to see
[1:32:03] something here now so so one of the
[1:32:06] things that that we as a gentile church
[1:32:09] now we want to be restored back to what
[1:32:12] the day of Pentecost I mean isn't this
[1:32:14] scripturally why God sent uh Malachi 4:5
[1:32:17] and six what to to the fathers to the
[1:32:20] children and now the Pentecostal
[1:32:21] children back to the faith of their
[1:32:23] father
[1:32:24] because in the between in between
[1:32:27] fathers to the children now those father
[1:32:29] those children raise up and they become
[1:32:31] fathers and they have children but now
[1:32:33] something's different and so we as
[1:32:36] children of that original church have
[1:32:39] have come through all of this in the
[1:32:40] great Army the palmerworm the cankerworm
[1:32:43] the Locust the caterpillar has come
[1:32:45] through the Gentile
[1:32:46] church and caused all kinds of problems
[1:32:50] and now we need to be restored back to
[1:32:52] the day of Pentecost
[1:32:54] condition amen and so we want the gifts
[1:32:57] and we want we you know but but but but
[1:33:00] but even Pentecost as a denomination
[1:33:02] they went back to the gifts but did they
[1:33:05] have the perfect
[1:33:08] no now that's part of it we want that
[1:33:11] right but did they have the perfect no
[1:33:14] right well so then so then what did they
[1:33:16] have in Pentecost well they had Christ
[1:33:19] himself coming back to them in the
[1:33:22] spirit of God the the for of the Holy
[1:33:24] Spirit to come into the to the heart of
[1:33:27] the believer as we said on Friday night
[1:33:29] and and by that by that sacrifice you
[1:33:31] know once perfected and the the believer
[1:33:34] has no more conscience of sins right and
[1:33:36] and so the Holy Spirit now that that
[1:33:38] it's the it's a it's the spirit of God
[1:33:41] and the spirit of man that can come and
[1:33:43] change
[1:33:44] you amen amen amen and so those that
[1:33:48] that that that now can can can give you
[1:33:51] that overcoming power the the lamb
[1:33:53] spirit couldn't come on you to give you
[1:33:55] overcoming power so you kept failing yes
[1:33:58] sir sir but but but the spirit of Jesus
[1:34:01] Christ the Holy Spirit I will come unto
[1:34:04] you can now come and as a kinsman
[1:34:06] redeemer take your place and you take
[1:34:09] his
[1:34:10] place and so and so so we want to be
[1:34:13] restored back to this is what they had
[1:34:16] on the day of Pentecost and I mean how
[1:34:18] many would love to be to have been in
[1:34:20] the upper room yes sir hallelujah how
[1:34:22] many wish we could have this morning a
[1:34:26] meeting that was that was the that was
[1:34:29] the same as the upper room experience am
[1:34:33] amen wouldn't that be
[1:34:39] perfect I'm gonna say that one again
[1:34:41] would because that leads you to wouldn't
[1:34:43] that be
[1:34:46] perfect yeah thank you I just needed you
[1:34:49] all to feel like you were being set up
[1:34:51] there it's way more fun Acts chapter 2
[1:34:53] when the the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:34:54] come they were all with one Accord in
[1:34:56] one place suddenly there came a sound
[1:34:58] from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and
[1:35:00] it filled all the house where they were
[1:35:01] sitting and appeared un them cloven
[1:35:03] tongues like as of fire and it sat upon
[1:35:05] each of them and they were all filled
[1:35:07] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:35:08] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:35:11] them utterance what a meeting what a
[1:35:13] time to
[1:35:14] to and the spirit of fire now upon
[1:35:17] everyone and I tell you what if I see
[1:35:19] that that's H you know I just I don't
[1:35:21] know how I'm going to react on that one
[1:35:23] you know this is going to be a great
[1:35:24] time this is the kind of this is the
[1:35:26] kind of meeting we would like to have
[1:35:28] but yet but
[1:35:31] yet Jude can come
[1:35:34] along 30 years
[1:35:37] later and say earnestly contend for the
[1:35:40] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:35:41] Saints so though they had the Perfection
[1:35:44] of the Holy Ghost on the day of
[1:35:46] Pentecost Why didn't it keep them even
[1:35:48] 30 years that a minister has to come
[1:35:51] along and say whoa earnest L contend for
[1:35:54] what we originally had something is
[1:35:57] wrong and Paul can say I know that after
[1:36:00] my departure Grievious wolves will come
[1:36:04] in well but if if what I had was
[1:36:08] perfect what like why are Grievous
[1:36:11] wolves even going to even going to be a
[1:36:14] problem for me right like go ahead Yap
[1:36:16] at my
[1:36:17] heels you Grievous wolf I'm perfect my
[1:36:21] God
[1:36:23] amen that's but that's what I am today
[1:36:27] right because of restoration now those
[1:36:30] Grievous wolves can Yap at our heels but
[1:36:33] they have already been exposed that the
[1:36:35] the great Army has come that the the
[1:36:38] denomination the nickan Spirit came the
[1:36:41] the The Jezebel spirit came the spirit
[1:36:43] of balum came and did all of these
[1:36:45] things in the church and Rose all of
[1:36:47] these things up and and and and and so
[1:36:50] but what was it doing because when they
[1:36:52] when they got the whole Holy Spirit on
[1:36:54] the day of Pentecost then it was just
[1:36:56] like okay we've got the Holy Spirit now
[1:36:58] how do we keep this going and brother
[1:37:00] Brenham details this in the church age
[1:37:02] book how can we keep this great
[1:37:06] Revival you see a little fear he said
[1:37:09] entered into their heart they said how
[1:37:10] can we keep this great revival going so
[1:37:12] they tried to figure it's like okay we
[1:37:13] have the Holy Spirit now you know we can
[1:37:15] see in the past you know all that the
[1:37:17] Pharisees did and what they had with
[1:37:19] Moses but they kept the religion going
[1:37:21] so we've got the Holy Spirit how do we
[1:37:23] keep the religion
[1:37:25] going and so and and enter in the great
[1:37:29] army with that one thought how do we
[1:37:32] keep this going what that tells you is
[1:37:34] they didn't recognize that when they got
[1:37:36] Jesus they didn't realize that all they
[1:37:39] ever needed was Jesus that all that they
[1:37:42] didn't need religion they they they you
[1:37:45] know forgive me I'll say it but they
[1:37:47] didn't need church now I'm not saying we
[1:37:49] don't come to church but I'm saying
[1:37:51] Church isn't the expression of the
[1:37:53] perfection of our heart you come because
[1:37:55] there's gifts in your body you come to
[1:37:57] edify the rest of the church you come to
[1:37:59] be edified by the rest of the church you
[1:38:01] come to corporate worship you come
[1:38:03] because he told you to come but none of
[1:38:05] those
[1:38:06] things none of those things are what
[1:38:08] Pentecost truly meant and so what they
[1:38:11] begin to do is they begin to create
[1:38:14] systems this church isn't the system
[1:38:19] amen it better never be amen but this
[1:38:23] church CH better always be a a local
[1:38:25] body a collection of people coming
[1:38:27] together to praise God together as one
[1:38:31] body because if you're isolating
[1:38:34] yourself well that's not you know we can
[1:38:36] that's another
[1:38:39] sermon amen we'll just leave that there
[1:38:41] so but isolating yourself wouldn't be
[1:38:43] scriptural either am so what they had at
[1:38:46] Pentecost they had truly Jesus Christ
[1:38:49] but they didn't what they didn't realize
[1:38:51] and then they tried to take that and
[1:38:52] they tried to say okay how can we make
[1:38:54] this our
[1:38:56] religion wow wow and so the and but that
[1:39:00] was never what he wanted Jesus was like
[1:39:03] no you like I what you don't like you
[1:39:05] don't need religion anymore you have me
[1:39:08] don't have the religion of me just have
[1:39:10] me
[1:39:11] amen but they didn't quite understand
[1:39:14] that so God sends his army among them
[1:39:17] from the time of the Pentecostal
[1:39:19] outpouring in Acts chapter 2 to to to
[1:39:22] our very days now the spirit of nianis
[1:39:25] and denominationalism has has taken the
[1:39:28] bark off the tree have taken the life
[1:39:30] off the tree I know you've just gone
[1:39:31] through restoration of the Bride tree
[1:39:33] and you you understand where I'm at with
[1:39:35] these four bugs right and so so all of
[1:39:37] these things have happened through the
[1:39:39] Gentile Church ages now but now we're in
[1:39:42] a place where the restoration is here
[1:39:45] and God in Revelations chapter 101 the
[1:39:49] mighty Angel Christ himself has come
[1:39:52] down and when he came down he gave those
[1:39:55] seals to the seventh angel that were
[1:39:58] living in the days of the voice of the
[1:39:59] seventh angel to wind up all the
[1:40:02] Mysteries which is the restoration of
[1:40:05] who he was from way back here before the
[1:40:08] foundation of the world to recognize now
[1:40:12] that your experience with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:14] has nothing to do with your church
[1:40:16] system it has nothing to do with you
[1:40:18] know I don't care which doctrinal group
[1:40:20] you want to be a part of it has nothing
[1:40:22] to do with
[1:40:28] that but do you know
[1:40:31] Jesus do you have the Holy Spirit in
[1:40:34] your heart he wants you to follow him as
[1:40:38] an
[1:40:39] individual now he may use gifts in the
[1:40:42] body to speak a word of truth but the
[1:40:46] Holy Spirit himself is the one who will
[1:40:49] come individually to you and Quicken the
[1:40:52] word that your pastor might say unto you
[1:40:54] and make it a reality because the
[1:40:57] prophet tells us you have one
[1:40:59] relationship to God and God has one
[1:41:01] relationship to you and it's Jesus and
[1:41:04] Jesus
[1:41:05] alone so though the the Revelation may
[1:41:08] be to the to the to the body in this day
[1:41:11] but yet to you as an individual it's
[1:41:14] quickened between you and
[1:41:16] him praise God and this is the
[1:41:20] restoration this is now I want to be
[1:41:22] restored back to Pentecost but I don't
[1:41:24] want Grievious wolves to come in and be
[1:41:27] able to touch me but because of the
[1:41:29] message of the hour which is the
[1:41:32] restoration that God promised he would
[1:41:34] send now I have Jesus now I have the
[1:41:38] Holy Spirit and my people shall never be
[1:41:47] ashamed
[1:41:49] Hallelujah now
[1:41:53] okay we covered that we covered that
[1:41:56] praise the Lord all
[1:41:59] right brother Bram says have faith in
[1:42:01] God he says Along come Pentecost and
[1:42:03] measured down the gift of the Holy
[1:42:04] Spirit speaking with tongues and signs
[1:42:07] but we're just letting the big gap
[1:42:08] through let us tonight lay the measure
[1:42:10] of God down and measure the whole word
[1:42:12] of God the same holy ghost that fired
[1:42:14] the Piston back there that brought them
[1:42:16] out by faith justification same one gave
[1:42:19] sanctification same one gave the baptism
[1:42:21] of the Holy Ghost the same power the
[1:42:24] same Holy Ghost can move the church to
[1:42:28] Perfection and it will do it everything
[1:42:31] that God has promised in his word God
[1:42:35] will do it amen so we're seeing then
[1:42:39] that what this is what God is doing is
[1:42:41] moving us to Perfection now now now hang
[1:42:45] on here because because because our
[1:42:48] Pentecostal friends you know and our
[1:42:50] Baptist friends and our our
[1:42:51] denominational friends now they have
[1:42:53] they're starting to have real issues
[1:42:55] with the kind of things that we're
[1:42:56] saying here because we're saying here
[1:42:58] that it's going to move the Church of
[1:43:00] God into Perfection but don't we have
[1:43:02] Jesus all right and isn't Jesus enough
[1:43:07] come
[1:43:09] on I mean that's like asking was Jesus
[1:43:13] perfect it's like
[1:43:15] yes of course Jesus is enough like what
[1:43:18] a baited question like yes he's enough
[1:43:20] but let me ask you then if Jesus was was
[1:43:23] enough weren't the four gospels
[1:43:26] enough if Jesus was enough if Jesus
[1:43:29] dying on Calvary was enough end of story
[1:43:32] you know that you've got John 3:16
[1:43:34] believe on Jesus
[1:43:37] Christ and you shall be saved and you've
[1:43:41] got the four gospels then you don't need
[1:43:43] the book of Acts you don't need the holy
[1:43:46] spirit cuz you have Jesus is that what
[1:43:48] you're trying to say is that all I need
[1:43:50] is Jesus is that all I need is John 3:16
[1:43:53] and the four gospels and I don't need
[1:43:55] acts and I don't need Romans and I don't
[1:43:57] need first and 2 Corinthians cuz all
[1:43:59] that came after and I don't need the
[1:44:01] Book of Revelations like why is the Book
[1:44:03] of Revelations even in the Bible if we
[1:44:05] have Jesus I don't as a matter of fact
[1:44:08] uh you know my my chiropractor you know
[1:44:10] good Christian man goes to one of the
[1:44:11] bigger Christian churches in in the area
[1:44:14] and he's like yeah we've been doing this
[1:44:15] study on and this isn't the first time
[1:44:17] I'd even heard this you know it's it's
[1:44:19] totally a thing out there in in
[1:44:21] Christian in the Christian world and and
[1:44:23] so yeah we've been doing this this study
[1:44:24] on Revelation and he I just don't know
[1:44:26] Trevor like my it's just it's just so
[1:44:29] confusing it's almost like John had some
[1:44:31] bad pizza and went to bed and had a
[1:44:34] dream oh I'm sorry but at least he has
[1:44:37] Jesus I mean even though he'll tell me
[1:44:40] that the whole that the entirety of
[1:44:42] scripture is God breathed God inspired
[1:44:44] and uh 100% infallible and inherent but
[1:44:47] the Book of Revelation John just had
[1:44:51] pizza I'm sorry sorry I'm a little
[1:44:53] confused on which Jesus you're talking
[1:44:55] about was it the Jesus from John 1:1
[1:44:59] that in the beginning was the
[1:45:02] word because then I want the Jesus of
[1:45:05] the Book of Revelation I want the Jesus
[1:45:07] that says he's coming
[1:45:09] down as a bride out of
[1:45:12] heaven with me come on I want that Jesus
[1:45:16] that that the Jesus I want that one God
[1:45:19] so if if Jesus if just okay Jesus died
[1:45:22] on the cross we have John 3:16 and is
[1:45:24] that enough like okay well hang on a
[1:45:28] second now we you know now we have more
[1:45:31] thoughts here on this subject well okay
[1:45:33] the Holy Spirit has now come was it
[1:45:35] enough well it absolutely it was enough
[1:45:38] for every age that they
[1:45:40] had but yet there was a plan of God Amen
[1:45:44] that God wanted to
[1:45:48] express amen and yes he expressed it
[1:45:51] through Christ but now as brother bandam
[1:45:54] tells us the Book of Revelation is the
[1:45:56] ongoing work of Christ through the
[1:46:00] Gentile
[1:46:03] ages God still expressing himself ex
[1:46:07] getting to a point now to show for even
[1:46:10] the Gentile church that though I give
[1:46:13] you the Holy Spirit the denominational
[1:46:16] system isn't how it's done all
[1:46:20] right but what I wanted you to see I
[1:46:23] it's almost as if God said what I like
[1:46:25] just as he did in the Garden of Eden
[1:46:27] okay go ahead fall and
[1:46:30] sin and all that will do is more fully
[1:46:34] express my love
[1:46:37] GL and so they're in Pentecost fine
[1:46:41] you're going to go into these
[1:46:43] denominations but all that's going to
[1:46:46] show is that the true revelation of who
[1:46:49] I am and what I want with you is not
[1:46:52] church church it's not just service it's
[1:46:55] not just doing good works but I long for
[1:46:58] relationship with you and when I came on
[1:47:01] the day of Pentecost it was about
[1:47:04] relationship but you didn't quite
[1:47:06] understand it when I'm when I created
[1:47:08] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden it
[1:47:11] was about love it was about Fellowship
[1:47:13] it was about relationship but you didn't
[1:47:16] fully understand it but when sin got in
[1:47:19] you understood my love now when I come
[1:47:21] in the Holy Spirit you didn't understand
[1:47:24] that it that it was just relationship
[1:47:26] and you didn't under you thought maybe
[1:47:28] relationship had something to do with
[1:47:30] church something to do with joining a
[1:47:32] system something to do with this is how
[1:47:35] you do relationship wow
[1:47:41] wow so he exposes all of that and now we
[1:47:45] see the full picture and now the prophet
[1:47:47] comes in fulfillments of Revelations
[1:47:50] 10:7 and fulfillment of Revelations 18
[1:47:52] one you know and he cries out come out
[1:47:55] of her my people out of that hold and
[1:47:58] that cage of of every unclean and
[1:48:00] hateful Bird come out of her what's he
[1:48:03] saying come out of these denominations
[1:48:06] be restored back into the relationship
[1:48:09] that you had at Pentecost but didn't
[1:48:12] realize that you had but now go ahead
[1:48:14] and let a Grievious wolf try to come in
[1:48:17] to the Church of the Living God that has
[1:48:19] the message of the hour been preached to
[1:48:21] them to expose the denominations to be
[1:48:24] called out of denominations and now oh
[1:48:27] isn't Jesus enough that's what I'm
[1:48:29] talking about is Jesus is enough it
[1:48:33] wasn't the church it wasn't the
[1:48:35] understanding but it was the ma the the
[1:48:37] magnified the the The
[1:48:40] Honorable Jesus Christ that came on the
[1:48:42] day of Pentecost now to where I can
[1:48:44] never be
[1:48:48] ashamed Glory brother Jack and I were
[1:48:50] just talking about this people say you
[1:48:52] know they they there's a quote where
[1:48:53] brother Brenham says I'm a I'm afraid
[1:48:56] that we're not getting people to Christ
[1:48:58] but getting them to a
[1:49:00] theory or to a
[1:49:02] church now some people they they they
[1:49:05] want to take that quote and then they
[1:49:08] want to say I'm afraid we're getting
[1:49:10] people to a
[1:49:11] message and not to Christ well I'm sorry
[1:49:14] that's not what he said now now what
[1:49:17] because it just depends on what you mean
[1:49:19] by the message but what I'm saying this
[1:49:21] message truly came to do is to deliver
[1:49:24] me out of those denominations to expose
[1:49:27] the problems of those
[1:49:30] denominations to bring me back to the
[1:49:32] understanding of who Jesus truly was and
[1:49:35] is and will be in my
[1:49:39] life amen amen amen and that it's not
[1:49:43] church I'm not going to fall into
[1:49:45] denominations I'm not going to fall into
[1:49:47] systems Grievious wolves could enter in
[1:49:50] all they want but if you've come to the
[1:49:52] revelation of what this message has been
[1:49:55] saying to you about Jesus Christ those
[1:49:57] Grievous wolves can howl they can B they
[1:50:01] can Yap they can run but they're never
[1:50:04] going to touch a Believer with this kind
[1:50:06] of Revelation because the restoration
[1:50:09] has happened in your
[1:50:12] heart and when it was restored what they
[1:50:15] had at Pentecost that was perfect is
[1:50:18] still perfect in you and they had the
[1:50:20] start of it but now the restoration is
[1:50:23] the completion and the full realization
[1:50:27] the perfect realization of all that they
[1:50:29] had on the day of of
[1:50:32] Pentecost by God's grace we have the
[1:50:35] perfect interpretation of the word of
[1:50:37] God with Divine Vindication we've got
[1:50:40] all of it brothers and sisters oh I'm
[1:50:43] afraid that we're getting people to a
[1:50:45] message and not Christ it's
[1:50:49] impossible I might be taking them to a
[1:50:52] message culture I might try to take
[1:50:54] people to a message church I might try
[1:50:56] to take people to a message Theory but
[1:50:59] if they actually caught the message of
[1:51:01] the hour that was spoken in fulfillment
[1:51:03] of Revelation 10:7 what that's doing is
[1:51:06] getting them to the one who came down in
[1:51:09] Revelation
[1:51:11] 101
[1:51:12] am
[1:51:16] amen that's so good glory I just love it
[1:51:20] yes sir amen he says then be therefore
[1:51:23] perfect even as your heavenly father is
[1:51:25] perfect how can you be when it's not my
[1:51:27] perfection it's not your Perfection it's
[1:51:29] his Perfection of his word that he chose
[1:51:32] you you never chose him and he brought
[1:51:35] you into Christ it's the Perfection of
[1:51:37] what his word and what do we have today
[1:51:40] his word it's perfecting us oh we had
[1:51:43] Jesus yes but now we have the full
[1:51:46] expression the full
[1:51:49] Revelation before us
[1:51:54] brother Bram says in the message
[1:51:55] perseverance out of 1962 I believe that
[1:51:58] there's a church coming into that
[1:52:00] Perfection all right that Ministry of
[1:52:03] perfection where the offices and
[1:52:05] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:52:07] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[1:52:08] church then pastors and teachers so
[1:52:10] forth will be so with the word until the
[1:52:14] whole thing will work right up to the
[1:52:15] coming of the Lord I believe that and I
[1:52:17] believe that we're nearing that time now
[1:52:20] believe that it's so now he's there
[1:52:22] those pastors and teachers are going to
[1:52:24] be so with the word
[1:52:27] right right right cuz you're going to be
[1:52:30] with this word which was enough but in
[1:52:33] this word I don't know there was a a
[1:52:36] revelation 18 that said come out of her
[1:52:39] my people well why should we come out of
[1:52:41] her well that's a great question why why
[1:52:43] aren't we a denomination why why should
[1:52:45] we come out of denominations oh well
[1:52:47] because here here's what I'm going to do
[1:52:48] I'm going to fulfill Revelations 18 and
[1:52:51] tell you
[1:52:53] my God and so so so so yeah I'm going to
[1:52:57] need this
[1:53:00] message I'm going to need this message
[1:53:03] for that Ministry of perfection
[1:53:07] brother am glory to
[1:53:10] God so so it it just becomes obvious at
[1:53:13] some point in time like what we're is is
[1:53:15] is is how can brother brandham say this
[1:53:17] that the church is coming into that
[1:53:19] Perfection well it it's it becomes
[1:53:21] obvious now as we look at this like if
[1:53:24] the Perfection is what they had on the
[1:53:25] day of Pentecost why was there so many
[1:53:28] denominations why was there so many
[1:53:30] problems if Pentecost was enough if
[1:53:33] Pentecost was truly you know the the
[1:53:35] full the full picture then why were why
[1:53:38] did the Catholic church in the Name of
[1:53:40] Christ kill 68 million
[1:53:46] people I I think they should be
[1:53:48] ashamed but my
[1:53:50] people shall never never be
[1:53:53] ashamed amen so we needed something then
[1:53:57] if that's what the expression of Christ
[1:53:59] was after the day of Pentecost in
[1:54:02] through the Dark Ages was to kill 68
[1:54:04] million people actually probably many of
[1:54:06] them the true
[1:54:10] Christians then I think we needed
[1:54:12] something to
[1:54:13] come and
[1:54:15] restore but God sent that Army amongst
[1:54:19] us that he might expose the problem
[1:54:22] problem s to show us the truth so that
[1:54:25] we have the the full picture now so my
[1:54:28] people will never be ashamed and so as
[1:54:31] we kind of bring this down to a close
[1:54:33] here because the timer is telling me
[1:54:35] that I should do that that kind of thing
[1:54:37] I I just want to say like as we as we we
[1:54:39] marry this up from what we talked about
[1:54:41] Friday
[1:54:43] night that this restoration is happening
[1:54:46] within
[1:54:47] you and and we focus so much on the
[1:54:50] restoration out of us right we focus so
[1:54:53] much on making sure that the flesh is
[1:54:55] restored and we for instant replay cam
[1:54:59] okay and we don't right we focus so much
[1:55:02] on that but we don't focus on the
[1:55:04] restoration of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:55:06] within you in the heart but if what
[1:55:07] we're trying to restore is the is the
[1:55:10] the the the the the spoken word of God
[1:55:13] which was the thoughts of God which was
[1:55:15] the heart of God being expressed then
[1:55:18] why is it it's like well I want the
[1:55:20] restoration of the heart of God on my
[1:55:21] flesh
[1:55:22] like amen yes but I don't want to put it
[1:55:25] on my flesh and not have the restoration
[1:55:27] of his heart be the restoration of my
[1:55:29] heart so do you want the bread or do you
[1:55:32] want Jesus do you want the the the this
[1:55:35] the the perfect sourdough with the
[1:55:37] butter or do you want the heart of God
[1:55:40] to come into you to understand that he
[1:55:44] desires that relationship with you to
[1:55:47] flood you to fill you with love to fill
[1:55:50] you with joy to fill you with peace to
[1:55:53] fill you with the assurance and the
[1:55:55] confidence oh but but brother Trevor a
[1:55:58] tribulation is going to come I don't
[1:55:59] care I won't be
[1:56:01] here but brother Trevor all of these
[1:56:03] problems and you know the economy and
[1:56:06] you
[1:56:07] know we could go into the political
[1:56:10] Litany of all of the
[1:56:13] things I don't
[1:56:16] care Oh but brother Trevor look look no
[1:56:19] don't brother Trevor me is Jesus Christ
[1:56:23] filling your heart with
[1:56:25] joy is he filling your heart with peace
[1:56:28] but brother Trevor like the finances
[1:56:29] lately is he filling your heart with
[1:56:32] peace is the source of peace the
[1:56:34] finances or is it Jesus is the source of
[1:56:37] curing the hunger bread or
[1:56:40] Jesus that's what that we're talking
[1:56:42] about the heart a God has a heart from
[1:56:45] the foundation of the world and he wants
[1:56:47] to put it inside of you and the way
[1:56:49] you're going to get it inside of you is
[1:56:51] the re ation of the Holy Spirit to take
[1:56:54] this word into your heart and let it
[1:56:58] come to
[1:56:59] life let it start start just showing you
[1:57:02] you know hey people in the Bible had
[1:57:04] Hard Times how did they get through it
[1:57:07] cuz God was
[1:57:10] there they went through hard times yeah
[1:57:14] yeah it happens I got I got
[1:57:16] a okay so praise God that's what we want
[1:57:19] we want the we want the restoration but
[1:57:20] I don't want the restoration to just
[1:57:22] happen and be
[1:57:25] theology come on what are we restoring
[1:57:28] the heart of God what are we expressing
[1:57:31] the heart of God but now we have it in a
[1:57:34] way though though there was an
[1:57:35] expression on the day of Pentecost we
[1:57:37] have it now in a way that will it's the
[1:57:39] perfect picture
[1:57:42] now this is
[1:57:46] restoration now I see through a glass
[1:57:48] Darkly but then I shall know even as I
[1:57:53] am known the picture has become clear
[1:57:57] because we've been given the message but
[1:57:58] we had to go through those that he had
[1:58:01] to send that great Army amongst us so
[1:58:05] that he could make the picture
[1:58:08] clear so here we are living in this
[1:58:11] restoration and brother brandham
[1:58:14] finishes the thought in the
[1:58:15] Philadelphian Church age in the church
[1:58:16] age book since this word indeed
[1:58:18] expresses perfect realization as against
[1:58:20] the idea of partial realization ism
[1:58:22] Illustrated in these verses we can Now
[1:58:24] understand as never before the anti-type
[1:58:27] contrasted with the type and
[1:58:31] substance
[1:58:32] substance in your heart with Shadow take
[1:58:36] the example now Mana from Heaven God
[1:58:38] sent down Angel bread from heaven for
[1:58:39] Israel but that bread did not satisfy it
[1:58:42] was only good for a day those who ate it
[1:58:43] were hungry again the next day it was
[1:58:45] left around and became contaminated but
[1:58:47] Jesus is the true bread from heaven
[1:58:50] where of Mana was just a type and if any
[1:58:52] man eats of that bread that came from
[1:58:54] Heaven he will never hunger again he
[1:58:56] does not need to come back and eat again
[1:58:58] the moment he partook he had eternal
[1:59:01] life here indeed was reality no need any
[1:59:05] longer for a shadow no need for a
[1:59:07] partial salvation here was the whole of
[1:59:10] it just like Jesus isn't a part of God
[1:59:13] is he is
[1:59:16] God amen
[1:59:20] amen in the laty and Church age out of
[1:59:23] the St book he says what great love the
[1:59:26] age that age manifested for him it
[1:59:27] reminds me of those beautiful words of 1
[1:59:29] Peter 18 whom having not seen ye love in
[1:59:32] whom though now ye see him not yet
[1:59:34] believing ye Rejoice with joy
[1:59:35] unspeakable and full of Glory with them
[1:59:38] we Rejoice also we haven't seen him but
[1:59:40] we have felt him we know him now as much
[1:59:43] as our limiting senses can let us right
[1:59:47] but one
[1:59:48] day oh can we break out of the limiting
[1:59:51] senses but one day it will be face to
[1:59:54] face that is for this age he is coming
[1:59:57] at the end of this age partial
[2:00:00] realization will be made perfect
[2:00:03] realization completed realization
[2:00:07] Hallelujah we have been looking through
[2:00:08] a glass Darkly but soon it will be face
[2:00:10] to face we have been going from glory to
[2:00:12] glory but soon it will be light be right
[2:00:14] in the glory and in his glory will shine
[2:00:17] we shall be like him wondrously like him
[2:00:19] Jesus our savior Divine isn't that
[2:00:21] wonderful we are complete in him that is
[2:00:24] true he would not lie to us about that
[2:00:26] but one day we will be changed in the
[2:00:29] atoms we will put on immortality we will
[2:00:32] all we will be all swallowed up in life
[2:00:36] then will we will
[2:00:39] realize
[2:00:42] realization how
[2:00:44] beautiful man with a seventh grade
[2:00:46] education wrote this he had Dr Le veil's
[2:00:49] help but but how beautiful is that
[2:00:51] thought
[2:00:52] right realizing realization musicians
[2:00:55] you can
[2:00:57] come
[2:01:00] so this this this realization though
[2:01:04] this this restoration this Perfection it
[2:01:07] starts in your heart it it comes into
[2:01:09] your heart we we we spent so much time
[2:01:12] trying to externalize it on to people
[2:01:17] but it comes in your heart and when it
[2:01:20] in it's truly in your heart it begins to
[2:01:23] it begins to break out just as one day
[2:01:25] we're going to be breaking out of these
[2:01:26] limiting limiting senses like like your
[2:01:29] heart is is is breaking out of its
[2:01:32] limitations and it's changing your very
[2:01:34] body it's changing who you are because
[2:01:37] it's changed your heart and so the the
[2:01:40] that that if you're going to pursue
[2:01:42] something if you want this Restoration
[2:01:44] in your life then then dive into the
[2:01:46] word of God and then dive into this
[2:01:48] message and and in a sense not Lord how
[2:01:52] am I doing on my on my flesh but father
[2:01:55] is my heart seeing Lord as I read this
[2:01:58] as I as I hear Brother brandom preaching
[2:02:01] as I hear Brother Jack and the different
[2:02:03] ministers preaching am I hearing the
[2:02:06] heart is it changing my heart even if
[2:02:10] he's telling me you're not look at how
[2:02:12] you're do look these things you're doing
[2:02:13] in your flesh like come on it's not just
[2:02:15] stop doing it in your flesh but you
[2:02:17] should begin to think Jesus why is he
[2:02:19] saying this to me is there something
[2:02:22] about what he's saying that's that's
[2:02:24] different in my flesh which is actually
[2:02:26] something that's going on in my heart
[2:02:29] God what's in my heart that's what I
[2:02:31] want to see that's what I want to change
[2:02:33] because if it'll change in my heart then
[2:02:35] then the restoration is already
[2:02:38] done and then the flesh doesn't matter
[2:02:41] near as much amen amen shall we pray
[2:02:44] Heavenly Father Lord we look at this
[2:02:46] complete restoration father we look and
[2:02:49] we see that you have done things
[2:02:51] throughout all ages ages father and I
[2:02:52] was just thinking father about Lord what
[2:02:55] it must have been like to be a believer
[2:02:57] in all of these different ages as the
[2:02:58] great Army has been sent among and um
[2:03:01] Lord I I can say I'd rather live in this
[2:03:03] age than have been in one of those ages
[2:03:05] father but even then father they there
[2:03:07] were people that had the truth of the
[2:03:09] Living God in their hearts but father
[2:03:12] they had to walk through these times but
[2:03:14] they did it with you and so all was well
[2:03:16] and so father there's times that we're
[2:03:17] walking through there are uncertain
[2:03:19] times there's a nervous complex age that
[2:03:21] we're unsuited to live in father but
[2:03:24] through all of that you restore our
[2:03:25] heart and because you restore our heart
[2:03:27] you restore our mind Lord and our
[2:03:29] thinking be can be can can be clear
[2:03:32] because we have this perfect word this
[2:03:33] perfect truth
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:37] Lord and we know the truth and it sets
[2:03:39] us free so it sets our our thinking free
[2:03:41] so father though anxiety would try to
[2:03:44] creep up but father yet we're we're
[2:03:47] we're just wrapped up in love Lord we're
[2:03:50] wrapped up in our heart of love for you
[2:03:52] and so father we we we're just not
[2:03:55] ashamed anymore Lord because we've been
[2:03:58] restored we've been restored by the
[2:04:00] heart of God and Lord how beautiful this
[2:04:02] picture is and I'm thankful father that
[2:04:05] you opened our eyes and our hearts and
[2:04:06] our understanding to see this oh God
[2:04:08] bless us Lord as we continue on in our
[2:04:10] lives waiting for your your soon coming
[2:04:12] Lord which we believe is nigh at hand
[2:04:15] Lord we we do ask father that that you
[2:04:18] would develop our uh that our Revelation
[2:04:20] would grow father your your Prophet said
[2:04:23] we should pray for Revelation more than
[2:04:25] we pray for anything Lord and so Lord we
[2:04:27] pray for Revelation this morning that
[2:04:29] you would open our eyes even further
[2:04:31] Lord to these truths that our hearts
[2:04:33] Lord God would be restored the Kingdom

[2:10:16] on today um just this perfect
[2:10:20] restoration
[2:10:21] and I tell you um brother Trevor is he
[2:10:25] was telling me early in the year that
[2:10:27] the Lord had given him a sermon I said
[2:10:29] brother I think it' be uh perfect uh for
[2:10:32] you to come this year and to minister
[2:10:34] that because this is the theme uh for
[2:10:36] this year and where we've been in our
[2:10:40] journey is uh talking about the four
[2:10:43] life Messengers that have come to bring
[2:10:45] life back into the church and I love how
[2:10:47] he just he caught the same thing I
[2:10:49] caught my great Army which I sent among
[2:10:51] you
[2:10:51] you know God allowed these things to
[2:10:53] happen because it was going to be a full
[2:10:54] expression of himself to us amen as uh
[2:10:58] as we learn you know from from history
[2:11:00] we won't repeat the same mistakes but uh
[2:11:03] we've been in this journey and when
[2:11:05] talking about the four life Messengers
[2:11:07] uh Luther and Wesley and the
[2:11:10] Pentecostals but it does not stop with
[2:11:12] the Pentecostals when they came with the
[2:11:14] gifts it goes into the complete word
[2:11:17] that's been brought back to us you
[2:11:19] understand that that God brought this to
[2:11:21] us and we we're we're privileged people
[2:11:23] to be able to see amen what the prophet
[2:11:26] taught us we can see these things and we
[2:11:28] know we won't repeat the same mistakes
[2:11:30] praise God we won't repeat the same
[2:11:32] mistakes we've been taught this is why
[2:11:34] we're not concerned about some Grievous
[2:11:36] Wolf coming in hallelujah hallelujah
[2:11:40] there's a there's a quote where brother
[2:11:41] random said she has
[2:11:44] ordained the second Eve she is ordained
[2:11:47] not to fall amen praise God the first
[2:11:50] Eve f this second Eve is ordained not to
[2:11:54] fall because she understands her place
[2:11:57] in the word oh blessed be the name of
[2:12:00] the Lord I I'm so glad that this you
[2:12:03] know the thought that I that I believe
[2:12:05] God was just bringing to us this entire
[2:12:06] weekend was that he the the the the
[2:12:09] fullness of this is God wanted to
[2:12:11] express himself through us that was
[2:12:14] God's ultimate plan he wants to express
[2:12:17] himself through us and we got to bring
[2:12:19] oursel to a place where we just yield to
[2:12:21] what God wants to do in in Us in and
[2:12:23] through us look it's not about like he
[2:12:25] said it's not about the the the church
[2:12:27] that you go to no it are you having a
[2:12:29] relationship with Christ the ministry
[2:12:32] that you under are you having a
[2:12:34] relationship with Christ that's what
[2:12:36] it's all about it's Christ in you and
[2:12:40] that's more than enough amen God bless
[2:12:42] you brother Trevor amen God bless
[2:12:46] you oh
[2:12:49] hallelujah amen had a um um I guess it's
[2:12:55] just a statement here but from uh Pastor
[2:12:58] uh Seth Arma again we appreciate him and
[2:13:02] his wife sister Rosemary they've been
[2:13:04] here he he he he he he uh surprised us
[2:13:08] on last week and just kind of came and
[2:13:10] and sat in the sanctuary and you know
[2:13:12] I'm like I didn't even know he was here
[2:13:13] till I looked up and that's brother Seth
[2:13:16] but uh he preached for us on on on
[2:13:18] Wednesday night and and one of the
[2:13:20] things that brother Seth did on
[2:13:21] Wednesday night he it's just something
[2:13:24] that um I just like how him and brother
[2:13:27] Trevor um one of the things brother
[2:13:30] brother uh Seth told us he says rally
[2:13:33] around the
[2:13:34] gift don't fight it rally around it
[2:13:39] right and um and and some of the saints
[2:13:41] that were not here on last week uh all I
[2:13:44] can tell you is that the Lord visited us
[2:13:46] Amen in a very special way and
[2:13:49] everything that we've been preaching of
[2:13:51] Joel 2 we saw manifested on last week
[2:13:55] amen and and like one brother said God
[2:13:57] is not a one hit wonder amen this is for
[2:14:01] me this is part this is the restoration
[2:14:03] this it is what it is and uh so I expect
[2:14:06] God to do exactly what he what he
[2:14:08] promised and uh and he certainly did
[2:14:10] that last week you know brother Seth was
[2:14:12] here and and and then you like I said
[2:14:14] brother brother tror coming and picking
[2:14:15] up saying it's about the word had gifts
[2:14:18] but they rejected the word amen they
[2:14:21] rejected the word not us we
[2:14:24] justification the gifts word all that's
[2:14:27] part so Seth you know he was encouraging
[2:14:29] us Wednesday night he he said praise my
[2:14:32] precious brother sisters myself and my

[2:15:05] back home to God uh to Fellowship the
[2:15:07] other night and they realized brother
[2:15:08] Trevor had gone to GH multiple times and
[2:15:11] and uh when he when he went he got all
[2:15:14] around so uh brother brother quu said no
[2:15:17] brother this is a real missionary this
[2:15:19] brother's said when I go to Ghana I go
[2:15:21] to timma that's City big city that's
[2:15:24] like like where brother Seth lives in
[2:15:26] you know a you have to fly into a that's
[2:15:29] big city but brother Trevor he get out
[2:15:31] in what we call the bush right and uh so
[2:15:34] brother brother brother uh brother
[2:15:36] brother uh quu said I'm going have to
[2:15:38] call you King
[2:15:42] brother because of some of the travel
[2:15:44] and what he's done there in in in Ghana
[2:15:46] so we we thank the Lord just for just
[2:15:48] the way that he kind of makes these
[2:15:50] connections uh just a wonderful God that
[2:15:52] we serve but we want to wish amen our
[2:15:54] precious brother's precious wife
[2:15:56] traveling mercies as they go back home
[2:15:58] may the Lord continue to keep them until
[2:16:01] we meet again amen We Trust like it used
[2:16:05] to be said um if if if if we don't see
[2:16:07] each other Amen on this side we meet you
[2:16:12] in the morning praise God
[2:16:15] Amen praise the
[2:16:17] Lord amen let's have a word of Prayer
[2:16:21] amen as we prepare to close the service
[2:16:24] father we are so
[2:16:27] grateful uh for what we see that you
[2:16:30] have
[2:16:32] done we we're looking back through the
[2:16:35] lenses of a prophet and we can see the
[2:16:39] history
[2:16:41] um I I just can't help but think that
[2:16:44] when you created Adam and Eve in the
[2:16:46] beginning the prophet told us that you
[2:16:49] designed Eve a certain way that you
[2:16:51] knew that there would be a weakness
[2:16:54] there God that she would uh she would
[2:16:57] fall but in in that and in bringing
[2:17:00] these things to Adam this would be the
[2:17:03] perfect opportunity for you to begin to
[2:17:07] express yourself to
[2:17:10] mankind Lord and from the days of the
[2:17:13] Garden of Eden even until now God we
[2:17:16] have been receiving an expression of of
[2:17:19] Jesus
[2:17:21] Lord if we could just see it
[2:17:22] individually and what you've been trying
[2:17:24] to do every trial that youve taken us
[2:17:26] through this whole journey of
[2:17:28] restoration the the the church had to go
[2:17:30] through that that process where the
[2:17:32] cankerworm and the Palmer worm and the
[2:17:35] caterpillar and Locust would have to
[2:17:36] come in the church had to go through
[2:17:38] that process in order to get the full
[2:17:42] expression of God manifested in us this
[2:17:46] is why we will never be made ashamed
[2:17:48] Lord that the testimony of of of
[2:17:51] overcoming and always greater than what
[2:17:53] we actually went through so father we we
[2:17:55] thank you for this and and if we can see
[2:17:57] this Amen in the history of the church
[2:18:00] then also let us look at it in our own
[2:18:02] personal lives God we've gone through
[2:18:05] some Seasons where it it feels like the
[2:18:08] the enemy has just run uh just eat up
[2:18:11] all the life but God there was a little
[2:18:13] life laying down in the stump in the
[2:18:15] roots of the tree praise God and Father
[2:18:19] I believe the scripture say just when
[2:18:21] there's life in the in in in the roots
[2:18:22] in the in in in the in the Lord the
[2:18:24] stump just a little scent of water God
[2:18:28] the life begins to come back up Lord and
[2:18:30] that's what we're feeling right now
[2:18:32] father and Lord we we're thankful that
[2:18:34] we're part of this great process that we
[2:18:37] can see ourselves in the midst of it
[2:18:39] Lord may we just remain humble and as as
[2:18:42] uh brother Trevor just referred to the
[2:18:44] quote we never want to get to the point
[2:18:46] where we're trying to control how you do
[2:18:48] things and and we got to we got to watch
[2:18:50] watch this we got to protect that and we
[2:18:52] no no Lord we just want to remain humble
