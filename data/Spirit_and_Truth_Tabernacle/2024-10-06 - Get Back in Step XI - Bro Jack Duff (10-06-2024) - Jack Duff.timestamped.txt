[1:02:10] let's pray quickly father we thank you
[1:02:12] for uh the anointing that is already in
[1:02:16] this place your spirit father has
[1:02:18] welcomed us here uh this morning and God
[1:02:21] we are asking that you would help us to
[1:02:23] get ourselves out of the way that you
[1:02:24] would have the preeminence and this
[1:02:26] portion of the service that the spirit
[1:02:28] of God would just take complete control
[1:02:30] of every thought that is presented as
[1:02:32] well as every thought that has been
[1:02:34] received we uh also want to remember a
[1:02:36] family who was lost a loved one um our
[1:02:40] sister Rebecca her brother-in-law has
[1:02:42] passed and uh asked that you would just
[1:02:45] uh be with this family oh God there's a
[1:02:47] wife left some children left and God
[1:02:49] they are really really uh suffering uh
[1:02:53] right now so we just ask that you would
[1:02:55] just cover them
[1:02:56] that you would uh uh be their strength
[1:02:59] Lord during this during this great time
[1:03:01] uh it's not easy to lose loved ones God
[1:03:03] but we we know that you are comforter
[1:03:06] and we ask that you bring Comfort even
[1:03:08] now father it's in Jesus name we pray
[1:03:10] amen amen you can be
[1:03:18] seated praise the Lord uh our journey
[1:03:21] continues with get back and step amen
[1:03:25] and
[1:03:26] um you know as I was just in prayer this
[1:03:30] morning um the Lord just really began to
[1:03:34] I think
[1:03:35] um just open my understanding how how
[1:03:39] much more this scripture that we're
[1:03:42] reading is actually for our day and just
[1:03:46] even the just the language where Joel
[1:03:49] prophesies I'll restore to you the years
[1:03:53] the restoration did not take place in
[1:03:56] the days of John the
[1:03:58] Baptist amen John the Baptist was
[1:04:01] introducing uh the Lord Jesus and um you
[1:04:04] know his ministry was a very important
[1:04:06] Ministry because it introduced the first
[1:04:08] coming of Christ and when you when the
[1:04:11] disciples came to the Lord Jesus and
[1:04:15] they after the mount Transfiguration
[1:04:16] they begin to ask him like now didn't
[1:04:18] they say that Elias was supposed to
[1:04:20] first come and uh and do some things he
[1:04:22] said yeah yeah yeah I and I say to you
[1:04:24] Elias has already come and they did to
[1:04:27] him what they what they was what they
[1:04:29] were supposed to do he says but I also
[1:04:31] say that Elias will come and he will
[1:04:35] restore all things so just that very
[1:04:39] statement from the Lord Jesus that the
[1:04:41] restoration actually
[1:04:43] occurs amen when that second Elijah
[1:04:46] comes because his ministry is to restore
[1:04:49] all things and I'm here to tell you this
[1:04:52] morning that Elijah has already come and
[1:04:54] gone but his ministry was the
[1:04:57] restoration Ministry Hallelujah and with
[1:05:00] it being the restoration Ministry these
[1:05:02] scriptures pertain to this
[1:05:05] time because this is the restoration
[1:05:08] time yes sir all right all right all
[1:05:10] right so all I all I want to just say is
[1:05:13] that everything God promised me I want
[1:05:18] it everything God promised me so let me
[1:05:21] um let's go back and just uh re re re uh
[1:05:25] mention in some things that we talked
[1:05:26] about last week and then we'll go
[1:05:28] forward amen um in in in this I want to
[1:05:32] start with I read this quote last week
[1:05:33] in questions and answers on Genesis and
[1:05:36] I uh I shorten it a little bit just to
[1:05:38] kind of make it quick uh brother Brandon
[1:05:40] makes a statement speaking in tongues is
[1:05:43] a Divine gift of God which belongs in
[1:05:49] the church praise the Lord I'm going say
[1:05:52] that again speaking in tongues is a
[1:05:55] Divine gift of God which belongs in the
[1:05:58] church just the same today as it was
[1:06:02] back there in the beginning and and I'm
[1:06:03] I'm I'm I'm reiterating that because
[1:06:05] anyone try to take it out is doing us a
[1:06:08] disservice amen it belongs in the Church
[1:06:12] of God now watch these statements that
[1:06:13] he makes it says uh that's exactly the
[1:06:16] truth yes indeed he that's the Bible
[1:06:18] teaching is a
[1:06:20] Divine gift and you deny that just the
[1:06:24] same as you deny the new birth you deny
[1:06:27] everything that Jesus taught when you
[1:06:29] Tred to cut that out Hallelujah so we
[1:06:33] ain't trying to cut it out we're trying
[1:06:34] to include it yes sir okay he says now
[1:06:37] here's the other statement now you can
[1:06:38] go wild on that many of them have now
[1:06:44] I'm I'm I'm I'm not going to read the
[1:06:45] rest of that you know the rest rest of
[1:06:47] this is um um we read it last week but
[1:06:50] but I I'll I'll just say this what what
[1:06:53] what we did last week was try to bring
[1:06:55] the balance on how the gifts are
[1:06:58] supposed to operate and when when he say
[1:07:00] that they've gone wild on it what
[1:07:02] happens in in the average Pentecostal
[1:07:05] church today there's a lot of speaking
[1:07:07] in tongues I mean um uh uh in the song
[1:07:11] service speaking in tongues when the
[1:07:13] preacher preaching speaking in tongues
[1:07:16] after he preaching speaking in tongues
[1:07:18] and at the altar call speaking in
[1:07:20] tongues when I meet you outside speaking
[1:07:22] in tongues huh if I see you at the
[1:07:25] grocery store and walking down the aisle
[1:07:27] picking up some cereal speaking in
[1:07:31] tongues I mean it it they go W with it
[1:07:34] this is what the prophet T they've gone
[1:07:36] wild with these things right you know
[1:07:39] and and and and and the other thought
[1:07:40] that I have here let me just kind of
[1:07:41] present this you know uh there was a a
[1:07:44] time brother Brandon went and he went to
[1:07:46] a service and my there was a powerful
[1:07:50] anointing Amen in in the church that day
[1:07:53] and uh and and and before the message
[1:07:55] came forth there was a brother stepped
[1:07:57] up and he start I think there was tongue
[1:07:59] spoken then the brothers uh uh gave an
[1:08:01] interpretation and he told her sister
[1:08:04] thus sayith the Lord you will not die
[1:08:07] now that lady had already been told by
[1:08:09] the prophet get your house in order you
[1:08:11] going to die now because they spoke in
[1:08:14] tongues amen because they got anointed
[1:08:16] and and and and and this is again go
[1:08:18] wild with it this this man say thus said

[1:09:30] know he got up and prophesied I know
[1:09:31] there was anointing in the church he
[1:09:33] said but God ain't told me nothing
[1:09:39] different I'mma tell you something you
[1:09:41] have to stand on the word even with
[1:09:43] gifts you got to be able to stand on the
[1:09:45] word don't get so caught up on a gift
[1:09:47] that it leads you away from the
[1:09:50] word amen hallelujah oh I I I I I
[1:09:55] there's some things that I I I I I want
[1:09:57] to say and I I have to be careful
[1:09:59] sometimes because we're on a live stream
[1:10:01] but but I I'm going tell y'all this i i
[1:10:03] i people have sent me testimonies of of
[1:10:06] different ones a young lady went to a
[1:10:09] church a Pentecost Church message
[1:10:11] believer went to a Pentecost church had
[1:10:12] a prayer meeting during the prayer
[1:10:14] meeting she actually started speaking in
[1:10:15] tongues this young lady the the the the
[1:10:18] the the message girl at the Pentecost
[1:10:20] Church started speaking in tongues and
[1:10:22] then also gave an interpretation of her
[1:10:24] tongues praise the Lord in a Pentecostal
[1:10:26] church now that's something and so there
[1:10:29] was there was really really floored by
[1:10:30] what was going on it was just what she
[1:10:32] said in her in her interpretation that
[1:10:36] most of them would not have no idea what
[1:10:38] what she said but I know and
[1:10:41] interpretation was uh push play just
[1:10:44] push play just push play now if you
[1:10:48] heard something like that go forth
[1:10:49] that's you know wait a minute that's not
[1:10:51] lining up with the Bible that ain't
[1:10:53] lineing up with the Bible I am we just
[1:10:55] played a tape on Friday yeah right I
[1:10:58] mean I ain't got no problem with that
[1:10:59] but we here's the problem when you say
[1:11:02] just push play or only push play that's
[1:11:06] where the problem cuz you just cut out
[1:11:07] the whole fivefold Ministry so if
[1:11:09] something you can speak in tongues and
[1:11:11] you can and you can interpret but if
[1:11:13] that interpretation don't line up with
[1:11:15] the
[1:11:16] Worden on huh y'all going to let me talk
[1:11:19] just for a little bit you remember
[1:11:21] brother Bram you know he was he was uh
[1:11:23] uh ministering and after he pre teer
[1:11:25] brother walked up to him and said he
[1:11:27] said that could be the 23rd chapter of
[1:11:30] the Book of Revelation and when he shook
[1:11:32] his hand the man took off in tongues
[1:11:35] Hallelujah church and when he when he
[1:11:37] start speaking in tongues amen after he
[1:11:40] finished three people showed up see that
[1:11:42] don't need no interpretation that was
[1:11:45] perfect
[1:11:47] friends one was a are you an interpreter
[1:11:50] and like yeah that was perfect FR
[1:11:51] brother Bram said don't y'all say
[1:11:52] another word say I want you to go to
[1:11:54] this corner and you go to that corner
[1:11:56] you go and write down what you heard him
[1:11:58] say cuz in the mouth of two or three
[1:12:01] Witnesses every word has got to be
[1:12:03] established and when they all came back
[1:12:05] together every word was exactly the
[1:12:09] same oh my God it was pure French but
[1:12:13] when brother brandom got it he began to
[1:12:14] take that because because the the the
[1:12:16] the interpretation was um you the
[1:12:19] decision that you made you've made the
[1:12:21] right decision he say this is my DEC
[1:12:24] this is my SCE it said because you've
[1:12:26] done this this in itself will make and
[1:12:30] make and bring to pass the tremendous
[1:12:33] victory in the love
[1:12:36] divine brother random say he he said he
[1:12:38] went back and start searching the
[1:12:40] scripture he said Moses made choices and
[1:12:43] the choice that he made brought
[1:12:44] tremendous victory in his life and
[1:12:45] different ones that he can look like
[1:12:47] that made choice and as a prophet he had
[1:12:49] to know he made the right choice come on
[1:12:51] as the bride of Christ you got to know
[1:12:53] that you've made the right choice and
[1:12:55] when you know you made the right choice
[1:12:57] it will bring it will make and bring to
[1:12:59] pass a tremendous
[1:13:02] victory in the love
[1:13:04] divine see so even with gifts we don't
[1:13:07] want them to go wow see we watching
[1:13:10] everything if if somebody tells me a
[1:13:12] dream I'm looking to see how that dream
[1:13:14] connected with scripture if I can't see
[1:13:17] scripture flowing through that dream
[1:13:19] I'll just put it to the
[1:13:20] side thank you for your dream I don't
[1:13:23] see nothing nothing not yet I have to
[1:13:27] wait for God to show me something but I
[1:13:29] don't see but I just be listening to key
[1:13:31] words to see how the scriptures tied
[1:13:32] into the dream yes sir oh my God my God
[1:13:37] all right
[1:13:38] Church brother
[1:13:40] brandom told us that even Jesus Christ
[1:13:43] himself spoke in tongues and we picked
[1:13:46] that up in in Mark 541 this is where we
[1:13:49] see the Lord
[1:13:50] Jesus um speaking in tongues amen the
[1:13:55] Bible says he took the damsel by the
[1:13:57] hand and said unto her ttha
[1:14:01] Kumai which is being interpreted damsel
[1:14:03] I say unto thee arise so this is if if
[1:14:07] our lord Jesus did it I I showed you
[1:14:09] last week that our Prophet did it amen
[1:14:11] this is something that belongs in the
[1:14:13] church sir it's a Divine gift of God
[1:14:16] that belongs in the church First
[1:14:19] Corinthians 14 just gives us instruction
[1:14:21] on how to keep this lined up amen we we
[1:14:25] in 1 Corinthians 14 the spirit of the
[1:14:27] prophets is subject to the prophets
[1:14:28] we've taught that amen the scripture
[1:14:31] tells us to covet prophecy and forbid
[1:14:33] not to speak in tongues uh we simply
[1:14:36] need to keep it in order the scripture
[1:14:38] advises let everything all things be
[1:14:40] done in decently and in order and and
[1:14:43] also what what we found out in 1
[1:14:44] Corinthians 14 when you're speaking in
[1:14:46] tongues in public this is the this is
[1:14:48] the when I when I say in public in a
[1:14:50] public setting like in the church uh let
[1:14:53] me just I want to make it clear in a a
[1:14:55] public set we in we here in church today
[1:14:57] and man you that anointing was great
[1:14:59] this morning is it still great it's
[1:15:01] still great and and and you and when you
[1:15:03] come to church and you have an
[1:15:04] atmosphere like that especially after a
[1:15:05] preaching word you know a gift could go
[1:15:08] forward you not that you going to make
[1:15:09] it go forward but but it can happen but
[1:15:12] knowing how to handle it when it does
[1:15:14] happen right so so brother Bram told say
[1:15:17] if you know if we're publicly like this
[1:15:19] I I'm sorry the scripture Paul tells us
[1:15:21] this it says um it Tong should be by two
[1:15:24] or or at most by three and let let let
[1:15:29] let let them interpret right let one
[1:15:32] interpret so so uh if you get an
[1:15:34] anointing like that we know if a if
[1:15:37] tongues go forth it should be only two
[1:15:39] or at most three not four people five
[1:15:43] people six people that's where it goes
[1:15:45] wow right but two or at most three
[1:15:48] that's what the Bible declares yes sir
[1:15:50] right so we just trying to line things
[1:15:52] up with the word now now here's the
[1:15:54] other thing uh that's in 1 Corinthians
[1:15:56] 14 I want to pull up this verse verse 13
[1:15:59] amen uh as we just try to continue to
[1:16:01] move forward we're keeping these things
[1:16:03] in order in line and here here's here's
[1:16:06] what the Bible say wherefore let him
[1:16:08] that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray
[1:16:13] that he may interpret if God actually
[1:16:17] gives you the tongue then you also got
[1:16:19] to pray God either give me the
[1:16:21] interpretation or give somebody else the
[1:16:23] interpretation and in this congregation
[1:16:26] because we got to have the
[1:16:27] interpretation and here's the other
[1:16:28] thing I read for you if we do it in
[1:16:30] order the prophet said like he told his
[1:16:33] sister he said sister you just let it go
[1:16:35] at the wrong time I know God was working
[1:16:37] on but if you would come back at the end
[1:16:39] of ser if the Spirit come back on you do
[1:16:42] it then and I
[1:16:45] guarantee I guarantee there will be an
[1:16:48] interpretation if the prophet can
[1:16:50] guarantee that Hallelujah because we got
[1:16:54] things in order with the word of God I
[1:16:56] believe the same thing in here if we
[1:16:59] keep it in line with the scripture I
[1:17:01] guarantee God will do exactly what he
[1:17:03] said he would do because this is the
[1:17:06] season this is the time for these things
[1:17:09] to
[1:17:10] occur amen this is the restoration
[1:17:13] message yes sir come on I mean you know
[1:17:17] I'm believing God for your family and
[1:17:18] I'm believing God for your money but
[1:17:20] restoration go beyond your family and
[1:17:21] your
[1:17:23] money yes sir truth and now now we now
[1:17:26] now we talk about the blessings in the
[1:17:28] in the upper
[1:17:29] Springs it's blessings in the nether
[1:17:31] Springs that's that's what you dealing
[1:17:33] with down here on the Earth but there's
[1:17:34] blessings in the upper Springs and you
[1:17:37] know what they've been taken out of the
[1:17:38] church now we got to preach it right
[1:17:40] back into the church and the more we
[1:17:42] preach it the more under expectation we
[1:17:45] become amen we're looking for God to do
[1:17:48] exactly what he promised that he would
[1:17:50] do let me uh go on to this sermon a
[1:17:52] super sign amen super sign here brother
[1:17:56] Brandon makes a
[1:17:58] statement it says now
[1:18:02] notice and and let me let me also just
[1:18:05] kind of clarify something really quick
[1:18:07] because I know it
[1:18:09] just when I'm
[1:18:12] quoting scripture and I'm quoting from
[1:18:16] God's Prophet brother brandom he was
[1:18:18] God's Prophet sit here in this
[1:18:20] generation to fulfill scripture amen not
[1:18:24] just a prophet just because somebody
[1:18:25] rise up and say they a prophet no I'm
[1:18:27] not talking about that I'm talking about
[1:18:29] a prophet like unto Moses I'm talking
[1:18:33] about a prophet like unto John the
[1:18:34] Baptist I'm talking about a prophet that
[1:18:37] had I mean John the Baptist was supposed
[1:18:39] to come and fulfill the introduction of
[1:18:41] Christ at his first coming God had a
[1:18:44] second prophet that would come and
[1:18:45] restore all things Jesus spoke about it
[1:18:48] and and brother brandom happened to be
[1:18:49] the one that fulfilled that amen all
[1:18:52] right and and born right during the time
[1:18:55] of the uh Assa Street Revival glory to
[1:18:59] God born right during that time let us
[1:19:01] know that there was a fourth stage that
[1:19:02] this restoration the sou Street was not
[1:19:05] the end of it it was part of it but it
[1:19:08] wasn't the end of it and then there was
[1:19:10] then then what had to come was the word
[1:19:12] which is what we're talking about this
[1:19:13] morning the word had to come and and if
[1:19:15] we can't take the word but still want to
[1:19:17] take the gifts we had a
[1:19:19] problem stay with me here if we if we
[1:19:23] can't take the word but want to take the
[1:19:24] gift we got a problem so watch this now
[1:19:26] I'm going to read here you know from
[1:19:28] what God's Prophet tells he says notice
[1:19:30] now they took all the Holy Spirit out of
[1:19:33] the church and made a holy man the the
[1:19:37] solemnity from the church on a holy man
[1:19:39] conquered it that went through for that
[1:19:42] great denomination of Catholicism that's
[1:19:44] what the pope is okay rule the Earth for
[1:19:47] aund and and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:19:49] years there come forth a
[1:19:52] reformer Luther and as soon as Luther
[1:19:55] died they organized it and the vine
[1:19:58] dried up and the husbandman pruned it
[1:20:01] where did it go it's dead lutherans are
[1:20:03] dead now now this is this is not
[1:20:05] anything uh new uh if you just go around
[1:20:08] to the average Lutheran Church nowadays
[1:20:10] they selling them the average Lutheran
[1:20:14] Church they're being sold because the
[1:20:15] people are no longer there amen and
[1:20:18] Luther was a reformer but but it's moved
[1:20:20] on from that hallelujah oh my God help
[1:20:23] us when we when we when we get to here
[1:20:26] because we we're going to see something
[1:20:27] and and um even though it moved on from
[1:20:30] that there was there is I'm going to
[1:20:31] talk about this a little bit later
[1:20:32] brother Ram said there was three seeds
[1:20:34] that were sewn three seeds and he said
[1:20:37] Billy Graham had a seed or Robert had a
[1:20:40] seed and then he said the word seed now
[1:20:43] here's what happen when seeds are sewn
[1:20:45] they need rain and when you get rain
[1:20:48] seeds come forth Hallelujah and whatever
[1:20:51] was swn is actually going to be coming
[1:20:53] up out of the ground so whatever Billy
[1:20:55] Graham sold sold and he's no longer here
[1:20:58] right and whatever he sold going to be
[1:21:00] coming up and it is coming up I'm going
[1:21:02] tell youall what he sold is coming up in
[1:21:03] the mega
[1:21:05] churches right that's right that's what
[1:21:09] Billy Graham sold and that's what the me
[1:21:11] mega churches are are are are
[1:21:13] reaping uh or Robert sold a Pentecostal
[1:21:18] seed right and and the Pentecostal seed
[1:21:20] is coming up my God and and if I could
[1:21:23] just be with y'all the Pentecostal seat
[1:21:26] got away from the word they had the
[1:21:29] gifts but it got away from the word even
[1:21:31] the man that was sowing the seed before
[1:21:33] he passed away he told everybody that
[1:21:37] Jesus a
[1:21:39] 900 foot Jesus Oh
[1:21:44] Lord a 900 foot Jesus told him if he did
[1:21:47] not get the money from the people God
[1:21:50] was going to take him home that's
[1:21:53] right well he went home yes
[1:21:56] sir and I'm not picking at him but I'm
[1:21:59] just saying there is no 900 foot
[1:22:02] Jesus and anybody come tell you that in
[1:22:05] order to scare you to get money out your
[1:22:06] pocket something's wrong with them but
[1:22:08] this is what happened with the Pentecost
[1:22:10] so see when the church when they leader
[1:22:12] go into things like that what you think
[1:22:14] the rest of them going to
[1:22:15] do sir but there was there was another
[1:22:18] one there was a Billy Graham and a or
[1:22:21] Roberts and he said there were two
[1:22:23] angels that went down into Sodom and
[1:22:26] blinded the people blinded them with the
[1:22:28] gospel yes sir they couldn't even see
[1:22:30] the truth anymore oh Lord have mercy
[1:22:33] blinding them with with these great
[1:22:35] great great big moves and and movements
[1:22:38] and and all kind of things blind blinded
[1:22:40] the people they could not recognize the
[1:22:43] true word of God Amen and brother
[1:22:45] Brandon say now notice just like Abraham
[1:22:48] had uh h m at the end of his name he
[1:22:52] says notice Graham g r a hm God was
[1:22:55] using this ministry Hallelujah said God
[1:22:58] using all Robert's Ministry and he say
[1:23:00] he says but there was one that stayed
[1:23:02] behind with the bride sewing the word
[1:23:03] seed the one that stayed with Abraham
[1:23:05] and and and and Sarah come on somebody
[1:23:08] and he just always say there was one
[1:23:10] stay with him but he would never
[1:23:12] say that there was another one by the
[1:23:14] name of h m cuz he say Graham g r a h a
[1:23:19] m six letters but he would never say
[1:23:23] brandom b r a n h a m seven letters
[1:23:29] never would say that we had to be the
[1:23:32] ones to catch
[1:23:33] it that's right let me keep reading let
[1:23:37] me keep reading Hallelujah I'm so glad
[1:23:39] we caught it all right since that went
[1:23:42] through that that went through for that
[1:23:43] great denomination Catholicism Ruled the
[1:23:45] Earth for hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:23:47] there come forth a reformer Luther as
[1:23:49] soon as Luther died they organized it
[1:23:51] and a Vine DED up and the husband pruned
[1:23:53] it where did it go isad head showed me
[1:23:55] where it Ever Raised after Luther's
[1:23:57] Revival it died he says alone came after
[1:24:01] that John Wesley the next stage amen and
[1:24:03] this is the part of the restoration when
[1:24:05] God sent Luther that was the first part
[1:24:07] of the restoration John Wesley was the
[1:24:09] second part of the restoration my God
[1:24:11] when he sent the Pentecost that was a
[1:24:13] third part of restoration and the fourth
[1:24:15] is the word itself coming back to us
[1:24:17] look at this now it says uh John West
[1:24:19] the next day see the great man of God
[1:24:20] that preach sanctification what happened
[1:24:22] what happened as soon as Wesley and the
[1:24:25] ashberry and them died uh ashberry and
[1:24:28] them died they organized and made a
[1:24:30] church out of it and God the husband
[1:24:32] pruned the branches off and it died tell
[1:24:35] me where they where where they ever had
[1:24:37] another Revival now you know somebody
[1:24:40] would read this quote and then they
[1:24:43] would go back to a little event that
[1:24:44] happened here I think in the past couple
[1:24:46] years where some people were at a
[1:24:48] college and I think it was Asberry
[1:24:50] college and and it's the truth
[1:24:54] hello and the prophet say it died now if
[1:24:57] you if you look at a little history at
[1:24:59] this college a few years ago young
[1:25:01] people was coming from everywhere and
[1:25:04] they were just having worship service
[1:25:05] after worship service after worship and
[1:25:07] they say we having Revival with worship
[1:25:09] services oh my God my God but if you saw
[1:25:12] how the people was dressed going to
[1:25:14] church they went to church one way and
[1:25:16] came out the same way no no this ain't
[1:25:18] the same type of Revival something wrong
[1:25:21] with this revival I mean I'm talking

[1:28:45] is that you must speak in tongues and
[1:28:47] and when he said they going while I

[1:43:42] season I'm going to say that again the
[1:43:45] fruit they are God's fruit that come
[1:43:48] forth in his season his fruit come forth
[1:43:52] in his season season and when when
[1:43:54] brother Brandon breaks that down he says
[1:43:55] that's God fruit coming forth in the
[1:43:57] prophet
[1:43:59] season the prophet has come the prophet
[1:44:02] is gone but since we're still under the
[1:44:04] anointing of what that Prophet said this
[1:44:06] is still the prophet's
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:11] season so we know what to look for on
[1:44:13] the tree Blasphemous names I want to
[1:44:16] read from
[1:44:18] there oh God Blasphemous names now
[1:44:22] brother Brandon preach the sermon a
[1:44:24] statute of a perfect man and then after
[1:44:26] the statue of perfect man he preaches
[1:44:27] Blasphemous names why is that important
[1:44:29] because often times a minister could
[1:44:31] could get started down the thought then
[1:44:33] he just man he he got so much left that
[1:44:35] he just didn't get a chance to say and
[1:44:37] the next sermon comes up now he goes
[1:44:38] back and he says some of those things so
[1:44:40] Blasphemous names he brings out some of
[1:44:41] this now when he preaches Blasphemous
[1:44:43] names his his main thought here is that
[1:44:47] what are the Blasphemous names what are
[1:44:50] they and notice that blasphemous
[1:44:53] names or names of blasphemy what are
[1:44:56] they he said
[1:44:58] Baptist
[1:45:00] Lutheran
[1:45:01] Pentecostal
[1:45:03] Episcopalian
[1:45:05] Evangelical anything that's off the word
[1:45:07] even if it's off by one little Iota it's
[1:45:11] a Blasphemous
[1:45:12] name watch it now he preaches this he
[1:45:15] says now I
[1:45:17] shun saying this a few days ago thinking
[1:45:20] that the church would be spiritual
[1:45:21] enough to catch it and maybe I better
[1:45:23] turn this tape off right now cuz I don't
[1:45:26] want it to get out amongst Brethren but
[1:45:29] you could speak with
[1:45:32] tongues you could shout you could dance
[1:45:36] you could cast out Devils do anything
[1:45:39] you want to and
[1:45:41] still not have the Holy
[1:45:47] Ghost it says then them disciples back
[1:45:50] there uh come back rejoicing and
[1:45:52] shouting because the Devils were subject
[1:45:54] unto them it says and it says and right
[1:45:56] among them was
[1:45:58] Judas right look at that now it says did
[1:46:01] not Jesus say in that day when he come
[1:46:04] that many will come uh to me and say
[1:46:07] Lord have not I cast out devils and in
[1:46:10] your name done Mighty works and I say
[1:46:11] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[1:46:14] didn't know you these things are not
[1:46:17] indications of the Holy Spirit but
[1:46:19] what's the
[1:46:21] indication by their fruit
[1:46:24] fruits what are the fruit coming off
[1:46:26] this tree by their fruits ye shall know
[1:46:31] them not by the manifestation but by the
[1:46:33] fruit what life are they living after
[1:46:36] they manifesting gifts yes sir amen if
[1:46:40] the quickest way to discard your
[1:46:44] testimony is to have a horrible
[1:46:48] life nobody want to hear from you if I
[1:46:52] was just up here preaching and then
[1:46:53] going out living any kind of way you
[1:46:55] wouldn't want to hear from me Lord I'm I
[1:46:57] I I I know the prophet say he a like
[1:46:59] calling names I know the prophet said he
[1:47:04] didn't like calling names and I know I
[1:47:05] just called some names I know I did but
[1:47:10] sometimes you have to do it in order to
[1:47:12] help the people not to hurt the people
[1:47:15] but there is a major
[1:47:18] preacher was
[1:47:20] CAU at a P

[1:52:58] absolutely that's gifts of God but those
[1:53:01] gifts of God

[1:56:29] right you you make a stumbling block to
[1:56:31] other folk when you do things like
[1:56:33] this
[1:56:35] amen amen amen praise God he says but
[1:56:40] those gifts of God without those virtues
[1:56:41] in them makes a stumbling block to the
[1:56:43] unbeliever is not accepted by God this
[1:56:48] oh I love this statement
[1:56:50] this has to be
[1:56:55] first and when you have faith virtue
[1:56:58] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[1:57:00] and brotherly love then the Holy Ghost
[1:57:02] comes down and seals you as a unit as
[1:57:06] same as he seals the church ages as a
[1:57:08] unit now I want to clarify just
[1:57:11] something with that statement because
[1:57:13] people taking that quote and say you
[1:57:15] don't even have the Holy Ghost
[1:57:18] until uh you got all these virtues in
[1:57:21] you that's what they teach that you
[1:57:23] don't even have the Holy Ghost until you
[1:57:24] got the virtues because the Holy Ghost
[1:57:25] come down and seal you as a unit but
[1:57:28] understand now before you can add Faith
[1:57:32] before you can add add virtue before you
[1:57:34] can add knowledge and Temperance and
[1:57:36] patience godl brotherly kindness and
[1:57:37] love before you can do any of that you
[1:57:40] got to be born
[1:57:44] again yes sir and if you are born again
[1:57:50] then that mean the Holy Ghost is on the
[1:57:51] foundation
[1:57:56] the Holy Ghost got to change you so you
[1:57:57] can add these things and all all brother
[1:58:00] brand I'm saying is at the end of it
[1:58:01] this is what completes the person see
[1:58:04] and and it's like you a seal going on
[1:58:06] both sides on the on the on the bottom
[1:58:09] and on the top it's a a holy ghost on
[1:58:10] the bottom holy ghost on the top seal
[1:58:13] yes sir and Holy Ghost on the inside
[1:58:15] uhuh amen amen praise God Amen all right
[1:58:19] all right I I hope that made sense
[1:58:23] you can't add cuz if you adding this
[1:58:25] without having the Holy Ghost then
[1:58:27] brother brandom says it's like a uh a
[1:58:30] peacock no no no he says it's like a
[1:58:33] blackbird trying to add peacock feathers
[1:58:36] to it you can't a black bird like a crow
[1:58:41] can't add peacock feathers and spread
[1:58:43] them and like look how beautiful I
[1:58:47] am that those not real feathers they not
[1:58:50] they not Originals uh-huh that's it you
[1:58:53] weren born with that and the reason we
[1:58:56] got to be born again is so that we can
[1:58:58] be born with this yes sir born with
[1:59:01] these virtues amen because without it
[1:59:03] you're not going to you're going to have
[1:59:05] you're going to have less patience
[1:59:06] you're going have less love you have um
[1:59:10] less
[1:59:11] godliness hello somebody amen Lord have
[1:59:14] mercy this just so much to preach it
[1:59:17] just it it's it's a lot it's a lot y'all
[1:59:19] but I I'mma just do the best I can amen
[1:59:22] we trying to be like
[1:59:25] God that's what godlin is all about it's
[1:59:27] like being like

[1:59:33] Jesus in my talk I want to be like Jesus
[1:59:36] in my walk I want to be like Jesus am
[1:59:39] all right let me go on it says this the
[1:59:44] Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a
[1:59:46] unit as same as he seals the church a
[1:59:49] ages as a unit the way he makes his
[1:59:51] bride is the way where he makes his
[1:59:53] individual made out of the same material
[1:59:55] like Eve was made out of Adam a rib from
[1:59:57] the side he here is the things that you
[2:00:01] have to have first you can't impersonate
[2:00:05] them you can't imitate them they've got
[2:00:08] to be God sent and God born
[2:00:12] imitation only
[2:00:15] causes
[2:00:20] confusion and we don't you ought to say
[2:00:22] Lord I don't want to be a stumbling
[2:00:26] block I want to be a stepping stone but
[2:00:28] I don't want to be a stumbling block to
[2:00:30] nobody amen not my wife not my husband
[2:00:35] not my not not nobody in my family I
[2:00:37] don't want to be a stumbling block I
[2:00:38] want to help them praise God it's like I
[2:00:42] said could you imagine seeing a buzzit
[2:00:45] sitting there with with a dove feather
[2:00:47] stuck in his wings say see I'm a
[2:00:50] dove he's not a Dove he's a buzzard a
[2:00:55] vulture and and and let me let me tell
[2:00:57] you how you can know that he's a vulture
[2:01:00] even though he got he done stuck these
[2:01:02] Dove feathers in him how you know he
[2:01:05] vulture you let something
[2:01:07] die and be sitting on the side of the
[2:01:10] road them Dove feathers will
[2:01:14] show if he hanging out on the side of
[2:01:16] the road next to something that's dead
[2:01:18] you know there's something wrong here
[2:01:20] sir amen and a dove don't eat that kind
[2:01:23] of
[2:01:24] stuff praise God Amen could you imagine
[2:01:28] a black bird with peacock feather and
[2:01:29] his wings saying that's something that
[2:01:31] he's stuck in but it has to come from
[2:01:34] the inside out glory and and produces
[2:01:38] Christianity God by the power of the
[2:01:41] holy spirit all right I was supposed to
[2:01:44] just quickly go through these things and
[2:01:46] I get on to where I was trying to go to
[2:01:48] but here we are again Amen Let me just
[2:01:51] tell you
[2:01:52] uh this what did Pentecost have for us
[2:01:55] to be restored back to it I talked about
[2:01:57] this I didn't finish it but I'll just
[2:01:59] talk about it again they had
[2:02:02] Oneness they had they were one in mind
[2:02:04] and they were in one
[2:02:06] Accord and the proma worm is what
[2:02:08] destroyed the brotherly love so we want
[2:02:09] to see that come back into church I told
[2:02:11] you I know what's been planted in this
[2:02:13] church so I know what to expect to come
[2:02:15] forth it says brother uh the scripture
[2:02:17] tells us that they had a a a a a Russian
[2:02:20] Mighty Wind it was a sudden wind a
[2:02:23] sudden sound it was like a wind and
[2:02:26] brother brother Solomon came and said
[2:02:28] how it was a tape that you can go back
[2:02:30] and listen to and in the building as
[2:02:32] brother Brown's preaching they can
[2:02:34] actually on the tape you can actually
[2:02:36] hear the wind coming into and then the
[2:02:39] voice of God speaking back out to the
[2:02:40] people through the wind
[2:02:43] amen amen amen amen amen uh he says uh
[2:02:48] the scripture tells that and I love this
[2:02:50] they were all filled with the Holy Holy
[2:02:52] Ghost that's what happened on the day of
[2:02:53] Pentecost everybody in the house was
[2:02:55] filled with the Holy Ghost uh they spoke
[2:02:58] in other tongues
[2:03:00] as the spirit gave them utterance this
[2:03:03] means everybody might not speak in
[2:03:04] tongues that's okay you got your gift
[2:03:07] just do what God called you to do and
[2:03:09] don't get jealous of nobody else that
[2:03:11] got a gift the gift of tongues you might
[2:03:15] have the gift of wisdom you might have
[2:03:16] the gift of knowledge do what God told
[2:03:18] call you to do amen right he said the
[2:03:21] other thing about Pentecost is the
[2:03:22] miracle of it is that the people
[2:03:24] understood in their native languages now
[2:03:27] I I I made this comment last week
[2:03:29] because we have multiple languages
[2:03:31] represented right here in our
[2:03:32] congregation we got English we got
[2:03:35] Creole we got Spanish we got Shona we
[2:03:38] got
[2:03:39] Africans we got twe we got all these
[2:03:42] languages and um and I and I shared a
[2:03:45] couple quotes with you how brother
[2:03:46] brandham was speaking in English in a
[2:03:50] prayer line and this young girl that
[2:03:51] spoke Spanish heard him she said and she
[2:03:54] told The Interpreter said I thought you
[2:03:56] said this man couldn't speak Spanish and
[2:03:59] they played the tape back he was
[2:04:00] speaking English but she heard
[2:04:02] everything he said in her native
[2:04:05] language of Spanish and he speaking
[2:04:07] English that's what happened on the day
[2:04:09] of Pentecost right also I showed you how
[2:04:13] brother brandham uh was in his hotel
[2:04:15] room and couldn't leave he start praying
[2:04:17] he said he heard somebody talking
[2:04:18] outside the room like who's this talking
[2:04:20] not it was him he was actually praying
[2:04:22] in German for a woman that was actually
[2:04:25] on the way to the meeting to be prayed
[2:04:27] for and she was a German woman he
[2:04:28] interceded in her
[2:04:30] language and didn't even know what he
[2:04:32] was doing yes sir as I was sharing at
[2:04:35] the brothers came and and told say
[2:04:36] brother
[2:04:37] Jack you all are familiar with AI if
[2:04:40] you're not it's it's all over the place
[2:04:43] artificial
[2:04:45] intelligence is is is all I thought I
[2:04:47] thought when I was in school this guy
[2:04:49] told me about this artificial
[2:04:50] intelligent I'm like man that ain't that
[2:04:52] ain't going to be happening he was right
[2:04:54] the teacher was right but this
[2:04:56] artificial intelligence is really it's
[2:04:59] it's it's it's there's a lot that people
[2:05:01] can do that are great things with it
[2:05:03] there's a lot of bad things that people
[2:05:04] can
[2:05:05] do sometimes you go to
[2:05:08] church a preacher has actually given
[2:05:12] given you a AI sermon and you don't even
[2:05:15] know it AI could I could I could type in
[2:05:18] AI right now just certain things about
[2:05:20] this message it'll give me quotes and
[2:05:23] scriptures for me to just come preach to
[2:05:25] you now let let me tell you something if
[2:05:26] you get a preacher that went to AI but
[2:05:28] never went to
[2:05:30] God you got a problem on your hands
[2:05:33] right and and and just so watch just
[2:05:35] just be careful kids are using it to
[2:05:38] cheat in
[2:05:41] school children are using it to cheat on
[2:05:44] their assignments in school all kind of
[2:05:47] things uh uh uh on the job maybe you
[2:05:50] have an assignment to write uh in school
[2:05:51] you got you use AI put this in there you
[2:05:53] got it oh I'm turning this in uh-huh
[2:05:56] people people can people people can tell
[2:05:58] that you done use your AI cuz you don't
[2:06:01] write like
[2:06:03] that that's
[2:06:05] right Lord I'm out here now ai been
[2:06:09] using a lot of lot of my my my daughter
[2:06:12] they they decided to put a picture on on
[2:06:15] on a former job of her they said what
[2:06:18] does she look
[2:06:19] like and they ask he what she looked
[2:06:22] like and they came back with a picture
[2:06:25] of my daughter and they had her with
[2:06:26] some lipstick and some earrings and and
[2:06:28] everything and she and she like that
[2:06:30] ain't me I ain't never look like that
[2:06:31] one day in my life she had to tell the
[2:06:33] boss please take this down AI got me
[2:06:37] wrong if you want a picture I give you a
[2:06:40] picture but don't use
[2:06:43] ai ai ai ai is a very dangerous
[2:06:47] technology it can be very helpful and
[2:06:49] very dangerous at the same time
[2:06:53] y they were telling me that AI they're
[2:06:56] using they're trying to use AI so that I
[2:06:59] can be here
[2:07:01] preaching in
[2:07:03] English but somebody else in their
[2:07:05] native language could actually hear what
[2:07:08] I'm saying in their native language not
[2:07:11] not just the the Google translate thing
[2:07:13] cuz Google translate like and I have a a
[2:07:15] a employee she she only speaks Spanish
[2:07:17] so what I do is I always go to translate
[2:07:19] and I type you know what I'm typing I
[2:07:20] put it in English and I translate to
[2:07:22] Spanish then I send it off to her and
[2:07:23] she do the same thing to me and that's
[2:07:25] how we communicate through through
[2:07:27] through through Google translate and I
[2:07:29] mean beautiful it helps me right but
[2:07:32] they trying to get it where even a
[2:07:35] video live video now you now I I want
[2:07:39] you to understand what they're trying to
[2:07:41] do is exactly what I'm preaching to you
[2:07:44] that happened on the day of Pentecost
[2:07:47] now and from so so from a intellectual
[2:07:50] perspective
[2:07:52] AI is trying to go to the same spot that
[2:07:55] God trying to restore us
[2:07:58] to now here's the other thing if they
[2:08:01] can do that with
[2:08:04] technology they got it from they got it
[2:08:07] from the scripture cuz this happened in
[2:08:09] the scripture first right so if they can
[2:08:11] do that with technology then how much
[2:08:13] more should we be looking forward to
[2:08:14] seeing these things spiritually sir amen
[2:08:18] amen God can do it
[2:08:21] am that's right and and I'm not saying
[2:08:23] God can do it I'm saying he already done
[2:08:25] it when you read the book of Acts this
[2:08:29] is what happened on the day of Pentecost
[2:08:31] when it all came in one mind and one
[2:08:35] Accord God began to do things like this
[2:08:37] in their
[2:08:39] midst it it it it was almost Pentecost
[2:08:43] if I can say it like this almost
[2:08:44] produced a
[2:08:47] before uh Tower Babel condition yeah
[2:08:55] because it was at the Tower of Babel
[2:08:58] that they lost control of the languages
[2:09:01] only because they was doing it their way
[2:09:03] and not God's way right sir but before
[2:09:06] before uh them rod and all them got
[2:09:08] going what they were doing they actually
[2:09:10] spoke the same language right oh my my
[2:09:13] my my my my my and where did that start
[2:09:16] back in the Garden of Eden so this
[2:09:18] restoration takes us all the way back
[2:09:20] Church
[2:09:22] I don't know about you I'm looking
[2:09:23] forward to all of this amen here's some
[2:09:25] other things amen that that that that
[2:09:27] Pentecost did
[2:09:30] um I'm going read this in in in uh give
[2:09:33] me um Acts 2 verse 13 and then um couple
[2:09:40] other things I want to say uh the other
[2:09:42] thing that that Pentecost produced that
[2:09:44] that we want to get back to Pentecost
[2:09:47] produced the correct
[2:09:49] revelation of baptism how we're supposed
[2:09:52] to be baptized we're not supposed to be
[2:09:54] baptized in in the titles of Father Son
[2:09:57] and Holy Ghost baptism is in the name of
[2:10:00] the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the
[2:10:03] father he is the son he is the Holy
[2:10:06] Ghost It produced the correct revelation
[2:10:08] of baptism amen nobody in the Bible was
[2:10:12] ever baptized under Father Son and the
[2:10:14] Holy Ghost everybody was baptized uh in
[2:10:17] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[2:10:19] other thing that happened in in in in
[2:10:20] Pentecost people continued steadfastly
[2:10:23] in the apostles Doctrine in
[2:10:26] Fellowship uh breaking of bread amen and
[2:10:30] in prayers remember if we going to see
[2:10:32] this happen we got to be what uh praying
[2:10:35] church and when we see God do it we got
[2:10:38] to keep praying amen
[2:10:41] amen amen other thing in Pentecost Many
[2:10:44] Wonders and signs were done by the
[2:10:46] apostles praise God and here's another
[2:10:48] thing that happened at Pentecost the
[2:10:50] Lord
[2:10:52] added to the
[2:10:54] church
[2:10:57] daily such as would be
[2:11:00] Sav because in in in in in in Mount Zion
[2:11:04] there would be Deliverance if there is
[2:11:06] someone that needed Deliverance there
[2:11:07] was going to be some Deliverance for
[2:11:08] them if they wanted salvation there was
[2:11:10] going to be salvation for them these are
[2:11:12] the things that happen and these this is
[2:11:15] what we're looking for here let me read
[2:11:17] this scripture acts
[2:11:18] 2113-21 uh and then I'll close here
[2:11:22] today
[2:11:25] um this what we're reading is simply
[2:11:29] fulfillment or a portion of the
[2:11:32] Fulfillment from Joel's prophecy that we
[2:11:35] read in Joel chapter 2 here Acts 2 verse
[2:11:39] 13 oh my all
[2:11:42] right says this um others mocking said
[2:11:48] these men are full of new wine but Peter
[2:11:52] standing up with the 11 lifted up his
[2:11:54] voice and at and said unto them ye men
[2:11:56] of Judea and all ye that dwell in
[2:11:58] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[2:12:01] hearken to my words for these are not
[2:12:04] drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but
[2:12:06] the third hour of the day but this is
[2:12:10] that which was spoken by the prophet
[2:12:12] Joel and I'm telling you when Peter
[2:12:14] identified this experience on the day of
[2:12:16] Pentecost as a prophecy that Joel spoke
[2:12:20] about we going to stand up and say the
[2:12:23] exact same thing Peter said no we not
[2:12:27] we're not drunken as you suppose but
[2:12:29] this is that that was spoken by Joel and
[2:12:32] then explained by brother brandham look
[2:12:36] at this he says but but this is that
[2:12:39] which was spoken by the prophet Joel and
[2:12:41] it shall come to pass in the last
[2:12:45] days pluralized that's why it says not
[2:12:48] just for the P Pentecost itself this is
[2:12:50] for
[2:12:51] last
[2:12:53] days hallelujah saith God I will pour
[2:12:56] out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[2:12:59] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[2:13:02] and your young men shall see visions and
[2:13:03] your old men shall dream dreams and on
[2:13:06] my servants and on my handm mates I will
[2:13:07] pour out in those days my spirit and
[2:13:09] they shall prophesy and I will show
[2:13:13] wonders in Heaven above and signs in the
[2:13:15] earth beneath blood and fire and and and
[2:13:17] Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned
[2:13:20] into darkness in the Moon into blood
[2:13:22] before the great and notable day of the
[2:13:23] Lord come now you know um the wonders in
[2:13:26] the heaven wonders in the heavens uh let
[2:13:28] me just throw this out there I have
[2:13:30] never seen in all my life so many
[2:13:35] articles on
[2:13:38] aelis
[2:13:41] Borealis the northern
[2:13:43] lights and I mean people that live in in
[2:13:46] places in in in the world where they get
[2:13:48] a chance to see them all the time
[2:13:49] certain times of year is it's almost
[2:13:51] nothing to them but I mean just a few
[2:13:53] months ago they showed up in in in Fort
[2:13:56] Lauderdale I wish I would have been
[2:13:57] there to see them but now they tracking
[2:13:59] it in every I mean it's like like a uh
[2:14:03] something happening in the atmosphere
[2:14:04] where they just showing up everywhere
[2:14:07] right and uh so so we hearing a lot
[2:14:08] about the signs these are signs in the
[2:14:12] heavens when you when you hear about the
[2:14:14] blood moons these These are signs that
[2:14:16] the scriptures talking about and they've
[2:14:17] been tracking this like they they can
[2:14:19] tell you when the next blood moon going
[2:14:20] to Happ
[2:14:21] happen Church don't miss these
[2:14:25] signs watch it now the sun shall be
[2:14:27] turned in the darkness and the Moon in
[2:14:29] the blood before the great notable day
[2:14:30] of the Lord to come and it shall come to
[2:14:32] pass that whosoever shall call on the
[2:14:34] name of the Lord shall
[2:14:36] be
[2:14:40] save I tell you the truth what they had
[2:14:44] at Pentecost is what we're looking for
[2:14:46] God to do this is what he planted and
[2:14:49] these are the fruit that we're looking
[2:14:50] for from his tree that he planted I got
[2:14:53] one last statement a quote from paman
[2:14:56] church age and I'm
[2:15:03] done those of you that are
[2:15:08] gifted Prophet gives us some
[2:15:12] advice he says just
[2:15:14] always keep humble
[2:15:22] always keep humble now everyone in the
[2:15:26] church has something to do everybody you
[2:15:29] got to find what you're supposed to do
[2:15:31] and then and when you find what you're
[2:15:32] supposed to do do it everyone in the
[2:15:36] church has something to do but don't
[2:15:37] never pull it aside for something else
[2:15:41] don't do that let it blend in with the
[2:15:44] rest of the church if you see somebody
[2:15:46] gifted pulling their gift to the side
[2:15:48] and and and and doing all that something
[2:15:49] wrong with them uh no well I don't I
[2:15:51] don't I don't really do this in the
[2:15:53] church but if you come to my
[2:15:57] house you know we just Fellowship a
[2:16:00] little bit together maybe the Lord will
[2:16:01] show me
[2:16:04] something but how come your gift don't
[2:16:06] never go forth in the church it the Lord
[2:16:08] don't really want me to do it like that
[2:16:10] is that
[2:16:12] right is that
[2:16:14] right but maybe you got an ulterior
[2:16:19] objective oh Lord have mercy I'm going
[2:16:21] to say some
[2:16:24] things brother random said for the young
[2:16:28] sisters if you always saw young sister
[2:16:31] hanging with a old
[2:16:35] sister y'all I'm out here not he say
[2:16:39] something
[2:16:40] wrong say why is that young sister
[2:16:42] hanging with that old sister all the
[2:16:43] time like that say something wrong he
[2:16:46] said maybe she got some candy that she
[2:16:49] giving her like he say like a little
[2:16:51] girl hanging with
[2:16:52] Grandma if you see a little girl hanging
[2:16:54] with Grandma they say they don't have
[2:16:56] nothing in comma common so why is that
[2:16:58] girl hanging with Grandma all the time I
[2:17:01] mean as a little girl she want to hang
[2:17:03] with people her age hello somebody amen
[2:17:07] and Grandma want to hang with people
[2:17:08] grandma can't even talk to her the
[2:17:11] little girl like that but she said maybe
[2:17:13] maybe grandma got some candy it's it's a
[2:17:15] reason why a young girl will hang with a
[2:17:18] older lady
[2:17:22] it's a reason why the older lady want
[2:17:25] that young girl to hang with her hello
[2:17:28] church I'm I'm just telling you what the
[2:17:30] prophet said so when you see things you

[2:17:46] they enjoy hanging with us sometime but
[2:17:48] they don't want to be with us all the
[2:17:49] time
[2:17:53] now I enjoy hanging with them but I
[2:17:54] don't want to be with them all the
[2:17:57] time

[2:19:38] that one time we had a good time next

[2:20:00] I'm unloading everything I don't know I
[2:20:02] didn't't even know I had all this in me
[2:20:03] to
[2:20:05] unload but God knows he just always keep
[2:20:10] humble
[2:20:12] right everyone in the church has
[2:20:14] something to do don't never pull it
[2:20:16] aside for something else let it blend in
[2:20:20] with the rest to the church is for God
[2:20:24] all things see see don't everybody don't
[2:20:27] everybody now don't everybody want to
[2:20:30] speak with
[2:20:31] tongues and don't everybody want to
[2:20:34] interpret try to do something good and
[2:20:37] just just keep being
[2:20:41] good see interpretation is not just you
[2:20:43] coming up with something off your
[2:20:45] mind no it's it's it's it's you know God
[2:20:49] has kind of giving this to you and I got
[2:20:50] to say it cuz see I'm going to tell you
[2:20:52] again we we sign when we get gifts
[2:20:54] together in the room and I just Lord
[2:20:56] Lord had us moving in that direction
[2:20:58] right before we moved here to this this
[2:20:59] place the devil tried to cut us
[2:21:02] off but you know what God Said I will
[2:21:08] restored we getting ready to walk into
[2:21:11] our own building and all this going to
[2:21:14] be in operation but you know what God
[2:21:16] got to do before we get to the building
[2:21:18] got to get us lined up that's right so
[2:21:21] we don't mishandle things when we get
[2:21:23] into the building we don't go off into
[2:21:28] chaos
[2:21:29] amen I mean it's going to be so normal
[2:21:32] and so natural it's going to happen so
[2:21:34] often that you're going I don't want to
[2:21:35] say that you're going to get used to it
[2:21:36] because brother random never got used to
[2:21:38] when the angel came it always did
[2:21:40] something to him and I want us to always
[2:21:41] feel that reverence of God when he comes

[2:27:44] pastor just
[2:27:46] thinking the restoration
[2:27:50] there was a time a few years
[2:27:52] back there was a brother that I guess he
[2:27:56] he left the message years before before
[2:27:59] I came I only had one conversation with
[2:28:02] him and the Lord Brother right in this
[2:28:05] area the Lord pressed him upon my heart
[2:28:09] in such a
[2:28:11] way that I got his number and I gave him
[2:28:13] a
[2:28:14] call and we spoke probably about an hour
[2:28:18] hour and a half
[2:28:20] the only thing I remember from from that
[2:28:22] conversation he said you know
[2:28:24] brother nobody ever came for
[2:28:28] me and that's what kept him from coming
[2:28:32] back nobody ever came
[2:28:34] for but just that conversation just
[2:28:37] listen to him talk and just let him know
[2:28:40] that he was loved I think it was maybe
[2:28:43] the next week or two weeks he was back
[2:28:47] in the house of the Lord serving the
[2:28:48] lord to this day
