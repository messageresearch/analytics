[10:12] knows the hour the day we don't know
[10:16] what may happen the Lord we trust in you
[10:20] for our anchor Lord holes Lord God
[10:27] beyond the veil we're not depending on
[10:31] nothing on
[10:32] on this side on this side on this
[10:36] dimension but our ankle goes beyond the
[10:40] veil and grips or rock lord god that
[10:43] rock is Jesus Lord Lord offer we know
[10:47] that the thing that we cannot see are
[10:49] more real than the things that we can
[10:51] see we ask you to just minister Lord God
[10:56] to your people or God I pray and I
[10:59] accident blessings in Jesus name Amen
[11:03] amen you may be seated and thank you all
[11:13] for a man coming out
[11:18] I should have pray for me we're gonna
[11:23] continue on in the book of Hebrews try
[11:29] and keep it sort of like a teaching so
[11:31] if we may do some read a man but I'm
[11:35] sure I trust it'll be a blessing to you
[11:37] I tell you about the real blessing to me
[11:38] as I was studying it and just looking
[11:42] through the scriptures like these things
[11:43] a man so let us turn on our bibles we're
[11:48] gonna go right there to Hebrews six
[11:52] Hebrews six and we're gonna pick up at
[12:00] the nineteenth verse couple scriptures
[12:05] there and media after that we're gonna
[12:10] flip over to Genesis 1:26 1:26
[12:19] thank you lord
[12:23] I seen the fraud about amen amen
[12:30] it says which hope we have as an anchor
[12:34] of the soul both sure and steadfast and
[12:42] which entereth into that within the veil
[12:49] whether the forerunner is with us I'm
[12:54] into where the forerunner is for us
[12:56] entered even Jesus made an high priest
[13:00] forever after the order of Melchisedec a
[13:05] man which hope we have as an anchor of
[13:09] the soul both sure and steadfast and
[13:14] which entereth into interest into that
[13:19] within the veil amen in a in the message
[13:24] that our Hebrews the property really
[13:27] starts to break down a man at the veil
[13:30] so we want to speak a moment and we just
[13:33] want to concentrate on the veil this
[13:37] afternoon the veil amen and uh turn to
[13:42] Genesis 1:26 Genesis 1:26
[14:01] a man
[14:06] and God said let us make man in our own
[14:10] image after our likeness and let him
[14:15] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[14:19] over the fowl of the air and over the
[14:23] cattle and over all the earth and over
[14:29] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[14:32] the earth a man and God said let us make
[14:37] man in our image a man now we see in
[14:43] John 4:24 he said that God is a spirit
[14:51] and he that worship Him must worship Him
[14:56] in spirit and in truth so if he made man
[15:02] in his own image what you see with your
[15:08] physical eyes is not the image he was
[15:11] talking about because God is a spirit
[15:16] now if we go over here to the second
[15:19] chapter of Genesis and the seven later
[15:22] on and it says and the Lord God formed
[15:27] man from the dust of the ground and
[15:31] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[15:35] life and he became a living soul so now
[15:41] we see that God made man in His image
[15:47] gave him dominion over the fish of the
[15:52] sea over the fowls of the air over the
[15:57] cattle and over all the earth then later
[16:05] on he took that earth and formed a body
[16:11] so that that spirit
[16:14] Cantwell in there is your veil
[16:19] now we're veiled in a body after the
[16:25] order of melchizedek with well we're not
[16:30] after the autumn eka that he was after
[16:32] the order of melchizedek but just like
[16:34] look at that we were veiled in a body a
[16:37] man now even that he gave us dominion
[16:41] over that body
[16:44] he gave us dominion over that earth he
[16:47] gave us dominion over everything the sea
[16:50] the fowls of the air and everything that
[16:52] creepeth and crawls upon that earth at
[16:55] that time Adam was control in control he
[17:00] was like an amateur God on the earth
[17:04] until the fall took place and we know
[17:08] that everything that the serpent was
[17:11] cursed a man that the woman was cursed
[17:14] and the earth was cursed a man and
[17:18] that's when the death set in at his body
[17:23] and things changed for Adam at that time
[17:31] Adam had the ability because he knew who
[17:36] he was he had the ability he knew what
[17:41] God wanted him to do and what God didn't
[17:45] wanted to do but after that he had an
[17:49] enemy because that veil was no longer
[17:56] sanctified because it was cursed now he
[18:01] had to fight his literal self his own
[18:06] flesh and we're veiled this even the
[18:14] Prophet said here the veil is the flesh
[18:19] and the veil is what keeps us
[18:24] from seeing God face-to-face in my
[18:29] listen he says in this church the veil
[18:33] is what keeps us from seeing the angels
[18:40] now I want to say that like this in this
[18:43] church the veil is what keeps us from
[18:49] physically seeing that angels at every
[18:54] chair we know that the Bible says that
[19:00] our and Hebrews that he will never leave
[19:06] us nor forsake us now we hear that but
[19:13] our faith has to to take us beyond the
[19:19] veil to see that he's right there with
[19:24] us all the time we see that the
[19:27] scripture says in Psalms 34 several
[19:31] tonight that the angels of the Lord are
[19:33] encamped around about those who fear Him
[19:38] that means that there are literal angels
[19:44] encamped around you everywhere you go
[19:51] but the veil hinders you from seeing it
[19:58] we're in a veil of flesh this flesh this
[20:04] body is was is is can only contact this
[20:09] earth these five senses of see taste
[20:15] smell touch and hearing to give us
[20:19] contact with this earth in this
[20:24] dimension and well see in our in our and
[20:29] in some in our minds that we want to
[20:32] think that here we know that God is
[20:35] always watching
[20:37] but we put God on a throne way above
[20:40] somewhere and say that he's looking down
[20:44] and he's watching everybody know he is
[20:49] right next to you you just can't see him
[20:56] he is right besides you as you travel
[21:01] the highways the prophet of God was
[21:04] talking about he says up that accident
[21:09] that you barely avoided God was
[21:16] literally not figuratively right there
[21:23] we have to be able to open our eyes
[21:28] these are the things that a prophet was
[21:34] able to see and Express to us in this
[21:39] hour that if we can ever get a
[21:42] revelation that it's not some far-off
[21:47] mystical something other that it is
[21:51] literally right here God is here there
[21:56] are angels here right now right now and
[22:03] he wants to shine a light from it looks
[22:09] like wonderful to see people have a mind
[22:12] and a thirst to come to the house of the
[22:16] Lord I believe we ought to come to
[22:20] church five days a week and go to church
[22:23] go to work two things and a perfect
[22:27] society that's the way it could have a
[22:29] much better society that would be all
[22:32] right with me because he when I come to
[22:35] the house of the Lord it gives an
[22:37] opportunity for the light of the gospel
[22:39] to shine on the dark places of my life
[22:44] so that I have an opportunity
[22:49] to repeat and once I repent that literal
[22:57] body is there on the mercy seat making
[23:02] intercession and it is cast into the sea
[23:05] does forgetfulness never to be
[23:08] remembered no more never to be seen so
[23:13] anytime oh Lord I can be in the presence
[23:19] of Almighty God just show up the dark
[23:21] places I remember as a child we used to
[23:25] go to the dentist we go to the dentist's
[23:28] you had your shoe this red dye appear to
[23:33] show all of those places where you
[23:35] haven't been rushing to good and you
[23:41] chew it up - thank you my man I've done
[23:43] like I got ended I knew I was coming to
[23:45] the dentist today so I well I got got
[23:48] all in it true that look I feel you show
[23:52] you - look mirror oh boy
[23:55] what it shows the places that you list
[24:00] that you might unknowingly shine a light
[24:06] on those spaces that you need to give a
[24:09] little more attention
[24:10] how many that glad for that all we won't
[24:15] it's funny to hear him say well done my
[24:21] good and faithful servant
[24:23] so God who is rich in mercy gives us
[24:30] each day another opportunity to be in
[24:34] his presence so that he can fellowship
[24:38] with us that was his desire in the
[24:41] beginning every evening he came down and
[24:45] he's a Adam if they fellowship in the
[24:48] cool of the evening see
[24:52] the children of Israel in the wilderness
[24:57] they had to eat of the vent of the manna
[25:01] every day they couldn't save it it had
[25:06] to be fresh every day a revelation had
[25:12] to come every day they had to feed on
[25:16] the provided word every day and we can't
[25:24] get a revelation or something one time
[25:27] and think that that is going to sustain
[25:31] us it has to be a fellowshipping around
[25:39] the things of God every day every day we
[25:46] wake up every day before we lay out here
[25:50] to bed we must spend time with the Lord
[25:54] to show the dark places always abiding
[26:01] in the things of the Lord amen now we
[26:06] talking about this veil
[26:09] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[26:11] the angels at their position standing by
[26:14] the seats what keeps us from seeing him
[26:18] we are here behind a veil behind a veil
[26:23] and that veil is flesh we are sons and
[26:28] daughters of God we're in the presence
[26:31] of God amen but the veil of flesh is
[26:37] what keeps us out of his presence but
[26:42] through the soul and the spirit by our
[26:45] faith we know he's watching us and he's
[26:50] standing right beside us and he's here
[26:56] now
[27:01] let us look at second Kings the sixth
[27:06] chapter in the seventeenth verse a man
[27:11] second King six chapter 17 verse
[27:29] Reed's here and Elijah prayed and said
[27:33] Lord I pray thee that she opened his
[27:41] eyes well let me go back so I can lay a
[27:44] little platform here of what I'm talking
[27:46] about
[27:46] I meant to start from the egg and the
[27:50] king of Syria award against Israel and
[27:52] took counsel with the surface saying in
[27:54] such and such a place shall be my camp
[27:58] and the man of God sent into the king of
[28:01] Israel saying beware thou pass not such
[28:05] a place for the Syrians are come down
[28:10] and the king of Israel to the place
[28:12] which the man of God told him and warned
[28:14] him of and saved himself there not once
[28:20] nor twice therefore the heart of the
[28:23] king of the Syria was so troubled and
[28:25] the king and he called his servants and
[28:29] said unto them will ye show me which of
[28:34] us is the king of Israel and one of the
[28:37] servants said non my lord o king but
[28:40] Elisha the prophet and that is an Israel
[28:44] tell us the king of Israel the words
[28:46] that thou speaketh in my bedchamber and
[28:49] he said go and spy where he is and that
[28:55] I may sin and bring and bring him and it
[29:00] he was told him saying behold he is in
[29:04] Dothan therefore he said to the horses
[29:08] and chariots and great hopes and they
[29:11] came by night and compassed about the
[29:13] city and when the servant of the man and
[29:17] of God was risen early and gone forth
[29:21] behold a host compassed about the city
[29:23] both with horses and chariots and his
[29:27] servants saying unto Him alas my master
[29:30] how shall we do and he said fear not for
[29:36] they that be with us are more than they
[29:40] that be with them
[29:42] and Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray
[29:45] thee open his eyes that he may see and
[29:49] the Lord opened his eyes and the young
[29:52] man of the young man and he saw and
[29:56] behold the mountain was full of horses
[29:59] and chariots of fire round about Elijah
[30:04] and when they came down to him Elijah
[30:07] prayed unto the Lord and said smite
[30:11] these people are crazy with blindness
[30:14] and he smoked them with blindness
[30:18] according to the Word of God now we see
[30:21] two things happen here
[30:23] he took the veil from the young man's
[30:26] eyes or he can see that there were
[30:31] Church that the angels was encamped
[30:33] around them and then he turned around
[30:36] and blood in his enemy so they couldn't
[30:39] find it now isn't that a perfect type of
[30:44] what's going on today the veil is being
[30:49] ripped moved from I that we may see
[30:52] Christ and others that continue to
[30:59] scholars and marking and continue to
[31:03] hold to their Creed's are continually
[31:07] being blinded continually being blinded
[31:12] let us look at Luke 24 Luke 24 chapter
[31:17] xiii verse
[31:25] amen
[31:45] Luke 24:13 amen and behold two of them
[31:51] went the same day to a village called
[31:55] Emmaus which was from Jerusalem of about
[32:01] threescore furlongs and they talked
[32:05] together of all the things which had
[32:09] happened
[32:10] and it came to pass that while they
[32:14] commune together and reason Jesus
[32:21] himself drew near and went with him and
[32:28] went with them but their eyes were
[32:31] holding that they should not know him
[32:35] and he said unto them what manner of
[32:40] communication are these that ye have one
[32:44] with another as you walk and our sad and
[32:48] one of them whose name was Cleopas
[32:52] answering saying unto him thou art thou
[32:57] only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not
[33:01] known the things which are come to pass
[33:04] there in these days and he said unto
[33:09] them what things and they say unto Him
[33:16] concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a
[33:19] prophet mighty in deed and were and word
[33:24] and before God and all the people and
[33:28] not a chief priests and our rulers
[33:31] delivered him to be condemned to death
[33:34] and have crucified Him but we trust we
[33:39] trusted that he had been trusted that it
[33:44] had been he which should have redeemed
[33:47] Israel and besides all this today is the
[33:53] third day since these things were done
[33:57] yeah and certain woman also of our
[34:01] company made an astonished which were
[34:06] early at the cell feature the supporter
[34:11] and when they found found not his body
[34:15] and came saying that they had also seen
[34:18] a vision of angels which said that he
[34:24] was alive and certain of them which were
[34:29] with us went into the supporter and
[34:32] found it even so as the woman has said
[34:36] but it about him they saw not and they
[34:42] said unto them o food and slow of heart
[34:46] to believe all that the prophets have
[34:49] spoken all not Christ have suffered
[34:52] these things and to enter into his glory
[34:56] and being and beginning at Moses and all
[35:03] the prophets he expounded unto them all
[35:06] the scriptures and things concerning
[35:10] himself and they drew near unto him drew
[35:15] near unto the village whether they went
[35:18] and he and he made as that as though he
[35:22] would have gone further but they
[35:25] constrained him saying abide with us for
[35:30] it is toward evening and the day is far
[35:33] spent and he went in to tarry with them
[35:37] and it came to pass as he sat at meet
[35:42] with them he took bread and blessed it
[35:45] and brake it and gave it to them and
[35:50] when their and their eyes were opened
[35:53] and they knew him and he vanished from
[35:57] their sight and they said one to another
[36:02] didn't our hearts burn within us while
[36:05] he talked to us by the wayside and while
[36:08] he opened to us
[36:10] description Amen so we see that these
[36:14] two fellows the first thing is that they
[36:18] was walking and they were fellowship and
[36:22] around the things of the Lord they
[36:24] wasn't just have a no idle conversation
[36:27] but they was astonished at the things
[36:30] that had happened and they was just
[36:33] reminiscent of the good old days when
[36:37] Jesus walked the earth and the things
[36:39] that he done fellowship and around the
[36:42] things of God and in the midst of that
[36:45] conversation
[36:47] the Lord Droon in when you yourself
[36:52] fellowshipping with one another talking
[36:55] which was with one another and having
[36:58] conversation and your conversation is on
[37:01] the Lord there's no mistake about it my
[37:05] brothers and sister he draws near many
[37:09] times when you you are talking to
[37:12] different ones and different things you
[37:15] can feel a man the atmosphere change
[37:18] during the conversation that is when he
[37:23] drew right in and joined into the
[37:25] conversation a man a man
[37:43] stinking not giving a given a testimony
[37:47] a man
[37:53] let's go to
[37:58] the message reaction to an action 5908
[38:06] 10 a man 59 0 18 and I'm a depend on you
[38:15] but so I don't have to look at it in my
[38:16] phone I don't have a little fancy gadget
[38:19] okay the flip and things like that but I
[38:21] get there I'm sorry paragraph 28
[38:32] a man you love the Lord Amen what I'm
[38:36] trying to get us a seat search is that
[38:40] the promise we hid in this veil but we
[38:43] we must use our faith eyes to look
[38:48] beyond the veil and see what's really
[38:50] going on around it meant to see what God
[38:56] is trying to give us - Amen that a man
[39:01] and that it's when we come to church and
[39:04] become the church
[39:05] let's not come to church lackluster
[39:08] let's not come to church as it's just
[39:11] another service because the God is here

[40:27] us it is just a veil that we we use to
[40:31] go to work and to contact things on this
[40:35] earth in this realm but we have to be
[40:41] able to to
[40:44] by faith go beyond this veil where we're
[40:50] seated in heavenly places with Christ
[40:52] Jesus and have a revelation of that and

[45:12] time God is putting you through a test
[45:21] the Prophet was talking about how he I
[45:25] think he worked out but he was talking
[45:27] about this uh pipe Factory and and and
[45:30] in the pipe factory they make these
[45:32] pipes and they have to pressure test
[45:34] these pipes and so they take these pipes
[45:37] and me put caps on them and they fill
[45:41] them with so many pounds of pressure and
[45:42] if that pipe fell and he throw it to the
[45:46] trash she put it up on depression

[45:57] pressure God is he he was here he was
[46:02] testing the shooting my woman he was
[46:04] watching to see how she react
[46:07] putting her in a situation to see what
[46:12] was she gonna trust God or not when God
[46:18] is dealing with you and putting you
[46:20] under that pressure he is getting ready
[46:23] to use you for something he is getting
[46:28] ready to give you a testimony and he's
[46:32] just cuz everything must be tried and
[46:35] proven he said bring me gold tried in
[46:39] the fire hey man that he may they use
[46:44] it's a revelation let's let's read that
[46:46] I think me see if I got it written down
[46:48] here
[46:57] and I don't think idea a man but he
[47:01] talked about their revelation gold
[47:03] trying to fight and he said by of UI
[47:05] sounds a man that he put on your eyes
[47:10] that your eyes may be open and see he
[47:15] was talking about their that they used
[47:18] school Greeks back in his day when your
[47:20] eyes let's go to go it to the heart
[47:25] system go to the heart 5801 12 evening
[47:32] paragraph 20 5801 12 the paragraph 20
[47:52] a man we have to look beyond the veil a
[47:56] man
[48:01] that's when Christians get sore eyes now
[48:05] we going to get in who thinks it when
[48:08] they're asleep and the things of the
[48:11] world their eyes get sore you look at
[48:15] too much television maybe into how it
[48:18] take makes your eye sore and we use to
[48:23] make all this grease and and rub it
[48:27] massage it into the eyes and until their
[48:31] eyes come open oh but just in the
[48:35] spiritual realm God has some holy oil
[48:39] the Holy Spirit and it massages the
[48:44] heart with the power of his resurrection
[48:49] until the spiritual eyes can fly open
[48:53] and see the glory of the Lord oh how we
[48:59] need an a massaging that our eyes of our
[49:04] understanding might be open then another
[49:11] thing when our eyes come open you can
[49:14] see you might hear but your eyes come
[49:17] open you can see and then when the eye
[49:23] is oak and the eyes open up we can see
[49:27] the goodness of the Lord
[49:29] there's many times God has walked with
[49:32] you he kept you from that ray
[49:40] and man that's all right
[49:43] he kept you from that Rick he brought
[49:45] you from that hospital and you go on as
[49:50] if who was like that hog under the apple
[49:53] tree that's a southern expression you
[49:57] know that hog under the apple tree the
[50:00] apples were beat down on his head all
[50:03] day long and he will just grab them and
[50:06] eat them and never look up to see where
[50:09] they're coming from that's the way many
[50:13] Christians do all the blessings of the
[50:16] Lord falling all around them and they
[50:18] never get on their knees to recognize
[50:21] that it comes from God
[50:24] say what a pity amen so we see that that
[50:31] was angels are always with us
[50:33] a man says now watch close now God swore
[50:42] oh oh
[50:44] which hope that we have as an anchor of
[50:48] the soul both steadfast which entrance
[50:51] into it which which the Veil the veil
[50:58] God came down veiled in flesh to do what
[51:04] to show himself they meant he had to
[51:09] hide because he couldn't see him and he
[51:13] hid behind that veil and the veil was
[51:17] who Jesus not me that doeth the work but
[51:22] my father he said My father dwelleth in
[51:25] me I were the father that worketh and I
[51:31] work is here Oh - here he is here here
[51:37] he is a the veiled one walking in the
[51:41] flesh God Emmanuel God with us
[51:43] God was in Christ reconciling the word
[51:47] to himself here he is walking around now
[51:53] he came down and made a sanctification
[51:57] a provision appropriation that through
[52:01] his death offered pay the price of sin
[52:06] that he might come by and dwelling us
[52:09] again then the faith that he is a veiled
[52:16] see then the faith that we have is a
[52:21] veiled faith or a veiled person
[52:26] therefore we don't look at the things
[52:29] that we see in this Veil the veil this
[52:33] rail has education these things speak
[52:37] it's a scientific thing but the Spirit
[52:41] of the Living God dwells in here calls
[52:45] those things which are not as though
[52:48] they were if God said so there there is
[52:54] your veiling when it is now someday he
[53:00] raised his veil up not born of a woman
[53:04] by sexual desire a man a man we see Amen
[53:09] blow it out a blessing there we see that
[53:14] he came down in that veil let's turn to
[53:17] Roman's 6 chapter a man Romans 6 chapter
[53:36] Romans the seats chat
[53:53] amen and remember when we was biting
[53:55] Genesis and we said you read the
[53:59] scripture and that he's God made us in
[54:03] his image of the Spirit amen and then he
[54:07] failed us in flesh okay so it says here
[54:13] what shall we say then shall we continue
[54:16] in sin that grace may abound god forbid
[54:22] how shall we that are god forbid how
[54:27] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[54:30] longer therein know ye not that so many
[54:37] of us know you not that so many of us as
[54:43] were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[54:46] baptized into his death therefore we are
[54:49] buried with him by baptism unto and to
[54:53] death that like as Christ was raised up
[54:57] from the dead by the glory of the Father
[55:00] even so we also should walk in the
[55:04] newness of life for if we have been
[55:07] planted together in the likeness of his
[55:10] death we shall also be in the likeness
[55:13] of his resurrection knowing this that
[55:16] our old man is crucified with him that
[55:19] the body of sin might be destroyed and
[55:23] henceforth we should not serve sin now I
[55:27] want to stop there and I want to go back
[55:29] and I want to say quickly remember that
[55:32] he gave he gave Adam Dominion and I made
[55:39] a point thank you brother
[55:40] I made a point to emphasize he gave him
[55:43] dominion over the earth he gave him
[55:48] dominion over his over his own faculties
[55:51] and over his body but we see here that
[55:54] knowing is that the old man is crucified
[55:55] with him that the body of sin might be
[55:58] destroyed that here for he shall not
[56:01] serve sin
[56:05] and he that is dead is free from sin now
[56:10] if we be dead with Christ we believe
[56:12] that we shall also live with him knowing
[56:17] that Christ being raised from the dead
[56:19] dies no more death has no more dominion
[56:23] over him
[56:25] see when the fall we've lost that
[56:27] Dominion but the the reconciliation of
[56:31] Christ amen
[56:34] through the resurrection amen
[56:39] reconciled us back with them because the
[56:41] price was paid he came down and
[56:45] manifested himself in our human flesh
[56:49] amen so that he can pay the penalty of
[56:52] sin so that we might be able to enjoy
[56:56] the riches and fullness of life with him
[57:00] Dave man but he had to be veiled in the
[57:04] sinner and that human flesh that same
[57:05] failed a man that are free from sin now
[57:14] if we be dead in Christ believe that we
[57:16] also live with him knowing that Christ
[57:20] being raised from the day it dies no
[57:23] more death has no more dominion over him
[57:25] for in that he died he died unto sin
[57:29] once but in that he lived he liveth unto
[57:34] God likewise reckon ye also yourselves
[57:37] to be dead indeed unto sin but alive
[57:41] unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord
[57:46] let not sin therefore reign in your
[57:49] mortal body that you should obey it in
[57:53] the lusts thereof neither yield your
[57:56] members as instruments of
[57:57] unrighteousness or to seeing but yield
[58:01] yourselves unto God as those that are
[58:04] alive from alive from dead and I'm sorry
[58:12] unto unto seeing don't get rich
[58:16] neither year your members as instruments
[58:18] of unrighteousness unto seeing but yield
[58:21] yourselves unto God as those that are
[58:24] alive from the dead and your members as
[58:27] instruments of righteousness unto God
[58:31] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[58:36] for ye are not under the law but grace
[58:40] what then shall we sin because what then
[58:44] shall we sin because we are not under
[58:48] the law but under grace he says god
[58:51] forbid
[58:52] know ye not that to whom ye yourselves
[58:56] servants to obey his servants ye are to
[59:01] whom ye obey whether of sin unto death
[59:05] or of obedience unto righteousness but
[59:11] God be thankful that he were servants of
[59:15] sin but ye have obeyed from the heart
[59:18] that the doctrine which was delivered
[59:21] you being then made free from sin ye
[59:25] became servants of righteousness I speak
[59:29] after the manner of men because of the
[59:31] infirmity of your flesh for as ye have
[59:36] yielded your members servants to
[59:38] uncleanness and to iniquity unto
[59:42] iniquity even so now yield your members
[59:45] and servants unto righteousness unto
[59:47] holiness for when ye are the servants of
[59:52] sin you were free from righteousness
[59:56] what fruit haggi then what fruit had ye
[1:00:03] then in those things thereof hee
[1:00:07] wherefore ye are not ashamed amen
[1:00:12] so what fruit if you have in those
[1:00:14] things well ye are now ashamed from the
[1:00:18] end of those things is death but now
[1:00:21] being made free from sin and both
[1:00:25] service to God he have your fruit on
[1:00:29] holiness and the N is everlasting life
[1:00:32] for the wages of sin is death but the
[1:00:37] gift of God is eternal life through
[1:00:39] Christ Jesus our Lord amen so we see
[1:00:45] Church that these members that that God
[1:00:51] gave was dominion over at one time this
[1:00:53] freshly veiled
[1:00:54] a man in the garden at the fall we lost
[1:00:58] a minion we lost control of it a man but
[1:01:02] see through the reconciliation of Christ
[1:01:04] he came down and veiled himself amen in
[1:01:06] this same flesh and paid the penalty of
[1:01:09] sin and give us an opportunity amen that
[1:01:13] we had Dominion once again over this
[1:01:16] earth through Christ Jesus amen but it's
[1:01:21] going to take a man our faith and it's
[1:01:23] going to take a revelation a man is
[1:01:27] going to take us a a constant renewing
[1:01:30] of our spirit amen to be able to
[1:01:33] overcome this flesh amen because if we
[1:01:37] don't feed on the things of God and stay
[1:01:40] in his presence let me take yourself in
[1:01:42] this fellatio this place should take you
[1:01:45] over amen because it's sinful it's
[1:01:51] sinful and until it drop off amen and we
[1:01:56] take on a new body we're gonna have to
[1:01:59] fight we're gonna have to fight until we
[1:02:02] leave here we're gonna have to fight
[1:02:04] until we leave here but the the the the
[1:02:06] the price have been paid the price has
[1:02:09] been paid he had he has no more no more
[1:02:14] sting of a man of the the he stuck his
[1:02:18] finger in in the wrong one and and and
[1:02:22] and it's over with a man so it's
[1:02:25] appointed on the man wants to die amen
[1:02:28] and that death has already taken place
[1:02:30] see but what he didn't realize that that
[1:02:34] one had that the the ability to raise
[1:02:36] himself up amen and
[1:02:38] and when he rose up heroes us up with
[1:02:41] him a man he paid the penalty so my
[1:02:45] whole point you know it's just let's let
[1:02:47] us let us crucify this flesh a man
[1:02:53] Crewson crucify this flesh and and just
[1:02:59] get out of the veil and be able to look
[1:03:02] beyond it there because he we have a
[1:03:05] representation of representation above a
[1:03:10] man to see everything that the very fact
[1:03:15] that you hear the very fact that God
[1:03:18] called you and if you have a mind to
[1:03:21] serve the law show that you have a
[1:03:23] representation from above a man that
[1:03:28] this is just a this is just your veil
[1:03:30] but you have a real representation on
[1:03:33] the other side a man that is waiting for
[1:03:36] you to just step right into it just
[1:03:38] waiting for you to step right into it
[1:03:41] it'll happen either by death or even or
[1:03:44] by by the rapture but this this this is
[1:03:49] corruption of put on this mortal put on
[1:03:52] immortality
[1:03:53] amen it will step into another body amen
[1:03:57] that don't have these same feelings and
[1:04:00] have these same hang-ups and things that
[1:04:03] we have to go through here on this earth
[1:04:05] amen so just continue to love one
[1:04:08] another a man with all your heart love
[1:04:13] the Lord with all your heart amen and
[1:04:16] this and and and to just look at one
[1:04:20] another see one another but look beyond
[1:04:26] the veil we have to in even in the
[1:04:31] situations that we go through we have to
[1:04:34] be able to look beyond the situation
[1:04:39] look beyond the situation it may look
[1:04:42] like it's one thing in front of us but
[1:04:43] see God is doing something in that
[1:04:46] situation we have to find we have to
[1:04:49] find a purpose of God in every
[1:04:52] thing we'd go through there's a purpose
[1:04:56] there you may have balls maybe giving
[1:05:02] you a hard time of something you may be
[1:05:04] going through that got you just upset
[1:05:05] stand back
[1:05:07] find the purpose of God in that thing
[1:05:09] because this death he's watching you
[1:05:12] it's just a test and anytime anytime he
[1:05:20] sees fit to put you through a situation
[1:05:23] to put you in a pressure cooker he's
[1:05:27] doing it because he has something for
[1:05:32] you to do but you must be tested
[1:05:42] reminded of the situation there with the
[1:05:45] Prophet how Cathy's young couple and
[1:05:53] they was acting all unseemly they're in
[1:05:56] the house of Lord trying to distract
[1:05:59] them and just it's being very rude and
[1:06:02] in the service and the angel of the Lord
[1:06:05] spoke to the prophet and said they're in
[1:06:07] your hands
[1:06:08] you can do what whatever you say
[1:06:11] whatever you speak it'll happen
[1:06:15] and he said I forgive you he passed it
[1:06:21] to him it was a test God was testing him
[1:06:26] to see if I can trust you with this
[1:06:29] power I can trust you with this it was a
[1:06:35] test even the Prophet had to go through
[1:06:38] the pray was in the pressure cooker the
[1:06:42] we're and the pressure cooker as well
[1:06:44] he's always there that's my that's the
[1:06:48] whole if I don't get nothing across
[1:06:49] that's the whole point that I wanted to
[1:06:52] get across that he's here he's here he's
[1:06:56] here he's always with you he's always
[1:07:01] watching you he's always caring for you
[1:07:05] he's always taking you through but we
[1:07:11] have to be able to get out of this and
[1:07:15] look beyond the situation that's in
[1:07:18] front of us get out of flesh
[1:07:25] have tomato communist if you've gone
[1:07:27] through something and or somebody upsets
[1:07:30] you what you take five minutes you say a
[1:07:35] five minutes first and any changes they
[1:07:37] pray for seven minutes for that person
[1:07:41] your heart to change just seven minutes
[1:07:46] he said God may show you something that
[1:07:48] that person is going through and you
[1:07:52] have compassion for and you have
[1:07:56] compassion for God maybe wanting to use
[1:07:59] you to help that person out of a
[1:08:04] situation see Saints we talking about
[1:08:07] adoption here we're talking about let's
[1:08:09] go on to perfection
[1:08:10] we all of us have a job to do as the
[1:08:17] body of Christ
[1:08:18] brothers answers your life your daily
[1:08:24] walk your daily life you it is you are a
[1:08:30] representation of you you are God all
[1:08:34] two feet God wants to be here again in
[1:08:41] this veil through us but we have to we
[1:08:48] have to get out of our carnal thinking
[1:08:51] that's why we have to keep our minds
[1:08:54] renewed daily on the way because he God
[1:08:59] has a way and and and and I'm a witness
[1:09:02] to this he has a way of the very thing
[1:09:04] you could be studying something you can
[1:09:06] we just go through the Bible or whatever
[1:09:08] you could be listening at a message and
[1:09:09] and you can something I message that

[1:20:55] gonna give a test a quick testimony and
[1:21:00] I want to go back and do that testimony
[1:21:05] I was what I was going to say I remember
[1:21:10] when I'm talking about
[1:21:16] the presence of God being being with us
[1:21:23] you know sometime
[1:21:26] you don't have to say a word
[1:21:30] just show presence in the atmosphere
[1:21:32] that you bring and have an effect I was
[1:21:38] in a Baxley condition
[1:21:41] and
[1:21:45] it was doing just a Brown's mother
[1:21:48] birthday celebration and we were invited
[1:21:53] myself and my wife
[1:21:55] he wasn't serving the law and but of
[1:21:59] course you know you know I should do a
[1:22:02] lot of work for and things like that so
[1:22:04] he was glad to come to the birthday
[1:22:06] celebration and I had no idea that
[1:22:10] brother free it was gonna be there and I
[1:22:16] didn't even see him and we were just
[1:22:19] sitting up I think I was sitting at the
[1:22:22] table with myself and brother Jack and
[1:22:25] brother Willie we sitting there just and
[1:22:30] brother Freddie came and tapped me on
[1:22:32] the shoulder and I turned around and he
[1:22:37] looked at me and never said a word but I
[1:22:43] saw the concern in his eyes and
[1:22:47] immediately conviction fell on me
[1:22:50] we need a conviction fellow me I just
[1:22:53] dropped my head my my head I said
[1:22:55] brother Fred I'm sorry man
[1:22:57] he said man he said dog I'll hold you
[1:23:03] responsible for your family
[1:23:07] they say he's not going he can hold he
[1:23:09] can blame you
[1:23:10] he gonna hold you responsible but just
[1:23:15] in his presence he didn't have to say a
[1:23:17] word to him he just looked at me and the
[1:23:22] countenance on his face and the look in
[1:23:24] his eyes was enough and I just dropped
[1:23:27] my head in my collar
[1:23:29] I apologized to him he said man just
[1:23:33] he's offended and he told me to say well

[1:23:37] come come up the Carolina I paid for
[1:23:40] come for a week I got you just come on
[1:23:44] just come on just come on but it was
[1:23:47] that little thing knows the love that he
[1:23:50] displayed and that at that time that
[1:23:53] began to soften my heart it soften my
[1:23:58] heart so that was the whole point of me
[1:24:02] sometimes you don't have to say a word
[1:24:05] but if that spirit that dwells in you
[1:24:09] and you have the rice sphere towards
[1:24:12] your brother and towards those that are
[1:24:15] lost sometimes you don't have to say
[1:24:18] nothing okay man hey man
[1:24:23] a man let his brothers come
[1:24:25] I feel like the devil took that test him
[1:24:27] on the front I wanted to beat and grit
[1:24:29] it I wanted to get it on now you love
[1:24:34] the Lord and that's how the church
[1:24:37] that's how I want to be my life I want
[1:24:41] my life to be so you know dedicated to
[1:24:46] him that sometimes I don't even have to
[1:24:50] see that but just my presence alone and
[1:24:52] bring the presence of Almighty God into
[1:24:54] whatever situation I mean and people
[1:24:58] know that you know it's something
[1:25:01] different just happens somebody
