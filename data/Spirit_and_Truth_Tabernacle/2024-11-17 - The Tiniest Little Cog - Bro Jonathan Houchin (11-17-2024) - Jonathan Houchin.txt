that you'd done we wouldn't be where we are today I said you impacted my life you impacted my family's life you impacted our Church's life you you have done a a a wonderful service and I say man of God we just want to say thank you for your service thank you so much and I told them I said I know that the doctors have given us a specific report I said but you have preached faith in us that even now we can't doubt uh so we only pray and just ask that the Lord say even while there's breath in your body we're going to ask God to bring healing to you but if he chooses not to we accept it and we understand that there's a great reward waiting for you so uh I told the family say he's in a winwin situation praise God praise God and so amen we will we'll certainly be looking forward to seeing him

there but uh we'll be coming back amen um I'm looking at changing my flight to try to get back a little earlier than what I had plan uh that way I'll be around for anything that the family needs uh over this you know this this these upcoming weeks amen so just keep us in prayer that the Lord would just give us a traveling mercies as we go amen and we certainly keep the meetings and prayer that God would just give us strength to get through the meetings even our going to Australia is because of brother Wesco brother Wesco did that he's the one that recommended and um and God has opened doors so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm grateful and I remember Sister Wesco was telling to say there was one place that he he had gone a lot of places but it one place he wanted to go real bad and that was Australia and um so uh he he got that opportunity he went years ago and and by him going he opened the door for other ministers to be able to come in and and I am one benefiting from the steps that he has taken amen we stand on great shoulders amen we stand on great shoulders and uh we're very very grateful amen for that praise the Lord I'm going to have to change that I might cuz brother brother brother Jonathan might not be able to to do that one amen he speak it speak what y'all doing amazing graceful but my friend is here um brother Jonathan and his precious wife sister Sarah uh there is um we connect on a lot of levels amen and um uh brother Jonathan if y'all don't know by now but he's one of my my golf buddies amen man and and when we when I first met him they came down here for some

started thinking just maybe maybe a little bit of confirmation give me something you know that sister started singing that song I believe she was was that you sister believe you were saying that Satan was fighting you on today but it had to be today because he knew I was going to be standing back there and I needed to hear that all right our victories are coming someday but I believe that it was also written all right that my victory can be today amen my god brother Wesco passed away Thursday morning yes sir I know there's going to be a lot of people that say that brother Wesco lost his life he didn't lose anything his victory day came Thursday morning praise God I'm jealous of brother Wesco that's right brother amen amen amen my God Mercy I could preach a sermon before we even preach a sermon I want to just say to brother Jack thank you for having me it's always such a privilege to stand in front of you people Glory GL the relationship that me and brother Jack have developed over the last few years it just it's just the Lord am that's all I can say it's just the Lord that relationship the relationship I've I've developed with with this church and um I tell you what if we could turn to Romans 8 we're going to read 26 to 30 we're going to read a little bit of the scripture while you're turning brother brother Jack had mentioned that I'm from Jeffersonville which I think most of you know it's always interesting when you tell somebody if you're from Jeffersonville the different responses that you'll get from different people yes sir and uh some people you know they really want to come to Jeffersonville they want to they want to see see the sight see the see the different things and other people will almost turn their nose up to you like you think you're something just because you're from Jeffersonville and it's just it's it's interesting but we have we had a family um about a month or so ago that they were wanting to come to Jeffersonville they hadn't been there in more than 30 years and I asked them I said uh you know do you want me to take take you around to just some of the sites and you know maybe see if I can get us into the Tabernacle to to to you know uh look around and uh so they were like yeah that would be great so one of the places that I took them was to um the candy store shimps yes sir I'm sure most of you are familiar with shimps and as I was walking around there and I was kind of letting them do their thing and I walked into the back and in the back they've got like this room set up and it's it's just um it's got a bunch of artifacts in it just from that area from the the years that have passed how long that candy store has been there and as I was looking around and I was thinking you know because it's it's it's a museum basically is what it is and I started thinking that that's what the message has become to so many people it's become a museum right just full of artifacts all right and I started thinking I was so thankful to the Lord that he gave me eyes to see that this message was more than just a candy store right it was more than just a building at aan Pin all right it was more than just a bubbling brook all right he gave me the eyes to see that this message was Jesus Christ revealed to us I was so thankful for that glory amen what a message we have that's right brother that's right amen Romans 8:26 to30 likewise the spirit also help helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did pre predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified I'd also like for you to turn to John 16 we're going to read 23 and 24 John 16:23 and 24 and in that day we shall ask ye shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you whether to have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full we're going to turn to one more place we're going to read Mark 9 20 to 27 Mark 9:20 to 27 Lord and they besought him and they besought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this Came Upon came unto him and he said of a child and often oftimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou can't do anything have compassion on us and help us Jesus said unto him if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straight way the father of the the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief when Jesus saw the people came running together he rebuked the foul Spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit I charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead in so much that many said he is dead but Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose let's pray dear heavenly father Lord as we're gathered into this this building once again father Lord as we're relying not upon a man but we're relying upon your promise that you would be here father Lord I just pray father that even now you would just take every spirit in this building under your control father Lord if there be any unbelief or or doubt father I pray that you would just move it out of the way Lord Lord as I heard your Prophet this morning saying how we can't help but those doubting spirits to to to enter into our mind but as the farmer said I've got a double double barrel shotgun that can keep him from roosting father father I pray that we bring out those double barrel shotguns those spiritual ones this morning Father Lord if there be any doubt father I pray that we empty both barrels into them right here now father may may there be nothing that hinders this service father Lord may your will be done father as my brother was praying may you help me Father get myself completely out of the way that you can take complete control father May everything that's said and done be pleasing to you father may it be in your perfect will Lord May our eyes stay fixed upon Calvary father Lord we thank you and we love you for all that you do in Jesus Christ I pray amen amen you can be seated thank you so my my sermon title this morning is the tiniest Cog and uh I know brother Bram talked about the cogs and how when they line up you know things have got to happen right and I want to take this thought about these cogs and I'm going to let's go a little little deeper with them and uh I'm going to start off by telling you the way a watch works so I was Sarah and I was walking around uh Downtown Disney this has actually been I don't know what six months ago or so and uh we were here um what way were you here for the night of worship and um yes and so so we were walking around and I walk into a a watch place there and uh I told the the the there was a lady standing there I told her I said I want somebody that can talk to me about how a watch works and I want to know every detail about it and just as I said that this man walks out and she looks and she said this is your man right here and and so she's explaining to him what I'm looking for and he was like oh you've come to the right place you know I love to talk about watches all right and so as he starts to tell me and you know and he starts talking and I'm just just W just taking in what he's saying you know but the way a watch works so there's different cogs or some call gear some some may call them gears gears cogs same thing brother Bram referred to them as cogs some people will call them gears so we're going to say cogs so the a watch is made up of different cogs some are small some are medium some are large they all have these little teeth on them and they they enter lock and the smallest Cog can make a medium Cog move which can make the larger Cog move a tiny little Cog can turn and make that larger Cog move that's how they're designed okay now the main Cog is always the biggest Cog in the watch that's the one that actually controls it keeps the time it it's what controls the watch okay it cannot do anything until that smaller Cog starts to move so nothing will happen in that watch unless that smaller Cog it can be the tiniest Cog but until that tiny Cog starts to move the main Cog can't do anything God now these time pieces this was very interesting these time pieces were originally made for ship okay now as a ship is traveling and it has a direction and they know how fast they're going they have to watch this time piece because once they hit a certain time they have to know to turn they've got to know which direction they're going and they've got to turn at that specific moment brother amen if they don't turn at that specific moment right they could be lost at sea forever this happened multiple times ships would miss the moment in which they were supposed to turn and because they would miss that moment the place that they were traveling to they would miss that just missed it by maybe a minute but by the time they were supposed to reach the destination they were so far off wow that they would never be found they couldn't find land wow wow come on now and one more thing a watch in order for the tiny Cog to start moving a watch has to be wound now in the old days watches that were wound you would pull out a little stem and turn it turn it turn it turn it turn it until it tightened up and push it back in now the watch is wound newer watches though is just the movement of your arm will wind the watch every time I move my hand it's winding my watch okay all right so we we we're we're good on how a watch works right okay on so I'm I'm GNA tell you one more thing I'm just kind of laying a foundation here for you so I'm a I'm a numbers guy I don't know if I've ever told you that I love messing with numbers and so we know that the scripture tells us one day is like a thousand years yes with the Lord right okay so I started taking that down that that that those those two those two days and the years and I wanted to break them down and so as I broke them down down down down down down down I came up with 90 seconds is like one year right 33 seconds is a day wow so Noah's 120 years sermon that he preached was three hours all right Abraham 25 years he waited on a son that was only 42 minutes to god wow Daniel's 20 21 days when he cried out for the Lord and had to wait 21 days for the angel that was 7 seconds so why am I telling you that because if a miracle happens if your Victory is today sir if it's right now he's got to start moving before you ever get out of your seat he's got to start doing something before you ever think about it Isaiah 65:24 and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear yes praise God amen glory okay so now let's get started Mark 9:22 I'm going to go back to that that story okay all right now this is Jesus has come up on this this scene here this child is is is possessed his father's standing there he's asking you know Jesus has asked how how often does this happen he's starting to talk to this man my God's starting to talk to him the man tells him it happens often he tries to throw this the spirit tries to throw him into the fire tries to throw him into the water it's trying to kill him wow and the man looks at Jesus and he says but if but if thou can't do anything right have compassion on us amen if see the Cog that tiny Cog was standing still wow if amen you can do this for me amen amen but Jesus looked back at him and I loved his response because he responded the same way if if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believe what was he doing there he was starting to wind that watch he was starting to wind it up because the next thing out of that man's mouth with tears in his eyes it said he straight way said I believe amen help my unbelief now the tiny Cog started to move now it started to make that main Cog start turning and Christ was able to cast that Spirit out of that child because the tiny Cog had started to move praise God yes sir we find in Mark 9:24 there's a pool there called Bethesda right and there was a man that had been sitting there for 38 years I believe it was that was crippled and as Jesus walked up on this scene yes sir all these other people around he stepped over every one of them and came to that one man Victory Day was coming that day it was coming that day Hallelujah as he stepped over to that to that man and he asked him will thou be made whole God and the man starts to say I can't get to the pool he's telling him I can't get to the pool there's too many people my legs they don't work I can't get there but Jesus says arise now he said arise now this man had a choice right there Christ was winding right there he was starting to wind him up that man had a choice right there I can either say I can sit here because my legs don't work I can't get to the pool or he could accept at that moment that was his Victory Day and he could stand to his feet and so he arose and took up his bed and he walked away right amen I want to say though in that moment what if he doesn't arise yes sir what if he tells him my legs don't work and I can't get to the the pool I can't stand up he lost his moment would that healing ever come that was his moment that was his Victory Day right there but it was up to him to possess it if he doesn't stand up just like those men at Sea he's lost forever you know brother Brown tells a story about a young lady that was sitting in his meeting and brother Brandon made an altar call that's right and people were coming to the altar but some the Holy Spirit was fixed on that lady the Holy Spirit was doing everything he could for that lady to come to the altar so much is where brother brandham walked down off the pull pit walked over to her and said sister the holy spirit is speaking to me about you and she denied it and a few years later he saw that same woman that's exactly right and she told him at that moment after insulting him she told him you are right because from that moment right there I could see my mother's Soul frying in hell and I would laugh at it what was that Christ was doing everything he could he was winding as much as he could but that Cog was refusing to move she missed that moment in her life and she was lost forever prise God when those moments come we need to recognize that's my moment this is my moment today is my Victory Day Glory Mercy I'm all over my notse so there was another man one time and I can see this as he was getting ready for for church for temple that day was the Sabbath day the Bible doesn't tell us how old this man was I don't know if he was married I don't know if he still lived at home but I'm I wonder if at one point while he was getting ready and he went to put his robe or his jacket on if he had to have his mom or maybe his wife helping because his his arm was withered up yes sir but he was going to go to Temple that day yes sir and as he got there that day there's a different person standing in that Temple that day and this man was was speaking probably in a way that most of those people had never heard before and there was all these Pharisees and the the the priests and everything standing there and they were looking at this man with the withered arm J and they were looking at the at Jesus Christ standing there thinking I wonder if he'll heal that man on the Sabbath day because that's not that's not permitted you don't do that and as Jesus was perceiving their thoughts he looked at that man and he said come here and he actually brings him out into the middle of the temple and he tells him stretch forth your hand now here was a moment again for this man this man had a moment right here he could either stretch forth that hand or he could have said I can't do it because my hand is withered right but Jesus standing there had started winding that watch and that c the tiniest little Cog started to move and when that tiny Cog started to move the great big Cog started to move and that man stretched forth his hand in front of all those people in the middle of that Temple because he's a Healer amen Victory Day came for that man right then Glory we've all heard the story of the prodigal son right how he he he asked his father give me all that's mine I'm going to I'm going to leave I'm I'm going you know that story could go a lot of different ways but the so he takes all of his his earnings and he leaves he goes and he spends all of his earnings he finds himself in a pig pin yes sir but he remembered I'm the son of this man amen amen that's my father that's right amen and you know as we look at this story as he was sitting in that pig pin and he starts remembering who he was that watch started to get wound that tiny Cog started to think all I've got to do is go home Hallelujah even if even if he doesn't accept me back as a son his servants eat better than I do that tiny Cog started to move but we know the story he went home and the father ran and met him because he had started that tiny Cog started moving it forced the larger Cog to start turning and he met him with a robe he they had a feast for this man but you know I want to stop it on this point here you know it took a pig pin to get that prodical son to realize where he was at and I think most of you sitting here know my testimony my God that's not what my pig pin looked like God we were doing just fine we had money we had nice cars my pig pin did not look like his Pig pin wow wow I ask you to think about what does your pig pin look like you know brother Bron makes a statement that just because it's paraphrasing just because it's cloudy skies doesn't mean that's God's disapproval am and just because it's sunny skies doesn't mean it's his approval so what does our Pig pin look like this morning what is it what does it take for that Cog to start moving it's another time that Christ was out and he was called that his friend Lazarus was dying and as he dwelt in the where he was at for a couple more days because he knew what was going to happen when he went back yes sir he already knew what was going to happen sir so he dwelt where he was at for a couple more days because this was going to be for the glory of the Lord those Victory days are always for the glory of the Lord amen but as he makes his way back he walks into the city Martha comes running if you'd only been here if here we go again with the if if you'd only been here yes my brother would still be alive and as Jesus starts talking to her and he starts winding and he starts telling her your brother will live again and she says yes I know in the general Resurrection but I am I am the resurrection he starts winding that Cog up because the next thing she says is even now even now what whatever you ask I know that he'll give you I don't know that she fully understood what was getting ready to happen but even thou amen whatever you ask and as this man Jesus Walks over and he actually starts to weep and I want to think about this moment for just a minute as he starts to weep I'm sure that those people in that City looking all those people were looking at this man going this man's got a problem brother Solomon for the rest of his life he's going to have a problem knowing that if he would have been here he could have saved this man he could have healed this man this was his friend this was one he loved if he would have just been here he could have healed him but he's going to have to live with this for the rest of his life with this problem that he's got hold the thought on that right there all right so I'm going to tell you a story real quick so right before Sarah and I started coming back to church we took a trip to uh to Jamaica and while we were in Jamaica we were we were at a a resort and on the resort they they offered uh um we could take um excursions go out out of the the resort just you know see see Jamaica so we set one of these up and we get on they they just a bus would pull up we'd all get on the bus and so as we're on the bus and there's a there's a lady um uh at the front of the bus and she's going to kind of be the the guide and uh she kind of starts talking to us a little bit and the bus starts to move to pull away and a woman from the back of the bus she yells wait a minute wait a minute I got a problem and they're like what's going on and she's like I just I forgot my medicine I think it was her medicine I forgot my my medication in the room so the lady says well just stop the bus and and they let her off and she was like just you know hurry just go grab it and come back so the lady come goes and comes back and she gets back on the bus bus starts moving again this Jamaican lady she takes this moment to to to to give us a little lesson about how the island works and she says you know on the island here we don't have problems we only have situations now at that moment I was not serving the lord certainly didn't have any thoughts of being a minister but for some reason that stuck with me and I couldn't figure out why and so not too long ago I looked this up this just came back into my mind again it's not a problem it's only a situation so I actually Googled I looked I I looked up the definition of what a problem is I looked up the definition of what a situation is I even Googled what's the difference between a problem in a situation well see the the difference between them is is a problem May or may not have a solution the solution may be it might not be good if you do it this way it might not be good if you do it this way but that's the solution you got to one way or the other that's the answer to it but it may not even have an answer however a situation is something that can just be changed amen that's the difference between a problem and a situation so all those people that were standing there going this man's got a problem they didn't understand who they were dealing with that he had the power to take a situation to take any situation and change that situation so as brother Braham talks about that this man with the stoop shoulders that was nothing to look at when he was standing there and he was tears running out of his eyes but he said where have you laid him and when he stepped up in front of that tomb and he squared up those little shoulders he squared them up because now he's ready to fight there was more than a man standing there there was more than a man standing in front of that tomb the situation was about to be changed but why because the tiniest Cog just a few minutes ago had started to turn which was allowing the great Cog to start turning and when he stepped up to that grave with so much power so much Authority brother Bram said if he wouldn't have called his name that he would have the general Resurrection would have taken place right then that everything that had ever died everything would have come up out of the Grave because that's the power of Christ that's what happens when the tiniest Cog will start moving Hallelujah there was another man by the name of Joshua one time he was in a battle this wasn't just a little Skirmish there was five kingdoms that were coming against him and they had been fighting all day long and they were just about to win this Victory but the sun was going down his men were coming to him and saying Joshua it's getting dark if it gets dark we're going to lose them they're going to run they're going to regrip we're going to have to fight this fight again but Joshua knew the Creator hallu he knew the one that created the moon and the sun glory and so that little Cog that had already been wound up under Moses's Ministry sir that little Cog started to move and he said Son stand still moon stop moving I need some more time because it was not a problem to him that was just a little situation that could be changed by the the Creator that tiny Cog started putting the larger Cog into motion and time stopped the sun Stood Still the Bible said that God hearkened to the voice of a man he listened to what that man said because that tiny Cog started to move the bigger Cog glory to God hallelujah amen there was a man one time sitting listening to Paul preach amen and the man had been born because all these stories we're telling right now Christ was right there Lord Christ Jesus Christ was standing right there but this was Paul this was after the crucifixion this was Paul Paul preached and this man that had been crippled his entire life was sitting there and something started stirring in that man's heart and Paul perceived that this man has the faith to be healed so he just looked at him and said stand to your feet he said it with a loud voice what was that because the watch had been wound that tiny Cog had started to move and that Faith from him caught the the the the attention of God's servant standing there because he started to move he started moving there was nothing that could stop that point those teeth that were intertwined started to move Hallelujah huj and the man stood to his feet had never walked a day in his life but he stood up under the the voice of Paul amen sir amen God there's a story that brother brandham tells yes sir he was in Arkansas one time and as he had just got done preaching and they were the policemen were around him because in Arkansas there was segregation yes sir all the black people were on one side that's right all the white people were on the other side amen right but this one little old black man come on right standing over to the side Hallelujah he heard brother Bram God's servant heard that man crying Mercy Mercy and what had happened just a few days before that man had had a dream his mother came to him in a dream what was that that was God winding that watch and when that little old black man got to that service there wasn't enough demons in hell to stop what was going to happen it didn't matter how much segregation there was in Arkansas nothing was stopping that moment and when that man started to yell out mercy and God's servant heard him he said I have to go over there I have to go over there there why because that Cog started moving it made the master Cog start moving and the policemen were saying we can't take you over there we'll start a race riot if we go over there but it did not matter the master Cog was already moving he had no choice but to go over there and when he walked over there and that blind man told him what the problem was I can't see but he believed he knew that in that M moment that was going to be his victory day there was nothing that could stop that glory to God and that man received his sight right there in that moment praise God Amen our Victory Day it could be a long ways away all right or it could be this day amen amen amen could be right here right now because I don't care what you're sitting here with I don't care if if if if if if the doctors have told you you have no hope I just left the church in Sarasota the doctors had given up on that man that's right stage four cancer but when they went to run the test after they had they had laid hands on that man when they went to run the test they couldn't find anything they were running tests to see how they were going to stop stop the cancer but they couldn't find the cancer why was that because that man drove down a steak and said today is my victory day today is I'm winning this battle today not tomorrow not next week but today don't look now but Paul or brother brandham wasn't here but the same Lord Jesus that was there the same one that stood at the tomb of Lazarus the same one at the with the woman at the well he's here right now I'm not brother brandham there is no brother brandham but there is still the same yesterday today and forever he's here right now whatever your need is whether it be sickness whether your family's falling apart marriage problems money problems I don't care what the problem can I get a tiny Cog to start moving today can I get somebody to say that today is my Victory [Applause] [Music] Day we always say that we're waiting on him but I tell you today he's waiting on you he's waiting for that call to stand in faith not because I felt something but in faith because you you said that was my promise that's what your word says your word says it's my promise it's my possession and like Caleb I stand here today and I say that we're more than able that's my possession my healing is mine it's already been paid [Applause] for my healing was paid for at Calvary my family was paid for at Calvary my sins were paid for at Calvary the sin question was answered at Calvary it's already done is there a tiny Cog in this building that will start moving and will reach out like the woman at with the blood issue she didn't we she didn't reach out like all the rest of them were reaching out they were touching Jesus they were all touching him with a physical hand she didn't need to touch him physically she reached out with something more that St that caused that man to stop in his tracks because that little Cog started to move and it forced that big Cog to start [Applause] moving do we have any little cogs in here I don't know what you have need of but I know that he knew before I ever got here what you had need of I know that he started moving before we even started playing the piano yes sir before they speak I will hear them amen hallelujah hallelujah if you need prayer this morning I'm more than happy to pray with you amen we don't have an altar but that chair can be your altar whatever you need I know that he's here and it's not just because I feel him it's because he promised he promised he would be here he's not obligated to me he's not obligated you he's obligated to his word and he promised that he was here he promised if we would ask and believe it not say I feel it but believe it that all things were possible he would give us anything that we ask in the father's name amen Jesus amen GL let's pray dear heavenly father Lord huj Lord as I preach this simple little sermon father Lord I just pray father God that it just will find its way into the hearts of your people father Lord I know that there's many needs sitting here father and I know that there's not a need one here that you can't meet and that you can't meet
