the enemy attacking their body but i thank god that we have a lot of a church full of victorious people [Music] they amen it through one more time i like what brother solomon said his prayer anything the devil attacks you with can be reversed praise god amen but whatever god bless you it is done as there's nothing the devil can do about that hallelujah it's his will for us to be in good health and to prosper even as our soul prospers so we we thank him for touching us amen one more time amen praise the lord um we'll uh give this morning's announcements and everything um we uh certainly uh bring our uh bring greetings to you from flagstaff uh brother dale uh smith there the pastor and some of you all may remember me he used to travel through these um through this circuit a lot he'd come with his fishing boat and try to find anywhere where there's some water and he'd jump out there and fish and then preach and fish he's just a real precious brother and uh but there the lord has called him out to flagstaff and they're in the mountains of arizona ain't no fishing up there but uh but he uh you know the lord's just blessed their their assembly there and um you know just it was a blessing to be able to kind of go and see he was telling me the testimony of um the church that they have they were renting from a little like a storefront and the lord sent a brother to the church and i believe the lord restored the brother somehow and sent him to church him and his mother and both of them had come into the church and was there the brother was there roughly 10 months and the lord had called him home and uh and also in that 10-month period the lord called the brother's mother home and uh but the mother uh left all her inheritance to the son amen and then the son left all his inheritance because he was the only child and he had he never got married never had children so he left his inheritance to the church so with that inheritance they bought a church in cash [Applause] won't he do it i say lord jesus sometimes i just like going and hearing other folk testimonials i i i the god that i serve is able amen you can't tell me he can't do it because i seen him do it for somebody else hey man i know what he's able to do for me so what he's done for others he would do the same for you hallelujah amen so i i was just i was just encouraged just to see it beautiful beautiful sanctuary the lord has blessed them with and amen and to be worshipping there um debt free is just that's that is that's where i want to be and man that's exactly where i want to be man you can use the money for other other things in the kingdom of god uh being able to help give to others and things like that and i want to thank you all uh many of y'all have been given towards our mission offering we started at the beginning of the year and and we've been able to send every month 250 a month every month you know to missions uh so we we thank god since the beginning of the year very consistent uh sending that so uh i know we're doing what we're supposed to do and i know god will take care of the rest so amen praise the lord uh before i i go into those announcements i did

hear say we got the pullers in the house make brother gene preach and you know brother seth i believe also preached a service and i said man that they're having church there in in south carolina so hey man i'm glad glad that the saints was able to make it i know some others tried to but uh you know just didn't work out but i trust that we'll get a chance to be a part of some of these meetings uh brother barry coffey is going to be doing a men's meeting there in tennessee september 23rd through 25th and uh i know a few of his brothers will be going up so keep us in prayer and that i'll be speaking uh at that meeting uh just one of the speakers there and then october 14th through 16th brother fred mullins is having meetings there at life tabernacle i know he mentioned to me that he invited [Music] brother larry nichols and he invited another brother by name his brother moore a pastor there in ohio uh and um so and myself i know that we've been invited to come and and minister so brother fred wants to um cater a meal for the saints and he just asked that if any of the saints from our church plan on going to the meetings uh just let me know let me know so i can let him know give him account for how many is actually coming from our church that way they'd be properly prepared so if you desire to go to those meetings just please let me know so we can give him uh a proper count for the for the catering and also uh the young people will be going to um travelers rest south carolina with brother um brother jason watkins and that's happening october 27th through 30th but now before that happens actually before brother mullins the weekend before october 7th 8th and 9th [Music] i was recently talking with brother brother uh watkins and we we teach together on this on this um this thing on revelation you know we were teaching out of the book of revelation and um so we were talking and a few weeks ago i was i ran into a quote that just kind of helped me uh revelations is a very mysterious book and uh it's not easy to teach from there but you know i believe god sent us a prophet and through that prophet he might not have went scripture by scripture but he gave us enough of his comments and through those comments we can kind of put some put the picture together and um and and one of the things that the lord's been showing me in the book of revelation because there are things that people are waiting for to happen uh during the tribulation period but there's things brother branham has said has already been happening uh certain sick seal things have already been happening hitler and stella stalin is a past tense event and that was something that was underneath the sixth seal and what the lord showed me that these events have been running simultaneously god's been dealing with the jews get even right now this war that you see in ukraine god is putting the jews back in their homeland through that war we don't know 144 000 could be in ukraine but they got to be back in israel before god deals with them right so you know god just been kind of showing how things been running simultaneously and then brother branham made a statement in um gabriel's instructions to daniel says uh he says i got to teach on daniel 70 weeks because out of the 70 weeks come the church ages now the seven out of church agents come to seals and the viles and the plagues and all these things he said if you don't understand the 70 weeks you know you won't understand the rest of it it says and then it says because it all fits within this time period i say wait a minute i mean everything in the book of revelation has to end at the end of that 70th week so no matter how mysterious it is it has the end there and when you start catching that you'll realize oh there's some things that already been happening all along the way i told the brothers the other night i wish that i could just i got about 125 lessons in the book of revelation and i wish i could just come and just take a different night and just teach them all to y'all god gonna make a way somehow i don't know when i don't know i don't i don't know when but i got it ready for you 125 lessons already i'm still making more amen to teach to the church so the lord knows all things amen this time and it's perfect we just we just love the lord so uh that weekend october 7th 8th and 9th

god uh i read a question answering the other day brother brown said can you be a christian not go to church he said no all right all right he said no all right that's what the prophet of god said if we believe the prophet we just say what he says he says no glory you can't be a cr you can't be a good christian if you don't come to church i said well i'll take that all right i said cause every time the door is open no matter where i'm at even if i'm not speaking i need a piece of bread i need something for me and my family to keep pressing on to say you know in this filthy world and you walk and see the filth of this world when i tell you he shined a light in goshen today and he's shining light in your life to press on today and to say hey keep pressing on and when he saw him behind the curtain of tom he just said he said you gotta go back into that body when he had that taken away vision he was taken away he said i got to go back into that filth he said we could just get a glimpse of what's over there if we could just get a glimpse this morning what jesus has prepared for us it's not built with hands of clay but it's built with the eternal hands it's got a house that's preparing a place where gold the ivory palace think about it this morning when we walk in we'll be dancing brother jack we'll be praising god i'll tell you he said whatever you got here i'll tell you i'll shout now i'm going to shout over there i'll tell you he said hey i'd love to see someone with someone a little bit emotional [Music] you know it's not all in the motions but there's a balance in it i know there's a balance but how can you not get emotional when your god set from glory and saved you this morning and gave me the truth gave me a message america four or five and six this morning and set you free oh when you get that revelation in your hearts there's nothing that will ever take it from you that god won't take it from you it might be thinking you got in the head but when you get it in their hearts and when it's anchored in that soul he said you know what the three hebrew children this morning he talked about the three hebrew children they said they couldn't burn it out of them they couldn't burn it out of them they can't burn it out of me they can't burn it out of you that's something you gotta possess today he wants you to have it this morning oh let's go to him in prayer oh lord father we're in this place may you be used in the mighty way father may this clay that was formed from the foundation of the world may you speak to this claim yes lord father not of me

doors father what we call the message father we should be living this message more than we ever heard lord father may you help him brother may you father as you did with that brother with that building i pray that you would do the same thing for brother jack may somebody you said that you're no respecter of persons this morning and father may you pour a double blessing on him in this church father you can make a way well there is no way well i claim it this morning in jesus name we love you we give you this service in jesus name amen god bless you i'm gonna try to turn on my clock because i don't want to run you out of here all day but i tell you it's good to feel the liberty this morning i'll tell you what there's nowhere a better place than i would want to be all right i've been there i've tried it it ain't good all right but when you come to the house of god that's all good i need more of it every single day i wake up i say lord i need more of you i need more of you we're going to turn to psalms this morning in psalms psalms 112 psalms 112. psalms 112 verse 7 it says he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the lord he said his heart is fixed his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he see his desire upon his enemies may you may god has blesses you may be seated i know this is probably a symbol scripture this morning but i believe every scripture is ordained of god i don't matter if it's one scripture or twenty it's all the word of god and it says he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting the lord i believe what a better time we're living in today is to have a heart that's fixed on jesus christ we travel all over the place and i see a hesitation in the bride because their heart is not fixed on jesus christ it's fixed on the pastor's ideas it sticks on it sticks on the man's ideas it sticks on things of the world it's fixed on their their uh their bank account is fixed under 401k it's fixed on things of the world but when you truly get your heart fixed on jesus christ hey nothing can move you this morning i don't care what your daddy says i don't care what your mama says i say if none of them go with me i'm still going if your wife don't go you go if you don't go you keep claiming it this morning and i'm here to tell you if you got a wayward uh child this morning i say claim them this morning the word of god says you can have your inheritance i don't know why we keep getting scared say well devil they're out in the world i don't care where they are you know what they might just get him just because of you just because of you he said for the ones that loved you brother brown the ones that loved you and vice versa they will be there i'm not saying it gives you a free meal ticket just to ride it's not a free meal ticket just to say well you're going to be there no just keep praying for them keep trusting that they're going to be there but david you don't think about david he was a murderer adulterer but he still said it was a man after god's own heart i'm so thankful that we can look through jesus to revelation you see men just like us in clay form they found the grace of god one day that came in his heart and he knew his motive and objective brother bram said you got to know your motive and objective and everything you do your motive and objective i'm paraphrasing that all right but he said his heart is established and i believe that's today that we get so uh we get so wayward sometimes because our heart is not established it's not established on the word of god enough you know what i think sometimes the only time we read the word or we listen to a tape it's on wednesday or sunday and you want to know why we're not established it's because you have the same audio audio that i have you have the same app that i have you have the same ipad that i have and i tell you what you know what you're not going to get enough just on wednesday and sunday it's an everyday walk with jesus christ it's a daily walk that you fall in love with the master and when you sing about them brother solomon was singing i said lord jesus we're having church i say because when you talk about him when you sing about him he comes down amen hey i'm so thankful for that psalms 108. turn to 108. it says verse 1. this is david he said oh god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise even with my glory let's turn over to um psalms 57 where we're going to be at this morning it says that uh verse 7. here he is again if he if it didn't mean as much mean that much he wouldn't say it all the way out through the scriptures he said my heart is fixed oh god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise and then he goes on he talks about making confession with your heart also the bible says where your heart is your treasure will be also you got to realize that when you talk to a brother or sister and you see where their heart is you realize where their treasure lies that's the scripture says it and you really see that so i'm not talking about a heart repair this morning i'm talking about a dedicated established fixed on the word of god fixed on the message of the hour fixed on every word and i'll tell you what i grew up i'm telling you i'll tell you a little bit about me i grew up in a very broken up home they didn't believe this word they didn't believe this message i came and saw it about 20 years ago but i tell you what once you get anchored in you're not going nowhere once you get fixed my dad will call me today he said son do you still believe this or do you still believe that crazy stuff you're in i said dad i believe it more than i ever believed it before and the more you get in the more you won't of it i taste the endless fountain that just keeps filling you and i tell you if you haven't got that fountain this morning i provoke you to get that fountain this morning i provoke you young kids to get the holy ghost and i tell you you'll never be the same i'm not saying you won't fall i'm not saying you won't fall or have failures in your life but i'm here to tell you within your failures there's grace and he says his mercies are new every morning that's what i'm thankful for that i can turn to the scripture and say hey get up my son no matter if you found me yesterday it's a new morning to serve you hallelujah but you know what i looked up the word fix what it means it says to be firm stable established or fastened in one place let me read that again to be firm to be stable to be established or fastened into one place that's what we got to be this morning we got to be firm stable established and fastened this morning but if the wife don't believe it you believe it if the kids don't believe it you believe it i'll tell you he said one place he said he'll take one in the bed leave one hey i want to be that one this morning he said there might be one in jeffersonville what hey i'm gonna be that one there's a i tell you there's a lot in jeffersonville now i said glory to god we gotta be that one all right but i believe there's a bride here to west palm beach today i'm thankful for that but we gotta find our position in christ amen we gotta find david he wanted his heart even though all he did he focused on the lord what god wanted the house of god he focused on the word of god and doing what god wanted him to do right right he said david was a man after god's own heart after all that he's done he still looked at his heart you can look at somebody and look at where they're at and look at their their intentions and motives but you can look up god only can look at the heart you might think you know somebody but god looks at the heart brother i said there's that little spot in that heart that they found that little empty part like a fingernail and that's where your soul lies this morning i'm glad that they can't touch it he said that three hebrew children i'm paraphrasing he said when they walk up to the fiery furnace uh king nebuchadnezzar he heated it seven times hotter and you know what when they got up they were throwing them in the fiery furnace and they were dying as they were throwing them in but you think about this he said when two or three are gathered in the mist i want you to hear something this morning there's some power when it becomes when we had two or three more in the midst this morning because think about it if he was through one by one he would have probably been in trouble because he couldn't verify his word but where he messed up was when he threw two or three in the midst he said when you two or three in the midst i will show up think about it this morning when there's two or three in the mask hey it ain't about the crowds he just said two or three you can always find two or three but i was where he messed up when he threw him in three at a time and then jesus showed up and he said hey you know the angels can't brother abraham say i love how you paraphrase this brother says he walked up the angels come up to him and ask permission could they hey do you see your children down there right right he said do you see him he said i see him uh-huh the lord says i see him he said look hey don't go blow him out don't go he said i could rush water down there he said no no don't worry about this is my battle i'm gonna step down from glory i'm gonna walk in the mess so i tell you quit worrying about your things of his life and things these trials and battles but trusting god like jefferson said he said the battle is not yours it's mine this morning and i'll tell you stop carrying your battles the problem is we carry our battles like we do our luggage all right it's like going to the airport and you walk in and all of a sudden you got your and you set it up on there and it says oh gosh rachel it's about to be 50 pounds lord maybe i put my foot there oh lord he convicted me i pulled my foot back you know i'm just telling you i'm human this morning and it's like 51. oh jesus all right put some stuff over there you know what what's the best part about it is when you throw the baggage on the bell and you let it watch and you watch it go so i'm here to tell you this money if you brought baggage if you brought throw it on the back of the belt this morning and let it go up let it go down to the pits of hell let it go down this morning i'll tell you we we got we get on the bad planes and i'll tell you i don't know why i'm going here brother but you get on the plane and you think about it my wife always gets home we've been flying a lot lately and you walk on the plane and i'm always looking at the pilot all right rachel just kind of keeps on going to the seat i say well she don't care who the pilot is but i do all right and i thought about it the other day she always looks that way i'm always going and there's always stuart just in the way i'm like can you move over where i can see we have experience on this plane this morning where there's a two-year-old on the plane think about it all right you don't ever tell your thinking different when you get on a plate now y'all be like excuse me move over but rachel just has straight she just has trust she just says hey if we pass away hey we're we have that earthly tabernacle be dissolved but you know i always want to look who's driving the plane i want to be like oh okay we have an older man and a little younger man so we got a little mixture we're going to make it problem all right now same in the church today we have older ones that experience battles we have younger ones they haven't experienced it yet but i tell you gotta trust in jesus christ and the only ones don't say he's carried me through every time [Applause] no matter what storm you go through no matter what clouds you go through i tell you what he's got a body waiting for you and if we got our heart fixed on jesus christ and on him alone what are we worrying about what are we worrying about i tell you the bride comes around here gets so worried and worked up i said why are you worried you're not listening to the tapes i'm listening to oh my you're not reading the word that i'm reading because our rest should be only in jesus christ amen should only be a jesus christ i'll fill my wife my wife will fail me but i tell you i always point her to the big l and say lord help me lord help me to be the godly husband help me to raise these kids in a godly home help me but protect their eyes it's like i had their ipad the other day we put on so many filters and so much stuff isaac said i can't get on that website it's blocked me out daddy i said praise god amen the eyes don't need to see that mess barely anyway that's right they don't need to see it that's right that's where you're gonna get scared up and right on side of the road amen i'll tell you we gotta get our eyes fixed on the lord hallelujah i heard someone say i heard a saying the other day he said you know you know who loves the pastor who shows up on sunday but you know who loves god when they show up mid-week hey i thought it was good i thought it was good we'll be at church have a full house on sunday morning sunday night it'd be 50 people all right i'm like where you go you can't get you just got filled up i mean enough for the whole week all right i don't know what you're doing but i need to be filled up every time i come to the house of god i need to i need more than 93 our tank i need more of him because this flesh this flesh this brother said is sticky yeah that's right it's sticky and you know what mine is too and what i'm saying to you is coming back to me too even more amen but i like what psalms 57 1 says david said be merciful unto me oh god be merciful to me for my soul thirst this in thee yea in the shadow of my weed thy wings i will make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed you know what calamity says for i already look that up it says an event causing great and often sudden damage or distress a disaster so here he is fleeing from saul for his life think about it but he says be merciful god for my soul thirst is for thee he says in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge you've got to find your refuge this morning and he says until these calamities be overpassed the problem is we don't have enough patience to let the climate is passed or we don't we have to call everybody else but call on the lord we call we we look up on face fake book or facebook that's what it's called uh and we we look at fake stories we look at a picture they left from high school on there and when you see them they're three times bigger than that or they're three times smaller than that yeah you know because they want to live in a lot of dream world i don't want to live in a dream world i want to live in his world i want to live in the god alone problem said we walk with god alone all right i'm here to tell you we got to get in accordance with jesus he said brother said when he was behind the curtain of time he saw the bride getting out of order he said get back in line all right start screaming get back in life and i'll tell you these websites and all this math someone said hey do you look at this i don't want to look at anything if it ain't the truth if it ain't the word of god you know what's so bad about it have you ever looked at the lives behind these mess these websites they've created their life is ate up they're divorced they're on the side of the road they're they're you'll hear their drinking in the drugs and we still believe that nonsense come on brother hey i just said it's the life behind the name that makes the devil tremble it's not what you say and he said it's the life so i'm just watching the life and when i see the lights all ate up give me give me away from that website i just trust in jesus christ alone if he said he sent a prophet he sent a prophet amen brother said 99 9 is still a lie that's right you know what i believe i'm like sister hattie wright this morning just call me crazy say this brother from uh south carolina and indiana is crazy because i'll tell you why i believe this is nothing but the truth you know what she said he said well you can have anything you want she said i want the salvation of my voice that's right that's right million dollars whatever you want she said i just want the salvation of my boys you know what i believe you know when they've been over there and they started giving their heart to the lord hey someone said the other day they said hey chris you know they're out in the world i don't care where they're at i don't care where they're at if he said he gave him he gave them to him the same to your children your family your wife your kids i don't care where there but he gave them to you so keep pressing on so i'm letting the devil lie to you so i'm saying they're not mine i just say you march home and say lord get behind me satan i tell the devil say devil go back where you belong right now amen you think about job he had to ask permission permission to mess with him that's right that's right he and that's pr think about it the devil has to ask permission to the lord when he wants to mess with you hey can i miss your brother jack can i mess with him he says he loves this message but can i just come down real quick and mess with him he said well hold on there's a hedge around them but but but there's a hedge you can't take his life but you can mess with him all right you can prove if he's a child of god or brother solomon or somebody i'll tell you what brother smiley back there i'll tell you put a hedge around me every one of you got a hedge around you you might feel like you lost everything but you gained everything you gained everything this morning when you saw this truth and when you saw the truth of this message you're blessed today there's people worshiping the devil and they don't even know it think about it they're dressing up walking in the church oh it's just a good day but there's somebody in this church today that goes the right way and sees the truth and i tell you he's coming for a bride that's making herself ready can you imagine on that day when we're there they're going well we went to the wrong church we went we should have went right and she said we're left on the same campus the bride is shining in one group and the devil shining in another my god my god think about it acts 20 acts 20 23 says paul said save that the holy ghost witness he said witness in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me he says neither count i my life he said i dear thy unto thyself myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god i believe that should be everybody's testimony when you're going through trials and you're going through having your heart fixed on jesus christ but none of these things move brother none of these things rachel called me and said this happened or that i said honey don't matter i'll say hey if it's if it's meant to be we just have to bear their approach that's what we believe i grew up i'll tell you i was telling you i grew up in a home i didn't know jesus but i had a grandmother i called grandma lois of the bible all right she might i don't know she's listening to him but she'll sit there every day she's 84 years old today she handed me two messages before i went in the military she had me jezebel religion why were not a domination she had me two tapes it lit me up all right i was in the baptist church thinking i was gonna do youth counsel and had thirty thousand youth it was a really big church and all of a sudden i walked through the pastor i said this is very you i've been learning the whole book wrong baptism i called my uncle i said hey he said what time is it be two o'clock in the morning son you know what time it is brother you better get the water or i'm getting the water because i can't i cannot wake up and not be here i'm telling you i got i got serious with the lord and i said lord i said lord listen he said we can wait tomorrow where i said brother we can't wait i said brother if i have to turn the water off if i had to bring the pool to you i want to be baptized i've been baptized the wrong way my god and i tell you ever since it hadn't changed that zeal once i got truly baptized in jesus christ that zeal and that message it must live this morning and we should all have the seal and all had the passion and you know what he said david didn't lose their salvation he lost the joy of his salvation brethren said so sometimes you might come in there this morning feel a little down low out i just tell you say lord fill me up again lord refill my joy refill my joy refill every fruit of the of your attributes this morning amen brown said in absolute 1962. he said the catholic church and the pope before they said has the pope for the absolute he said the protestant has their bishops and their creeds he said they're general overseers but i'm like paul all right he said god europe he said paul got your pencil set down something he said paul said in acts the 20th 24th fourth verse none of these things move me oh he said can you have the creeds he said you can have whatever you want but then things don't move me he said i'm anchored my soul in the haven of rest to sell the winds the wild seas he said i don't know where you're at this way that way no more the tempest may sweep over the wild stormy deep he said all may turn down but in jesus i'm safe evermore he said i'm safe forevermore he said none of these things moved me he said i'm tied to an anchor he said oh since i've been met him paul said on that road i've been tied to an anchor he turned me around he set me back right you remember paul belonged to our organization he said the biggest in the land but he was tied to the united states he said but he got tied to the absolutes you got to get tied to the truth tied to the absolute and i tell you you know where you get tried that is when you say i believe a message i carry message books all right the devil knows every scripture he knows every quote you know what that's why he likes to come try his children that's why the lord lets it you know he said they're more more precious than gold i'll tell you what they're tough sometimes i'll be honest i'd be like lord but you know what he said brother brahm said you know why he does it to us he said because he has confidence in you amen he said he puts trials and tribulations because he's got conf brotherham said this he has confidence in you so when you're going through trials and tribulations i'm like lord you must have a lot of confidence today because i'm feeling it i always say i said lord you're bringing it today you're letting the devil bring it today but you know what every time there's a way of escape every time no matter what trial the work my kids are going through there's always a way of escape there's always a way a way that you can trust in god that he's going to bring you through i i was back here believing i said you know what lord you you know what i was thinking about her house and stuff i said you know what you don't just i heard brother one say he said you know what he said i don't just want him to pay the house payment i want to pay it off you know what brethren said ask god for big things [Applause] i think we limit jesus christ today and i tell you you want a building with claimability you need your children to come in you claim a man i'll tell you we gotta step up above where you're called to be we're just living too low today and the devil's got you scared and i don't sit right there i said lord give him a building not just a small building but give him a big building to shine this message i said go buy some more botnet lady with a huge building i said i ain't gonna quit praying until you give it to him [Music] i'll limit jesus christ why you limit him we don't limit jesus christ but i see it all the time we limit them we say well god well you could do this for them and i wish you could do why don't you just say lord i'm having it he said let your body obey your confession i say just walk around brother jack every day i'm getting my building i'm getting my building i'm getting my building i'm getting my love going i'm going to be healed today i was hurt the other day so bad my whole body was hurting and i said i'm gonna praise you no matter anyway i'm gonna praise you and about that about two days later i was still saying it brother jack and all of a sudden i said i don't feel no pain but that's the problem is you got to claim it this morning stop letting the devil lie to you and whatever you need this morning you keep walking in hallelujah you're not children of the devil you're children of the god a god that loves you if you see this message i'll tell you go try to tell a co-worker about it and you start telling a little bit about abc's well it really don't matter you know they baptize that way no it does matter yes he does that's right you know maybe if they're on their deathbed and they don't know better and they ask for god to forgive them okay but if you know the truth and you don't abide by it right right i tell you we are so blessed i'm telling you man we come back we come my dad would tell me she called me all the time you still got i said dad this message is so true this message is everything i've been looking for amen i'd go to the baptist church the pentecostal church i'd come back to the baptist church and freeze it behind a friend he'd like chris quit yelling amen out so loud i'm like oh yeah we're in the baptist church and then we go to the pentecostal church then we go to the methodist church he said brother you are all over the place because i was searching something all right all right i was searching for a fix something to fix my heart on besides the things of this world and then she had my grandma faithful grandma just hand me two tapes i listened to him we're in the barracks i had bible study from then on out we had bible study i paid for it too we would run miles and miles home probably gonna look like it now i'll probably look i run miles now i got married and she's cooking all the time uh you know but i tell you what when i was in the military we'd run miles and miles and they would make me run around the whole platoon saying philippians 4 13. where you have philippians 4 13 we run 10 miles and i say lord if this is all i got to do i'll still do it i said if this is why i got to see this message i'm going to keep running and i was running around chris you got about died i'm telling you i felt like i was gonna die but i said well it's okay because if i die i'm going to heaven so i keep on running every night they wake me up at two or three in the morning where's philippians 4 13. wow wow they said where is he at i get up i said i'm here drill sergeant he said come in get this he said get this get this log and i said what's the law he said it's called desire so welcome is a half cut telephone pole it's about that high and he made me do lunges all night long saying scriptures and i told the drill sergeant and i said drill sergeant whatever i have to do for the master i said i'll pay every row he's paid it all and you know what this still don't amount what he done for me and i would just walk down the barracks and i would do them lunges back and forth drop it he'd say laugh at me pick it back up and you know what he started messing with my mind and i said you know what i don't care how far and at the end of the graduation he said hey brother you get up here and say the prayer he said you've been stable you've been established you've had your heart fixed on jesus christ and he says you say the prayer over these soldiers today because you didn't waver [Music] that's how we got to be you're all soldiers in an army but we're called out into the army of gods bro brother said he said he put five stars on youth this morning he said f-a-r-t-h faith he said and the chief commander-in-chief has put five stars on you i'm thankful that he put five stars on me and you this morning when we need a need we can go to the old and i'm not telling you he's just an errand boy this morning amen i'm not saying hey well lord i need this this and this today you ever just laid on your face and said lord i just love you i might be going through this trial i don't need anything i just want to tell you i love you amen i don't want to just go through the to-do list of what you need me to do what you need to do this morning hey sometimes we want to check them off we get down say lord i need this i need that i need this i need he knows what you need he knows what you need before you ask he just wants a willing heart fixed and established get on their knees and say lord hey i just tell you i love you this morning i'm not saying you have to be in your prayer class for 14 hours or 15 hours hey you can always pray continually in your car worship in the lord turn on the cd i'll tell you to change the atmosphere i'll come home my wife's all tore up the kids are in array she's taught them all day and she's like here get them i'm going to the grocery store that's what they call out now because homeschool you can tell you can tell we homeschool the kids she's like i'm going to the grocery store i'm getting a cup of coffee all right all right so we go on trips i tell ya she's like oh praise god amen my life uh go back to psalms 57 verse 2. it says i know i'm going to get all through all this but psalms 57 2 it said i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me not just all things for him but all thanks for you as well he says he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up salah you know what salam means paul's and think about it all right yeah salah is not in the bible just to be there it means pause and think about what you just read that's exactly right it says from the reproach of him would swallow me up god shall send forth his mercy and his truth he sent you the mercy and he sent us his truth i'm so thankful i love the name brother jack true tab i'll tell you what spirit and true tabernacles because we have it amen we have the truth we have his spirit today and if you don't have it i say get it before the end of the service praise god amen so you know what i was thinking i was thinking about this you know he's going through her approach he got hurt but he didn't give up all right you know isn't it funny that sometimes that we get hurt in church that's good and we stop going all right i just want to ask you one question did you stop going to walmart when they said something to you [Applause] when the cash register or someone said something wrong or messed up a price yeah whatever it is but you're back at walmart the next week but someone hurts your feelings or the pastor says something or or someone in the church says something you know what just pray for them it says when they persecute you pray for them when things go trial hey pray for them bro abraham said when they're in the gutter pick them up i hear people hear this message about that bastion this person blasting this person i say you know what brother brahm didn't say that amen he didn't say any of that he put us always back to the bible always back to the bible yes sir amen amen but i tell you don't let somebody stop you to go from going to church because they said this or said this about you you don't stop going to the grocery store and the grocery store that food is not gonna last i might look like it last but it ain't gonna last it ain't gonna last the food ain't gonna last but this food in here it will last for your life it'll give you eternal life this morning it'll give your kids life it'll give you life it'll give you abundantly life it'll fix you to the jesus christ it'll give you something established this morning i like what daniel said you know daniel you know he said he purposed in verse eight daniel one he said eight by one eight he said daniel purposed in his heart we're talking about fixed heart in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat nor the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the uh units and he said that he might not defile himself so david didn't matter if lions were coming didn't matter what was chasing his life he said he purposed in his heart i told my wife i said you know what if anything happens to me i don't care i said you know praise god i said you can just put it on there you can mark my tomb malachi 4 5 and 6. i'm not trying to be some crazy but i'll tell you what i believe it with all my heart because it's just the scripture and i told the boys the other day we're trying to go through the whole bible with them and they were like dad you know we're going through the whole i said yes and i got a white board about that in my basement and i said we're going to go through the whole entire bible i said because the day we're living in the spirits that we're fighting out here i said if you don't know your bible you could know every quote i said but if you don't know why you believe what you believe you won't have nothing to stand on and i said you need to be established in the word of god from genesis to revelation and when someone comes up and questions you you take them back to the word of god and you say that's because it's in the bible i believe he sent them malachi 4 5 and 6 revelation 10 7. and they think oh we're fanatics i said boys you learned the front and back of this book do you think the pilot when he gets on the plane he goes well how do you turn to page six we'll crank this up we were looking at some pilot we rode by some houses the other day had your own uh had your own hangers right i said my jesus and isaac said man i want to drive one like something you don't know how to drive one what you gonna do get in there and like act like you're driving i said i ain't flying with you hallelujah i said i already get on these other planes enough we went through a storm the other day it was so bad bro jay you probably been on a lot of planes it was just bouncing and falling out of there i said lord jesus and the guy in front of me i'll tell you i pray for that whole plane i'm telling you and this black brother was sitting in front of me precious and i don't know what he was but i i didn't know i had his hands on him i was like lord jesus you saved this whole plane you save the pilots you say that i was praying for everybody and i was back there i'm telling you i was backed by the the worst place you could sit is back in the vet don't get the bad i just tried to get the cheapest seats not now i sit by the wing i learned my lesson i was in the back the lady stored her sis down she puts her drinks in his eyes she snaps in i knew she was in a hurry and she's trying to snap and all she gets is she looks at me i'm like what's wrong with you i all said she looked at me and i said you know what we gotta get this plane out of the air and she said well yeah and i said you know what the bible says she said what's that i said it says lo i'm with you always i said so get it out of the air that lady was laughing i i she wanted to laugh i put it that way that's all right and we got we landed safely and that guy looked behind me hey brother i just want to tell you i don't know you but thank you for praying for me [Applause] you know everybody's got their little thing a dentist or something or whatever they don't like to go to i'm telling you i just don't like planes that well i believe god if we go down we die but you know it is what it is but i just don't have control all right all right brother you ever push the button and it rings and you're like are they going to come or they go what's going on and they have all them buzzing noise and the pilots up there but you know what but when you hear the pilot's voice and you we were on the way we're coming to the store my brother was picking us up in sarasota and we're coming to sarasota i'm like lord have mercy he's like we've been fighting in a storm for an hour my brother we landed and he's like i'm sorry he got on the thing he said i just wanna let you know everything's gonna be all right we're gonna go around this storm and all of a sudden you just calm that's the way the lord jesus christ does with us when you're going through a storm when you're going through a trial he just says hey calm down i got this i've already experienced it that's why i came on this earth that's why i came in this earth in this bodily form he said i've been tempted in all manners i believe if you've got a sickness he can heal you this morning he's got whatever you have this morning he'll give it to you [Music] [Applause] he said daley my brother said the handwriting on the wall he said daniel an alien away from the way from home way down but watch what he did he purposed in his heart that he wouldn't defile himself with the king's doings down there he said all the king's fancy foods and all the identities he said he said that he had was to eat upon his wine liquors and purposed in his heart while he was an alien he'd keep himself from god he said amen there you are he said though the world forsake you let everybody's laughs at you and calls you every fanatical name that could be called purpose in your heart to do that which is right that's from uh the handwriting on the wall i'm so thankful i got to move for time psalms 57 8 verse 9 but see no matter what he went through he said awake me with my glory he said awake salty in the heart i myself will wake early i will praise thee no matter what he's going through he look at him he's consecrated he's sitting there going oh lord among the people i will sing unto thee among the nations that's how we got to be when we go through trials say lord i still praise you i'll still serve you if this plane falls out of the sky i'll still just say lord we go in the glory someone said the other day said man why you fly a legion i said because it's a good price he said will you up your life insurance i said no this lady this lady sit beside me rachel they were sitting there she said yes she was talking to her about it and i said man i can you can't help not talk about the lord all right it's just it's in you and she's like well you know i got insurance i remember when i was at the airport and they would but you could buy insurance before you got on the plane i was like they all they offered insurance she said yeah they had a little kiosk you'd plug your name in i didn't know they even had that she said you plug your name in before you get on the flight can you imagine oh hurry hurry up put your insurance information in i said man i might not have a whole lot of insurance i said they won't put me in the ground but i got blessed insurance that jesus is mine and i'm getting out of here one day and her eyes got real big and i said praise god i tell you me and the two little sisters over there we were what they were ladies whatever they were i said i don't care i still call i'll claim them all right they might not dress hey just because we got long hair and dresses that don't mean anything you could be covering the very act of it just because you're doing it just because and i still walked through that plane i said lord save everyone in this place lord maybe let me just say one thing that will change this this outcome in here amen i said lord give me a heart to love every one of these books because i was in their seat one day i come out speaking lies we all come out speaking lies but god grace and mercy stepped down and saved you this morning amen so i wanted to show you a demonstration for time i want to show you a demonstration this morning talking about having a heart fixed hopefully i can do it without coming through this floor and having to pay for it but i thought about this talking about having it fixed so you see this you see us affix to the board you know it has a form of godliness think about it it has a form of godliness i had to go by this last night brother jack i just the lord put on my heart and i was running the lows they look like i was crazy he said what you need this for at 9 58 i said god put on my heart so i need to buy this he said well son we closed in one minute i said please just let me get some kind of board in the nail all right but it has a form of godliness it goes to church it says it believes the message it says that i believe the quotes hey come here say what's your name joseph joseph come here buddy i want you to try to get that nail out of there back and forth see it had a form of godliness but it went all the way in [Music] it wasn't all the way in it wasn't fixed to the word of god it wasn't fixed you know joseph let me see that nail one minute all right i'll use you one more time i know that people at least always crazy i want you to get that out now you can't get it out because it's fixed to jesus christ [Applause] i want to explain something to you you know what we don't always look straight doing it [Applause] just just because you just because you're a saint of god doesn't matter you have battle scars hey you might look a little bent but you're still fixed to jesus christ you might look a little crooked this morning but you're still fixed to jesus christ you might have went through trials along the way you might have started off right come out but guess what god takes his hammer this morning and he takes it like this and he puts you in play [Applause] so he just keeps working on you brother jack solomon he said well he needs a little bit of this you know brother chris needs a lot of this [Applause] so if they look like this and they look like a brother or sister they look like [Applause] hey give well first of all we got to give god the money and then we'll get to each other [Applause] he said you robbed me because you didn't give me your tires first [Music] [Applause] yes you know even brother branham it was a process he didn't become he took he took time's progression yeah right yes sir he's working on every one of us and some of us take more time than the other when they were having me as a baby we were set up for the abortion clinic i'm trying to close get that bank brother sorry when i was when i was a kid i uh they set up the abortion clinic she went to the abortion clinic that said hey you're not gonna have this kid he's gonna be a vegetable you never talk he'll never he'll never walk all the medicine you went through all the depression you went through from being abused he said you'll never come out right mom said you know what no matter if you beat me i'm still having this baby she had me here i am today [Applause] i tell you god still lives god still cares no matter what scar you're going through i was talking to a guy the other day and he was thought we were talking and he said well i my chest this hurts and this hurts and you would never know he was burned up as a kid he said when i was a kid i was burned all the way up on my chest and i stopped and said you know we don't know what scars go behind that shirt physically mentally but i just tell you just to let god or yourself be his hands you be his feet and you just start working on that nail sometimes and say if you if you don't get anything from the service i say get fixed to jesus christ but i like what the word says in jeremiah 23 29 he said is my word like as a fire look at this this one came to me last night and i had to get up and go lowe's set the lord like a hammer that break at the rock in pieces i was having a church last night brother i couldn't put it down i was like lord boy said where you going i said well i'll see you in the morning because i'm going to have church myself the boys know it they're like dad we'll see you tomorrow but he said the word is like a hammer so imagine taking this word and every day that you read the word of god is forming that nail it's forming yourself and you're being affixed to that to the board but you're being fixed to jesus christ and as brother uh jack said one time i heard about five years ago he said this is how i fight my battles and he kept singing that song this is how i fight my you know this white boy can't sing but you know come on brother but he did he was singing this is how i fight my back i still got it on video i listen to it all the time and he's got the word of god saying this is how i fight my battles and honestly that really stood out to me because that's what it takes it's not what we can say it's what we can read in here and say lord you did it for them you'll do it for me you said i could have my inheritance i could have my inheritance you said i could have a church you said hey whatever things i ask when i pray i shall have them your prophet said hey your prophet said ask for big things hey we need a building we're going to get a building i'm just i'm telling you what i'm going to put in my bible there's not one thing that i had not wrote in this bible that hadn't come to pass i'll tell you what every day i'm going to pray every day until it happens i believe every one of you should do the same amen every one of you as the musicians come we must have it all the way in we must have not just halfway in form of godliness but all the way in the word of god everything of our life everything we possess everything we say we believe a message we believe a prophet i love malachi 4 5 it talks about the heart it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord verse 6 and it shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to the fathers least i come and smite the earth with a curse he's done that he's turned our hearts back and he hasn't if he had turned your heart back this morning i provoke you to get your heart right amen and you know what we're all gonna die one day it might be a heart attack it might be liver it might be whatever it is but i tell you if that soul's right don't matter what happens to this body it don't matter and i love what brother brown said in this he says in this scripture as they play something softly he says he says right here he says the other night he said lord gave me a message i'm resting he said the whole christian principle is based upon rest and i thought it was funny he said i woke up by 10 o'clock and here he wakes up his wife he's like look i just figured out the whole christian walk is based on rest can you imagine waking your wife up and say listen i just figured it out the whole christian wife's on rest and your wife looks at you goes i was resting i was sleeping chris i was resting why are you waking me up [Music] but he said my my yoke is light amen and i like what he says here luke 21 26 in closing men's hearts are failing for fear and for looking after those things that are coming on the earth i believe we're living soul in this day for the powers of heaven shall be shaken listen what brother brown says he says in their eyes were opened 1957 and they knew him remember if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already awaiting you know we're in war we got all these things i will read this to you i believe it will help you it says don't be scared of hydrogen bombs or no other thing as long as you got christ in your heart that's the best bomb shelter i know of thank you jesus he said that's the best bomb shelter we know of don't be scared of hydrogen bombs or no other thing as long as you've got christ's yard that's the best bomb shelter i know of it's made of feathers under his whims he said you abide he says so don't worry about those things he said you he said you're a christian but if you're not a christian you are certainly standing in an awful place he said you don't know what many your heart is going to stop beating the bible said men would die in the last days with heart trouble men's hearts fell in for fear perfects of times the stress between the nations he said look ten times as many men die as women the bible never said women's heart would be felon it said men's heart would be found that's why i believe so many homes are broke up because they don't take joshua they don't take it strong enough they don't take it and say you know what no matter what we go through we got it over over our when we walk through the threshold this house will serve god me and my house will serve the lord now says honey you leave that for the rest of my life if something ever happens to me you keep these boys in the truth you keep them in this truth and you bring them to church every time them doors are open and brother braham said get somewhere and support a pastor all right now amen he does he says get somewhere call somewhere your home church i'm blessed to know you brother i'm blessed brother nathan said hello nathan bryant's my pastor he said hello and amen and you know it's so good to know balanced ministers not someone way out to the left not someone way out to the right but someone in the middle of the road that you still can be a christian and have a good time it's not this look boys look kids this ain't a this ain't a bible just to tell you do's and don'ts but when you real i actually thought that when i was a kid i'm like man that's a lot i can't do but when you realize that he already paid it all and he already knows that he he already paid the price he just wants you to get in line with every scripture and say lord if i fall tomorrow i'm sorry lord i'm glad he's got every david and bathsheba all throughout the scriptures uh david all these ones that did bad things i'm glad he's got them in here where we can look back at it and say lord you save them you can save me i'm here to tell you young kids talking about the heart i told someone this the other day i said you know i said look you marry a christian young kids if you ever get married if i don't see you again you marry a christian and you marry someone that loves the lord more than they love you exactly yes sir more than they love life you make sure they love jesus christ more than they love everything amen and i tell you that's what will keep you together and i said you know what i told someone the other day these kids were you think i said you know i said it's better to have a broken heart [Music] than a broken home amen i said so if you need to break it up right now you'd rather have a broken heart than a broken home [Music] i don't care what age you are if you're dating somebody rather have a broken heart than a broken home so i'm here to tell you just get your heart so established on the word of god and not just on wednesday and sundays but every day let's go to him and pray lord god i know it's chopped up but father we love you it's still your word of god god i'm thankful that you you've called us out and you've placed our

hallelujah a fixed heart a fixed heart i i think we all can identify with a word that was spoken here today is a man of heart that is fastened in one place that was the definition that brother chris gave and when he used the the nail amen into the wood once he got it fastened in there brother joseph wasn't gonna pull it out amen and that that is a uh um should be an encouragement once you're fixed you're fastened amen in christ there's nothing the devil can do to pull you out of that place amen i i'm just grateful i think last week brother smiley was making a comment how god just makes us all so different and and uh you know just how the ministry's just kind of flowing and brother chris i can just imagine him coming into lowe's at 9 58 looking for a piece of wood and a man a nail and a hammer you know because he got to make this point and that's something brother chris that'll stay with us amen i'm glad they let them in that lows amen but that's something that'll stay with us i think if we kept this bullet that this board in the back everybody here that was here today would understand what it all meant but others might come say why in the world y'all got that board up there it's because our heart is fixed our mind is made up amen no turning back no turning back no turning back brother brother chris god bless you we really appreciate amen you stopping by amen and minister to our hearts today this was this was this was real real good and i'm gonna be using that um uh david got hurt but he didn't give up and he said people get hurt in church all the time but when they get hurt they talk about giving up and quitting not going back say well did you get when you when you went to walmart and you know how you how that how that cashier treated you you didn't like it you told everybody about that cashier walmart but it did not stop you from going back to walmart don't stop coming to church when you get hurt be fixed be it be established amen no matter what no matter what come no matter what goal i'm going to be fixed in christ jesus amen praise the lord let's have a word of prayer amen as we uh just prepared to dismiss you on today father we are uh so appreciative of the word of the lord that we have heard uh here today the the beautiful example that was given to us lord to be fixed and even lord how the nail was just so crooked amen but it was fixed no matter no matter what the condition was it was still fixed it wasn't going anywhere and god how you use the example just to show that sometimes lord we're just being put back into position the word of god is what uh puts us back in position we thank you for all that you're doing lord in our lives we thank you god for a beautiful reminder and lord my prayer is that if there's somebody here that is not fixed what uh what a beautiful way it was put lord that nail was barely in yeah we were going through the motions but we were not fixed and that's why we ended up in a condition worse than it was when we first started but oh god once we got fixed nothing that the enemy could do lord god that could take us out of you so lord that's the way we want to find ourselves as we leave this place today fixed in christ permanently establish oh god a part of the superstructure that's that's what we want to be father we pray your blessings upon your servant lord that you would just continue to use this ministry wherever he go bless his wife and his children oh god as they stand by side and lord we just uh we're grateful that he had the opportunity to pass this way and we pray god amen it might have been his first time but we claim it won't be his last time lord that he'll make it again hallelujah that you'll continue to use him again and oh god we're joining him lord i just love the encouragement how lord everything that he has placed inside of his bible as a request lord you have given to him and father you know we have things in our bible right now that we're we're looking for you to manifest oh god something that you've already done but there's more we know that you want to do so we're joining our brother in prayer that we're going to pray until you manifest amen we're gonna push pray until something happens hallelujah lord that is our desire amen to do that for you so we pray your blessings upon the saints as they leave this place but not your presence may you continue to watch over and keep each and every one and lord you know those that are not in our midst this morning we pray that you look upon them as well bring them back father into into the presence amen of the saints lord is our prayer it's in jesus name we ask it amen and amen let's give the lord another hand of praise hallelujah my god you can be seated amen in the presence of the lord uh we'll have the brothers come amen and they will dismiss us appropriately and god bless you we'll be back on wednesday night at 7 30 for our bible study and and uh brother brother brother chris made a statement today [Music] it says we got to be able to pay god then we can help our fellow man after we pay god and he was just talking about that he said i know why i'm going here well when you come on wednesday night you'll see why he said what he said amen it goes right into the lesson for wins and that god is a good god amen god bless your church amen [Music] [Music] [Music] you
