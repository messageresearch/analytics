musicians certainly appreciate you all tonight god bless you praise the Lord and figured that I would start dish this year off amen the youth service and just ministered little sermon tonight and I believe it hope it would be a blessing and man to not just the youth but to everyone and we just thank god there's something a little put in our heart as far as having a few services a few years ago and we were just trying to do all we can the the objective here is just to try to be a strength of encouragement to all the youth here in our area and you know we want to be faithful to that we want to be faithful next month of the weekend that the youth service would fall would be the weekend for the West go be having the meeting so we'll be there in support of those services but then the month after that we'll certainly try to be right back on track amen so we'll just keep those keep the services in prayer and the other thing is we we want to give opportunity to other young ministers to just kind of come and present the gospel and you know so this is a real nice platform for them so we trust that the Lord will just help us in our efforts if you always stand with me I want to read a man one portion of scripture out of the book of Daniel chapter 6 you all are very familiar with this story and then Daniel chapter 6 and we'll start reading at verse 10 it is a very good chapter to go back and just read over again when you have time but for the sake of time tonight we'll just read just a few verses Daniel chapter 6 verse 10 says now when Daniel knew that the right sign he went into this house and his windows and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees praise the Lord three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and made supplication before and making supplication before his God then they came near and spake before the king concerning the Kings decree has thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days save of the O king shall be cast into the den of lions the King answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the Medes and Persians which alters not then answered they and said before the king that Daniel which is other children of the captivity of Judah regardeth not the O king nor the decree that down assigned but making this petition three times a day they may unless I just found the word of Prayer father we thank you for the opportunity to read the word thank you for your spirit that has been here through this time of worship and as we got we're just entering to this little thought here tonight we pray that you bless it and that you would bless the ears that were hear the word of God tonight may it make a difference in all of our lives in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated I want to take a felt a man on Christian conviction a man Christian conviction praise the Lord and and just kind of get a start at conviction is a fixed or firm belief a man conviction means that you have a fixed or a firm belief and I believe that's something that all of us need to have if we don't have it especially the youth a man and and in this day and in this time you need to have a fix to firm belief on the Word of God that God is real a man and that we all need relationship with him I want to just read a quote here from the prophet out of the message witnesses and mani makes this statement it says then these children of Israel these Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego God's witnesses God's never been without a witness he's always now here I want I want you to get this real close God as never at any times been without a witness on earth he's always had at least one man he could put his hands on and say that's my witness it's come down to one man it's come down to one man one time and job was his only witness and Abraham in the land but God had a witness somebody's going to witness for God somewhere now after a while we want to find out what a will a witness really is of this day all right notice these men as they went down there they refuse to eat the Kings meat drink his wine they refused about to his image they were genuine true witnesses of God then there's something there then there sometimes a penalty goes with a witness I think that's something that we need to understand there being a witness for God don't mean it's going to be easy all the time right but it's a decision that you have to make that for God I live and for God I'll die so then there sometimes a penalty goes with a witness sometimes when you witness for God you have to suffer a little bit a man you have to suffer a little bit when you when you're going to be a witness for God and oftentimes people not ready to sign up for that right not the suffering part amen I want the blessing part but not the suffering part but in order for you to get the blessing you got to go through some suffering hallo you know we wouldn't be we wouldn't be talking about Dan your head you're not going through the lion's den hey man Daniel was a true witness right I mean he didn't he didn't he didn't give up I love the way the script to put it that as soon as he heard the writing was signed I mean as soon as Daniel heard that these guys that come up with the scheme Daniel went to his house not like this season and the he es conviction right he has a firm belief that he's not God no matter what man has written Daniel gonna continue to put his God first hallelujah no matter what the government's take Daniel's gonna put his God first and I've only did Daniel Amen with winning when he heard it Danny went straight to his house hallelujah not a secret Daniel opened up the windows honey when he opened up say everybody look in and see I'm not gonna hide now one hard being ain't gonna hide now I've got conviction that my god is still car whether you got lawyer you don't get love my goddess till God he had Christian conviction seating and no matter what a circumstance was Daniel was able to counter press in and and just I'm a great three-time day and you can see these guys just coming up and just watching the first time the second tough second time three we got them out of going straight to the King to Tony now you know the story they end up in that lion's den but he did it because he had Christian conviction it wasn't easy like the proper say sometimes you have to suffer a little bit because of your conviction you know what when you when you when you're in school somebody gonna talk about you because of your conviction young ladies when you dress in like a Christian hello Amen they gonna talk about you because of your conviction young man when you don't put on the shorts to play basketball they gonna say something about you because of your conviction but as Christians we need to have conviction we gotta have a fixed it's gotta be a fixed or firm belief and what I mean by that it can't change because the situation changes it can't change because the circumstance it's got to remain fixed it's got to remain fun that this is what I believe with my parents are here when they not here I still believe this fixed and firm belief we all need that as Christians we need that you know a lot of tech I was just you know just thinking on this and amen it seems that our level of conviction has dwindled right the things we would have never done years ago they're starting to be done now because we don't have conviction hallelujah now you know I you know that there's there's there's a conviction I think is a good thing wasn't one preacher told brother Brandon one time he was the Browns out doing a street meeting and now this he said that this color brother walked up to him and and when he walked up to me yeah he said he said you know what the conference is if they say yeah I think I know they say well what preacher it's like four points and they say and these points sit right over the top of your heart he's saying when you do something wrong they turn see that's conviction you feel it when it turns you say now now what happens is that if you don't yield to that conviction to just keep turning keep turning until eventually it cut its way right through and you don't even have no conviction or more so the things that you're used to think was wrong now you think they okay but but you know i'ma tell you before you got there there was some conviction you just ignore the conviction right but God got away bringing that thing all back around again but you know but but here here's the thing a lot of times what will it happen to people that you know things that we used to think was wrong now we just we don't compromise it all the way down today wrong no more let me let me go on a little further say he says I was hours I was looking at you people used to be convicted but if on your job they had a little pad like this on the job and if you put that pad in your bag and took it home conviction people would actually fit the pictures now some of y'all young people looking at me like a little simple piece of paper like that I mean if your job had a in with the job name on it now you know that ain't your pain that your company bought that thing right it's got their name on it and when people would go home with that pen they used to actually have conviction because they think that they were still in the pen from the company oh my god now that is also time where people used to feel like they was still time from the company but now people don't have that conviction anymore they'd rather than come into work they actually doing everything else but work allows that chick-fil-a on last night and I saw this lady act like she was going to take out the garbage and when she got over to the garbage can I saw just sitting there fumbling around just promise I'm not gonna take that long to take out no garbage and before I looked at before I realized she was on the phone over there talking and she was just she was just going on trying to get this message across the sunlight especially good it didn't work so she she stepped outside for a little bit got that phone and was talking and I saw coming back here huge phone like that like that like that tablet she was trying to put it inside her pocket I'm like if my boss saw that let me tell you something about it she had partial conviction because the processor can fix like she was looking around to see who saw her oh my mama but when you got real conviction you don't go on the job acting like that right if you smother put your phone in the lorca put your phone in the locker you need Christian conviction hallelujah you'll keep your job that way all right now see so you know but it used to be time that people have conviction on so many things you know there were certain places we didn't go because of our conviction there were certain people that we didn't hang out with because of our conviction there's atlas atmospheres that we don't go into because of our conviction and I hate to tell you this young people if you don't have no conviction your parents do and so when you ask them by God certain places they say no it's because of Christian conviction hallelujah no you can't go to that party no you can't go to that house no you can't do this because of my Christian convictions hallelujah see one day you're having yourself glory God says that we don't use certain language because of our Christian conviction right amen and just because you know you know sometimes our language change when we get around certain people but when you got Christian convictions no matter what they say your dad has changed the way that you talk because you realize you represent in Christ hello somebody and then we didn't take certain jobs because of our Christian convictions we didn't think we didn't think of working on Sundays because of our Christian conviction we didn't listen to certain music we didn't listen to it it wasn't on not on our phones because of our Christian conviction glory to God amen see the Hebrew boys they want to turn the bow but they would not bow because they had a certain amount of conviction they said when you when we play this music we want you to buy you say they say no our God is able to deliver us and we don't care whether you pay the music we don't play the music we will not bow see I'm gonna tell young people you got some Christian conviction you're gonna let anybody just put anything on your phone hallelujah you're gonna take it off real quick you're gonna let people just do whatever they want to do in your presence when you got Christian conviction I had a friend of mine when I got safe and then you know we got in the car and she my music exchange and they got in the car with me and and when they got in the car they turn the station I said no no no we're not gonna listen to that what's the matter with this or not I don't listen to that number I know I know I just got saved last week but I don't listen to that no more ever since last week I stopped listening to that I mean I week I mean dude caught me two weeks ago we would have been able to play that but not because God thumb did something in my heart I don't that no more they realize that this kind of changing and see your friends need to recognize that something that happened to you so you don't change when you get amongst them change the way you talk change the way that you act change the way that you read don't do all that when you get into the present you need to have Christian conviction hallelujah we not talk about just being Christians when service time starts you got to be Christian 24/7 and all over you gonna have that is you got to have some conviction some stopping points glory to God I was I was when I was in Israel I was standing in this place called Caesarea and and and and they had a Coliseum that was there and they talked about how this was the ruins of hair at the King and and the guide was telling me it's telling us telling the whole group you say you know in these Coliseum's in this place this is where the gladiators will come out and they will fight and say he's saying some of them they sometimes they fight animals and and and and went either the gap gladiator kill the animal the animal kill the gladiator but they were fighting to the death and sometimes they would fight men but they were fighting to the death and as the guy was just kind of talking about that I my mind just went back to a a testimony you know that brother branham is share divided his daughter Becky she was reading something about the gladiators you know one night she's bringing it you know bringing out to her daddy and you know it she'll tell him the story and brother branham saying you know the very first sign of Christianity is that you refuse to kill another man that was a sign that was a conviction that I'm not going to kill see I mean those Ten Commandments weren't just written just to be written but a man they became part of our life right I'm not gonna steal no matter how bad it gets teal I'm not gonna kill I'm not I'm not gonna serve a false God I'm not gonna do any of that right I mean that this is what you know this is what Daniel was standing on saying I'm not gonna have any other guys before me I'm gonna still preach to my god right see he had conviction he was holding on to the Word of God what that was to him and I saw that so you know brother Graham say the first sign of a Christian is when they refuse to kill a man now back in that time you know what I was I'm standing there in the goddess telling say that this is a place where you know they were just that man people would die right here in this pot I mean gladdy is just kids fighting to death fighting to death and the story that brother did brother branham's daughter told him say you know she was reading about this gladiator that went out and and when he went out he they threw out through a lion enemy the man he got his sword and killed a lion it through another lion and we got a sword kill the lion they didn't they threw African big big African come running up at him in and he got that African he got him down on the ground somehow and when he got him on the ground he took it took his story took it right to put it right on his neck and then it took the stories through it and he walked up into the the leaders of that day and he took off all of his armor me say as a Christian I cannot kill another person I'll kill these animals but I cannot kill another person you know that's just my conviction that I cannot do that and when he walked up there you know to the to the leaders of Rome that they said now you you you being a slave you gonna defy Rome they didn't care anything about his conviction can see sometimes with your conviction you might have to stuff a little bit but this man because he had had a conviction he say he say he'd say he said no I can't do it so they ordered the African to get up say get up and get his floor and come over here and kill him and the African did exactly what they accident do but the man gave his life willingly because of his conviction I want to read a testimony a man somebody that's willing to give willingly this is out of the message life glory to God listen to this hallelujah you got to have conviction and every everyday God has always got a witness and every day and young people this is your day God wants you to be his witnesses listen in a message life for the man who says a few days ago down in Ohio it says they said that all the children had to be sent to college they want no illiteracy in Ohio and the Amish people don't send their children to these modern high schools and they've never had on their record of all the Amish in history of one one case of juvenile delinquency let them dress different act different and be peculiar and act but they haven't had no juvenile delinquency not one case on their records of America they don't send them to them kind of places and they passed a law that they'd have to go they'd have to go to their own high schools and colleges and the old mother and father was called in because they didn't send their son and the judge that you either send them or you'll serve two years in prison I was in Middletown Ohio at the time it happened and the father said I refuse to do it sir not for being different but because that I come to America thinking that this was a freedom of religion we don't have no more democracy freedom of religion he said you are either abide by our laws or you'll pay the penalty like the rest of them would he said I refused to send him so he didn't want to send his children to these public schools I mean they want to teach him at home he said I just don't want to send them say I refuse to simmer so to judge they said I sentence you and the mother two years in the penitentiary so you don't change because of the situation you got conviction look at this say the last flower of democracy faded in that courtroom the father got up and said very well I'll spend it to save my son I'll go to prison for my son he says I don't want any of your rock and roll's in your nonsense thank God for a father with conviction it says and when he started out the unjust judge tried to justify himself by saying that remember the scripture says give Jesus Caesar what is Caesar's and he turned around and said unto God so you got to have you got to know what the Bible say yea the gifts what is Caesar's but I'm also give God what belongs to God Oh hallelujah he was he was ready to go to prison because of his connection look at this he says he says under God but it bloomed again just in a few minutes this whole quit the job the judge lost everybody on the bench and resigned their office God be blessed fulfil outstanding Americans yet there what should the church to take a stand and stand there without moving you got to be firm fixed in your belief hallelujah God is gone and if it required me to have to go to jail because of something I'm standing for it and that's just so being gotta make a way we got to have Christian conviction hallelujah hallelujah now stay with me here I got a couple of things that I just want to get out a man when we when we have this conviction you know there it comes at different stages in life while I was there on the trip there was a sister she lives in Australia and she was sharing with me how she got saved at and baptized at a very young age about six years old she was saved and baptized and you know she just wanted to serve the Lord they're very young age there's some young people that ever like that that you know man once they hear about God they just want all of God and there's others that struggle they won't God but the world is also pulling on right but you got there some way some somehow some way you got you got to figure out which way is the right way I remember the Brandon told his son Billy Paul he said son put your arms out like this it says now son if you go right you're gonna be going right but if you go left you're gonna be going wrong and say and the further you go left the harder it is to get back over here so you have to make a decision because you standing right in the middle which direction you're gonna go and always remember now if you go this way you're getting closer and closer to God but the further you go that way the further you get away from God now trust me you go that way running from God he'll find a way to catch you somehow someway and you're gonna end up with some Christian conviction whether you get it now or later but you're gonna get some conviction this system was talking about how she was just a young girl and wanted to serve the Lord and and at six years old she remembers that how her sisters encouraged her to go to a movie and when she went to the movie now I mean this was you know years ago movies ain't movies back then ain't like they are now oh my god if I could just talk to y'all just for a few minutes you know I mean it's something to see some of stuff that y'all see now we used to have to have special channels that you had to pay for to see that they have Showtime and HBO and stuff like that and you had to pay to see that and you had to see it late at night nowadays they don't care about you paying for nothing they just go they gonna push it on push it on you and in the middle of the day right amen but it take conviction say no I'm not gonna look at that it's just said she went to move in and after she fell after she was all just whatever the movie was she don't I don't she don't remember the name but whatever she saw she said don't convicted and she said I didn't want to go to the movies no more remember the brother brother brother Isaiah Brooks was talking about how he used to wear shorts he loved the swim loved to swim but one day he went swimming and and when he come out of the pool he say something discounted he didn't feel right and he said just kind of conviction came on me say he never put on a pair of shorts since that day he had Christian conviction hallelujah so you have your own personal experience with God it gives you Christian conviction Oh glory to God you all might not have heard this story but brother Billy Paul told it it's for the young people it's a conviction like I told just a little paper people used to be convicted by opinion from the job that got the job name on it if they took it from the job into one man stays convicted nowadays we I need a pen you just taking it as keep on going you don't even think nothing about it it's still it it still is this feeling it's the truth a man we need to repent anyway we're still it and walked right at him brother Billy Paul told a story back brother branham and how for the random it druvan house they got to the border late at night and they said you got it it's in there you got a net and iron got no I said you got you know you got any pecans nine got no PK ain't nobody put no pecans got he get you know everything you know accent at the board ISA dying got bang got it left the board about three hours got to his hotel wherever he was standing at night got all the luggage at the car at the bottom of the luggage pecans that somebody put in the con he didn't even know what it was dead I need y'all to just just wait weren't work with me here you mean the Holy Ghost out of all the things that God showed a profit showing them about about where this person live and you know this person is this person that but did not show him pecans and then pecans were sitting that guy he done throw three hours you know what he did because of his conviction I told Billy said get in the car we got to go back to the border Billy was sleep taught daddy we can take care of in the morning said no I told a man I didn't have him I gotta go back now and make this thing right got in his car Tod's I don't know what falling asleep at the wheel to drive all of it now there's many times brother Brandon would drive and in the into it right for him but not this time not this time this time he had to show what his what his uh what his relationship was with God's his conviction was so strong then he had the I told the man I don't have him I'm going back three hours drive back to the border telling me I did have pecans and I'm sorry that I lied master well okay all right great send them right back three hours back the other way nine hours and probably go into a prayer line the next day Christian conviction Lord we need some of that I was um let me see here I was I was blessed by by something that I saw when I was when I was in Israel God can always have a witness every day that he has a man on the earth every generation God got at least one that'll be his witness in Israel one of the requirements is that young men and young ladies have to go to the Armed Forces they have to serve at least two years that's that is a requirement you get 18 you're going to the army bottom line young lady I mean I thought we went to this was one spot we were looking at all the tanks and everything that Israel was using in some of the wars that they at fault and and they had all these young ladies coming behind young men I'm and they carrying guns 18 19 year old I mean they got gun I mean they load it and you know you're looking at like wow you know just and just don't don't don't get anyway we were out at a mall and they stand around the mall with guns right and man look at look at these look at these uh these young people well now as a soldier because you know there's this new revelation that has come out that you know all ladies didn't wear didn't want to wear pants because of you know just being in mod but they were soldiers and as a soldier they had to wear pants and you know the thing of it is is that really back in the Bible days you didn't have any women soldiers you only had men so don't justify right your Christian conviction will say no I'm not gonna wear pants hallelujah yeah I mean it you know there was a I forget where it was but there was a brother that was in the army and they had to wear shorts but his conviction was so strong that he told the army said I just don't want to wear shorts glory to God I've know two brothers like that didn't want to wear shorts in the army and you know what the army changed their rules to allow that man to wear long pants because we had Christian conviction this young lady you know you're looking at all the young ladies around and they said we gotta send unrelated it to send y'all take y'all on a tour this place I'm like okay all right we'll wait on this soldier when I was sitting around the soldier never come never come - all of a sudden it comes shoulder soldier running down the steps no gun and she had a skirt on and we looked at her and said uh she said I'm sewing so my name is Abigail and I'm gonna be taking around like okay you in the army yes how long about a year I'm sorry yeah another year where you from I'm from the United States I used to live in in Hawaii you know but my family wanted to move back here to Israel when I got when I moved back here to Israel then I had to join the army my brothers have already served now my time is sir came out now now I said she had a skirt on and so we all look and we're like okay all right okay all right we're just gonna follow you around but now you know when you're looking at all these people in the army and everybody got pants is she the only one with a skirt dude you kind of drawn to this like what what's going on here so so so you know we waited till she finished the tour and at the end I kind of got it to herself I say Abigail I need to ask what is this with you and the skirt she say that's my conviction I don't believe a woman should wear pants I said what's your faith what what faith they were Baptist Baptists that didn't believe in wearing pants Baptists right and here she is in the Israeli army as a soldier said now are you the only one where's Curtis say I am C got some time only one witness just one and that warmer bring condemnation on everybody else and when I looked at that yelling I said stood there on huh conviction mom and daddy nowhere around but this was her testimony I'm gonna wear a skirt in the army sir god bless you Abigail and after we you know we finished the tour we went to get some ice cream and everything and we saw this soldier walking up you know in the same mayor where we were to get ice cream and said that's Abigail we know or not cuz she the only one see the only one that wear that skirt man see she had Christian conviction now you know you know the gladiator him on a hat conviction in his day and Daniel might have had conviction in his day but God meet people with conviction for this day even though they might be criticized even though they might be the only one doing it but God Wolf's got what bless you for your Christian conviction young ladies she stood out like like a beacon of I mean just a like Oh Lord at least it's still some folk that believe she had no makeup she had I mean long hair she had a skirt at all in the army might be the only soldier that they ever had like that but yet in the Israeli army there was an avid gallon God need young people how to do that in your school you might be the only way but where you're standing there with Christian conviction say Lord I'm gonna live for you no matter what anybody else says you know I might I might be I might be picked that I might be criticizing me a lot of stuff might happen but it doesn't matter I'm gonna stand for you God need young people like that don't stand because your parents are standing don't be a Christian because Mom and Dad is a Christian you'd be a Christian because God's done something in your heart Daniel had it the Hebrew boys had it I remember the story that was told a man of the martyrs 40 of them that were about to be thrown into some freezing water they were I mean it was it was cold as I don't know what and they had to take off all their clothes and be thrown in this water if they did not denounce Christ and they asked the first one you're going to denounce Christ no throw them in the water and there's gonna freeze to death second when you got denounced Christ no throwing him in the water and they got all they went all the way down the that down the line got to the 39th you don't denounce Christ no I mean no I'm gonna I'm gonna stand for Christ threw him in the water 40th guy comes up you got it I was crying yes I'm gonna denounce Christ's throne is closing and went away but the soldiers standing there one soldier said no no no that was 40 that came and 40 got to die say I'm gonna take a stand for Christ right now and I'm gonna live for him and I'm gonna join these inside this freezing water took off his clothes and jumped in he had conviction God need people that a stand no matter what everybody else is doing young people with conviction I don't care where life takes you do you have conviction so I've told my daughter years ago I said you got to have guardrails and you're going through life you got to have guardrails and see the guardrails are put on the side of the road to help you from going over the sides if you don't have something to block you you go right on right on up just right on over there but you got to have something that a if you fall asleep at the wheel something you'll bump into and I push you back in the middle of the road we all need that in our life the Holy Ghost wants to be your guardrail wants to keep you wants to stabilize you there's a little statement here that I want to I want to read mmm glory to God glory to God this is a out of the the message the presence of God I'm recognizing as we're getting that I just wanted to share this a statement from Charles Finney says revival is a renewed conviction of sin and repentance followed by an intense desire to live in obedience to God it has given up one's will to God in deep humility again revival is a renewed conviction and I think that's what many of us need us as we're approaching this new year we just entered in we need to renew conviction right a revival is a renewed conviction of sin and repentance followed by an intense desire to live in obedience to God it has given up one's will to God in deep humility the statement that the Prophet makes here in the presence of God unrecognized he says I watched one time at the seashore where when was blowing and it was just shaking why it wasn't a seashore it was up at Lake Michigan I was standing out there watching the waves as they would come in and and all that sea was a jumping or the waters a jumping and the boats are rocking I thought what is that going on I thought why the lake is having a revival that's it it's jumping and shaking why there's a rushing mighty wind coming down on it I thought well you know what there is a one more drop of water in it right now than what it was when it was perfectly still no more water in it just all stirred up well now what's it stirred up about you know what a stirring up of the water does washes all the trash out of it up on the bank that's what we need a washing of humble out on the bank let the word of God have preeminence that's what we need a revival and wash all the unbelief out and all the bugs and superstitions and things come out and see that God is still God that's what we have revivals for and as we just kind of start this year off I pray that the young people were in turn to spirit of revival it's some stuff that need to be washed it's some stuff on your phones need to be washed right it's things that you that you all have done you know that I mean you had you felt them with four points you felt them but see what happens that when you you feel them if you if you let it just go on a little bit too far eventually you stop feeling the points but God brings it back to your tension because he wants you to have Christian conviction oh that type of conviction don't need mama daddy around that type of conviction don't need the past around that type of conviction will keep you when you're all by yourself like Abigail Abigail is kept and she's all by herself the only ones standing there in the army when they go to take a picture you can always fight Abigail but Abigail didn't care when she joined the armor side on my final but I'm gonna fight in a skirt the Lord blessed Abigail and the Lord bless all the young people that it takes stands like that regardless of what criticism comes our way you'll still stand for the word of God we all need Christian conviction in man the Lord bless you let's pray while the heads are bowed a man is there Amy here tonight and everybody just keep your heads bowed there is Amy here tonight so brother Jack I want that I want that Christian conviction I want to be able to take a stand even when I'm by myself the Lord has spoke to your heart tonight I just want you to lift your hand right where you are and I want to pray especially for you tonight I know God doesn't speak just to speak but oftentimes he's speaking because he knows who needs it God sees your hand tonight God sees your hand I'm gonna pray in as I'm praying you just talked to governing your own special way from your heart God we can we can look back in our lives and we can see that there were times that we were truly convicted things that we would not say places that we would not go people that we would not associate men but we look now god they're things that the enemy is just slowly creeping up on us it's like a Python wrapping himself around us trying to squeeze the very life out of us but we thank you for your word we thank you for your voice that would speak to us we could look back and see people like Daniel we can see people like the Hebrew boys who took their stand in their day and they they were Christians when it mattered most we could look at a modern-day Abigail that's right now in the army of Israel but yet standing on her convictions thank God for a young 18 year old girl that would do something like that but God you want more Abigail's that you want more Daniels you want more Hebrew boys that will stand in this day and there's some hands that have grown up in this place that acknowledged that they need Christian conviction fathers the disciples pre said Lord behold they threatened this but granite said our servants that with all boldness we may speak that word we may live the life we may do what is required of us to do and we won't be ashamed on the job that you've blessed us with we're going to be Christians in the school that you've allowed us to attend we're going to be Christians God wherever we are we're going to be Christians help us to yield to your spirit yield to your word yield to your way Amy you got get all the glory and all the honor of our lives we repent before even right now access to forgive us and that from this day for you would take us the Lord and help us to
