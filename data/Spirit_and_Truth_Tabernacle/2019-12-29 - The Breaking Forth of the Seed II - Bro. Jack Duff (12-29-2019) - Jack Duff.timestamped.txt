[1:05:04] amen to that sermon and begin a year the
[1:05:08] year the incredible and somewhere in
[1:05:10] that sermon I made a statement and I
[1:05:13] didn't because sometimes have to remind
[1:05:15] you of things but I made a statement I
[1:05:18] said brother Josue and sister Amanda
[1:05:22] were considering a manor house for those
[1:05:26] way and introduced house in Vero Beach
[1:05:29] the sister Amanda since Amanda said a
[1:05:33] little sway a nice house but is there
[1:05:36] spirit and truth tabernacle in Vero
[1:05:38] rates to Vero Beach
[1:05:41] and she said not not just any spirit of
[1:05:43] truth tabernac is the one that brother
[1:05:45] Jack passed us
[1:05:48] because if there's no spirit of truth
[1:05:50] Tabernacle Eurobeat say I don't really
[1:05:52] want to go to Vero Beach and in that
[1:05:56] sermon at the end I said God god bless
[1:05:58] you for that statement sister man
[1:06:02] and here at the end of the year I can
[1:06:04] think I can say God has blessed you for
[1:06:07] that statement

[1:14:31] okay god bless you sister koneko is so
[1:14:34] good to have you and man with us on
[1:14:35] today we put on the business cards who
[1:14:40] you invited by I should say the Holy
[1:14:41] Spirit and fight it
[1:14:45] I know God don't make mistakes a man God
[1:14:50] is God is perfect and all that he does
[1:14:53] so I want to just read a man maybe two
[1:14:59] scriptures this morning and we kind of
[1:15:03] got started and they thought a few weeks
[1:15:05] ago and I'm this priest portion of it
[1:15:10] then I said I want to come back because
[1:15:12] I got a few more things that I want to
[1:15:14] share and so I want to just maybe go
[1:15:19] into that a little bit more today if you
[1:15:22] just turn with me to mark chapter 4
[1:15:25] my man mark chapter 4 starting here at
[1:15:31] verse wide and man says and it began to
[1:15:40] teach by the seaside and there was
[1:15:45] gathered unto him a great multitude so
[1:15:47] that he entered into a ship and sent in
[1:15:49] the sea and the whole multitude was by
[1:15:51] the sea on the land that taught them
[1:15:54] many things by parables and said unto
[1:15:56] them in his doctrine hearken behold they
[1:16:01] went out a sower to Seoul by this is
[1:16:04] really something so this was verse 2
[1:16:07] says he taught unto them in his doctrine
[1:16:10] so this was very important words that
[1:16:14] Jesus was sharing right so verse 3 says
[1:16:17] hark and behold there went out a so
[1:16:19] worth to Seoul and it came to pass as he
[1:16:23] sowed some fell by the wayside
[1:16:26] the fowls of the air came and devoured
[1:16:28] it up some fell on stony ground where it
[1:16:32] had not much earth and immediately it
[1:16:34] sprang up because it had no death of
[1:16:36] Earth and you know we wanna we want to
[1:16:41] watch this parable very closely
[1:16:44] you know the even even when the fowls
[1:16:49] came and devoured the seed that was sown
[1:16:54] it does not mean that the seed did not
[1:16:57] have an opportunity to grow hallelujah
[1:17:01] the reason for that is because when the
[1:17:04] bird eats it it passes through the bird
[1:17:08] the birds system and the bird has to let
[1:17:11] it go again there's just some seeds grow
[1:17:15] through stuff sometimes have to just
[1:17:24] come through some stuff but it does not
[1:17:27] stop the growth amen
[1:17:32] all right verse verse five again some
[1:17:37] fell on stony ground where it had not
[1:17:39] much earth and immediately it sprang up
[1:17:42] so now even when it was on stony ground
[1:17:44] it was still growing right because it
[1:17:48] had no depth of it didn't have much
[1:17:50] earth so there was conditions but it did
[1:17:52] grow for a little bit now it did grow
[1:17:54] for a little bit I don't want to just
[1:17:56] have a little bit of growth amen I want
[1:17:58] full potential praise God
[1:18:01] a man verse verse six says but when the
[1:18:05] Sun was up it was scorched and because
[1:18:09] it had no root it withered away right a
[1:18:13] menace conditions for not being rooted
[1:18:15] alright a man and some fell among thorns
[1:18:20] and the thorns grew up now for the
[1:18:24] thorns to grow up the seed that was
[1:18:26] actually amongst the thorns was also
[1:18:29] growing
[1:18:29] they were both experiencing growth
[1:18:32] hallelujah catch that now so they're
[1:18:35] both experiencing growth the problem is
[1:18:37] a man said some fell on thorns and the
[1:18:39] thorns grew up and choked did and it
[1:18:42] yielded no fruit because it was growing
[1:18:44] amongst thorns it got choked out
[1:18:46] hallelujah yielded no fruit and an other
[1:18:50] fell on good ground and dear yield fruit
[1:18:55] that sprang up and increased and brought
[1:18:58] forth some 30 some 60 and some 100 and
[1:19:03] we said unto them he that hath ears to
[1:19:05] hear let
[1:19:07] here alright let's leave that one there
[1:19:11] and then we'll probably come back and
[1:19:13] pick it up in a little bit but let's
[1:19:14] turn over to Genesis 1 verse 11 here in
[1:19:20] Genesis 1 praise the Lord
[1:19:30] from the very beginning God was
[1:19:32] concerned about this process a man
[1:19:36] Genesis 1 in verse 11 says and God said
[1:19:40] let the earth bring forth grass leather
[1:19:44] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:19:47] yielding fruit after his kind a man
[1:19:52] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[1:19:58] and it was so and the earth brought
[1:20:02] forth grass an herb yielding seed after
[1:20:05] his kind and the tree yielding fruit
[1:20:08] whose seed was in itself after his kind
[1:20:11] and God saw that it was good and the
[1:20:15] evening and the morning were the third
[1:20:18] day amen let's pray over what we have
[1:20:22] read father we are so appreciative of
[1:20:27] the word of the Lord we pray father the
[1:20:31] Holy Ghost would make things clear to us
[1:20:34] as we just embarked upon this thought
[1:20:36] thank you for the anointing that has
[1:20:38] been in the service through the worship
[1:20:40] and the specials and everything that has
[1:20:43] happened Lord we're going into a new
[1:20:45] year encourage we're going into new year
[1:20:48] strengthen looking a man back over the
[1:20:51] year and all of the various tests and
[1:20:52] trials but yet we're still standing in
[1:20:54] the house of God and a man willing to
[1:20:57] give God praise and honor and glory
[1:20:58] shows that we got the victory no matter
[1:21:01] what it is that we face so father we
[1:21:03] thank you for the incredible things that
[1:21:05] you've done and we know that Lord is
[1:21:08] just a continuation a man that we will
[1:21:10] flow into and and our confidence and our
[1:21:13] hope and our faith is in you we just
[1:21:15] trust you God and as we enter this
[1:21:17] thought Lord how
[1:21:18] it's to take this Lord and build a
[1:21:20] Punnett that you might get glory and
[1:21:22] honor out of our lives it's in Jesus
[1:21:24] name we pray amen they man god bless you
[1:21:27] can be seated praise the Lord so we want
[1:21:36] to just continue our journey amen on the
[1:21:40] breaking forth of the seat amen the
[1:21:43] breaking forth of the seat and I want to
[1:21:48] just sum we talked about this a little
[1:21:50] bit a few weeks ago but I want to just
[1:21:51] hit a few things and then I will go
[1:21:54] forward I won't read all of this
[1:21:57] a man so don't worry about pulling this
[1:21:59] close up but I'll just tell you where
[1:22:02] they are
[1:22:03] this message changed with God brother
[1:22:05] Branham makes a statement says Jesus
[1:22:06] said the word is a seed that a source
[1:22:09] source sold and a seed if it's Germa
[1:22:13] ties if it's a Dermott AR the sun and
[1:22:23] moisture will bring forth the life
[1:22:26] that's in the seed right and here's the
[1:22:29] thing we gotta get the seed amen
[1:22:32] under right conditions a both Sun and
[1:22:36] moisture oh come on somebody a man as I
[1:22:41] look around I see a bunch of seeds in
[1:22:42] here
[1:22:43] I see seeds all over the place and in
[1:22:46] order to get the seed to come forth what
[1:22:49] God put in it before the seed amen
[1:22:52] was created alright what God puts
[1:22:55] something in that seed and in order to
[1:22:57] get that seed to express what God put in
[1:23:00] it we must get the seed a man in there
[1:23:04] under the right conditions of the Sun
[1:23:07] and moisture hallelujah if I could just
[1:23:11] a man just go a little further he says
[1:23:13] it will bring forth the life that's in
[1:23:15] the seed all right now another little
[1:23:17] statement that he makes he says the
[1:23:19] Bible said that God is in the world and
[1:23:21] this is
[1:23:21] the message investments just a quick
[1:23:23] statement the Bible said that God is in
[1:23:25] the world he is the word and if the word
[1:23:29] in you it produces God again hallelujah
[1:23:36] if the word is in you it produces God
[1:23:42] again and I an order for to produce God
[1:23:44] again we must put it under the right
[1:23:47] conditions Amen of Sun and moisture
[1:23:50] Oh church I hope we get this amen
[1:23:54] what is it what God placed in you when
[1:23:57] it's put in the right condition it will
[1:24:00] bring forth God again hallelujah glory
[1:24:05] to God amen it will bring it will
[1:24:08] produce God again this is this is what
[1:24:10] he tells us now I want to pull this one
[1:24:12] up this is out of that the seat shall
[1:24:14] not be heir with the shuk Amen the
[1:24:16] Prophet makes this statement and this is
[1:24:18] where we get our thought from about the
[1:24:19] breaking forth of the sea amen
[1:24:22] it says in the message the sea should
[1:24:25] not be here with a shut it says but now
[1:24:28] we're standing at the time of the seat
[1:24:31] now we're spending at the time of the
[1:24:35] seat now the sea will hold I'm going to
[1:24:40] tell you to I tell you the truth amen
[1:24:43] win it win it when a flower is going
[1:24:46] through winter everything in the flower
[1:24:50] dies right era it's only one thing in
[1:24:54] the flower that does not die right but
[1:24:57] the leaves will come off right amen
[1:25:00] you know you won't even see anymore the
[1:25:03] still right roots and everything else
[1:25:06] right on it seem like everything of that
[1:25:09] flower died but but before the flower
[1:25:12] actually enters into a winter season I
[1:25:15] hope y'all stay with me I said it for
[1:25:18] what i'ma say it again before the
[1:25:20] our interest into winter season the
[1:25:23] flower always trots a seed that's why
[1:25:27] the Prophet said the sea will hold
[1:25:30] because the Amen so when it goes to
[1:25:32] winter season it drops even though
[1:25:35] everything else was there it dropped
[1:25:36] that see you might not even be able to
[1:25:39] find the seed the scene actually freezes
[1:25:46] winter will freeze the sea but when the
[1:25:49] Sun began to come out well in the
[1:25:52] springtime amen it begins to melt the
[1:25:56] four songs around the sea somebody's in
[1:25:59] winter season right now
[1:26:01] but don't worry after winter it's a law
[1:26:04] of God after winter you've gotta go
[1:26:06] through spring rains cold and I'm
[1:26:10] looking forward to spring season some
[1:26:13] season get ready to come fall hallelujah
[1:26:16] all glory to God that's see me by going
[1:26:22] into the earth that winter before went
[1:26:24] to buy that seed being dropped in the
[1:26:26] earth what happens in spring is that we
[1:26:28] don't see a different flower we actually
[1:26:33] see the same flower and the process
[1:26:37] repeats itself because there's a low and
[1:26:41] where is the law the law is found inside
[1:26:45] the scene
[1:26:46] [Applause]
[1:26:51] it is the smallest part of this whole
[1:26:55] process but there's a lot of guts there
[1:26:58] and it's gonna reproduce yourself over
[1:27:01] and over and over again let me read this
[1:27:05] this quote here my god I love this hey
[1:27:09] Manny Manny man they may say not a seat
[1:27:13] will hold the seed will hold a man what
[1:27:20] support cooperate with the seed holding
[1:27:24] it it was set there for that purpose to
[1:27:27] hold it Amen because as the Sun comes up
[1:27:31] in the early spring upon the wheat watch
[1:27:35] the whole nature through the season roll
[1:27:37] through the day roll everything rolled
[1:27:40] just perfectly right with God
[1:27:42] amen can I say that again everything
[1:27:45] rolled just perfectly right with God
[1:27:48] ain't nothing out of Cana nothing out of
[1:27:51] cater amen all things are working
[1:27:54] together for your good because you're
[1:27:56] called according to his purpose glory to
[1:27:59] God says everything roll just perfectly
[1:28:01] right with God
[1:28:03] now when that warm Sun begins to shine
[1:28:06] upon the seat it breaks forth and that's
[1:28:11] where we get the breaking amen forth of
[1:28:13] the sea when the warm Sun begins to
[1:28:16] shine upon the seat it breaks forth
[1:28:19] hallelujah amen it says but the world
[1:28:23] has to be in a certain position to make
[1:28:28] that sea break forth out of the dirt I
[1:28:32] like that the world and if I could just
[1:28:35] put it this way your world
[1:28:40] your world has to be in a certain
[1:28:43] position in order to make the seed break
[1:28:49] for hallelujah and see this is this is a
[1:28:54] thing you don't even have a choice in
[1:28:56] this right if God has equipped you with
[1:29:00] a particular seed then it's got to come
[1:29:04] forth if we can get it under the right
[1:29:06] conditions give the right amount of Sun
[1:29:09] on the right all right right amount of
[1:29:10] moisture it will break forth you can't
[1:29:14] even stop it I don't know if we get that
[1:29:19] I don't care how hard you try you can't
[1:29:24] even stop this from happening the reason
[1:29:27] you can't stop it cuz God place the law
[1:29:30] in the sea oh god help us Jesus the
[1:29:35] world has to be in a certain position to
[1:29:38] make that seed break forth out of the
[1:29:40] dirt
[1:29:40] it has to come around this away and get
[1:29:44] it a certain position to make that seed
[1:29:45] come forth it had to come that way to
[1:29:48] get it up out of the Dark Age now I'll
[1:29:52] come back to that hopefully in a little
[1:29:54] bit but you know I was talking to a man
[1:29:56] about this and and and and I and I went
[1:30:00] just did a little study on these seeds I
[1:30:03] had to go to a little children's website
[1:30:05] called cool kid facts a man I mean you
[1:30:09] want to understand these things and
[1:30:11] sometimes if you just look at it look at
[1:30:13] it from a child's perspective it begin
[1:30:15] to make a little bit more sense to you
[1:30:17] amen but as I was studying on this
[1:30:20] little website I found something out
[1:30:23] about a seed say inside a seat is an
[1:30:26] embryo inside the seat right this little
[1:30:31] I mean my sort the seat is so small but
[1:30:34] inside of it you can't see it but
[1:30:37] there's an embryo and and what the
[1:30:40] embryo is it's a tiny plant in the sea
[1:30:43] and the endosperm which a small leaves
[1:30:47] which feed the embryo so it's got this
[1:30:50] the endosperm the leaves and everything
[1:30:52] all inside say the outside of the seat
[1:30:54] has a coat and it acts as protection for
[1:30:58] the embryo to make sure it's safe
[1:31:00] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:31:02] stay with me the embryo is safely stored
[1:31:05] inside the coat now you don't see that
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:09] the embryo is simply stored inside the
[1:31:12] coat waiting for the perfect time to
[1:31:16] begin terminating the embryo is inside
[1:31:20] the coat it's just waiting for the
[1:31:22] perfect time to begin germinating glory
[1:31:25] to God and that means it's going to
[1:31:26] start growing hallelujah when the seed
[1:31:29] begins to Germany it's starting to grow
[1:31:32] hallelujah glory to God and see what's
[1:31:34] happened is that that that little place
[1:31:36] that's on the inside cannot remain on
[1:31:39] the inside will it start germinating the
[1:31:41] little plants out and this ain't gonna
[1:31:43] be enough for me and the more it absorbs
[1:31:46] moisture and the more it absorbs the Sun
[1:31:50] all of a sudden before you know what's
[1:31:52] on the inside as he begins to sprout out
[1:31:55] now you still don't know what kind of
[1:31:57] seed it is but it's going through a
[1:31:59] process of growing a man church
[1:32:03] hallelujah
[1:32:05] events that see will reach maturity
[1:32:08] glory to God and that's what we expected
[1:32:10] from some of God's people to reach a
[1:32:13] place of maturity and God when we reach
[1:32:16] maturity and we shall look like Jesus we
[1:32:20] should talk like Jesus we should act
[1:32:22] like Jesus but I want you to understand
[1:32:27] the potential Center a man for you to
[1:32:29] look like Jesus and act like Jesus and
[1:32:32] talk like those potentials are already
[1:32:35] laying inside of you we just need to put
[1:32:38] you under
[1:32:39] condition in the right situation and did
[1:32:43] it express itself spoken one is already
[1:32:49] in you Amen the spoken word Paulo is
[1:32:56] already laying inside of you but once
[1:33:00] you come into the right condition it
[1:33:02] will express itself Oh search Oh sir
[1:33:07] stay with me here I'll tell you glory to
[1:33:10] God I thank God for this it says it says
[1:33:13] I'm distance the website says the embryo
[1:33:16] safely stored inside the coat waiting
[1:33:18] for the perfect time to begin
[1:33:20] germinating which means that it starts
[1:33:22] growing glory to God now you know why
[1:33:25] that thing is growing inside the seeds
[1:33:27] you can't see it you know and I was
[1:33:30] saying this before you know you look at
[1:33:31] people and you don't even really you
[1:33:33] don't know what's going on the inside of
[1:33:34] them you look at the outside and I don't
[1:33:38] see nothing now if it's a seat a man
[1:33:41] there then just give it time it's
[1:33:43] waiting for the perfect time to start
[1:33:44] manifesting itself glory to God glory to
[1:33:48] God
[1:33:49] look you says this discuss this this
[1:33:51] website that the seed needs the right
[1:33:54] conditions to germinate and they may
[1:33:57] have to wait for years before those
[1:33:59] conditions are right it needs the right
[1:34:03] conditions and it may have to wait for
[1:34:04] years and do you realize why you're
[1:34:06] waiting for years you might get
[1:34:08] discouraged you might think that this
[1:34:10] has never produced anything and you
[1:34:12] might get a man tempted to go dig it up
[1:34:15] no don't dig it up commit it to the
[1:34:17] earth and what's at the right time when
[1:34:20] the conditions are just right watch it
[1:34:24] come forth Amen God knows the conditions
[1:34:29] we might not know the conditions there
[1:34:32] you know there it's there you know I
[1:34:34] know I know that there's a they say
[1:34:36] everybody to go to jail get jailhouse
[1:34:38] religion say everybody go but you know
[1:34:40] some people really get
[1:34:42] touch with God when they go through a
[1:34:44] situation like that some people be flat
[1:34:47] on their back in the hospital before
[1:34:49] they actually begin to give God their
[1:34:52] attention the condition has to be right
[1:34:55] the situation has to be right the sea
[1:34:58] will come for Oh glory glory glory our
[1:35:03] trials put us in condition our trials
[1:35:07] position us for for the Sun they hit us
[1:35:09] just right oh I don't know if we hit it
[1:35:12] I don't know if we're here but the Sun
[1:35:14] will hit us just right and you know what
[1:35:17] let me keep going here I got it now I
[1:35:19] don't want to get ahead of myself a man
[1:35:21] sees need the right condition to
[1:35:23] germinate and they might have to wait
[1:35:25] four years before the conditions are
[1:35:27] right sometimes we might think they're
[1:35:29] dead it's just waiting on the right
[1:35:31] condition listen some seed needs light
[1:35:34] to germinate and others need darkness
[1:35:39] some will germinate or they'll start
[1:35:42] growing in light but others will grow in
[1:35:44] darkness hallelujah oh my you know I
[1:35:49] gotta keep going but all seas need
[1:35:53] moisture all seas need moisture oxygen
[1:35:56] and the right temperature to Germany now
[1:35:58] let it look look at this the statement
[1:36:00] that they may hear that just bless me
[1:36:02] seeds need to pass through the process
[1:36:07] called Scarah fication all seeds must go
[1:36:13] through a process called Scarah fication
[1:36:17] and this means that the hard C coat
[1:36:22] changes the outer shell of the seat
[1:36:25] begins to change and the reason that the
[1:36:28] outer shell is changing is that it
[1:36:31] allows moisture to enter into the embryo
[1:36:37] you know how some people be so hard
[1:36:40] they don't want nothing to do with God
[1:36:43] they so tough on the outside but when
[1:36:46] the conditions change brother let me
[1:36:50] tell you something your condition will
[1:36:53] change system your condition will change
[1:36:56] if you belong to God it is impossible
[1:37:01] for God to lose you all that the father
[1:37:05] has given me will come that's his
[1:37:08] promise so he has allowed a situation to
[1:37:11] change a lost job my culture situation
[1:37:16] to change a lost car might coach your
[1:37:21] situation to change there are many
[1:37:23] things that can happen to you in your
[1:37:25] life that will cause your situation to
[1:37:28] change sometimes losing a loved one
[1:37:32] causes your situation to change it
[1:37:35] actually takes our hard-shell where
[1:37:38] people can talk to you before they can
[1:37:41] say nothing to you before now all of us
[1:37:43] say you just open up lose this a little
[1:37:46] bit and you know one word strike that
[1:37:49] seat things begin to change
[1:37:55] look at this
[1:37:57] Scarah fication a man is when the heart
[1:38:01] Seco changes to allow moisture to get in
[1:38:05] they said now scarification happens
[1:38:08] naturally in a number of ways now listen
[1:38:10] to this for example scarification can
[1:38:14] happen through freezing temperatures so
[1:38:17] remember I just said that you know see
[1:38:19] drops right before winter that seed
[1:38:22] actually freezes so scared for keishon
[1:38:25] it's happening and it's going to
[1:38:26] actually produce growth watch this
[1:38:28] Scarah fication can happen through
[1:38:30] freezing temperatures temperatures also
[1:38:33] scare fication happens when a seed
[1:38:35] passes through the digestive tract of an
[1:38:38] animal hallelujah amen that's why I say
[1:38:42] when when Jesus spoke about the fowls
[1:38:44] you know the fowl may take it and run
[1:38:46] off with it but that same see can be
[1:38:48] replanted
[1:38:50] because it went through the digestive
[1:38:51] tract of the animal and now it can't
[1:38:53] bring forth you just might have to go
[1:38:55] you know go through some stuff but it is
[1:38:58] still bring forth yeah
[1:39:02] look listen it's in the ghazal says once
[1:39:05] the conditions are right the plant
[1:39:07] starts the plant inside starts to grow
[1:39:11] and get bigger
[1:39:12] it pushes open the Seco a bit like a
[1:39:16] chick hatching out of an egg tiny leaves
[1:39:19] appear and they push out of the soil
[1:39:22] brother I'm looking for some stuff to
[1:39:24] push out next year even if it's a tiny
[1:39:29] leaf praise for the tiny me full of rain
[1:39:38] just let me see the the cloud the size
[1:39:41] of a man's hand that's enough for me to
[1:39:45] begin to tell everybody it's gonna rain
[1:39:48] please God I know it's gonna grow to
[1:39:56] full maturity just a little bit it's the
[1:40:00] breaking forth of the seat just a little
[1:40:03] bit just a little bit let me go on with
[1:40:07] this I love this this quote here I am
[1:40:09] the resurrection of life brother Branham
[1:40:11] who makes a statement that just goes
[1:40:13] right along what we just read from this
[1:40:15] website the man he says now God has a
[1:40:20] funeral procession for the flower seem
[1:40:25] strange says but the little seed is
[1:40:29] laying on the ground then the fall rain
[1:40:33] comes now can you imagine nah nah y'all
[1:40:36] got to catch this the the seed dropped
[1:40:39] from the flower before winter and the
[1:40:43] seed actually just nobody planted it it
[1:40:46] just laid on the ground it just laid on
[1:40:51] the ground it says then the fall rain
[1:40:55] come oh can I can I just I just I want
[1:40:58] to break into these things you know
[1:41:00] because the the
[1:41:01] the bird could actually take the seat
[1:41:03] and take off somewhere else stay with me
[1:41:08] the bird could take the seat from this
[1:41:11] place right here and take off somewhere
[1:41:13] else and when it releases an out of his
[1:41:15] digestive tract it's gonna grow where it
[1:41:18] is planning Oh hallelujah
[1:41:23] you might end up in a whole nother
[1:41:25] country but you'll start growing because
[1:41:29] there was a love inside the sea so you
[1:41:37] win it when it's planted right in a spot
[1:41:40] producing hallelujah watch this watch
[1:41:45] this
[1:41:46] he says mine says he says the little
[1:41:51] seed is laying on the ground then the
[1:41:54] fall rains come like tears dropping from
[1:42:01] the sky and pass down upon this little
[1:42:04] seed until it buries it so the rain is
[1:42:07] actually coming to do what bury it the
[1:42:13] Holy Spirit rain comes to burial seat
[1:42:17] nobody else planted it nobody touched it
[1:42:21] but when the Holy Spirit rain comes it
[1:42:23] buries your seat
[1:42:25] Oh God is so smart listen listen it says
[1:42:31] and along comes the cold winter now the
[1:42:35] petals are gone and then the stock is
[1:42:38] cold the bowl in the ground the roots is
[1:42:42] dried up says oh the sea when the winter
[1:42:46] freeze it freezes the sea it burns the
[1:42:50] seat open the Pope runs out look now we
[1:42:54] get a loan February March there's no
[1:42:57] pedal no stop no snow signal Pablo
[1:43:01] nothing is that the
[1:43:02] end of that flower can see when you're
[1:43:05] looking at people and they went to see
[1:43:06] so you might think they've all washed up
[1:43:08] but I got good news that's not the end
[1:43:11] of the flower hey we get ready see some
[1:43:15] some saw some of God's radiance
[1:43:18] that's what brother Jerry told us we are
[1:43:20] that we're the radiance of God but we
[1:43:23] got to go through our seasons before we
[1:43:25] can radiate hallelujah listen it's at
[1:43:29] the end of the flower not by no means
[1:43:32] there is a little charm of life
[1:43:35] somewhere within that seat that you
[1:43:39] might give the dirt in your hands and
[1:43:41] take it to the laboratory and let the
[1:43:43] scientists examine it back and forth and
[1:43:46] he'll never find that Jermel life God
[1:43:50] hid it I love this church that the
[1:43:54] scientists may never find it Amen by God
[1:43:57] hate it and see sometimes when you're
[1:44:00] going through various trials folk will
[1:44:02] give up on your folk will quit on you
[1:44:04] right folk will say will write you
[1:44:06] off amen because they think they have
[1:44:09] you underneath their their microscope
[1:44:12] they can't see nothing amen they can't
[1:44:15] see anything so they just give up on you
[1:44:17] but God hate it God hid it glory but
[1:44:26] just as soon as the world rocks around
[1:44:29] in the solar system until it gets around
[1:44:33] to where the Sun begins to strike the
[1:44:35] earth became you cannot have that life
[1:44:40] brother when the asteroid strikes it you
[1:44:44] can't hide it you can't stop him from
[1:44:47] coming to church
[1:44:49] they might have been due season you may
[1:44:50] see him nowhere around but all of a
[1:44:52] sudden the sea begins to show where was
[1:44:56] inside it can't stop praising God it
[1:45:00] can't stop worship Him I got to get to
[1:45:03] church
[1:45:03] Friday night Wednesday night send me
[1:45:07] more I want to be in the house of God
[1:45:10] something is structure.c glory
[1:45:16] I believe this search I believe this and
[1:45:20] I'm preaching it because it's what I'm
[1:45:22] looking for
[1:45:23] look at this if you lay a concrete walk
[1:45:29] down through your yard on top of the
[1:45:34] grass where the next summer
[1:45:38] where is the most grass set it says
[1:45:44] right around the size of the walk a man
[1:45:48] says why it's that light that was laying
[1:45:50] beneath that concrete and when it comes
[1:45:54] springtime though a rock lean on it oh
[1:45:58] Jesus
[1:45:59] because some spare me and see my the
[1:46:02] devil got us just mash down with this
[1:46:04] sin with we got our counter stuff laying
[1:46:06] though a rocket sleigh on it though
[1:46:10] trouble surrounds it though our Rockets
[1:46:13] laying on it hallelujah glory to God it
[1:46:18] sets a rock laying on it it will not
[1:46:21] hide it you know that's the best best
[1:46:26] accident thickest grass and the
[1:46:27] strongest grass that's growing
[1:46:28] underneath the rock even when you cut
[1:46:32] off the edges you still ain't got to the
[1:46:34] roots and since you ain't get to the
[1:46:38] roots guess what's gonna happen it'll
[1:46:42] come right back praise God this is a
[1:46:46] losing battle that you're fighting
[1:46:49] oh Jesus I've ceased I just I need the
[1:46:53] devil to know that saying you might have
[1:46:55] put some people on the rock thought you
[1:46:58] had them buried but because the s/o in a
[1:47:02] striking underneath the rock they gonna
[1:47:05] come back stronger than before
[1:47:08] oh when it comes to springtime throw a
[1:47:14] rock laying on it it was not hot it the
[1:47:17] light will weed its way right through
[1:47:19] that's what makes so much grass around
[1:47:22] the edge of the wall you cannot hide
[1:47:25] life it has to come up because God has
[1:47:28] put the the Sun s you in over this the
[1:47:32] Botany life and it controls Botany life
[1:47:35] alright I thank God for that now I've
[1:47:39] got a couple other things that I just
[1:47:41] want to share here this next one out of
[1:47:44] wisdom versus faith wisdom versus faith
[1:47:48] oh Jesus
[1:47:51] and and now when we talk about this we
[1:47:54] can we can see this in the natural but
[1:47:56] I'm leaning more a man towards the
[1:47:59] spiritual this morning because this see
[1:48:03] we're talking about the seed of God
[1:48:04] that's laying on the inside of believers
[1:48:06] and sometimes when we're going through
[1:48:08] rocky situations in life or whatever it
[1:48:12] is it look like we're we're hopeless
[1:48:13] we're helpless but if there's a seed
[1:48:15] there if you put it in the right
[1:48:16] conditions it's gonna sprout it's gonna
[1:48:19] come forth a man no matter no matter I
[1:48:22] mean as long as the soil is right the
[1:48:24] Sun is right the moisture is right it
[1:48:25] will come forth hallelujah it will be
[1:48:29] everything that God predestinated it to
[1:48:31] be a man church now I made this
[1:48:35] statement before and and let me just get
[1:48:39] this again hallelujah brother Branham
[1:48:42] made a statement the word the word
[1:48:45] because there's a word see in you glory
[1:48:47] to God that word can not come forth or
[1:48:50] cannot grow in denominations it can't
[1:48:55] grow
[1:48:57] I want to say that again amen if you've
[1:49:01] ever tried it to go to denominational
[1:49:03] Church because of what's on the inside
[1:49:05] of you you cannot digest what they're
[1:49:11] serving hallelujah
[1:49:14] you can't agree with what they're
[1:49:15] serving amen your experience only goes
[1:49:19] so far in a denominational Church but if
[1:49:22] you're ever gonna be like Jesus you're
[1:49:24] ever gonna talk and walk like Jesus you
[1:49:26] will never get there by going to the
[1:49:28] nomination Church hallelujah glory to
[1:49:34] God and see God amen we will read this
[1:49:37] and say the word is a seed and when the
[1:49:41] when the scriptures say that the word is
[1:49:43] a seat well the word was god hallelujah
[1:49:46] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:49:49] us so we were talking about the word as
[1:49:51] a seed we said that is God Himself in
[1:49:53] that seat and when God produces amen
[1:49:56] another seed that means God producing
[1:49:59] himself hallelujah if you were made in
[1:50:03] his image if you came just like apple
[1:50:06] has to produce apples God produces God
[1:50:10] all this producers are just bananas
[1:50:13] producers in the bananas God produces
[1:50:16] God and if you already see the God that
[1:50:19] you must produce God nothing short of it
[1:50:26] it must look like God it must like God
[1:50:36] [Applause]
[1:50:40] what you think isn't in God see himself
[1:50:43] a man the same thing you see the apple
[1:50:47] tree you I'll be expected of seeing
[1:50:49] yourself as a son of God and a supporter
[1:50:52] of God hallelujah let me let me a word
[1:50:56] the word cannot grow in denominations
[1:50:59] Amen brother branham say
[1:51:02] go seize of the Bible cannot grow in the
[1:51:05] atmosphere of wisdom Holy Ghost sees of
[1:51:10] the Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere
[1:51:13] of wisdom what we need is faith
[1:51:16] hallelujah it'll grow in an atmosphere
[1:51:18] of faith but not an atmosphere of wisdom
[1:51:20] let me go amen let me read this this
[1:51:23] little statement here from wisdom versus
[1:51:25] faith says how could a lily live amen a
[1:51:30] lily seed seed seed live and grow when
[1:51:34] it thrives on waters grow in one of
[1:51:38] those dusty denominations he says how
[1:51:41] could it do it when it thrives on water
[1:51:45] water is a spirit they have a form of
[1:51:49] godliness but they're neither power of
[1:51:51] the Spirit amen
[1:51:53] see though the word falls on them it
[1:51:58] can't grow hallelujah and if you just
[1:52:02] notice anybody that's ever come in
[1:52:04] contact with this message
[1:52:05] I wanna I'm gonna say 100% but probably
[1:52:08] well over 90% they'll leave the message
[1:52:11] and they'll go to the denominational
[1:52:13] Church but they can't stay in the church
[1:52:14] that they go to they get out of that
[1:52:16] church and go to another church they get
[1:52:19] out of that church and go to another
[1:52:20] church they can't stay in those
[1:52:21] conditions that there's a reason why
[1:52:23] because that seed that's on the inside
[1:52:25] of them will not grow under those
[1:52:28] conditions we're trying to get everybody
[1:52:31] in the right condition sitting in the
[1:52:34] right atmosphere then we'll see what's
[1:52:36] inside of there then the sson can strike
[1:52:40] it with water with moisture and we'll
[1:52:42] see God produce God himself again look
[1:52:46] at this Pro look at what it says amen
[1:52:49] they have a form of guns but deny the
[1:52:51] power of the Spirit see though the word
[1:52:53] falls on them it can't grow it can't
[1:52:55] grow just like the word was on Eve but
[1:52:58] it couldn't grow just like the word was
[1:53:03] on Eve but it couldn't grow it says why
[1:53:07] accepted wisdom Satan's wisdom the work
[1:53:11] comes to them the word falls upon them
[1:53:15] sure it does a man
[1:53:18] growth in a fall of them they can hear
[1:53:20] the word preach but the issues they'll
[1:53:22] never grow they'll never grow hallelujah
[1:53:26] hallelu if you want to come a man into a
[1:53:28] full statue of a perfect man you got to
[1:53:30] get somewhere where they preaching that
[1:53:32] look at this hallelujah I want to just
[1:53:37] go back to this scripture and mark for
[1:53:40] now Jesus gave the parable of these
[1:53:44] different grounds and as I was sharing
[1:53:46] with you amen there are that the see was
[1:53:49] growing it certainly looked like it was
[1:53:51] growing Amen in these conditions but it
[1:53:53] just it it didn't have anything to keep
[1:53:56] it glory to God went when the trials
[1:53:59] came it didn't have anything to keep it
[1:54:01] glory to God a man and and and we want
[1:54:04] to make sure that we're on good ground
[1:54:05] that this seed is growing on good ground
[1:54:07] I'd rather bring 434 or something then
[1:54:11] bring forth nothing at all right so when
[1:54:14] it's on good ground there it will
[1:54:16] increase and it will produce something
[1:54:18] some 30 some 60 some 100 now my goal is
[1:54:23] 100
[1:54:24] I want maximum potential hallelujah
[1:54:29] well I settle for half way I want
[1:54:31] maximum potential if that's what God has
[1:54:33] for me that's what I want maximum I want
[1:54:36] to maximize my opportunities with God
[1:54:38] hallelujah
[1:54:40] now Jesus gives a man some clarification
[1:54:43] let's go to mark 4 and verse 10 Amen for
[1:54:46] the sake of time glory to God
[1:54:49] we'll just kind of pick it up right
[1:54:50] there it says and when he was alone they
[1:54:54] that were about him with the twelve acts
[1:54:58] of him the parable it says and he said
[1:55:01] unto them unto you it is given to know
[1:55:04] the mystery of the kingdom of God but
[1:55:07] unto them that without all these things
[1:55:09] are done
[1:55:10] in parables that singing they may see
[1:55:14] and not perceive and hearing they may
[1:55:18] hear and not understand lest at any time
[1:55:22] they should be converted and their sins
[1:55:24] should be forgiven them he goes on he
[1:55:27] says and he said unto them know ye not
[1:55:30] despair about and how then when you know
[1:55:33] all parables the sower soweth the word
[1:55:37] now remember the word is God the Word
[1:55:41] was God the Word was with God and the
[1:55:42] Word was made flesh amen in 12 months so
[1:55:45] the word is godless this seed is God
[1:55:47] being sung hallelujah the sower soweth
[1:55:52] the word and these are they by the way
[1:55:55] sides where the word is sown but when
[1:55:59] they have heard Satan cometh immediately
[1:56:02] so can I tell you all that before you
[1:56:04] when you get out the church Satan gonna
[1:56:08] be right there
[1:56:09] but try to take this from you but we're
[1:56:13] gonna find out who we are right look at
[1:56:16] look at what happened these I'd say that
[1:56:19] by the weight site where the word is
[1:56:20] sown but when they have heard Satan
[1:56:24] cometh immediately and taketh away the
[1:56:26] word that was sown in a hearse now
[1:56:30] that's something to me well just catch
[1:56:32] what Jesus just said Satan come not you
[1:56:36] it was a fight for you to get to church
[1:56:38] you abide wrestling with the devil and
[1:56:41] you want
[1:56:45] you you want and you get here to the
[1:56:49] church and you hear the word of God and
[1:56:52] then you go outside and the Bible says
[1:56:55] that Satan come immediately he don't
[1:56:57] even ask you to give it up you don't
[1:57:04] even wrestle with you this time the
[1:57:06] Bible tells us that he comes immediately
[1:57:08] and takes it away now I'm bringing it up
[1:57:13] for a reason I'm bringing up that point
[1:57:15] for a reason I want you to realize you
[1:57:17] have to fight to keep what you got the
[1:57:21] kingdom of God suffers violence and the
[1:57:24] violent will take it by force rather
[1:57:28] don't let the devil take nothing from
[1:57:30] you if God gave it to you it has become
[1:57:34] your personal property
[1:57:38] Satan you can have nothing this is my
[1:57:42] this is my promise this word God said to
[1:57:47] me he must speak it to you spoke to me
[1:57:50] and I refuse to let you take this from
[1:57:54] me you don't have to fight to hold on
[1:57:58] the what God gave you praise God them
[1:58:02] children below me you we're gonna have
[1:58:05] to fight the hold on for please God
[1:58:08] Church tell the devil no no no no no no
[1:58:14] glory to God hallelujah
[1:58:17] oh Jesus Jesus look at what the
[1:58:23] scripture is telling us here st. us I
[1:58:26] mean I just refuse to just allow them
[1:58:29] just coming in just no no no you're
[1:58:30] taking nothing nothing that God gave me
[1:58:33] nothing you cannot have it if I have to
[1:58:38] fight on my knees I'll fight on my knees
[1:58:40] and until that seat gets into the right
[1:58:44] place hallelujah see that you know what
[1:58:48] is the scripture Seder that promises
[1:58:50] unto you and to your children those that
[1:58:54] are far off as many as the Lord our God
[1:58:56] shall come that's what that's what the
[1:59:00] words say
[1:59:00] so we're if you got a promise like that
[1:59:03] you don't you don't you don't wrestle
[1:59:04] with no devil plants in the world
[1:59:10] put it for six but put that script in an
[1:59:13] envelope and send it on off the way now
[1:59:16] let me ask you a question when you send
[1:59:18] packages out do you do you chase them
[1:59:22] down to track them

[2:01:24] take anything and everything from the
[2:01:25] devil we know by revelation who where we
[2:01:29] stand search a man a man's watch this
[2:01:32] now watch the scripture it says verse 13
[2:01:37] and these are they by the wayside where
[2:01:40] the word is sown but when they have
[2:01:42] heard Satan cometh immediately and
[2:01:46] taketh away the word that was sown in
[2:01:50] their hearts so fight to keep you cease
[2:01:52] now fight to keep your promises and
[2:01:57] these are they so many hearts all right
[2:02:02] and these are they likewise which are
[2:02:05] sown on stony ground who when they have
[2:02:09] heard the word immediately receive it
[2:02:14] with gladness now I don't want to just
[2:02:17] sit here in church and say amen to the
[2:02:19] word but not having a root because look
[2:02:25] at what happens in verse 17 and have no
[2:02:28] root in them oh you got to have your own
[2:02:33] root now you got to be planted somewhere
[2:02:37] this ain't the pastor giving you your
[2:02:39] root you got to have your own root you
[2:02:43] got to make your own decision you got to
[2:02:49] know what sort of the planet in have no
[2:02:53] root in themselves and so endure but for
[2:02:59] a time when but I fought for time
[2:03:04] afterward when affliction or persecution
[2:03:09] Arase for the word seat now the
[2:03:13] persecution come against the word that's
[2:03:15] in you now brother branham say you know
[2:03:18] when when Mary was pregnant with Christ
[2:03:22] a man with when she received the word
[2:03:24] from the angel and now she's about to
[2:03:26] amen I give birth to Christ he said
[2:03:29] that's when the persecution set in
[2:03:31] that's when they changed the laws that's
[2:03:34] when they caused them to leave Leave
[2:03:36] leave Leave leave Leave leave
[2:03:38] Galilee and go back to Nazareth

[2:06:34] have held a stand everybody got a hold
[2:06:41] it high not just a pastor oh brother
[2:06:45] Randall said we had a church where we
[2:06:47] didn't believe in planting carts
[2:06:49] everybody ought to go home and throw
[2:06:51] away date cards a man Church that's what
[2:06:55] he's saying we all got to uphold the
[2:06:58] standard of the word the devil will come
[2:07:01] immediately and bring affliction or
[2:07:04] persecution for the words sake and know
[2:07:07] what the Bible says and I have no room
[2:07:09] a man in themselves and so and do it
[2:07:12] before time after when affliction or
[2:07:13] persecution arises for the words sake
[2:07:15] immediately they are offended don't be
[2:07:20] offended for the word stand for the word
[2:07:22] and if Jesus had to go through some
[2:07:25] persecution for his beliefs you have to
[2:07:27] go through some for yours as well hey
[2:07:30] man there being a Christian is not a
[2:07:31] picnic it is a war brother we didn't
[2:07:37] some some people get into a military
[2:07:39] just to look good with a uniform
[2:07:41] but other people get in because they
[2:07:43] want to go to role they'll fight for
[2:07:46] their freedoms not only fight for theirs
[2:07:49] in fact for yours too glory to God
[2:07:52] a man I'm fighting for your freedom in
[2:07:55] Christ
[2:07:56] all right listen listen he says in verse
[2:07:59] 18 and these are they which are sown
[2:08:02] among thorns such as here the world and
[2:08:06] the cares of this world and the
[2:08:10] deceitfulness of riches
[2:08:11] now why would Jesus say deceitfulness of
[2:08:14] riches anybody has been living long
[2:08:20] enough knows that the devil always got
[2:08:24] something
[2:08:24] he got another scheme brother if he
[2:08:29] can't get you with wit juice wee-wee I
[2:08:41] guarantee we got some a ton so
[2:08:43] some Amway or Amway didn't work they
[2:08:46] start selling juice when the juice
[2:08:50] didn't work then they went to supplement
[2:08:51] aloe vera right
[2:08:53] they went from there to something that
[2:08:54] everybody selling something the devil
[2:08:56] constantly got you going after something
[2:08:58] i'ma tell you if you just whittled God
[2:09:00] he'll bring it to you you won't have to
[2:09:02] go for it he'll bring it to you if you
[2:09:05] just do what he asked you to do I'm a
[2:09:08] living witness a man a man a man I'm a
[2:09:13] living witness hallelujah amen III I'm
[2:09:17] driving a truck that I didn't even go to
[2:09:18] buy didn't even go out there to buy it
[2:09:23] well I went out there for somebody else
[2:09:25] I'm out here doing them a favor and and
[2:09:29] it just so happened that very day I go
[2:09:31] it's a very day that they put it out
[2:09:34] there I'm like well it didn't even have
[2:09:36] a price on it like what y'all asking for
[2:09:38] that they told me I said hey what I want
[2:09:40] to pay in my head I said how much I
[2:09:43] wanted to pay and next thing you know
[2:09:46] I'm telling the brother brother brother
[2:09:47] say how much you wanted to pay for that
[2:09:48] that's what I wanted to pay okay I'm
[2:09:50] gonna try to get them to include your
[2:09:52] truck in my deal you are okay and he
[2:09:57] went out and did it
[2:10:00] that way God will bring you your desire
[2:10:04] if you just serve Him
[2:10:06] don't be chasing riches you know the
[2:10:10] reasoning used to see Pizitz of riches
[2:10:12] because you taste and you never actually
[2:10:14] accomplish you know what you can
[2:10:17] actually get it and by the time you get
[2:10:19] it you gotta spin it like that don't
[2:10:23] chase it let God bring it to you listen
[2:10:26] listen I'm trying to go forward since
[2:10:28] and the cares of this world and the
[2:10:30] deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of
[2:10:34] other things entering in choke the word
[2:10:41] the less of other things entering in
[2:10:46] choke the word and it becometh
[2:10:48] unfruitful see we're trying what kind of
[2:10:57] ground you are you because I'm gonna
[2:10:59] just be honest with you when Jesus gave
[2:11:01] us these full different examples all of
[2:11:03] us fit within these four categories
[2:11:05] which which ground are you first win is
[2:11:10] the ground that I want to be and these
[2:11:13] are they which are sown on good ground
[2:11:15] brother branham call it pre-prepared
[2:11:17] ground predestinated ground amen
[2:11:21] these are they which are sown on good
[2:11:23] ground such as hear the word not only
[2:11:26] hear it what they do and receive it and
[2:11:30] by hearing it and receiving it something
[2:11:34] happens and bring forth fruit some
[2:11:36] thirtyfold some 16 and some a hundred
[2:11:41] church I want to be the one that's
[2:11:44] bringing forth 100 fold I wanted
[2:11:45] everything everything God everything God
[2:11:49] is I want to be can I give you just
[2:11:52] another quote here all Jesus glory to
[2:11:56] God
[2:11:57] this is out of the message recognizing
[2:12:00] your day and its message and as a
[2:12:02] message just in the title
[2:12:05] recognizing your Danis message says look
[2:12:11] look what he said in this day would take
[2:12:14] place listen to it real close the sign
[2:12:17] of Sodom would take place in the day
[2:12:21] sound like Abraham the day before Sodom
[2:12:23] that was called out all these things
[2:12:26] that was prophesied will be taking place
[2:12:28] now watch the day you're living we've
[2:12:31] we've went over it and over it
[2:12:33] notice he has promised to send you
[2:12:36] heavenly light he has promised to send
[2:12:39] you heavenly light we need something to
[2:12:42] shine on this right because we get it in
[2:12:44] the right condition it will grow many of
[2:12:46] us already tried denominations we did
[2:12:48] not grow there but brother when this
[2:12:52] found us because we didn't find this but
[2:12:55] when this found us that's when we
[2:12:57] started to grow that's when the Bible
[2:12:59] became a new pole this is now I promised
[2:13:03] to send you heavenly light to ripen the
[2:13:07] word seat that would be sown for this
[2:13:11] day the seed is here the seed is the
[2:13:17] Bible why Jesus says so the word is the
[2:13:21] seed that a so assault says and now
[2:13:24] before you can have any crop no matter
[2:13:27] if you sow the seed if you've got to
[2:13:29] have I said say it's got to have light
[2:13:33] to ripen that seed or it'll rot it won't
[2:13:36] do no good it'll perish but if they if
[2:13:39] it's got if it's got seed in the ground
[2:13:41] the right ground with the right kind of
[2:13:43] a sunlight on it it's got to write them
[2:13:46] listen and he promised that in the last
[2:13:49] days in the evening time the Sun would
[2:13:52] come out to ripen that seed the seed is
[2:13:55] being preached the Son of God is
[2:13:58] ripening that sea
[2:13:59] by vindicating it making it push out
[2:14:02] before you and proving that it's right
[2:14:04] do you get it
[2:14:05] recognize your day a man let's go on a
[2:14:09] little further here now I wanna show you
[2:14:16] that a seed has just been in the right
[2:14:18] condition for the Esso in the strike it
[2:14:23] and for it to come forth and build
[2:14:26] random called it pre-prepared ground in
[2:14:28] my thoughts go back to the woman at the
[2:14:30] well we don't know her name but we know
[2:14:35] her situation and she's just given a
[2:14:38] title woman at the will but the Bible
[2:14:41] tells us that Jesus said you know I have
[2:14:45] need to go by Samaria
[2:14:48] Jesus said I hadn't need to go by and
[2:14:50] there was a certain time of day that
[2:14:52] Jesus was coming and when it got there
[2:14:54] he you know he sent the disciples away
[2:14:57] and because according to his vision this
[2:15:00] woman would be there by herself and and
[2:15:02] nobody else needed to be there so he
[2:15:04] sent the disciples amen on an errand to
[2:15:07] go get some vittles hallelujah glory to
[2:15:10] God and hear this woman come to the well
[2:15:12] and and Jesus just begin to have a
[2:15:14] conversation now the time of day that
[2:15:16] she came to the well she had to come
[2:15:19] with all the other women I mean she
[2:15:21] couldn't come with the other woman
[2:15:21] because of the type of woman she was by
[2:15:24] being a prostitute she could hang out
[2:15:27] with the other ladies so they came early
[2:15:29] November morning by here she come they
[2:15:31] come before the Sun actually a menace
[2:15:33] it's up and shining real hot but she
[2:15:36] comes at the middle of the day when the
[2:15:37] sun is shining at its hottest but you
[2:15:40] know what by her coming at that time she
[2:15:43] was in the right position for the S o n
[2:15:47] to strike her seat now brother Branham
[2:15:51] said Amen on the outside and looked like
[2:15:53] this lady was dark but on the inside she
[2:15:56] had she sang she had some life there she
[2:15:59] just needed there so in the strike it
[2:16:01] hold so
[2:16:03] she was sitting myself at the Whelan and
[2:16:05] Jesus beginning to have a conversation
[2:16:07] woman bring me a drink she said ah it's
[2:16:11] not customary for your people to talk
[2:16:14] with my people and for us to have
[2:16:15] fellowship like this it's not customary
[2:16:17] he'd say well if you really knew who you
[2:16:20] were talking to you would actually ask
[2:16:22] me for a drink because because the drink
[2:16:25] that I have amen it will flow like wells
[2:16:27] of living water
[2:16:28] amen out of your I'll be out of your
[2:16:31] innermost being it'll be like wells of
[2:16:32] living water just say well what kind of
[2:16:34] drink is this should say now you don't
[2:16:36] even have anything to draw out of the
[2:16:38] will and she said oh well is deep you
[2:16:41] ain't got nothing to draw how do well
[2:16:43] how are you gonna give me some water she
[2:16:45] just began to talk and and have this
[2:16:48] conversation and then and before your
[2:16:50] north Jack's Jesus or the questions sir
[2:16:52] give me this water that you're talking
[2:16:54] about they say well now before I can
[2:16:58] give you the water and this right we got
[2:17:00] to get ourselves in the right condition
[2:17:02] amen
[2:17:03] before we don't see some growth maybe we
[2:17:06] got to do what this lady did repent they
[2:17:15] begin to talk jesus said now now now Ya
[2:17:18] Allah I'll give you this water I got
[2:17:21] this water for you amen but but we don't
[2:17:24] need to settle the same question first
[2:17:28] he didn't say like that he just said
[2:17:30] before you get this water go get your
[2:17:33] husband and then come and I get
[2:17:36] something to drink with your husband and
[2:17:40] then she finally say sir I have no
[2:17:43] husband and then Jesus with a little
[2:17:46] father say yeah and the one you living
[2:17:49] with
[2:17:52] the one you living with the one who make
[2:17:57] him your beau with is not your husband
[2:18:03] is that what he said so that's not your
[2:18:06] husband pretty much what he said you
[2:18:09] should be living there in the first
[2:18:11] place
[2:18:14] hallelujah he say say the one you living
[2:18:17] with is not your husband he said I'm not
[2:18:21] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[2:18:22] minute you know the they told us that
[2:18:26] when Messiah come no you know what
[2:18:31] when were people looking for Messiah
[2:18:33] just for the miracle part but we're
[2:18:38] Messiah come he don't just do miracles
[2:18:40] when Messiah come he deserves scene when
[2:18:48] Messiah come these are the things that
[2:18:50] he does in the age when Messiah come he
[2:18:55] would do these things she say he say you
[2:18:56] know the one you're talking to he is the
[2:18:59] Messiah what she is something that's
[2:19:04] truck on the inside she halle-loo she
[2:19:07] went through a little scare fication
[2:19:08] process and when they're so instruct
[2:19:12] what was on the inside after she had got
[2:19:16] rid of the same question after she
[2:19:18] settled the same question did she could
[2:19:21] take over a little city and start
[2:19:23] running and say come see a man that's
[2:19:26] told me two things that I done
[2:19:28] [Applause]
[2:19:29] [Music]
[2:19:31] and I'm gonna tell you something the
[2:19:34] reason that them people could listen to
[2:19:36] her testimony because evidently when she
[2:19:38] come in contact with Christ something
[2:19:41] change ain't no way to come see a man
[2:19:47] you inviting us to come see a man nobody
[2:19:52] coming to see no man you see and honey
[2:19:57] evidently something changed when she
[2:20:00] come in contact with Christ and what we
[2:20:02] need see see see the before before that
[2:20:04] seek and break forth it was there all
[2:20:06] the time
[2:20:07] darkness had it all messed up the life
[2:20:09] she was living had it all messed up but
[2:20:11] she just had to get into the right
[2:20:12] position Oh God I want me to just get in
[2:20:18] the right position and when she got in
[2:20:20] the right position s o n reveal her sin
[2:20:25] and that was light striking her seat so
[2:20:29] if God was to come today and reveal your
[2:20:32] sin
[2:20:33] that's like striking your seat because
[2:20:36] God don't want you walking in that
[2:20:37] darkness I can I can almost assure you
[2:20:42] when the seen in her life broke forth
[2:20:45] that man got a hug guy at her house you
[2:20:52] see the one or two things either she
[2:20:54] left oh he left you don't go back to the
[2:20:58] same condition you run from that you you
[2:21:03] get out of that situation as fast as
[2:21:05] mine why if you don't that is the devil
[2:21:08] coming immediately to take what has been
[2:21:12] soul
[2:21:20] and you find yourself just going through
[2:21:22] mine better after mine but the devil
[2:21:23] just took our your strength from more
[2:21:26] than one service that's what when you
[2:21:28] leave serves you gotta make good
[2:21:29] decisions separate yourself from seeing
[2:21:33] not only separated from yourself from
[2:21:35] sin separate yourself from anything that
[2:21:38] looked like seeing you man Church we
[2:21:44] talk about trauma we want to see the see
[2:21:45] a man come to full maturity my chest not
[2:21:50] just a shout on Sunday and then you bite
[2:21:52] right back into what you was in no no we
[2:21:54] looking for more than that
[2:21:56] now I can tell you that some churches
[2:21:58] down the way they'll be happy to have
[2:22:00] you come and shout on Sunday and live
[2:22:02] any kind of way the rest of the week but
[2:22:04] not here right here we all got to come
[2:22:08] to maturity hear that woman with her
[2:22:14] sinful condition simply just had to get
[2:22:17] into the right position for the Esso end
[2:22:20] to strike a seat let me go a little
[2:22:23] further
[2:22:24] oh my mind let me read this side of the
[2:22:28] message taking sides with Jesus says
[2:22:32] that see was laying there the only thing
[2:22:36] that it needed was water and the water
[2:22:39] had fell on it all they needed was water
[2:22:42] and the water fell on when it fell upon
[2:22:45] those Pharisees they said s Beelzebub
[2:22:47] couldn't bring nothing there was nothing
[2:22:49] there but we used to come from them to
[2:22:53] come from says but when that pedestrian
[2:22:56] see struck that water of life she said
[2:22:58] sir you must be a prophet I know that
[2:23:00] when the Messiah cometh he would tell us
[2:23:02] these things
[2:23:02] he said I'm he that speaks to you she
[2:23:04] left that water pot amen and into the
[2:23:08] city she had something to tell she said
[2:23:11] come see a man who has told me that
[2:23:12] things I've done
[2:23:13] isn't this the very Messiah see she took
[2:23:16] sides with Jesus that's right strange
[2:23:18] thing wasn't it all the Pharisees and
[2:23:21] Sadducees didn't know him and this
[2:23:23] prostitute know him see why those who
[2:23:26] believed him and loved him and seen his
[2:23:29] signs they
[2:23:30] no that was the Cylon Messiah there's no
[2:23:33] getting around it they knowed it the
[2:23:39] other thing that I just want to bring
[2:23:40] out before we would try to find a way to
[2:23:43] get out bear with me I just want to read
[2:23:47] this quote spoken words the original see
[2:23:52] part 2 I'll read paragraph 399 on this
[2:23:58] paragraph 399 now stay with me here it
[2:24:03] says oh here we're gonna get in get in

[2:24:42] here I want to make sure we get this do
[2:24:46] me do me a favor and just I don't know
[2:24:51] why the date didn't come out right there
[2:24:53] put in put in a search for real true
[2:25:02] sperm just put it in that and it should
[2:25:06] bring up this quote real true sperm here
[2:25:13] we go so here we're going to get in
[2:25:18] something deep now now watch this see
[2:25:21] Church this real church with the real
[2:25:24] true sperm notice the eunuch had been
[2:25:28] with all the Dedes now remember and this
[2:25:33] is important because he's talking about
[2:25:35] the unit that went down to into Israel
[2:25:39] and you know he went there for the
[2:25:40] Passover and everything but he didn't he
[2:25:42] didn't get anything but
[2:25:43] ritual this this this this were in order
[2:25:48] to produce Christ it will never come
[2:25:50] through denomination it'll never come
[2:25:51] through wisdom it's gonna be by faith
[2:25:53] amen and some humble waiting that God
[2:25:55] gonna do things look says now remember
[2:25:58] God never committed his preaching and
[2:26:01] his gospel to an angel
[2:26:03] how many knows that how many rows that
[2:26:07] Galatians 1/8 said if an angel come from
[2:26:09] heaven and preached something else
[2:26:10] beside besides they had preached let it
[2:26:14] be a curse so the angel is wrong if he's
[2:26:17] different from the word glory God came
[2:26:21] on down below angels and committed it to
[2:26:25] man which were sons you believe that
[2:26:29] now watch now he never committed it to
[2:26:32] angels notice he did not do it now now
[2:26:36] the power of the believing Church Christ
[2:26:38] oh man I'm sorry I skipped something I
[2:26:42] got my I got my quotes messed up here
[2:26:44] let me um let me I'll go go to paragraph
[2:26:47] 388 in that same same same message but I
[2:26:51] want to just try to get something here
[2:26:53] to you
[2:26:53] amen it wasn't given to angels and
[2:26:56] there's a reason a man that wasn't given
[2:26:59] to angels God gave the word to man to
[2:27:03] preach God gave the word to mean to
[2:27:07] preach accidents another quote where
[2:27:10] brother and say God did not ordain a
[2:27:12] tape recorder to preach the gospel
[2:27:17] God did not ordain a CD player to preach
[2:27:21] the gospel
[2:27:22] God did not Oh Dana mp3 player to preach
[2:27:25] the gospel yes we can hear the gospel
[2:27:28] but it was not ordained by
[2:27:30] God to preach the gospel hallelujah
[2:27:34] now listen say there's a reason why Amen
[2:27:37] God ordained men to do this
[2:27:41] hallelujah for some reason that is not
[2:27:44] okay

[2:31:37] the seed is in the body this is the body
[2:31:42] the seed is in the body Oh glory to God

[2:31:59] Christ the same yesterday if ever you
[2:32:00] believe it there these are not
[2:32:02] denominational hybrids now a man this is
[2:32:06] those that's an orbit waiting for the
[2:32:09] countdown you know what I mean
[2:32:12] fixing to take a rocket that I don't
[2:32:17] know where I'm at I'm fixing to take a
[2:32:19] rocket glory amen
[2:32:22] these are not denominational hybrids not
[2:32:25] standing in here they're not no sir it's
[2:32:27] the seed that's what the Prophet called
[2:32:30] you now let let's go on a little further
[2:32:32] it says now I'm going down to paragraph
[2:32:35] 401 I believe in that same message and I
[2:32:39] got it mixed up there it says now Philip
[2:32:41] had been up to Pentecost Jerusalem to
[2:32:44] worship I mean he says amen to that
[2:32:47] the eunuch he had been I've been down
[2:32:50] there with all the DVDs I think I
[2:32:53] already got that I got that I got that
[2:32:54] okay no okay why didn't he get something
[2:32:57] he come back down studying the prophecy
[2:32:59] of Isaiah although an angel directed
[2:33:05] Philip to him the German life had to
[2:33:10] come through the body
[2:33:11] Philip notices now what the brothers say
[2:33:18] you know so what we have is Philip they
[2:33:22] meant this when Jesus had to go by
[2:33:27] Samaria he knew the German life had to
[2:33:29] come through him to her to the woman at
[2:33:32] the well that's why Jesus had need to go
[2:33:35] by Samaria
[2:33:36] Jesus has left the scene now and now we
[2:33:39] got these disciples on the scene and
[2:33:41] here
[2:33:41] Philip is it once city preacher the
[2:33:43] revival but because there's one man Amen
[2:33:47] on the backside of a desert that is
[2:33:48] study of Scripture and this man has
[2:33:51] questions that angel goes to Philip and
[2:33:54] says Philip I need you to leave here and
[2:33:57] go to the backside of the desert because
[2:33:59] he didn't even tell him I just get down
[2:34:01] the backside of desert and when he got
[2:34:03] there he heard this man reading
[2:34:05] Scripture he was reading a book if I
[2:34:07] said you know and as he's reading
[2:34:09] scripture like well who is this prophet
[2:34:12] talking about who is the prophet
[2:34:14] referring to is he talking about himself
[2:34:16] or is it talking about another man
[2:34:18] Philip say do you understand with Teresa
[2:34:20] how can I understand unless somebody
[2:34:22] show me when the man opened up that was
[2:34:27] that it was just what was happened just
[2:34:28] just a little Amen the little shell was
[2:34:31] coming off to allow just a little water
[2:34:34] to get in hallelujah and when Philip
[2:34:37] jumped up of a chariot and begin to
[2:34:39] preach Christ out the scripture to this
[2:34:41] man hope that s om begin the sign on a
[2:34:46] eunuch in there in the desert there on
[2:34:49] his way back to Ethiopia the conditions
[2:34:52] were just right for the answer win the
[2:34:55] strike this man glory to God and when
[2:34:59] the conditions get Scott just right the
[2:35:01] man say who can stop me from being
[2:35:02] baptized when your conditions get just
[2:35:05] right you go run into the water when
[2:35:09] your conditions get just right you
[2:35:11] repent of all your sin when your
[2:35:14] conditions get just right you can't stop
[2:35:16] this seed from coming forth but the
[2:35:20] reason that the angel did not go down
[2:35:22] and see that man himself is because the
[2:35:25] C word the germination process had to go
[2:35:29] through the body hallelujah God want us
[2:35:34] to produce a man ever see this but those
[2:35:36] supposed to produce after his own kind
[2:35:38] can I ask what's must being produced off
[2:35:41] of your tree what's being produced off
[2:35:44] your tree next year you ought to be
[2:35:46] looking to bring somebody else to church
[2:35:48] with you
[2:35:49] because the seats was reduced after some
[2:35:51] guy not only did the c-word a man passed
[2:35:55] through the body and fill his time but
[2:35:57] you know even when it when it came to
[2:36:00] you know brother branham gave out a
[2:36:02] couple other other examples you know the
[2:36:04] reason that Peter had to go to connect
[2:36:06] his house the angel told Peter where to
[2:36:09] go Gary told the angel token is where to
[2:36:11] go get Peter from and the reason the
[2:36:14] angel told Coe token is where Peter was
[2:36:16] because the angel himself could not
[2:36:18] bring the seat word he needed Peter as
[2:36:21] another human being
[2:36:23] identify with canoes to bring the c-word
[2:36:25] Peter was carrying the germ of life are
[2:36:30] you with me Peter at that time was Karen
[2:36:34] determine can I tell you this morning
[2:36:35] you are also carrying the germ of life
[2:36:41] all we got to do is get it in the right
[2:36:43] position don't let the devil come take
[2:36:46] these promises from you even when you're
[2:36:49] amongst your loved ones remind them of
[2:36:51] who they are reminder this is what God
[2:36:54] said about you and this is what this is
[2:36:56] what God's promises to me for you and
[2:36:59] I'm believing God for you honey
[2:37:01] hey man I'm sticking everything I got on
[2:37:05] that and I'm not gonna let the devil
[2:37:06] take it from me no matter what I see the
[2:37:09] seed is passing through your body Oh
[2:37:15] glory to God glory to God glory to God
[2:37:18] let me let me just find one and we'll
[2:37:21] break out of this oh my the conditions
[2:37:24] just got to be right the reason that
[2:37:27] Paul had to be visited by Ananias is
[2:37:30] because the seed had to pass through the
[2:37:33] body the German life was coming through
[2:37:35] Ananias Oh God the German life is going
[2:37:40] through you a man that's going through
[2:37:43] you even right now it's going through
[2:37:45] you remember I told you sometimes you
[2:37:46] can be looking at a at just something on
[2:37:48] the seat that seek out an embryo in it
[2:37:50] and it don't look like nothing happening
[2:37:51] to it but you just leave it right where
[2:37:53] in that condition the earth will strike
[2:37:55] it God will put in a certain position
[2:37:57] and what was in it is gonna come forth
[2:37:59] oh yes
[2:38:02] believe that let me just finish off with
[2:38:04] this one quote Jesus let me start with
[2:38:10] God is in his people God is in his
[2:38:13] people
[2:38:14] Oh glory all right
[2:38:20] many people gets the wrong impression on
[2:38:23] these meetings they think because the
[2:38:26] Evangelist is there or something someone
[2:38:28] praying for the sick when he's gone all
[2:38:30] the healing virtue is gone God covers
[2:38:32] the earth your pasta what's the matter
[2:38:35] with my pastor that he can't do that
[2:38:37] well friends that's the wrong impression
[2:38:39] half
[2:38:40] yea passes if he's a godly man his
[2:38:43] prayers will be answered just the same
[2:38:45] as any evangelists or anybody claiming
[2:38:47] any gift or anything else he's a man of
[2:38:50] God and you should respect him that way
[2:38:52] believe in him and God will answer your
[2:38:54] prayer answer his prayer he said confess
[2:38:56] your faults one to another and pray one
[2:38:58] for the other that you might be healed
[2:39:01] not only every person in a measure
[2:39:04] that's got the Holy Spirit has the gift
[2:39:06] of healing in a measure
[2:39:07] notice that not every person they got
[2:39:10] the Holy Ghost in a mess you already got
[2:39:12] to get to healing no I don't think we
[2:39:15] caught it don't pray don't pray X got to
[2:39:18] give it to you you already have it it's
[2:39:22] just in a mention that means you can lay
[2:39:24] hands on the sick and they'll recover
[2:39:26] hey man listen it says every Apple
[2:39:31] that's in the tree is in the tree when
[2:39:34] it's a sprig no more than that when it's
[2:39:38] a little-bitty branch set in the ground
[2:39:40] every bloom that I ever be in the tree
[2:39:43] is in it right then the blooms don't
[2:39:46] come down out of the air the blooms
[2:39:49] don't come up through the ground
[2:39:51] the blooms already in the tree the
[2:39:55] apples already in it the trees planted
[2:39:59] in the ground and the only thing it has
[2:40:01] to do is drink praise God and when it
[2:40:04] goes to drink him and it has to drink
[2:40:06] more than its portion and it's
[2:40:08] Red's out push this out that's the way
[2:40:11] we're planted in Christ Jesus through
[2:40:13] the inexhaustible fountain of life we
[2:40:15] start drinking the more we drink we just
[2:40:18] push out that's right it brings out
[2:40:20] these elements I want to encourage you
[2:40:21] to drink as much as you can as we go
[2:40:24] into this next year drink as much as you
[2:40:25] can watch what pushes out a man you can
[2:40:29] never have too much of God and the gift
[2:40:32] of gift that God has called you to the
[2:40:35] trouble of it is you don't drink that's
[2:40:38] right you don't drink don't you believe
[2:40:40] he's the inexhaustible fountain of life
[2:40:42] come to me all you let are the ends of
[2:40:44] the world and drink the devil don't care
[2:40:46] how much you come as long as you don't
[2:40:48] drink so today I will let you coming in
[2:40:51] shout and jump and do everything and
[2:40:53] Long's you'll know that you don't drink
[2:40:55] because if you drink you're getting
[2:40:57] yourself in right conditions the devil

[2:41:02] as you don't drink you come and drink
[2:41:04] and that's what the meeting is for now

[2:41:16] it just drink to what it was a lot man
[2:41:19] why it would just always still just

[2:41:25] the matter with the Christians they
[2:41:26] don't drink enough you want a drink to
[2:41:29] you just spread out and let somebody
[2:41:30] else see it now like that see push out
[2:41:35] get a testimony commit it to God
[2:41:39] believe it step out on it claim God's
[2:41:43] promise just committed to God believe it
[2:41:46] commit my ways them to the Lord he will
[2:41:50] bring it to pass whatever you want but
[2:41:54] he can't do it as long as you're holding
[2:41:56] it so now I will see if I'm any better

[2:44:05] bits and pieces at different times
[2:44:07] because situations might have you know
[2:44:09] caused it to be that way but I'm on
[2:44:11] expectation for everything all that God
[2:44:14] wants he poured in a crisis and all that
[2:44:18] Christ is he has poured it into his
[2:44:20] church churches time for us to rise up

[2:44:35] questions Amen let's take care of the
[2:44:38] same question begin ready to go into
[2:44:39] another year let's expect great things
[2:44:41] from God hey man let's pray father we
[2:44:46] thank you O God Lord you have encouraged
