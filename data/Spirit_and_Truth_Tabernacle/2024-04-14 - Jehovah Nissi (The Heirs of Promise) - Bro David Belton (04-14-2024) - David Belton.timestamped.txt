[40:47] really really well-known Minister pastor
[40:50] and uh just very uh instrumental in our
[40:53] journey as we were coming up through the
[40:55] years uh brother Peter ch
[40:58] uh there in London the Lord called him
[41:01] home uh and um at the at the age of 70
[41:05] years old and um he was there in his
[41:08] church they they I I was told that they
[41:11] have a um they have what I they're they
[41:15] have a problem the problem is the church
[41:17] is too small for the amount of people
[41:19] that's coming and what I call I call
[41:21] that a good problem amen we're going to
[41:24] have problems some good some bad but
[41:26] that's a good problem
[41:28] and uh so they were there looking to see
[41:30] how they could expand the building he
[41:31] was working with an architect on last
[41:34] Wednesday there at the church and uh and
[41:36] while he was there with the architect he
[41:37] just dropped to the ground uh had a
[41:40] heart attack they they believe it was a
[41:42] heart attack and he was just gone just
[41:44] like that he had just gone to the doctor
[41:47] I want to say month two months prior
[41:49] doctor had giving him a clean bill of
[41:51] health and everything is good but it's
[41:54] something when God calls his child home
[41:58] and it just lets them go real quick you
[42:01] know and uh and just brings them home so
[42:03] uh we want to pray for the church we

[1:11:02] an intellectual
[1:11:05] phase what people think by way of
[1:11:07] knowledge how they know Jesus Christ the
[1:11:09] word but then there's another phase
[1:11:12] those that know him by a spiritual
[1:11:14] Revelation a spiritual understanding the
[1:11:17] Bible said in all that getting get

[1:15:36] you know God made a promise he swore he
[1:15:39] said I'm going to fight with amalec from
[1:15:42] generation to generation now I don't
[1:15:44] want we not going to go into all of that
[1:15:46] today but keep in mind
[1:15:49] amalec came from the seed of Esau
[1:15:53] wow and Esau was the conm minded
[1:15:57] believer right that's right right Esau
[1:16:01] hated the
[1:16:02] birthright and see
[1:16:05] amlc even though he come descended from
[1:16:07] Esau amlc hated Israel when Israel first
[1:16:12] came out of Egypt
[1:16:14] rejoicing praising the Lord there there
[1:16:17] goes the
[1:16:19] amalekites right there to attack them
[1:16:22] that's right they attacked the weak ones
[1:16:24] the Bible said those that were kind of
[1:16:27] worn out and weak those that were
[1:16:30] lagging behind see you can't get you
[1:16:33] can't lag behind you got to be steadfast
[1:16:37] unmovable always about into the work of

[1:16:48] hated the amalekites hated Israel they
[1:16:51] fought Israel you study scripture all
[1:16:55] through time during the time of that's
[1:16:57] why God told told s sa Samuel tell Saul
[1:17:01] to utterly destroy the
[1:17:04] amalekites but he didn't and David later
[1:17:07] defeated but many of them got away and
[1:17:10] then even the time of hezeki there were
[1:17:13] more
[1:17:14] amalekites in the time of Esther there
[1:17:17] were more Amal amalekites but finally
[1:17:20] they were destroyed praise God in the
[1:17:22] Book of Esther Hallelujah and hmon came
[1:17:26] from the amalekites you see you see they
[1:17:31] hated Israel We Are Spiritual Israel

[1:17:53] muscolini and
[1:17:55] stying but in the spiritual realm to

[1:18:20] him Hallelujah and what happened when
[1:18:23] the Lord Jesus Christ when he when he
[1:18:25] went in the wilderness he was tempted

[1:18:34] in all points Hebrews

[1:18:47] government to come after
[1:18:49] you but it was tempted in all points yet
[1:18:53] without sin all right
[1:18:56] but praise the Lord you built upon the
[1:18:58] revelation of Jesus Christ and though
[1:19:01] every demon may come against you hell
[1:19:04] shall not Prevail against you Hallelujah

[1:22:06] hezeki and you know they knew that those
[1:22:09] angels were with
[1:22:13] them and we Moses knew that God was
[1:22:16] backing him up brother Moses brother
[1:22:19] Paul even brother Bram knew that the
[1:22:22] angel was backing them up what what
[1:22:24] about you and
[1:22:25] I the same pfy here with us right we all
[1:22:30] as the Son and Daughter of God we have a
[1:22:33] Halo we have a
[1:22:35] light we're not off the word amen what
[1:22:38] happened in the day of Pentecost there
[1:22:40] was a clothing tongue like as a
[1:22:44] fire
[1:22:46] set upon each of them where do you think
[1:22:49] it probably set probably upon their
[1:22:51] right shoulder amen hallelujah set upon
[1:22:55] each of them and they were filled with
[1:22:58] the Holy Ghost sints of God we we ought
[1:23:00] to look more in the Unseen Faith looks
[1:23:03] into the Unseen Abraham call those
[1:23:05] things that are not as though they were
[1:23:08] Hallelujah Abraham moved by faith amen
[1:23:12] and he received the promise and God told
[1:23:15] him uh Hallelujah that I'm going to
[1:23:17] bless your seed as well Hallelujah oh
[1:23:21] that's why we're glad this morning
[1:23:23] Hallelujah for what God has done now now
[1:23:26] as we continue
[1:23:28] on as as we encourage each other in the
[1:23:31] Lord the Bible said don't be surprised
[1:23:34] though don't marble cuz Satan also just
[1:23:37] like God have Angels second Corinthians
[1:23:41] 11:13
[1:23:43] to15 Marva don't don't Marvel cuz Satan
[1:23:47] himself have Angels who transform
[1:23:52] themselves into angels of
[1:23:55] light see so what are you saying you
[1:23:59] have the power of God and you have the
[1:24:03] power of the devil and those are the two
[1:24:06] Powers that's fighting in the universe
[1:24:09] in every human being on the face of this
[1:24:13] Earth is influenced by one power of the
[1:24:16] of the other amen we in one power or the
[1:24:20] other now there was a type in the Old
[1:24:23] Testament
[1:24:25] Canaan was the land that was
[1:24:29] promised to to
[1:24:31] Abraham his seed after him
[1:24:35] rather to enter into Canaan that was the
[1:24:39] promise but our promise today
[1:24:43] Hallelujah is to live in the power of
[1:24:46] the Holy Ghost that's our promise today
[1:24:50] right amen and in Christ we can conquer
[1:24:54] all things you believe that in Christ
[1:24:58] we're
[1:24:59] Victorious Hallelujah in Christ we have
[1:25:02] Victory but remember you can't
[1:25:07] receive Victory or even
[1:25:10] character except by suffering all right
[1:25:13] cuz character is our Victory amen
[1:25:17] character is not a gift now the Bible
[1:25:19] tells us God gives every man different
[1:25:22] gifts everyone a Measure of Faith
[1:25:24] he gives a measure of Grace he gives the
[1:25:27] Holy Ghost he he give many gifts he give
[1:25:32] healings he give many
[1:25:35] things but character is not a gift
[1:25:40] character is a victory in other words
[1:25:43] you have to be an overcomer amen you
[1:25:46] going to be tested remember we we heard
[1:25:49] from our theophany in this end time our
[1:25:52] word body According to second second
[1:25:56] Corinthians 5 and 1 Paul said if this
[1:25:59] Earthly house be dissolved I have
[1:26:02] another one Eternal now keep in mind
[1:26:07] eternity is not millions of amounts of
[1:26:10] somewhere all right eternity is here in
[1:26:13] another dimension that moves much faster
[1:26:17] than this Dimension Amen brother Jack we
[1:26:19] know that's part of Einstein's theory 34
[1:26:23] billion 5 96
[1:26:25] million miles per second it's faster
[1:26:29] than that the prophet said that other
[1:26:31] dimension is billions times faster so
[1:26:34] Einstein saw something he kept splitting
[1:26:37] the atoms Einstein saw that there was a
[1:26:40] power out there that he just couldn't
[1:26:43] touch he kept splitting the atom he kept
[1:26:46] splitting and kept splitting and kept
[1:26:48] splitting Einstein saw no end scientists
[1:26:53] called it a superior I force scientists
[1:26:56] call it an an intelligent Force but we
[1:26:59] know it's God it's allmighty God it's
[1:27:03] the power of God it's eternity amen

[1:43:54] railing accusation against the devil now
[1:43:57] keep in mind Satan went to
[1:44:01] michah why did he go to Michael cuz
[1:44:04] Michael is the Archangel of all the
[1:44:06] Angels Michael in the Angelic realm is
[1:44:09] Christ and Satan knew that Michael had
[1:44:12] had the power of the
[1:44:14] Resurrection Satan knew that so he went
[1:44:16] to Michael disputing Moses body what
[1:44:19] y'all bear him he couldn't find where
[1:44:22] where's he at where's his
[1:44:24] body where is
[1:44:26] he M said the Lord rebuke thee no AA

[1:44:38] filthy
[1:44:39] garments he was
[1:44:41] filthy see we were born in sin shaper in
[1:44:45] iniquity came to the world speaking lies

[1:45:21] Pure White let your garment be white
[1:45:23] amen hallelujah oh I'm glad for the
[1:45:26] Garment it's not a strange garment was

[1:45:36] garments but the Bible said and the
[1:45:38] Satan same went before God accusing
[1:45:41] accusing Joshua the high
[1:45:47] priest but what did the Lord said said

[1:46:16] even the ministry was just the lay
[1:46:19] members gone stray the leaders brother
[1:46:23] were astray too all went astray so God
[1:46:27] sent a prophet with the message to wash
[1:46:30] sir that we may be clothed I want to say
[1:46:33] this here the prophet say I have a my
[1:46:35] desire is to dress the

[1:47:21] thankful so the angels God encamp about
[1:47:24] those who reverence him we're in the
[1:47:26] presence of God all the time I never
[1:47:28] leave thee nor forsake Thee I will be
[1:47:31] with thee all the always to the end he's
[1:47:35] with us now he promised he'll never
[1:47:38] leave us nor forsake us remember even um
[1:47:43] Daniel when Daniel was praying for
[1:47:47] understanding seeing all I getting get
[1:47:49] understanding get wisdom get
[1:47:51] understanding the scripture said in the
[1:47:52] book of Dan in the last days they that
[1:47:54] know their God should do exploits you
[1:47:56] should be purified and made white you
[1:48:00] will be
[1:48:01] tried that's why the prophet could tell
[1:48:03] us the greatest battle or the greatest
[1:48:05] thing that ever happened to you is the
[1:48:08] test the
[1:48:10] trials and you got to be an overcomer
[1:48:13] are you an overcomer Caleb said we are
[1:48:16] more than able brother Paul said we are
[1:48:18] more than conquerors amen amen Hal
[1:48:25] Hallelujah so to stand that test through
[1:48:29] all trials that's why he allowing him
[1:48:32] what's he doing he's molding

[1:48:48] city he that can ruleth his Spirit he
[1:48:52] that ruleth his spirit in the Book of
[1:48:57] Proverbs 16:32 I believe is Moder than
[1:49:01] he that taketh the
[1:49:03] city what are you
[1:49:06] saying more than
[1:49:09] anything you must
[1:49:11] learn how to
[1:49:13] master human
[1:49:17] ability because God has created
[1:49:20] you to become master
[1:49:23] of every circumstance what are you

[1:49:28] hard for the Lord is anything too hard
[1:49:30] for the Lord there's nothing too hard

[1:50:29] uh I can uh don't have
[1:50:33] to turn and have you reading all day I
[1:50:37] just PR them out amen now the Bible said
[1:50:42] this
[1:50:45] remember Galatians 4 and you don't have
[1:50:47] to turn
[1:50:49] there for it is written
[1:50:53] that Abraham had two
[1:50:58] sons the one by the bond made the other
[1:51:04] by a free
[1:51:06] woman but he who was of the Bond woman
[1:51:09] was born after the flesh that's why we
[1:51:13] must be born again amen the new birth is
[1:51:17] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:51:19] personally to you see it's not enough to
[1:51:22] learn the
[1:51:25] message you can learn the message that's
[1:51:28] not good
[1:51:30] enough but you must receive the person
[1:51:34] Jesus Christ that's when it's real to
[1:51:40] you so woman was born out of the flesh
[1:51:43] but he of the free woman was by promise
[1:51:47] is a promise Jesus said in Luke 24
[1:51:53] he promised he he said a promise of the
[1:51:55] father what's our promise we said it
[1:51:58] earlier our promise is the Holy Ghost
[1:52:02] all through the New Testament the Bible
[1:52:03] speaks of the promise the Bible said
[1:52:06] even through the through the Old
[1:52:07] Testament Saints in the in the uh Hall
[1:52:09] of Fame chapter Hebrews 11 all those
[1:52:12] through everything they went through all
[1:52:14] the trials and the cruel mockings and
[1:52:16] everything they went through yet in all
[1:52:20] of that some saw the s receive cruel
[1:52:23] markings all those things yet receive
[1:52:27] not the promise the promise emphasize
[1:52:31] the promise oh Hallelujah the promise
[1:52:35] the promise is unto you the promise yes
[1:52:39] sir the same promise that he promised
[1:52:42] Abraham he knew that we had a Roy seed
[1:52:45] with a faith seed
[1:52:53] the promise of the father is the Holy
[1:52:56] Ghost Hallelujah they receive not the
[1:52:59] promise because they without us could
[1:53:01] not be come to
[1:53:06] maturity with things or an allegory a
[1:53:09] type for these are the two covenants the
[1:53:12] one from the Mount Si which gen the
[1:53:14] bondage which is a AAR so the law puts
[1:53:18] us in Bonnet the law puts up us in
[1:53:26] jail the law is the word of God In seed
[1:53:34] form but the grace of God is when the
[1:53:36] word is quickened in our hearts by the
[1:53:40] Holy Ghost see the letter kill it and
[1:53:43] many take this message as law many use
[1:53:48] it as law many uses it as the letter
[1:53:53] but the latter without the spirit
[1:53:56] without the Revelation without the
[1:53:57] quickening power is a law and it
[1:54:01] produces legalism and legalism produces
[1:54:08] Rebellion this is not a message of
[1:54:12] law this is not a message of dos and
[1:54:15] don'ts this is not a book of
[1:54:18] rules this is the Christ revealed this
[1:54:21] is the revelation of Jesus Christ heyen
[1:54:26] The Mighty God unveiled before us aren't
[1:54:29] you glad so the letter kill it but the
[1:54:33] spirit giveth life and brother Paul goes
[1:54:36] on to say and the Lord is thy
[1:54:42] Spirit i't you glad the Lord is that
[1:54:46] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:54:49] is I want to hear where the spirit of
[1:54:52] the Lord Lord is where the spirit of the
[1:54:55] Lord is when there's a time to shout
[1:54:58] there's a time to shout where the spirit
[1:55:00] of the Lord is when there's a time to
[1:55:03] praise there's a time to praise where
[1:55:06] the spirit of the Lord is when it's time
[1:55:08] to Bubble dance there's a time to Bubble

[1:58:37] U for his much I'm reading this for as
[1:58:41] much then as Christ has suffered for us
[1:58:44] in the flesh

[1:58:50] likewise with the same mind let the mind
[1:58:53] that was in Christ be also in you you
[1:58:55] going to have battles he didn't say it
[1:58:57] was going to be
[1:59:00] easy all of us now you know if if you
[1:59:03] don't if you're not having trials raise

[1:59:13] having trials raise your hand you see it
[1:59:17] shows you Sons and Daughters of God but
[1:59:21] and some of us have some hard
[1:59:25] trials they said one guy I heard a story
[1:59:28] one guy was
[1:59:29] complaining about his cross went to the
[1:59:31] angel complaining complaining
[1:59:33] complaining about his cross he just
[1:59:35] couldn't bear it was too too
[1:59:37] much so that and and it was it was a uh
[1:59:40] you know pretty big
[1:59:44] cross so he went he went the angel said
[1:59:47] okay go in there in the room and trade
[1:59:51] it pick up another cross you know and
[1:59:55] you and you know use it so they said the
[2:00:00] guy went in the room he found a little
[2:00:02] small cross over in the corner he picked
[2:00:05] it up it was heavier than the one he had
[2:00:08] but you
[2:00:09] see no one can
[2:00:12] bear your cross your cross your trials
[2:00:16] is designed by almighty God for you and
[2:00:22] for you only God for the foundation of
[2:00:25] the world knew what and he's not going
[2:00:27] to put no more on you than you can bear
[2:00:30] the devil may make you think you can't
[2:00:32] bear it and it gets hard at times but
[2:00:35] you keep on looking to
[2:00:37] Christ cuz arm yourself in the same mind
[2:00:40] for he that has suffered In the Flesh
[2:00:43] has ceased from sin that he no longer
[2:00:46] should live the rest of his time in the
[2:00:48] flesh to lust of men but the will of God
[2:00:51] so it's the word of God God that's why
[2:00:53] we have to pray that's why we have to
[2:00:55] pray and see they were astonished Mark
[2:00:58] 1026 they were astonished out of out of
[2:01:01] measure saying among them themselves who
[2:01:04] then can be saved Jesus looking upon
[2:01:06] them said with men it is impossible but
[2:01:10] with God for With God all things are
[2:01:14] possible then Peter began to say unto
[2:01:17] him Lord we've left all and have
[2:01:19] followed thee Lord we've left everything
[2:01:21] we gave up so many things to follow you
[2:01:24] and I I've give we've all given up
[2:01:26] things I've given up careers and
[2:01:29] all and I don't regret it oh yeah I wish
[2:01:33] I had the money
[2:01:34] sure that I gave up but I don't regret
[2:01:38] giving
[2:01:39] up on those things to receive Christ
[2:01:44] Christ is the greatest of all
[2:01:47] amen what profit is a man to gain the
[2:01:49] whole war and lose his own soul or what
[2:01:51] will a give in exchange for his
[2:01:53] soul we have to make the right
[2:01:56] Investments and you everyone who chosen
[2:02:00] Christ you've made the right investment
[2:02:03] because this world is falling apart
[2:02:05] Israel is is is about to Israel is
[2:02:09] waiting they're they're waiting to build
[2:02:11] a temple you you know about the red
[2:02:12] heers you all know they already got the
[2:02:14] red heers over there they already uh
[2:02:17] even um October
[2:02:20] also when one of the leaders of Rome he
[2:02:23] was told by the head of Rome you know
[2:02:26] who that is to give those
[2:02:30] vessels those vessels that were kept
[2:02:34] from the destroying of the temple in the
[2:02:36] past 2,000 years ago Rome kept those
[2:02:39] vessels and lied about it all through
[2:02:41] the years and finally decided to give
[2:02:44] those vessels back to Israel they say
[2:02:46] they on they're for you and we don't
[2:02:48] want to hold up your blessings but it's
[2:02:50] too late now they already cursed Babylon
[2:02:54] is already cursed be because they not
[2:02:57] only came against Abraham but his
[2:03:01] seed All Through the Ages 68 million
[2:03:04] over 68 million Christians killed
[2:03:06] through the Dark
[2:03:09] Ages and Rome is still in power so all
[2:03:12] those things are happening those are
[2:03:14] signs that total eclipse many rejoicing
[2:03:17] many spent thousands of dollars traveled
[2:03:19] all over to see that total eclipse but
[2:03:21] we know there's a major sign there's a
[2:03:23] sign of Darkness Isaiah said Darkness
[2:03:26] upon the Earth and grow Darkness upon
[2:03:29] the people that's religious Darkness but
[2:03:31] I want you to put a little light for
[2:03:33] this message Hallelujah and this light
[2:03:37] Hallelujah are you glad for this light
[2:03:39] Shalom little bride
[2:03:42] amen there's no time to be depressed
[2:03:45] we're Worship in the Feast of
[2:03:46] Tabernacles It's Time To Worship it's
[2:03:49] time to praise God it's time to internet
[2:03:51] King lamb worship like the Bible speaks
[2:03:54] of in Revelation 5 why because John
[2:03:56] recognized his name was in the book
[2:04:02] amen so rejoice in your trials you see
[2:04:06] that's so hard rejoice in your
[2:04:09] tribulations Peter said we left off
[2:04:12] Jesus answered and said verely I said
[2:04:13] unto you there is no man that haveth
[2:04:16] left house or Brethren or sisters and
[2:04:20] now Jesus said he that do the will of
[2:04:21] God the same as my mother my sisters and
[2:04:24] brothers remember they try to exalt Mary
[2:04:26] in the Book of Luke blessed are the womb
[2:04:29] that bear the and the P give the suck he
[2:04:31] said no you're not going to exalt Mary
[2:04:33] you're not going to exalt the Virgin
[2:04:34] Mary but blessed are they that hear the
[2:04:36] word of God and keep it amen and the
[2:04:39] same as my mothers and my brothers and
[2:04:41] my
[2:04:43] sister or father or mother or wife or
[2:04:45] children or lands for my sake and the
[2:04:47] gospels but he shall receive in h
[2:04:50] hundredfold now in this this time houses
[2:04:53] and Brethren and sisters and mothers and
[2:04:55] children and lands look here
[2:04:59] with with what you see so we're right in
[2:05:03] line as a Son of God as a daughter of
[2:05:06] God with persecutions and in the world
[2:05:08] so he promised us persecutions just like
[2:05:11] Abraham had persecutions we going to
[2:05:13] have persecutions but Jesus said be of
[2:05:15] good cheer be of good cheer be
[2:05:18] encouraged be encouraged I'm come and
[2:05:22] the same holy ghost in you is going to
[2:05:25] overcome so let us keep on pressing let
[2:05:28] us keep pressing the battle let's keep

[2:16:07] word of the Lord on
[2:16:09] today HS The Heirs of
[2:16:13] Promise uh certainly appreciate brother
[2:16:16] belon and just uh the Lord using him I
[2:16:18] was um listening and he was kind of
[2:16:21] reading some of the scriptures there
[2:16:23] talking about the trials and it uh he
[2:16:25] just was all over last couple weeks of
[2:16:28] services but I was thinking about
[2:16:29] brother brother Quinton when he came a
[2:16:31] few Wednesday nights ago and he was just
[2:16:33] sharing how uh we going to go from one
[2:16:37] trial to the next trial to the next
[2:16:39] trial and it was for warning us that
[2:16:42] this is this is just part of the
[2:16:43] Christian Journey it's not anything that
[2:16:45] we run from but actually something that
[2:16:47] we run to and and I'm going to tell you
[2:16:50] something this may sound a little
[2:16:52] strange but when you are when you've
[2:16:54] been a Christian for a
[2:16:55] while uh the trials don't seem to weigh
[2:16:58] you down the way they used to weigh you
[2:17:00] down you realize it's just part of the
[2:17:02] the journey right and that that's just
[2:17:04] part of what God promised and and and
[2:17:06] and there's nothing that the devil can
[2:17:08] do and another thing he he mentioned
[2:17:09] today Chief demons we talked about that
[2:17:12] on Wednesday night demons are real and
[2:17:16] we don't we don't we you know he
[2:17:17] mentioned earlier how the way that he
[2:17:19] defeated the devil every time a demon
[2:17:21] came cuz they it's a real Spirit you
[2:17:24] have to plead the blood of
[2:17:27] Jesus I I plead the blood of the Lord
[2:17:31] Jesus Christ that's where your Victory
[2:17:33] is but uh he was talking about how how
[2:17:35] Chief demons and I just thought to
[2:17:36] myself if if the devil has assigned a
[2:17:40] chief demon to you you must be a
[2:17:44] threat yes sir you must be a rough a
[2:17:48] rough character for the devil If he if
[2:17:50] he got the chief
[2:17:53] demon you got you you must be troubled
[2:17:56] to the devil's Kingdom amen but if the
[2:17:59] chief demon can't take you down you can
[2:18:01] they can forget about it church we
[2:18:03] walking in Victory going from one
[2:18:05] Victory to the next Victory to the next
[2:18:07] amen and we thank God for the character
[2:18:09] building process along the way brother
[2:18:12] Belton We Appreciate You amen this
[2:18:15] morning God richly richly bless you amen
