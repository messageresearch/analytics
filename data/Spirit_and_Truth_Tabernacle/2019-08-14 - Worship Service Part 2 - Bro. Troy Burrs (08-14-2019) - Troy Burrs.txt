Deuteronomy the fourth chapter and I'll let you have your seat so long I'll take our time see I'm just having even that's better hey man look sorry Deuteronomy a man the fourth chapter in the fourteenth verse a man we're speaking on and just studying looking into worship and we titled it a worship service and just kind of looking at how we were in in this in this age and all throughout time you know the devil's primary objective is to exalt himself above the throne of God and to be worshipped by man he desired to be worshipped and if you're not careful if you're not careful in this hour without the reveal word without a revelation you will find yourself worshiping Satan and not knowing it amen and these are the things that we just kind of want to bring out Amen because mankind was created to worship amen we regardless of whether we go to church or regardless of what we do man I'm going to just going to find something to worship see because we're sheep and we must follow something amen if we if we not following the right thing we'll follow the wrong thing amen Deuteronomy the fourth chapter and the fourteenth first and the LORD commanded me at the time to teach you statutes and judgments that you might do them in the land whether you go over to possess take you there for good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similar to on the day that the Lord spake unto you in harab out of the midst of the fire lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similar tool of any figure the likeness of male or female the likeness of any beast that is on the earth likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish is in the water or beneath the earth and less thou lift up that an island to heaven and when now since the Sun in the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven should be driven to worship worship them and to serve them which the LORD thy God has divided unto the nations under the whole heaven made a lord at a blessing to the reading of his word amen you may be seated amen we see here that you know one of the first commandments that the Lord gave the children of Israel that he said that he'll have no other God before a man because we see that that in the beginning Satan from the beginning met him there in the Garden of Eden God had already had laid things out he took six thousand years and and he and he laid out the garden just the way he wanted to and he gave Adam dominion over everything in the garden and he gave them a wife and and and and everything was good there but what he did was Satan came in and did just what he do he perverted what God had already done and he started with the seed because the Word of God is the original seed so if he can just get in there and corrupt that see he gave Eve a hybrid word see the God's Word is pure and it must stay peer so the devil came in and he gave her pot truth he gave her a little bit of truth mix with the life the definition of section is the truth misrepresented so he is a deceiver and so he was able to slide in and and and and and give her a part of the word and didn't slip his own agenda and right on the end there which calls her to go off amen and message god of this evil age he pointed out how at that time it took God six thousand years a man to create his Garden of Eden and it's his taking they devil six thousand years to create his Garden of Eden and we're living right smack dab in the middle of it now this is Satan's Eden amen but there shall be light in the evening time amen we see here that uh in Isaiah he says I will ascend upon the heights of the clouds and will be like the Most High we're going to just kind of just go back a little bit then we're going to get into some things amen Cain and Abel they both worship they both was was did with the church they both was justified Amen man they both was sanctified they both did everything that they did but the only difference between Cain and Abel was Abel had a revelation that it was blood Cain still believe that Oh lied I believe that it was fruit in the garden and they've been telling that lie since - since then that it was an apple so he went and planted a garden amen and presented amen the fruits of his labor a man of his labor of the things saying well this is what I did Lord look at what I did this is what I did but see you have to understand that that was Kane's service to the Lord he go out and he would he would check his garden and he would turn to the to the fruiting and the different things and he'd leave them across the altar in incense seal service to God but she let me tell you something you have to you have to be in God's will to do him a service you can be sincere in your efforts and me but if you're not in the will of God your service is not accepted if you're not in the revelation of the truth for the hour in which you're living in your worship is not accepted we look now and in today's time many people don't search doors every Sunday and good people see we have to understand that it's not the people but it's the church system it's the system we we we go back and we looked at that that uh the Prophet brought out that Babylon he said it was the system the system of idol worship and that that's that that concept has been spread throughout the entire world Amen we'll see how Nimrod had brought together all of the nations they may have brought together all of the nations and he introduced this idol worship one of the main things men this worship of three gods a man with the father the woman and the child the Prophet brought out in the church ages how he didn't in that time they put the woman over the Child Jesus it was the father in heaven the end Oh mother and damned - ah and this three gossip placing the woman as a go matter pressure brought up in the message flashing red lights are becoming like this nation amen you see now that the woman has become her God amen and she's been a tool in the hand of the Satan every since the beginning the Bible said that the sons of God that looked on the daughters of men and saw that they were found a man and then it took a partner wives amen he's always been dangling a woman using a woman to achieve his agenda amen we go back and we look here we see that that number odd had three main objectives his first objective was a man for every to create a man I'm sorry hello his first objective was to create a name for himself he wanted to make a name for himself his objective was not a man for Christ or God to be glorified he it was all about him amen and the second objective was to start his own religion we see how was one religion that was a way the gods way but he wanted to propagate his own way to get to glory his third thing was to build a strong nation amen and so we see that the only nation that people that God called as a nation was the Jews and other than that God calls individuals he never called anyone else as a nation so we see that that when he was talking about a nation the Prophet brought that out as he wanted to build a denomination and seeing that that well was the seat where he would draw people up under this system of idolatry amen and blinding the people under the deception and started a polytheism form of worship amen and not that that concept just kind of just kind of when it went across the world there and and we see all across in different societies and different sects where the same thing we see a Buddha they have it's an image of three Buddhist priests amen and they worship and over in India they have something similar to that and here amen we see the concept of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost and we'll get into that just a little bit later now we found today a man that people you ask people about Christianity and and they say they tend to tell you that they'd all they have to do is be a good person speaking to people you find that today it seems that people whatever they choose God would just accept anything on the basis of the sincerity of their heart but no it has to be God's provided wait you can't just be like Nimrod come up with your own idea you can't be like him and just say well well well well I'm not gonna really search the scripture to see how we get back to to glory I'm having everybody believe well one day there's a rapture in there when we die we all just go to help but no one is looking to see well where what is the way that is a door there is a way there's a provided wait amen let's look at Deuteronomy the sixteenth chapter a man that were to run him at a sixteenth chapter amen we're gonna look into that a little bit a man what is God's provided place of worship a man it's a very important the Prophet preached this message in 1965 three times a man in each time his revelation on the subject seemed to have just gotten greater and greater he also went between he preached trying to do God a service without it being his will and also right and then he preached spiritual food and due season and right behind that I think he preached it is the horizon of the Sun amen and all of these things when you really look at him and you really begin to dig into it they all could met he was trying to get us to see something Amen that be careful a man of you must worship God in spirit and in truth amen we come to church and we worship we worship God and we say thank you we've some time like I said last week and we praise God the scriptures say we praise their moaning allow some but praise them on the high Sun but let everything that has breath praise the Lord now that's that synonymous with worship is definitely a part of worship but worship goes just a little bit farther than that and we'll dig into that just a little bit amen worship is the lifestyle that you live a man a worship is a condition of your heart amen you can praise the Lord but if your heart is not in the right place it's just empty noise amen it's just empty noise thank you brother amen Deuteronomy 16 we read from the first verse to observed a month of abiud and keep the past over unto the Lord thy God for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night and we know that Egypt types denominational bondage a man thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there thou shalt eat no leaven bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread there with even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste and thou mayst remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of their life and there shall be no leavened bread seen with Whitney and all the coasts within all the coasts seven days neither shall there anything of the flesh which thou sacrificed the first day at even remain all night until the morning thou mayst not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee but in the place with the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in thou shalt sacrifice the Passover and even at even the going down of the Sun at this at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt and thou shall roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose and thou shall turn in the morning and go into the tenth six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and the seventh day thou shalt be a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God and thou shalt do work there in seven days thou shalt number unto the unto thee being the number seven weeks from such time as the beginning to put the sickle in the corn and thou shalt keep the feast weeks unto the Lord thy God and tribute the freewill offering unto thine hand and shout down unto the Lord thy God according to the LORD thy God bless thee amen amen and we see basically this is going on the show that only in the Gates Worth where God shows the place his name is the only print only place Amen what he is going to accept worship the place where he chose to place his name amen bear with me Church we're going to see that that turn to turn here to of revelations amen let's look at revelations the 12th chapter revelation 12 the seventh verse there's one provided place the place where he chose to place his name there amen before we do that lets go to the revelations thirteen revelations thirteen the eighth verse any read on this word says that and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life slain from the foundation of the world o that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him now how he's gonna see see everybody's gonna worship something everybody's gonna worship now what we want to do is make sure that we're not in this group because all whose name is not written in the Lamb's Book of Life will worship Him who was him now let's look at revelation 12 amen the seven he says and there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was there found place any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world I want you to pay attention to that right this which deceiveth the whole world now if it'll be so close that it'll deceive the very elect if it's possible it's not gonna be outside of religion Satan knows he looked back and he watched God and he wants to be like him so he's not trying to he's not trying to get people into the barroom he's not goal is not to get you all of the doing all kind of divine things it's just to get you off the word if he could just get you off the word because see it in heaven if it's not pure if it's not pure word then it's off the word because you can't divide God up and mix it with anything else it made me do the word is a CD and it is in its purity to produce a hybrid God would not produce after itself anything that's hybrid would not produce itself again it must remain pure the original water seed of God is the spoken word amen so we see here that isn't that the devil Satan which deceiveth the whole world this is how he's going to get these people here that all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life why through the deception through misrepresenting the truth of the gospel you know and I say just so many people just believe that you could make it just be good we can just live a good life or we can just come to church and garden we'll just ask God once we get there no you won't get there you can't just what you better have you ever have a thirst of the hunger for a man for truth acknowledge now amen he who hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be fed amen if you love him you you you desire to know him amen he stole representation of it not just a good fluffy storybook type message to know him in a pal in the revelation that is what's going to produce the life in you Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and he that word was that word was inspired but once it was inspired and he spoke it it was written and it laid there for hundreds of years as words on paper this Bible we have here is words on paper it's words on paper but it takes the inspiration of Almighty God to make these words live Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and two thousand years later a man the anointing fell on those words amen and an angel came to a virgin and said you have been highly favored what was it this day those scriptures was being fulfilled and the penis of that word what did it do created a life in the womb of Mary the very word that was spoken by the Prophet 2,000 years ago became life at that point because his word was not saw it will produce amen glory to God now we see that uh the phagon was cast on that serpent called the devil Satan wish to see the whole world he was cast out of the earth cast out into the earth and his angels was cast with him amen you know in the message there how can I overcome the Prophet said that this is the greatest age of deception there was you see because like I spoke earlier that that there's been two hundred thousand thousand demons loose from the river Euphrates that's all congestion in this one time with fighting all kind of demonic spirits amen that's why out of all of the light of the gospel that we have in this age amen there is a maturing of every see a man with there's a maturing of the faucet see we see what happened in in the beginning when when when Cain couldn't give his way the Bible said that he became Ross in his spirit amen and he slew his brother amen and we look at the same spirit that came down when Jesus amen they they chose they chose a thief and a robber over Christ Jesus what happened they became that priest said they became Roth in a spirit insult to kill the word same spirit let me tell you something my brothers and sisters there's an ecumenical council amen that hates the bride why because our very presence and of our very stance on the word they look at us like we're the problem they are wrong in their spirit but see they come in in such a soft raiment I'll give you an example they say well well we're supposed to just love everybody love everybody and then they allow homosexual marriages in the churches and call it Christian love they allow women and different things to be priests and leaders in it and call it Christian don't want to offend nobody but you our faith in God where is your love for him that evil over here because that's not who you worship you are standing during the pulpit of Satan Amen why she is actually being watched and people go and don't realize it sit and take part of it and I all got this church that uses at the end of the service they would get down and they would put out to chat and say the doors of the church is now but it's not about the doors of the church is being opened what about the door of your heart being open the door of your heart and it's not about you joining the church but letting Christ into your heart and your life you become a member of the body through a verse you can't join the church you have to be born into it but they tell people that all you gotta do just come come sitting and chatting different ones and the mother letter churching the elders and one they come and shake your hand and put your name on the roll and send you out to go and tell you now just keep coming to church and you'll be all right shame on all in the name of Christianity that God is not getting no worship from that not one iota but it's Scott's us so many are the scene by right hand fellowship and coming there and blow these Creed's and dogmas but denying the power of the word the revelations of the truth in this hour a man god of this evil age the prophet says the devil's unholy spirit is calling his church by the error of perversion the devil's unholy spirit is calling his church worship it is an attitude of the heart towards God's Word outside of that there is no worship there is going through the motions but your worship is empty your worship is yes you going through just just the scriptures say you worship me or with your lips but your heart is far from me a man Bible say there in John the second chapter 15 verse love not the world neither the things of the world If any man love the world and the love of the father is not in it for all that is of the world the luster yard lust of the flesh and the pride of life is not of the Father but of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof see the Prophet told us we won't have those things to worry about when we get on the other side because those emotions of those glands won't be there a man and his wife was I said well he who you're gonna love the most me just a first wife or the second wife he said well you won't have that problem because those those we won't have them to just be perfect love there'll be no more lust that stuff is gonna burn up here it'll be over with we'll have different bodies you don't have to worry about those kind of things a man and the world passes away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever you see he that doeth his will so we found that the service of the Lord must be done in his will and his will is in the truth of the gospel now I'm not talking about as the Prophet said in trying to do God a service and and I'm I won't get into it because I'm saving that there's five things that you must have to do God's will the first he said it must be in his time and season he said imagine if Moses started building a boat saying I'm a goin get the children be German and sell them down the Nile are we gonna sail to freedom no it was not time for that that was Noah's day imagine it must be the word must be the word for that day he said it must be in his time and his season I mean that's why I brought out not long after that he he preached a message spiritual food and due season man the price it was isn't something my brother's assistance to see how all of these measures fell together one behind the other and the next thing was it must be according to his word it must be according to his word amen I didn't I didn't I didn't write them all down here but it's following we'll get into it we're getting to it sometime but it's five months amen that when you're doing saying one of the main things that must be his will you can't do something you you can have be sincere we see David was sincere in trying to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to the camp but he consulted the wrong people he consulted the host of the army and the different was but he never consulted the process never consulted the prophet and it cost a man his life she going outside of the will of God doing the service you could cause no damage then then then good amen the message choosing God's provided place of worship amen 1965 February 20th paragraph 38 page 8 I've been wanting to say that a man he says here then we see by the very creature CH denomination is left far behind let me let me go back let me go back a little bit now all the feasts and holidays of the holidays all the Tabernacles all the wood everything in the tabernacle everything typed Christ all the offerings and the laws that everything was in tight of Christ we've been through it time after time here at the Tabernacle he says then we see by these that every Creed church and denomination is left far behind it's not even in the race at all every Creed every church every denomination is completely left out there is no place for them at all nothing is typed in the Old Testament or anywhere in the Bible that the church but the forced unity of the babbles tower that that's the only thing that types the unity because it was by Nimrod a wicked man who went out and forced all the little countries to become into one place and the end and in this great tower it was a religious worship of course but not considered in the Word of God so there were you see denominational religion typed in the Tower of Babel in the Old Testament which this religion is certainly a religion but not the religion of the Word of God God has not chose to put his name in any denomination he wanted us he says I want in the scripture for it if it is I know that I know they claim he has but he hasn't he has not put his name in many places because he said he put his name in one place and that one place each one of our denominations want to say that there that place but it's contrary but where did he put his name now he now and he what is his name first of all we have the name we find that God's name is before we can find what he were he putting it in place now we find out that he had many titles he's called the Father which is a title he's called the son which is a title he's called the Holy Ghost which is a title he's called the Rose of Sharon which is a title he's called the lily of the valley which is a title he's called the morning star he's called Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha it's the seven different compound names of redemption names of all that they are all titles amen none of them were names but he has a name and when mote when he met Moses he had not the name yet but he told Moses I am that I am and when we see Jesus on earth speaking in Hebrews the six chapters I'm sorry I beg your pardon John the six chapters he said I am that I am they said why your man not over 50 years old and say that you seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am that I am see the one the burning bush in the pillar of fire that was the burning bush back there in the days of Moses I am that I am and now we find out that Jesus said also I come in my father's name and you received me not then the name of the father must be Jesus that write the name of the father is Jesus because Jesus says so I carry my father's name I come in my father's name and they received me not and Jesus and he said Gabriel called him Jesus and the prophets called him Jesus and he was absolutely Jesus before his birth even the holy prophet called him name Emmanuel which means God with us and we see that when marry a man like Gabriel came and told Mary that she was highly favored it was the angel that told him you would call him Jesus you're not going to just pick the name you were Joseph get together and just pick a name I'm gonna tell you what his name is and and and what was it it was that work he had chosen already before the foundation of the world a man but he who had chosen already the place his place of worship amen the place where they could it's going to be in that name of Jesus amen and to prove it that when when when Mary went to Elizabeth's and told her like the angel and everything had came true and told her that the neck the child's name would be Jesus amen that prophet that was in the belly of Elizabeth leap for joy amen why cuz he recognized that name even being a child not even going you recognize that name why because it was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world knowing that the redemption is drawing man see it was altogether dead even even then before they was even breathed the breath of air they were still just cells in the in the in the window in the wombs of these two women they came together the word came to the prophet and the Prophet received the Holy Ghost right in the womb recognizing that that name there is a name to worship that name above everything amen and we see even today even in our denominational churches even anything what was it it was the word for that date being manifest now they'll say well it's just Jesus and we're worshipping Jesus but the same thing is happening today my brothers and sisters amen we've had a prophet in this hour amen of stop that have came Amen just like John the Baptist to show you the father's appearing to show you that he's come again and you're doing the same thing you're recognizing not but you say we're worshiping Jesus you're worshiping that historical event you're worshiping me Satan has deceived you once again amen but it's not possible a man for the bride to be deceived amen to him that hath an ear cuz they have something he said my sheep know my voice any man we're talking about worship where do we worship how do we worship how do we serve the Lord there's a certain place that we have to worship we can't worship in any gate we can't worship it is a condition of the heart that he receives our worship amen may the Lord at a blessing hey man we're gonna stop right there amen and that hopefully another time that we can come back and there's more to it a man because when you when you go back and you look at the birth we're talking about there when we're married but we go back and we continue to the the journey of Mary a man and when she went into Bethlehem the place of God place of bread amen and and and and and into a manger how those three wise men what did they follow they followed a star that star was a reflection of the Sun amen and we had a star coming this day a man that is leading us what back to that to Christ again leading us leading us to the revealed Word amen amen the knows that star shine amen and in the manger the Prophet brought out he says not a manger is in your heart I was speaking earlier about that the doors are the church being opening they know there's a let him be born if there's no room in the end there's no room for him in the denominational churches they have too many programs and I you know I talk to certain people and they say well I'm going to this church because I like B programs I like the program where they got things for the kids and and maybe they got things on the holidays little programs and things like that is it no no room for Christ in the end because you got too many programs but open up your heart since there's no room in the end opened up the manger of your heart and let Christ be birthday within your heart amen let them be birth within your heart wrap him up in the swaddling clothes and coming to his kingdom amen you love the Lord Amen so let us stand we're gonna we're gonna stop it right there we don't want to go past our time I see keep going on that because it's just so much with when we go from there talking about a true worship and the true service and and and look at the the the events that when the Prophet was bringing these things out and all of the messages that sort of lined up and what they were really saying my god it's just something a man Church we're getting ready to go home amen we're living in Satan's Eden amen but God amen is there's another place where he's chosen to place his name amen there was a song a man that came out not too long ago say he chose me he chose me amen gosh chosen place of worship he's chosen you he's chosen us a mentor place his name in this hour a man he lives in us now we're that-that-that-that light he may I mean that they started the city's he preached that message right after that not so long ago after that it is the rising of the Sun amen amen rising of the Sun Amen so y'all just bear with him still studying to put some of these things together but it's a beautiful study amen seeing how a man the people the Satan has deceived the minds of so many a man but the main thing us being believable a man this is this is my skim milk this as strong me amen and now you know some of the numbers kicked them out they can't you know they hit this kind of stuff for me all they just like hey they get raw food me spirit are you talking about the Baptist Church like that are mine man I've been here for so many years understand the other day Christ left it long Christ left it long time ago got too many programs and different vain like that and bishops and all kind of stuff and that you don't have any room for Christ in them all he standeth from the outside but there is the door to the heart that have been your heart a man let him be birthed in the manger pure heart they may let us bow is you take this chopped up for your father God and me you just find a nesting place Oh father God in the homes of people I just give us a Lord God urgency Oh Lord God stimulation the revelation law knowing that we are chosen people priesthood [Music] we're not worshipping the Satan not falling for the tricks exceptional Lord God the Lord we see you for who you are we see you for where you are Lord God you have revealed to us over think when we come to the point spirits operating in the framework of the devil of a powerless the Lord may we see these things are fun continue Lord God to elevate us O Lord the word continue to manifest look I was in a mortal body just like Mariola nodded Sarah Lord God we expect me hallelujah changing the world everything is lining up everything is coming into full but to video father ice ever so brutal father guards in the cross I was so expecting a Lord God looking for your for your promises so father-god
