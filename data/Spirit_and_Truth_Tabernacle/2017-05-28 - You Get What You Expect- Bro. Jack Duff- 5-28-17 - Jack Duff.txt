has actually been here that should y'all got to help sister Ashley okay since I got up here I thought she was here much longer alright there's a little bit before y'all y'all see some of these voices that we don't get a chance to hear y'all get them up and let them sing right don't just like so the actually before you leave we're going to get a song from you and it's just of a nice walk through the door guy get a soften up too but don't don't let them say it's coming and not blessings we got to be blessed by that so I didn't see it but praise God all right a man so good to see also specialist imaginary madness it's my family a man thank God for them here and I'm Matthew 9 verse 27 it says and when Jesus departed then two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of David have mercy on us and when he was coming to the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe he that I'm able to do this they said to him yeh Lord been touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were open and Jesus straitly charged them saying see that no man knowing now you know that's almost impossible right two blind men get healed hi-hi are they not going to be able to tell it right when people saw them yesterday you couldn't see but now all of a sudden you are seeing I can may not tell him right and when God does something for you how can you not tell me a man but they when they were departed spreader brought his fame and all that country as they went out the hole they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil so brother Branham brought out brought to attention that when a person has a dumb spirit where they can't speak that's a devil that's finding them stopping them from being able to speak verse 33 says that when the devil was cast out that's all that needs to happen when the devil is cast out the dumb spake and the multitudes marveled saying it was never so seen in Israel but the Pharisee said he casteth out devils through the Prince of the Devils and Jesus went bout went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word let us bow in a word of Prayer amen on today God we are grateful for the privilege we have to read the word of the Lord but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to help quicken what we've read and make it come alive to our hearts make it live for even right now we trust God that is not just Bible stories but that we can look deeper into this and see that you are the same yesterday today and forever so if you did it back then you can do again today so help us got to apply our faith to the word that we have heard and may you God just get glory and honor out of everything that happens here we take control every spirit that is against your spirit and we bind it now in the name of Jesus we cast it out and access you God will come and have complete authority in Jesus name we pray amen god bless you you can be seated a man this morning praise the Lord a man we want to just take our title this morning you get what you expect a man you get what you expect and just to identify a man this word expectation and define it for us this morning it's a strong belief that something will happen and man when you have an expectation you have a strong belief a man you might not be able to put your your finger on when it's going to happen a man you might not be able to tell people how it's going to happen Amen but you have a strong belief that it is going to happen praise the Lord and as Christians we should always be walking around in under expectation maybe we should always have a faith a man in the Word of God that whatever God has promised you ought to be looking for it all the time looking for it to be fulfilled no matter what comes against you it may be your expectations still say there's going to happen praise the Lord if it's healing you got to expect that it's going to happen even if in your body you're going to feel worse you still have to have an expectation that it's going to get better Alleluia if you're going through a man of trouble sometimes even in your finances and you know that God promised you a man that he's going to rebuke the Devourer for your sake you might not be able to tell people when it's going to happen but your expectation says it is going to happen and if you can keep your expectations then you get what you expect and I know everybody going through some type of trial here today but my encouragement is that and don't let the devil take your expectation well whatever you do don't let them take that and I mean everything is coming against you right but don't let the devil take your expectation that's a strong lean belief Amen that something will happen and it's in the narcissus as there's something what happens or is going to be the case in the future so expectation deals with the future our event my expectation you don't have to have expectation with something that you see them right now but expectations what you see in the future and faith is the thing that annoys your expectation things has long-range vision faith is now looking at the current circumstance this is not looking at the sect of the current situation case does not listen to what the doctors say it tastes not looking at anything so take his long-range vision if I think kissing is beautiful bring it to pass come on somebody Amen you don't get what you expect hallelujah somebody so if I tell you I'm under expectation for some great things let me just try to slip myself down because you know I just I feel my I feel my help like they say I film I help copy a man let's listen at this the and the sermon believe about this the Prophet says here 300 years ago it says a French scientist proved that if you go the terrific speed of 35 miles an hour gravitation would take you off the earth you say you think science would refer back to that today it says are there going 1900 miles an hour and still going on they're pressing forward looking for it but we want to look back and see what moody said and thank you say it Finley said knocks Calvin some of those what they said was all right that was for their age but we're going on my grandfather rode rocks I'm driving a Ford v8 my son will fly a jet plane amen that's where that's we're moving on that's what religion ought to be the coming of the Lord is at hand the church ought to be moving on into the powers now I like this you know that this discernment believers out if you say the church ought to be moving on into the powers glory to God science can only climb so far and then it has to drop off but look at this but we got untapped sources come on church amen I haven't even began to in there enjoy y'all clock out for me and then I got some untapped sources and I'm ready to tap into them right I'm ready to experience them say he said we got untapped sources that never been touched it says of the power a limit of God that we ought to be moving into we're living a million miles under our privilege tonight our privileges of Christians to be enjoying I'm looking for that you're I'm supposed to be enjoying this FSS I feel ashamed of myself when I look out here see the institutions and the sickness and the troubles that's going on right now our search ought to be walk in the street I would search ought to be welcome the street let me put it this way our church ought to be healing the sick all at search ought to be raising the dance how it search ought to be casting out Devils amen our church ought to be doing signs and wonders making my whole world realize that Jesus Christ live that's where our churches they're supposed to be it said that's what we need to be done of doing a man so my expectation that we're going to be moving into that sphere not many days hence glory to God expectation is a strong belief that something will happen or be the case in the future glory to God let me just kind of drop into another little thought here on a bleeding of the Spirit of God a man leading of the Spirit of God the Prophet makes this comment also says expectations says if you're expecting it you will receive it I want you to get that one if you're expecting it you will receive it glory to god I'm just really I got some things that I want to just kind of drop in there when I went I'm just waiting but but there's you know we got to see ourselves you know getting that promise we got to see ourselves receiving what God spoke you know that we can receive we got we got to already see tax a man says expectations if you're expecting it you will receive it so you usually get what you expect to get hallelujah you know sometimes you know your expectation is that strong belief right of something that will happen and and and sometimes you know you can have a strong belief internally even though you have not expressed it externally like not now stay with me on this one because you know oftentimes you can be saying one thing with your mouth right but on the inside you don't believe what you just said you said it because that's the right thing to stay around Christians that's the only reason you said it because you know you you ain't gonna talk no doubt round no Christians you already know what they gonna say let out you know it I was I was just talking with brother Diggs and we were just kind of sharing and said when he came down here and you know and he was going through that blindness you know in his eyes so every everybody had a quote for him everybody had a scripture you know everybody says you know just just just say this to just do that and just believe it just keep repeating five strikes I'm here then I've been doing that for real right he's saying and it's not that it's not that I don't believe that of course I believe that what my expectations say I don't want to just get it I want to experience it right so you know when we went you know often times up when we call through different things you know we just kind of say the right expression when we get around Christians right with this we go we know exactly how to put it but on the end of you know in the back of your mind even though you have confessed you know by structure meal you got a but but the doctor said now you know but this about that is he's been the reason that that but that you have that's your expectation even though you have not actually ceremony enough in your heart that's what you believe and you don't get what you expect see but with faith I need some of that expectation amen you have the right mental attitude towards what God has promised you then the darkening say one thing saying you can tell everybody not a doctor said this but my god a mentor either got a hit of all my diseases see your expectation has change of not based on what the doctor said your expectations based on what the Word of God says and that type of expectation you don't get what you expect stay with me here expectation if you expecting you receive it you usually get what you expect to get if you come to the meeting tonight expect you to find something to criticize Amen something to criticize the meeting the devil will show you because that's what you're expecting you were looking for something wrong so the devil going to show you something wrong and you're gonna go home with something wrong right but if you expect them to get some from God then you leave here with some from God hallelujah say he will sin he will see that you get satisfied the devil will meet your expectation and if the devil can reach expectation what do you think about God [Applause] see he said he talked about the devil he will see that you get satisfied says you get what you expect if you come to get up sing hallelujah anybody come to get one of them today if you come come on we got safe test driving a long way they didn't come to play games with this they need blessings they come to get a blessing then often many times the fakes have come into the church not knowing what the message was going to be that day but they knew they had something that they needed to call and the right one will be spoken right to their situation they leave with a blessing come on church it's the way that we approach this thing look at this we face there's our said you get what your spec if you come to get a blessing God will see that you get it I love this I wanna I want to hold on I want to work with that just for a little bit God will see that you get it if you come to get saved God will see that you that you get it if you come to get he'll be expecting to get healed God will see that you do it is whatever you expect him now sir today is the Simeon they didn't have telegrams and so forth like date like they do today and they did have televisions and the radios and so forth amount of slides as we have the message whip was from lip to ear and you know only those only those who expect and usually get what they're looking for now let's pick up send me in here in the scripture turn with me to Luke chapter 2 and I will pick him up my god if you expect that God will see that you get it God will see to it if that's what you expected Alleluia but also if you got something negative a man the devil gonna see to it that you get it glory to God you're going to get what you expect either way you're going to either get it from God you're going to get it from the devil praise God Luke chapter 2 verse 25 let's look at how Simeon is approaching a man church glory to God Amen when you look at this and verse 25 says behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just a devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ now when I look at this man Simeon I just begin to think of my mind how many times this man by the might have been that close to death maybe laying on this sick man doctors don't start they pulled a glass was down they shaking their hands there ain't no hope for this man but Simeon got a promise that I am NOT going to see death until I see the Lord's Christ and simming that look the doctor now I say doctor maybe you can't help me and I understand you don't did everything you possibly could you don't mix this up and mix it up you don't did Avery and I appreciate your efforts but I got a promise and Simeon can look at us enough maybe you ain't got the same promise that I got but God told me I will not see death until I've seen it was quite Benny hair to his revelation and Simeon got what he was expecting it was a friendly he could explain if anybody but he has strong belief that God made him a promise and he was going to hold on to that I could see sympathy even if I died God to raise me up well as they say say and he came by the spirit and this is this this is the critical Amen component here - what Simeon did that day he came by the spirit unto the temple and my question to you is how did you come to church this one not that's the question how did you come are you coming out of tradition how are you coming it because I got nothing else better to do or Sunday but are you coming in the spirit expecting God to do something for you today sisimiut gain by the spirit into the temple and then opinion when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law and took him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to our words since when my eyes have seen thy salvation you know what Jim you could even go blind he can die he can go bloody with cover with promises and in his promise with a revelation that was given to him as an individual nobody else got this but never even had it and he's done on this relation don't you go out to stand on your own personal revelation and when you do that you don't get what you expect glory to God glory to God glory to God I am plan on losing nothing Amen I lose enough that I lose in my house I'm losing my tie losing nothing hallelujah look at this it's a thought now let's stop serving that servant depart in peace according to that word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people light to light the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel Simeon God what he expected a man and went you know we think about this expectations is usually based upon faith brother Branham made some comments in the sermon expectation 1961 February 5th and I'm just kind of making and just given a few quotes from here so expectation useless based upon faith you have to have faith before you can expect anything right says now like many of the servants of God no Testament faith cometh by hearing and hearing other words so you got to have faith before you can expect anything another thing you say you can't go to people and say now do you think I got my healing you can't go nobody acts in that you know using the same service I was in do you think I got it what you think about it it ain't what they think it's what you think right a man you know you often time to go looking for people to give us confirmations know that Bible gives us the confirmation and then God speaks to you you got your own confirmation you don't need nothing else Holly I don't care if God spoke to you twenty years ago you hold on to what he said to you 20 years ago and keep expecting hallelujah see you say he says he says you can't go around you can't go to people say now do you think I got my healing you think it's nothing what they think that has nothing to do into it it's what you think it's up to you you also say when we get all the little disbelieving spirits away from us now this is important God it's important because once the disbeliever spirit come away then you begin to see what you expected and i'ma try to say you by the gray sky Abraham had to get the disbelievers spirits away from him when the disbelievers Pierce was there must every time he did things that he should not have done he tried to help God out God promised him a son and here was this especially now ain't no way darker touched my body I better help children are sick just take my hand made taketake Haga and here just just leave in spirit sitting there Abraham's house and he follows my road that this principal person Ishmael but when the disbelievers fear got away then he popping eyes all right Church glory to God let's stay with it here says this and said when we get all that little just believe in spirits away from us here's what I want you know what I was coming to see when I looked at Abraham we all have to kind of go through this time of maturity even when it come to the promises right you know oftentimes we can receive something from God and we think we really got it right but but here coming enemy to try that and the test to see if we really got what you know what God told you that he was giving you and sometimes we make decisions we make choices that show that we don't truly believe all that God said and you know and we might get something out of it but we didn't get the perfect perfect plan of God out of it hallelujah church right Abraham did get affirmed but now the promise on hallelujah we got a little harlot I mean God want to bring it to a perfect face right where I mean if God said it that settles it I ain't changing nothing imma stay right with this no matter how long it takes my expectation will not change all right stay with me here let's go on he says I don't care it says when we get over this little just leave the spirits away from us and just take out at his word I don't care what so-and-so said and so and so that God's made the promise I stand right here then God will go to answering a lot of statement he makes say the longer the wait the greater the miracle you make sure I've been waiting a long time brother Jack the longer the wait the greater the miracle it just means so much when someone say I was waiting 25 years right another person I was waiting on hundred and twenty years but I was waiting this the longer the wait the greater the miracle it sure that God didn't forget glory glory glory listen says I'm reading also from just a few notes here from a sermon that he preached if anything too hard for the Lord says it happened because he expected it to happen the Abraham had the baby after 25 years the reason that happened is because Abraham expected it to happen since when something anchors in your heart where you know it's going to happen then something is going to happen say if it don't happen right now it will happen after a while if it don't happen today it will happen tomorrow if it got up tomorrow it will be next week whatever is going to happen anyhow God said so there you are now you're getting down to where you have faith when you start talking like that now you really got things because it's not being changed by the circumstances it's not being changed by you know whatever whatever whatever else occurs you still got faith believing that God makes your promise and and it can not fall to the ground of return boy so if it don't happen right now it's going to happen after a while if it don't happen today it'll happen tomorrow if it don't happen tomorrow it will be next week a man whatever is going to happen anyhow thought that so that's my faith church I got some things I'm holding on to and I tell you this is where my faith is they say say I am going to be the one that's going to be healed when you're walking into a service it might be a whole bunch of people but because I'm coming to church in the spirit I'm not counting testicle just where they buy together I'm coming because of atmospheres comfy created and this place in a girl nobody else get the healing I'm gonna be the one I'm living in Church of my healing I mean with my deliverance I'm moving with my promises reveal the earth expectation hallelujah hallelujah you know when you can imagine how and some of the prophecy meanings different people come with expectations Angelo will be with Minnesota here and then move over there didn't move over it's just moving all over the place because all these people had expectation I could just imagine somebody maybe how the Holy Spirit beginner deal with some other situation to call out this this one condition and said sister you got this that you're dealing with and this other so so I said I got the same thing in a God can speak to huh then let us speak to me and you let you to enjoy Lord just need faith to stop building up and everybody getting in getting their deliverance that's expec and you're looking the reason that they are doubt it because each one came on the expectation if your family first you call me second if you don't comment second you commentary you don't call me today hallelujah glory to God you know let me let me just kind of drop this in my god this dissing testimony let me and we'll we'll read this I just want to pray to be a blessing to your heart these these you know how you could go to meeting expecting and then the meetings over and you didn't get what you wanted you didn't get what you wanted right but uh Amen even though the meetings over God's not finished and you got to learn how to keep your expectation I want to go to the message expectation I'm going to paragraph B 38 a ma'am but you got to learn how to maintain your expectation even when you haven't I mean maybe the meetings over is like man I didn't get what I wanted don't let the devil take your expectation you got to keep that Church a man see you'll get what you expect a man II God will see that just satisfied he didn't say when he didn't say how he just gotta see to it that you are satisfied so whatever your expectation is God will meet that expectation glory to God look at this it says do you believe in being led and that's the Holy Spirit that lets him in that is inside life now and I said bring your brother here why in a moment the Lord had healed him he was crying and weeping said I never felt like this since I was a young boy went out of the building I sat down again to eat and something just lifted me up I went out wife and them followed me just as I stepped out the door I heard someone say oh thank god and a little woman dressed in black she knelt down on the street she began to cry and I said stand up sister and she stood up she said brother branham she was from Chicago she said I got cancer in the breast she said I've tried hard to get to you everywhere said I couldn't do it and she said this morning I started to eat and I was crying because I have to go back home and said the Spirit of the Lord said go stand in front of Miller's cafeteria at 10 minutes after 9:00 for the exact time I be there Oh hallelujah come on now go stand in front of Miller's cafeteria at 10 minutes after 9:00 there it was I met her over and Arkansas the other day just shouting it's been weeks ago said that's all everything had disappeared it had gone and I started on down the street the life said aren't you going to eat I said no the Spirit of the Lord is leading and I went on across the street and I started to go across to the drugstore to get some little coloring books we had to keep the baby locked up a little three-year-old girl in the room all day with the saw and I saw I spend my time in prayer that's how I know those things is pray and pray and I said and as I start across the street something said stop and I said oh my turned around wife said where you going I said you you all go right on to the hotel he's got something else for me to do and I backed up in the corner to look at some fishing reels I love the fish and so forth I backed up there see no one's looking at me and I turned my head I said father what would you have me to do and stood there not just imagine now I heard a voice said go to the corner I went down to the corner across the street and I stood there and they began to blow the whistle and the traffic would come across the street and they walked there with the lights and and I stood there for about 10 minutes and just kept standing there and after a while but whistle blows again the group of people cross the street just as busy as they could be and I noticed coming behind was a lady with a little checkered dress on she had on a little Canadian and she's carrying a pocketbook over over arm she walked across the street and the spill-off said go near to her and I walked right up to her like that and she passed by looking down passed on by me now I felt that strange maybe God just did something there that I didn't know she walked about 15 feet she turned back looked like that she said Allah brother branham and she said all she just began to beat herself said oh she didn't know what happened I said what's the matter sister she said I'm from Canada she said I've spent every penny that I've had I'm only allowed 150 dollars she said I got a with her him and she said I slept in a lobby last night right and I had five cents for coffee this morning and she said I was going out here on the road to hitchhike to get back home young woman about 30 years old she said and I was going on down here about two squares and something said to me turn this away and oh my there was I said stretch your hand sister right down the spot that the lady was healed and the reason that she was here because she kept her expectation notice what she just went through she's out of money she's sleeping in the hotel lobby and she got five cent left in the pocket on the way to go back home but the devil could not take her expectation and because she kept the expectation when she woke up that morning because she was still in the spirit she was an actress but she was still in the spirit the Holy Ghost could tell him I walk this way and she walked in to get so several say stop and turn right here and when she Lake Authority man my gosh she just counted or whatever she's doing and as she walked out did not realize the man that she was a great I was watching right back don't let God pass you by this one tip all right I remember the little fish stopped in time and look here Sheila sell my brother Fanta miles Alma I would give me a hitchhike to get out of here but I got it with her head

prom and each brother banner I mean fella we're still just sitting there at the house and you know they they I mean it don't know what doggone do but they know God don't do it all of a sudden it's

running in my group of people there they had to get a game to get away everybody around a healing service the Lord working in the middle of the street oh oh oh that shouldn't be a surprise because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday that they're ever and we were here we heard a testimony just a few weeks ago that when the brothers walked into a restaurant when decide where he wanted to go that night where the holy ghost said go to ha ha ha and if it nicking pancakes ha I give their case you got an idea to help some people take a selfie with them they are trying to get a motivated how but

expectation you got to sleep under expectation wake up with that necktie shuttle we're in the car Church my my my my my you get what you expect hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God listen listen I got a couple of things I want to just kind of share here you know I'm going back to that same sermon I'm going to paragraph e 29th glory to God the day was expecting God to deliver him from the lion's den the Hebrew children when they went into the fire first they said o our God is able they was expecting God to deliver them and they made the last step of the way before he came but he all he's always there at the last end Jesus comes in the darkest of hours then Jesus comes along they was expecting it the woman with the blood issue was expecting if she could touch the hem of His garment it was over when she touched the hem of His garment her expectations were fulfilled if you come tonight or today expecting to be here you're going to be healed if you come expecting to find something to criticize the meeting you'll certainly find it you get what you come for that's right now we go back to look at the story here that we ran out of Matthew 9 a man that just blessed my heart you know just reading this because the scripture tells us Amen there in verse 27 praise the Lord Amen the scripture tells us says and when Jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying to stand down son of David have mercy on us you know as I was reading that I say wait a minute how can blind men follow him we called our I can blind me and follow him right it's impossible for blind men to follow Jesus they can't see right and notice that especially when Jesus departed thence now what we need to understand is there were a couple things that happened before these blind men got hold of them one was that this is the ruler gyrus the ruler you know at the time he came seeking Jesus to come and bring healing to his door to that God right you see were seeking and as she was on sick she actually died and they come and tone saying I don't trouble the master your daughter's already dead you might as well just go ahead and accept reality right this was this encouragement from significant reality and just coming home and more and just don't trouble the master but as Jesus said no I'll go I'll go with you I'll go to your houses and as he's on the way to the demands house because of the crowd that's following there was a woman that have been also in a condition for 12 years and that woman say all know this is my opportunity and you got to see Church every time you come in it's an opportunity glory to God it's an opportunity for you to get something from God and then when the saints begin to gather in the atmosphere is being created it's an opportunity for me to get something right so that way they say no no no no I know he's not coming for me but I'll tell you what if I could just touch the hem of His garment I know I'll be Meho this condition that I've been suffering with for 12 years it'll be over my expectation says it will be over now if you know Scripture Jesus couldn't even go a pro turn because of the condition that she had I mean people can sit with her people can do that she couldn't even go to church with the condition that she had but it did not say she can approach him so she went and she touched for him his garment when she got that she turned and walked away in and she thought she got hers and she just I'm done but Jesus a who touched me when Jesus a who says they're not might not be the same out you know all these people touching you Jesus why would you say something like that who touch me you realize that everybody is touching it's like no but ain't nobody touched me the way that she touched me hallelujah when they say he's looked around the audience Candy's found to say okay sister what is it you know say your faces made your whole what is it that you know what what happens to he say she say I've been dealing with this condition for 12 years and you know and and and I and the doctors can help me but I told myself that if I could just touch the hem of your garment you don't need to touch me but if I touched you then I knew my situation would be sound and say oh that that's a what faith you say your faith has made you whole and the Bible say immediately I don't know about you but I'm looking for some immediate lesson sometimes God gives you immediate blessing sometimes you got to wait on some of others he encouraged your faith by giving it to you immediately and you might have one that you need right now it means me I'll tell her after when I by the time I leave Church that's the type of blessing I leave immediately and if you come with that type of expectation God will read it but Dyer said now I'm glad you got your blessing but I need to take the master home he already promised he'd come home with me and he got there raised that young girl adding up now before he raised her up he had to do something he had to kick everybody out that was that was in unbelief and a different people in your life Amen that speak a lot of negative stuff you're gonna have to get them out of your life give them the boot I'm sorry we can't talk no more every time I talk to you take my promise from me you have to hang up on them come on somebody for he is the Lord Amen they keep you defeated glory to God Amen Jesus had to do it y'all get out out I only want believers in here right now we got a real neat amen and when they got got the atmosphere just right then he did something in the atmosphere and that twelve year old girl came back alive hallelujah it's because of father and a mother had expectation that if we can get Jesus inside our house no matter what the condition is it's going to be taken care of well these blind men they don't heard about this woman being he they don't heard about gyrus daughter being raised from the dead and the Bible says when Jesus departed density coming out the house right two blind men followed now the reason that they can follow is because they can hear the commotion they can't see nothing but they can hear the commotion and their sense of hearing actually tells them something is happening so I can't see it I heard about him I can't see him I heard about it I need him to do something for me and I could just see him stumbling trying to find where Jesus is and maybe some y'all stumbling trying to find where Jesus did I can tell you where he is this morning he's helping the mr. Jeffrey glup I can see him just stumbling trying to find them maybe they asking people in the streets they where where you know what was here Jesus so where is where is we don't hurt about them healing blind people we gonna get our site today they have to make sure they got to the Prophet the Bible said they followed look at it and when Jesus departed this two blind men followed him crying and saying stop summoned David have mercy on you got to stay on the trail don't let it up don't let I mean and when God gave problems you stay on the trailer till you get your promise fulfilled go oh and when he and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him we're not letting you leave the city until we get our blessing listen and Jesus said unto them believe me that I'm able to do this they said to him Yale or Yale or yeah we believe we believe exactly that you're able to do and then he said then touch me there I say according to your faith you understand you can't go around actually nobody what you think is the promise for me or not for me it's according to your faith you think I'm going to bless me with this that I'm asking him for it's according to your faith it's your face it's not their friend Jesus have cording to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were open and Jesus straitly charged them saying see that no man Oh and verse 31 say but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame and all the country could not keep it today so had to go tell somebody else I got something this morning I can't keep to myself I'm have to tell somebody else let me keep going here just for a little bit longer see we have to learn the have to face that Abraham hat and let's reach this out of God's covenant with Abraham and his seed let's read a little something there my Lord Jesus hold on one second let me at this before I go there let me just just share a couple things here with you oh my so much I was reading you know I was telling you all just just recently how if you looking for God you find him in the midst of your priests when you're going through something you got to learn how to just just praise God in the middle of it I see the Word of God is the seed and when the feet come in and you receive that seat into your heart you've sleeve it on good ground into your heart when you get that now you have to give that seat water and if you want to see the word to grow if you want that promise to manifest now you have to give it water and what waters your personal see your revelation is your praises that that's what worship is all about right and I got sure I don't share with you many times the Bible say open you I mean that's one open your mouth wide now fill it but the other one say they came they came and they worship God with a loud voice right they loud was so so as you begin to worship God people don't know why you worshipping but you know why you were lord I thank you for that thing being for field I thank you for speaking to me today I thank you for everything that I need I got him you you you just begin to worship God it's reading this recently you know George Mueller was telling a story in this innocence of this book released the power of prayer this missionary had six children you know six boys and he had been praying for them boys he stay for many years and say just seemed like one of them boys would ever turn a heart towards the Lord so when the man start telling us condition of George Mueller he say he totally went to let me say his advice to the message they continue to pray for your sons as you pray for me say expect an answer cease not just pray for them but now you have to expect an answer and many of them prayed about things but we have not expected the answer right continue to pray for yourselves expect an answer to your prayers and you will have to praise God so three things you do keep RAM expect the answer and please God in the middle of it so when a master man say are the missionary here to see you know mr. Miller - six years later six years passes mr. Miller come through that city again and when he saw him again the second time he said now within two months of you telling me to take that advice within two months of taking the advice five of my six sons were converted and then we converted within eight days of each other imagine that right the man of entire years but all day was missing was the expectation and the worship and maybe that's what someone's missing the day some expectation and a little worship you know you have to praise God for it already being done one of these days we gonna give God a place where I let it being done we ain't waiting to see nothing then it's already been done you also been based on what you see what you see in the future as based on your expectation and you'll care fat rich thick my my mind John Lyon got what he expected he was praising God expected to be healed and why he was worshiping his eyes popped open [Applause] hey man why we working for one day this door gonna pop open and your loved ones going to come walking in and you're going to be already in a please before they got here so when they get here you're going to be tired hallelujah but you'll get some ministry you'll get a second way in since the man began to worship you know he said within two months of taking them by five of his six clubs were converted within eight days and those five or six four five or six boys had already been serving God for six years right by the time mr. Miller came back he said my boys two weeks after you left five of the six of them got converted and they've been serving out for six years since you left right it shows that God hears our prayers but our expectation aid man and you know and our worship has to be the same glory to God I just thought about some testimonies there with with the prophet and you know there was a you know you all remember the story of the young girl that was blind in Arkansas and as she was there you know at the meeting and and she somehow got disconnected from a daddy and when when she got disconnect from daddy she just yelling out daddy daddy and nobody helping her nobody so you know as they as they were yelling out you know these things you know brother Branham was trying to leave and he hurt her you don't stand daddy and anything he'd say no I got to make my way within some of the brothers said no you can't go over there because it's going to be some problems if you go over there and leave all these people here there's going to be some issues they no no no no I got to go over there and deal with this situation because the Holy Spirit is leading me there and as we got there and they say you know daddy daddy that and say ma'am can I help you and say yeah I'm looking I'm looking for my daddy I'm looking for my daddy and as they say he said well I don't know where your dad's to where you come from say I come from this city and he said you see the bus out there from citizens from it she say she say well you know I just come I've got these things you know my eyes he scales on my eyes the doctor said it's gonna fall off at a certain time they didn't afraid to do surgery and I just I just come to be prayed for you know she say she say if you can get me to the healer man I find my own daddy that's expectation so if you can't help me find my daddy do me a favor get me to the Euler man and I find my own death when brother Brandon heard that it just shook him like oh my what kind of faith it just get to the decision so he began touches and and as he say look now uh you know I know you're looking for the hilum answer but I pray for the six you say you the healer man you say no no I'm not the hilum and Jesus is the healer man Jesus's element say but I do pray for the city she says she's grabbed hold of it it is a caller but just hold on to him say say say I'm not gonna let you go till I get what I need she said he said my please ma'am don't make a big scene out here dumb person I won't make no scene but I ain't letting you go till I get what I need I said to myself if I can get to the healing man like that lady say if I can just touch the hem of Jesus God if I can get to the Hiller man I know I'm gonna get what I when I expect brother Brandon we gonna pray for us they can you know say all of sudden scales begin to fall off her eyes and that lady was healed right there on the spot because of expectations were that she would get healed she couldn't get into the service but God brought the service to her that's the expectation let me just read a little bit more just just to increase your faith here here's that here's a story out of Mary's belief Mary's belief glory to God I'm actually going to oh no I'm sorry King I can't King skip over nineteen since we could see five hundred rush to the altar tonight which would be good a good sign that that the revival is going to break we don't have to have five hundred the altar week we just have to take God's word for and start rejoicing we don't have to have five hundred also we just have to take God's word for it and start rejoicing something will happen that brings the word to life as we water it with praises see that that brings the word to life as we water it with praises what makes a seed grow water water makes the Word of God grow what makes the Word of God grow is the praises of God so whatever you got a man whatever you hold on to you're just going to have to continue to praise God amen and to that thing comes to pass he goes on to say when Jesus told him to wait in the upper room or the city of Jerusalem today was a do with power from behind that word fell on their ears they was in the temple continually praising God day and night what was they doing watering that promise and all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting the word was being watered and it took life and started it and it's at life has started growing you're wanting a revival start watering the word the promise that makes me feel religious myself if you want to come out of the wheelchair start watering the word if you want to come from the cancer start watering the word little Ricky tonight here's a testimony that God heals cancer he heals cancer he heals all our sicknesses thousands times thousands of infallible proofs of it we've seen now I'm going to skip down in the same message to paragraph ether tea now this is a man that has some expectation since South Africa recently a man had who had never had a pair of shoes on his feet in his life been waved back in the jungles has born back there years ago by missionary parents he was born with deformed feet when they come walking up through there clubbing his feet alone he had a shoebox under his arm and someone said to him what you got in there he said a pair of shoes said what do you expect to do with them are they going to be your father's he said I'm going to wear them and when the service was over he had those shoes on running down through that lot just as hard as as he could go not a man came to church shipwrecked Simeon came in the spirit that man came in the spirit with a box of shoes they said well shoes that they they for me I'm leaving here walking I'm putting on these shoes maybe I don't know what his feet had to do in order to get inside them shoes but they did exactly what he expected search I tell you we got to come on expectation it says and when the service was over he had those shoes on running down through that lot just as hard as he could go praising God what did he do he took on at his word he had so much when he was asked he said I've seen others coming that was crippled it was healed and I've seen those who were blind to see again and God would not God would not turn me down that's the way to believe that God won't turn me down oh I thank God for that hallelujah you know there was a another little testimony where if you know the prophets talk about how this man was he was at home he was blind and he'd been blind for about ten years and there he was just you know under expectation and what God did for him he sent his mother to him his mother passed away and he sent the mama to him in a dream and the mama told us saying I go down to such-and-such city in a dream went good I'm such a city look for a man by the name of Branham he's going to pray for you and you'll be healed the man went down the man heard what happened to dream and wasn't expecting none like that he went down that city and just said waiting outside after the meeting was over here come brother brand I'm walking up to the man and his wife say the parson coming the parson coming he say parson I got to tell you I got to tell you my mama told me to come down and see my mama been going for years but she told me the Drina come down here and have you prayed for me and say I be healed but the man said I don't know number I know mama coming nobody no dream but if the man is here lord I pray for them in the name of Jesus that man receive this sight right there on the spot God know how to anoint your expectations if you got to get your dream then order here knowing it if you got to give you a word he'll anointed whatever God wants he will anoint your expectations don't let the devil take that from you you get what you expect can we look at Abraham just for a second here this is out of a the sermon God's covenant with Abraham and his seed so notice them when he got the promise the Bible said in Romans 4 that Abraham was strong in faith giving praise to God see that's the thing you got you got to be giving praise to God before even happen you got the phrasing so Abraham was strong in faith giving praise to God I can hear him go back and say Sarah I just talked to God and he told us we was going to have a baby and the first thing we ought to do is go down and get some bird eye and some pens and get everything ready because the baby's coming the Lord said so that's the way to believe it that's the way to believe it believe that's the way to believe every man that says if a person is sick like this lady like this sick lady here how do we sister take my pill over there God said so if I could believe it and I do believe that I'll be healed make ready for it so that if God spoke something to you amen and you got a promise it hasn't happened yet but what you need to do if you notice the promise that God gave you now make ready for it I just love brother gene testimony brother gene he was here Friday night and every time I see his wife I remember what happened with brother gene brother gene was at he married his wife in Haiti and and they wouldn't release her to come here and he's just waiting waiting waiting for the coming and brother westco's praying whispering one day under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost brother Branham I mean brother Wesco just made the comment say you say brother Jing get ready your wife is coming out of Haiti brother jeans a man you just saw running I mean run up to our aid man he grabbed ahold of that and when he grabbed hold of it brother ji went home and bought some paint I thought paint in the house you know he started getting the house ready doing all kind of stuff within months they released his wife and brought her from Haiti amen and she's here today Church we got to learn how to make ready when God speak to gotta you gotta you got to move in hallelujah she says make ready for they man get everything ready gets that when time comes you're going to receive it God said so now just just real quick before I go into just Abraham I want you to understand something this was out of the message the ark but around say there's three elements that people live in three elements first is the humanistic right first is the humanistic second is divine revelation and then third is vision but these are three elements that we live in humanistic divine revelation and vision so now this like in prayer when you pray for anyone and humanistic we say well I hope you'll get well so that's your human side I hope you get well see says i'll see i'm hoping i'm believing with you try to use all the faith that I can that's human right the second divine revelation when something's reveal to you you know where your heart is going to happen yet there's nothing but just a revelation now I remember you know sister Wesco going through that the doctor that come and told say y'all better get ready your mama is going to die and since the Westco she had a revelation sister-in-law God ain't told me that I've got a say by stripes she's healing our darling told me she gonna die and she stood on her relations that God gave her even though the rest of the family now you need to just get you know with the program the doctors say Mama's on the dial you might come on you know stop this sitting on the ligado until me and she was standing on her own revelation then I'm mama live for 13 more years because she stood on her revelation brother Branham when you know when he was just reading the Bible about Joseph's reasons the life story just haven't got to say you know you're gonna have a son named Joseph and I hear hear hear he waiting on Joseph all he had was a revelation and he went and his wife got pregnant and with which she got pregnant she brought forth her daughter and everybody start criticizing not as you said you must amend Josephine not Joseph right everybody start Christmas he says they know God told me I have a Joseph I don't know what I'm able to go through but I might have a Joseph where his wife got pregnant again and at this time the doctor said you better not let her go through this pregnancy because she might lose her life we say doc I don't know what's gonna happen to my wife but I know God told me I'm gonna have it Joseph all he had was a divine revelation but with that divine revelation Joseph king and his wife was spared you don't have to stand on your own personal divine revelation that goes beyond hope that's when and when like God spoke to Simeon God will speak to you listen second is divine revelation when something's real to you you know you just know your heart it's going to happen yet there's nothing but the revelation and that's all it needs to be is the revelation and third is a vision of course that's the stay at the Lord that's perfect and positive because a vision a man even a dream God can give you a dream but a dream when it's correctly interpreted is a vision when you get a vision from God to know that's exactly the way it's going to come to pass in church we got we got we if we don't if we don't have the vision but we got a revelation stand on that revelation don't let nothing shake you keep your expectation there were seven keys to Abraham receiving his promise seven keys to his victory you find it in Romans 4 verse 16 through 25 I won't read it all but I'll just I'll just share these things that I saw there verse 18 and Romans 4 he was against hope but but he still believed in hope and and I looked up that word hope I got this little book that sister Michelle gave me years ago called keys to the Bible and I looked that up it says hope is defined as expectation of a future good so when you're against expectation believe in expectation hmm the hope is defined as an expectation of a future good so the Bible say that he was against hope but still believed in hope right the second things that he was not weak in faith now I want to just drop in and I said this earlier when were you looking at this for Paul to write these things about Abraham we know Abraham got with Hagar we know that right and so when when Abraham got a Hagar it was show that he was weak in faith everything that he was doing to try to help the promise was it showed that he was weak in faith but here's the thing about this I started looking at this from a different angle Amen as I was reading the scripture this morning because I'm saying in Romans 4 that he was now about a hundred years old now when he had Ishmael he was 80 something years old but he didn't have Isaac until he was about a hundred years old it showed that there was a time of progression it showed that there was a time of maturity in Abraham's faith so God we're looking at the mistake that happened with Ishmael King God was looking at perfection when I became we've made some mistakes along the way but we also go through a time of maturity and god of looking other mature Christians now and it's not holding your mistakes to your account so in fact God this was our God describes and he's looking at the finished product he looking for that point A to point B to tell his not what happens in between man look at this it's a the first thing he was against hope but he still believed the who second he was not weak in faith this is God describing him at the end of the trial oh my god my god up he considered not his own body which was now dead the other thing he did he can say my set the deadness of Sarah's room verse I mean number four amen in verse 20 he staggered not at the promise to run belief now you got to get in your mind he's not talking about when he was 80 something he's talking about when he was a hundred all right he talked about when he mature he staggered not at the promise he weren't going to get no Mohan Lee's right Amen that that is done and go I made a mistake now I'm not repeating that again glory to God I'm keeping my expectation the other thing here he says this it says he second out the promise of Opteron believe number five he was strong in faith number six he was giving glory to God that means he was watering his seed of promise with his praises and number seven he was fully persuaded that what God promised him he was able to perform anybody here fully persuaded what God promised you he's able to perform i'ma tell you just I'm gonna tell him myself this morning I'm going to tell him myself this morning I was I was this sermon I've had this for a few weeks and I got to the point where I said you know i'ma wait for a certain thing to happen and then i'ma preached a sermon then I got rebuked because that's not what Abraham did Abraham then wait first either to come before we start telling everybody about Isaac Abraham was testifying about Isaac before Isaac came so as the seed of Abraham I'm gonna testify before it happens you want to know why I'm testify because my expectation I got a show me I really strongly believe that that's something that something good is in my future Anna you know I had a little situation come up here recently and I was uh man I I knew I had to pay some taxes so I knew I got these taxes and so I don't know where I'm gonna get the money from the pay these taxes but but I know I got taxes that need to be paid and and the one thing I didn't want to do I just went through financial peace I don't want to put my taxes on my credit card and then leave that debt there I said no I don't want to be I don't know no lord I don't want that so they had the taxes and then I had some other things that were coming up and I say Lord you know in order for me to meet all these needs I'm gonna need a certain amount of money in order to meet those needs and I said and I'm you know this ain't no no chump change right I need I need big money got big money you know and you know I mean the numbers start with five digits that's old but I need something big and as I'm sitting here you know tough just praying to the Lord and like Lord I need this and you know I want to take care of this and you know when you owe taxes you don't you don't pay it in January you know that right right you wait to April 18 right up to the to the last day you can get it in and when you all right that's what you do it right so I'm waiting on God waiting on God say lord I need this money so I said I'm not without what I just I'll put it on the credit card but I want the credit card to be paid off before the end of the month I need this so I'm just praying I'm asking God and I get the taxes you know situated and you know everything all settlements in the Lord I you know I'm just my expectation that you're gonna meet this need you're gonna meet this you know the amount of money and I'm praying for it and I remember talking my wife and she exerted on how we're gonna do this I'm gonna so you know what I asked God for this amount of money I don't know how God don't do it but I asked them for it and I believe he's gonna do it I believe it does she say amen amen we agree and so I'm this going through life just you know doing things just and I'm everyday I'm on the expectation and I sitting here in my office one day and I get a telephone call and when I get it's called not now when I say this you probably say oh they do that all the time I was not expecting them to do this so to me it was a miracle I'm telling that in the fehb beforehand it was a miracle to me and I'm gonna always testify that it's a miracle to me you may do things like this all the time I don't so it's a miracle to me so you know I'm sitting I know exactly what I told the Lord that I need and what I pray for so I get this telephone calls my insurance agent I want to think about no insurance so they call me so hey you uh you want to make some changes to the insurance policy I said no no I'm looking to make no changes my stress per se you talked about it in the past I say when we're not talking about a year ago I said well things changed I am looking at make no changes to my insurance policy so you know you got money on your policy I see I got money on my policy um yeah yeah your policies you got money on all your policies I'd say money on all my powers that's okay how much I got on this one how much I got on this one how much I got on this one and how much I got on this one and how much thing I've never mistake I can tell you on that but that's your wife policy yes okay I have a copy and I say my when can I get this money any time you want to just show up here yes oh yeah so when she found out how much she had once we add it all up guess whether it hit the number that I was praying God praying asking God hit it right on the dot my expectation that I'll go get this mother ain't no hot gobble go through it baby it is don't tell me what he came to I just feel him do it real subtle little guy he's a big guy anything missing I hear so I say won't he do it so I stop there I ain't stop there could see that's already to happen I'm preaching the sermon and that's already happened so I'm preaching sermon now talking about what I'm expecting to happen I say my lord consumer I share that testimony Martha oh yeah yeah yeah you got one the policies that I said nah I got one the pops but I never used that policy like that so I didn't know that and I wasn't expecting that they call me unexpectedly and when they told me that so now you know praise God they just happen to call it the right time and when they added it all up say lord have mercy my prayer just been answered so I said Lord I want you to do a double portion and I need you to do it because somebody's gonna say well that's common we always get blessings like that not me understand that's the way God did me all right so God might do something different for you since you always get blessings like that so I say Lord I need I need I want you to do it again double double just just just just do a double portion is just I need you to do double so I said okay Lord I'm looking for this number to hit again now I don't want to use it that way help me brother Steven held it then I I don't want to use it like I have playing the lotto or nothing like that and then I pick play the lotto so I said Lord I'm just looking for you to do a double portion of that and and I'm looking for you to do it too to just prove to dedicate that you you you you did this for the mind that might think well that's common always ain't no miracle to me you know I want I want that mind to be touched so so Kayne and and I went home one night because some of the money that I that I needed was the help my daughter's paid for school I needed some money help them pay for school so that's why I had this disfigured number I said I gotta help them you know so um I said lord I need this I need this then and I don't want them in Dec like me over my school I don't want my kids and

daughter say I got a scholarship and she's open amount of scholarship as oh yeah and I added up both them scholarships because both phone got scholarships and when they both got scholarships half of what I was believing God for was already met through their scholarships so the money that I was going to use the property scholarships ain't got to use it for that no motor but I'm still expecting the

where I get out here a man okay at thy words at thy word sometimes good to know what God doing and sometimes you got to put out there before it even happen now you know every every Devlin Hill can be turned against you know what we speak but also every angel in heaven because when I when hell turns loose guess what heaven turns loose as well and I'd have seen it happen before actually there was mo demons trying to overtake hell they got cashed out they lost but great to see that's with us and he that's in the world we just got to stand on the word no matter what we hear what's the expectation the expectation don't change based on what you hear the expectation is the same because God's Word is the same all right at my word let's try to find a way to get out says uh now he cannot heal you or cannot save you or do one thing for you until first you accept it now I'll accept it and believe it and what's the last thing confess it until I'm getting mine I'm getting I'm confessing that is coming and it might be in the mail but I know they only delivered on Sundays but it might be in the mailbox right now they do sometimes they live on sons you know that right I had a special fish motel now we got a special delivery for you he can I heal you can I save you or do nothing do one thing for you until first you accept it and believe it and confess it gonnigan it ain't gonna happen till we confess it so I'm confessing we got a new church we have new school I'm confessing it they made me go over to God hallelujah that's right you've got to confess it not you got to feel it you got to confess it he's not the hot piece of your feelings he's the hot breath of your confession that's right what you confess now if you'll get prayed for a step this building's after the Holy Spirit will move in here and you feel his blessed presence in here is worth going for sin that He healed all and so forth like that I see in the pound got here it go forth and lo it know and knowing it's for everyone and you walk out and say well I just feel just as bad as I did when I went what bad as I did when I went in I he couldn't do a thing for you and you say well I'm accepting it now and then in the morning you get up and say well I still got that Henny Sam Oh Lord I'm just I'm telling I'm confessing it before I get any email response I remember wisco you know that's the that's why I thank God oh brother let's go all right I remember him he was waiting on his that back that first house that he was he moved into and for years he lived in apartments and things that nature and I watched god bless him with that first house and when he moved into the house say that the the people the mortgage people's call them saying learn that we can do anything that we can do but let's go say well you keep doing what you do and I'ma keep doing what I do so what you're tougher I said you keep just keep trying to work in numbers trying to find somebody take them off I'm gonna keep doing what I do what you do I pray and as he pray and his friend in Danny was reading scripture and proverbs in the Bible said the heart of the king is in in the Lord's hands right and when he when inside that scripture said not just the heart of the king the heart of the mortgage Linda is in God's hands and he held on to that and he will let he had bulldog faith will let it go and you know what he moved into the house then I remember walking into the house for the first time I walked through every room I didn't look that it just pays to serve God I say it pay to serve God but God God did the exceedingly abundant ask a thing that was the first house God wasn't finish it then put him in the house whole family that moved out and everything and here he got a house five bedrooms ship him a sister let's go with a pool that God wants you to enjoy your blessings he had two houses at one time that's what God does I don't tell me what it can't do they say I remember when brother brother let's go he's the sheriff testimony about going full-time of ministry he used to tell it to us all the time I can't see it I can't see it you you had a good job you just walked off like that huh don't full-time ministry lawyer well I do appreciate the ministry but I couldn't see it but when God turned the tables on me see I got bored off face to my faith is a little different when God gave me something I won't turn it loose he gave me a job I won't let it go I don't they can be taking me through all kind of stuff I want gently you know they got to kick me out of there they have to sit down I have meetings with me we don't I lead out on my feelers and everything because of my brother cocaine but but God make us all different like that but I can tell you this much since seven months ago since I left and I said I was forced out God has provided God has provided and I'm grateful to God for providing oh my Jesus my god I know he's a real God faithful God he's not a God I'm just read about him a book somewhere but he's the same yesterday today and forever he still provides if you're just trusting you'll do what he asks you to do I guarantee he will not let you down I never seen a blessing like that just the way I just saw it I ain't never experienced that later but when you walk in my faith and not by sight living under expectation now I go every day I'm looking in the mailbox I'm waiting on the next one huh it ain't coming today tomorrow be him and if it ain't in the mailboxes be in my hand somebody's come shook my hand and so I I don't know I was gonna get it but God that showed me that he's on my side so I'm just I'm just crazy enough to believe anything now I'm I'm becoming just like my spiritual father I'm becoming just like I'm too crazy I believe it I just made man incredible God does incredible things even that's incredible well going i'ma preach that one day that's incredible glory to God all right let me let me go on a man lord I thank you since we He healed all and so forth that seeing the power got here here it go for ignoring this for everyone and you walk out and say well I feel just as bad as I did when I went in he couldn't do a thing for you you say well I accept it now and then in the morning you get up and say well I still got that headache I still feel as bad as I did then you drop right down you'll never live above your confession let the saintly person in the building right now just make up in your mind that you're not a Christian anymore that's when you become not a Christian see when you go out to say are you a Christian no I used to be but I'm not no more you're falling from grace right then see it's faith see it's either faith or unbelief you're possessed with those two powers which one dominates you I have a faith or unbelief if you got faith you're saved because you are a believer if you haven't got faith you're a sinner so Church let faith dominate your life because you don't be possessed of one or the other and I'm gonna tell you you're going to get what you expect the devil going to bring it to you or God don't get it to you but I'm just choose to serve God choose to believe God receive that all God has for me I'm tired of living beneath my privileges and I'm it's time for me to tap in some of these untapped resources amen I'm tap it in I just experienced one of them I got this more where that come from the man that ate the watermelon brother brother random you know if it's a the brother ate the watermelon it was actually did you enjoy this it yeah I enjoyed that watermelon but it's more where that come from so I need another piece of action and when God bless you one time like wow is more where that come from I need I need some more that's hardly the man I'm gonna tell you another thing sometimes what happens that he has needs that arise in your life and that need is to draw you closer to him because oftentimes when we get a little bit too ahead of ourselves we get too blessed we forget where it came from and that's another sermon to bless you can tell what somebody to bless they start missing church remember the truth they listen they got a car usually when they were walking to catching the bus they catch it you used to met church all the time when they get to blast they stopped making excuses all right God know how to just humble you right back down and help you get your priorities the car was up you get to church not the work the car was for church all right for you to help pick up people brain in the church what was something else that you did but the cause for you to bring people to church so people in all broke down on the side road of trying to go to church that's why you got the car all right all right let's pray y'all musicians out come on God is a good guy God is a good god you get what you expect amen expect great things church is my encouragement to you expect great things from God let's pray father we thank you for your precious part god that

that if there is any here that have something Lord that they're believing you for even while we're here Friday night brother brother Diggs had us all touch and agree on things and you know exactly what was in our hearts and what we were touching agreeing on god help us to keep the expectation no matter what we hear no matter what we feel no matter what we see but help us to hold to that
