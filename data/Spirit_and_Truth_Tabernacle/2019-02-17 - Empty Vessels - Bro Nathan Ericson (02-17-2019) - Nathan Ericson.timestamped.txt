[1:01:49] we appreciate the Lord Jesus just a
[1:01:53] wonderful wonderful atmosphere that was
[1:01:55] a beautiful song all this song
[1:01:58] then here in this morning just sort of
[1:02:00] real real precious in spirit singing
[1:02:04] about season for change and just
[1:02:07] reminded just a few weeks ago speaking
[1:02:09] on a sermon we shall be changed they met
[1:02:13] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:02:15] the Prophet was saying how does this
[1:02:19] change happen how does it happen and
[1:02:22] they said it comes by the spirit of the
[1:02:26] word right and as you just kind of look
[1:02:29] at that
[1:02:30] you know this everything has a spirit
[1:02:33] associated with you whether you want to
[1:02:35] realize that or not
[1:02:37] everything has a spirit music in
[1:02:40] particular carries different spirits
[1:02:43] saying how rap music cares of spirit
[1:02:47] where you just want to fight shoot some
[1:02:52] kind of spirit brother Joel you know
[1:02:56] what I'm talking about
[1:02:57] but uh you know and then country music
[1:03:00] carry spirit you wanna shoot yourself
[1:03:05] she left me again rock'n'roll
[1:03:14] carries a spirit you wanna bang head
[1:03:16] with somebody you know lost your mind
[1:03:20] because of it
[1:03:21] sometimes good good Christian music Mick
[1:03:24] you wanna
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:29] I can just be in my car gonna be in my
[1:03:34] room all by myself just press play I
[1:03:44] just hear the right thing at the right
[1:03:46] time and I'm go write good worship music
[1:03:49] won't watch it just dip your hands and
[1:03:51] just have the presence of the Lord just
[1:03:53] pouring out your eyes but all those
[1:03:58] things will not produce to change what
[1:04:01] produces a change is the spirit that's
[1:04:04] in the world it's not just in the word
[1:04:08] but its own the word if you've ever been
[1:04:09] discouraged and just picked up your
[1:04:11] Bible and just rent one scripture all of
[1:04:15] a sudden your whole attitude changes
[1:04:17] because there's a spirit that's in the
[1:04:19] world
[1:04:20] it's an eternal Word of God and that's
[1:04:24] more important than anything else in the
[1:04:25] sermon we thank God for this have the
[1:04:30] brothers prepare to come we'll prepare
[1:04:32] to take this mortars offering and then
[1:04:35] I'm going to get out of the way
[1:04:39] one half of the Nathan Thomas piqued our
[1:04:41] hearts
[1:04:43] then let's just bow our heads brother
[1:04:46] the whole story
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:43] praise the Lord
[1:05:46] wanted to thank the Lord for giving I'm
[1:05:50] pronouncing this wrong the name wrong
[1:05:52] but I believe it is a dr. Graham Graham
[1:05:56] okay accomplished you're still going to
[1:05:57] have you with us today
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:06] they were telling me another sister that
[1:06:10] came believe her name was Dolores I
[1:06:14] understand and she was just going here
[1:06:17] to the of the store and as she was going
[1:06:21] to the store to get something for the
[1:06:22] Dollar General she saw Saints coming
[1:06:25] into the house of God she felt the pool
[1:06:34] to come right on into the house of the
[1:06:35] Lord and I just felt last night just a
[1:06:39] lot that was sad was just really you
[1:06:42] know God just directed the minister
[1:06:44] right where he needed to go right
[1:06:46] because I mean this is what it's all
[1:06:49] about you know a reason for even being
[1:06:52] here on earth right now is because we're
[1:06:54] still looking for the last scene
[1:06:58] I believe the rapture should have
[1:06:59] happened a long time ago but because
[1:07:01] we're looking for the last scene that's
[1:07:03] why we're still here and any time we're
[1:07:05] doing meetings like this we're we're
[1:07:07] trusting and believing that that last
[1:07:10] one might be found in a meeting like
[1:07:12] this you said the right atmosphere
[1:07:13] somebody could give birth a man so we
[1:07:16] were thinking God for that
[1:07:18] I just appreciate the Lord and all that
[1:07:20] as status happened I know some of the
[1:07:21] states would be leaving after this
[1:07:23] service today we still have one more
[1:07:25] tonight that'll be at six o'clock but
[1:07:27] those that have to leave after service
[1:07:28] we want to say thank God for you for
[1:07:30] coming to this big part of the meetings
[1:07:32] without you it would not be what it is
[1:07:35] and we're very very grateful a man for
[1:07:38] your attendance but also a bad time
[1:07:44] because it's so expensive you know the
[1:07:50] hotels do that because they know
[1:07:52] everybody come and they get out of the
[1:07:53] snow but but we thank God for your
[1:07:55] sacrifice and they got reward you so
[1:08:03] we're not gonna take time amen

[1:13:04] that that we just appreciate your gift
[1:13:06] amen a talent is one thing even a

[1:13:22] if the Lord had helped me this morning I
[1:13:25] want to continue someone in the same
[1:13:27] vein that I've been in I was up last
[1:13:29] night just seeking the Lord and and and
[1:13:33] God helped me this morning I'd like to
[1:13:34] minister on empty vessels empty vessels
[1:13:39] so we're here in second Corinthians the
[1:13:41] fourth chapter and beginning with the
[1:13:44] fourth down to the seventh verse in whom
[1:13:47] the god of this world hath blinded the
[1:13:49] minds of them which believe not lest the
[1:13:52] light of the glorious gospel of Christ
[1:13:54] who is the image of God
[1:13:56] should shine unto them but we preach not
[1:13:59] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[1:14:02] ourselves your servants for Jesus sake
[1:14:05] for God who commanded the light to shine
[1:14:09] out of darkness have shined in our
[1:14:11] hearts to give the light of the
[1:14:13] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:14:17] face of Jesus Christ but we have this
[1:14:20] treasure in earthen vessels that the
[1:14:24] excellency of the power may be of God
[1:14:27] and not of us can we quickly also take
[1:14:31] Romans chapter 9 amen this might be just
[1:14:36] about my favorite chapter in the whole
[1:14:37] Bible right up there with all the rest
[1:14:40] of them amen but this is precious here
[1:14:46] Romans 9 and we'll read the 20th to the
[1:14:49] 23rd verse nay but o man who art thou
[1:14:52] that repliest against God shall the
[1:14:56] thing formed say to him that formed it
[1:14:58] why has thou made me thus hath not the
[1:15:01] Potter power over the clay of the same
[1:15:04] lump to make one vessel unto honour and
[1:15:06] another unto dishonour what if God
[1:15:09] willing to show his wrath and make his
[1:15:11] power known endured with much
[1:15:13] long-suffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:15:14] which are fitted to destruction that he
[1:15:18] might make known the riches of his glory
[1:15:20] on the vessels of Mercy amen
[1:15:23] which he had afore prepared unto glory
[1:15:26] let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord
[1:15:29] we're here as empty vessels this morning
[1:15:31] we have nothing of our own to offer Lord
[1:15:33] we've not fella
[1:15:34] we're not here to fellowship around the
[1:15:36] ideas of a man Lord the eloquence of a
[1:15:39] man but father where we want to feed on
[1:15:41] the body word of the son of man Lord
[1:15:43] that's among us father and working
[1:15:45] through us Lord we just asked you to
[1:15:46] come on the scene Lord in such a special
[1:15:48] way father that we'd all be able to get
[1:15:50] out of the way this morning Lord that

[1:16:12] to your people and just render to them
[1:16:14] exactly what they have Nita Father for

[1:16:18] a Heavenly Father who is faithful Lord

[1:16:35] prayer requests Lord of a brother from
[1:16:37] our church that asks for prayer in these
[1:16:39] meetings brother Sal Lord having
[1:16:41] open-heart surgery this Wednesday we

[1:16:49] incompletely Lord and deliver him from
[1:16:50] that thing all those that are here Lord
[1:16:52] they have need of healing or deliverance
[1:16:54] encouragement whatever it would be Lord
[1:16:56] we're looking to you not to any man but
[1:16:58] looking to Jesus the author and the
[1:17:00] finisher of this faith in Jesus Christ's
[1:17:02] name we pray and we dedicate this
[1:17:04] service
[1:17:05] amen amen you may be seated amen sure

[1:17:15] be here and also all you that have come
[1:17:17] to fellowship together it's wonderful
[1:17:19] you can have unity in this area and and
[1:17:22] good fellowship amongst the churches and
[1:17:24] so I just want to say God bless you to
[1:17:27] all those who not only from the local
[1:17:29] church but those that are visiting and
[1:17:30] the ministers and and and pastors and
[1:17:34] saints it's it's just a blessing to be
[1:17:37] together there's some Ohio people
[1:17:39] sitting there so hyoe people god bless
[1:17:41] you brother yeah I would feel right at
[1:17:43] home
[1:17:44] amen empty vessels this morning empty
[1:17:49] vessels and we were speaking last night
[1:17:50] on the the thought on the latter glory
[1:17:54] amen about the about the taken out of
[1:17:57] the book a Hagee I they're talking about
[1:17:59] the the the temple that was restored
[1:18:01] through the work of observable which is
[1:18:03] a type of the work of restoration that's
[1:18:05] happening today and we were just showing
[1:18:07] how that there was actually a
[1:18:08] discouragement on the hearts of the
[1:18:10] people because the temple that had been
[1:18:12] restored was very humble to the eye to
[1:18:14] the ayah was very humble it was very
[1:18:16] simple compared to Solomon's Temple so
[1:18:19] that people were discouraged but God
[1:18:20] raised up
[1:18:21] profit to assure them that there would
[1:18:23] be a greater glory of this latter temple
[1:18:25] it would be more than the works of
[1:18:27] Solomon but it would be the personal
[1:18:28] presence of the desire of nations which
[1:18:30] is Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah coming
[1:18:33] to his temple amen is a greater glory
[1:18:35] even than Solomon amen and we believe
[1:18:38] that a greater than Solomon is here
[1:18:40] we were just laboring to show how that
[1:18:42] we are the tabernacle of his presence
[1:18:44] today that you know the bride is
[1:18:45] literally amen embodying in her vessel
[1:18:48] amen as a many membered body the actual
[1:18:51] presence of God the actual attributes of
[1:18:54] God which were in a mystery form the
[1:18:56] beginning have been manifested on the
[1:18:58] earth and collectively the bride of
[1:18:59] Jesus Christ amen is in a sense a
[1:19:02] physical coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:04] amen
[1:19:05] but not in the body that he walked the
[1:19:07] shores of Galilee not in that son of
[1:19:08] David rain but in a many membered body
[1:19:11] of Jesus Christ amen we're here today
[1:19:13] that's why we've come that's why we're
[1:19:15] bound together by love amen is because
[1:19:17] we've been knit together to be that body
[1:19:19] amen so we find that a true Christian
[1:19:22] now it will will will be somebody who
[1:19:25] their life and their whole being their
[1:19:27] whole vessel is dedicated to that
[1:19:29] calling to that cause a meant to be the
[1:19:32] the temple of God to be the tabernacle
[1:19:35] of God and a vessel for His Holy Spirit
[1:19:37] amen
[1:19:38] we're not here to follow our own dreams
[1:19:40] and ambitions we're not here to you know
[1:19:43] to try to build something in this world
[1:19:45] but we're we're sojourners here amen
[1:19:47] we're children of Abraham where we're
[1:19:49] Wanderers and we're strangers in a
[1:19:51] strange land amen and we've been
[1:19:53] separated we've been set aside for
[1:19:55] service a man we've been consecrated
[1:19:57] unto God so we have nothing of our own
[1:20:00] to offer him amen if it was up to us on
[1:20:03] our merit and and our Worth and our
[1:20:05] righteousness and our own works to try
[1:20:08] to be as something or try to Amen
[1:20:10] deserve his presence we we never would
[1:20:13] have had a chance but we find that we're
[1:20:15] to be before God empty vessels amen
[1:20:18] where all of our pride and all of our
[1:20:20] achievement and all of our talents and
[1:20:22] our gifts and everything is poured out
[1:20:24] and amen and and we've got to come to a
[1:20:26] place to be his temple you've got to
[1:20:28] come to a place Amen where you just
[1:20:30] clean house
[1:20:31] we just say Lord I'm done trying to make
[1:20:33] it on my own I'm done trying to I'm
[1:20:35] trying to to get by on my own work so my
[1:20:38] own merit Lord I'm cleaning house
[1:20:40] Amen cuz I don't want it to be my house
[1:20:42] I don't want it to be I don't want my
[1:20:44] life to be decorated the way I want I
[1:20:46] don't want the carpet to be the way I
[1:20:47] want this is your house Lord I want to
[1:20:49] be your house amen
[1:20:51] so we got to be empty vessels before God
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:54] and we referenced this quote last
[1:20:55] yesterday brother Branham said in
[1:20:57] perfect strength by perfect weakness he
[1:21:00] said there's one thing that we've got to
[1:21:02] master a man this morning there's one
[1:21:04] thing that we have to master if we
[1:21:06] expect to fulfill God's desire in our
[1:21:09] life amen if you want to live this
[1:21:11] message if you want to live this calling
[1:21:13] if you want to be the bride of Jesus
[1:21:14] Christ there's one thing you've got to
[1:21:17] master amen that is we have to master
[1:21:20] the thought of human ability if we ever
[1:21:23] get to a spot where we think that we can
[1:21:25] do it with our own intelligence and our
[1:21:27] own abilities we've got to master that
[1:21:29] in such a way that we can get rid of the
[1:21:32] thing and lay it aside so that God can
[1:21:34] use us amen that's right and make a
[1:21:36] complete surrender we cannot use one
[1:21:39] ability friends we cannot use one
[1:21:42] ability we've got to make a complete
[1:21:44] surrender amen amen that's what I want
[1:21:47] to be that's the testimony I want before
[1:21:50] God amen it's not of me it's not my
[1:21:52] works or my my hopes and dreams but I
[1:21:55] just want to be a surrender vessel unto
[1:21:57] Him because I know that everything
[1:21:59] that's that's good and godly in my life
[1:22:01] has come to me by grace amen
[1:22:04] everything that we have as Christians
[1:22:05] has come by grace and grace is unmerited
[1:22:08] favor amen
[1:22:10] in other words there was nothing that
[1:22:11] you did nothing you could have done to
[1:22:14] deserve the grace of God but the grace
[1:22:16] of God came anyway amen hallelujah even
[1:22:19] the faith that we're fellowshipping
[1:22:20] around today you say well oh I've got
[1:22:22] faith brother I've got faith but even
[1:22:24] your faith is a gift of God the Bible
[1:22:26] says by grace you are saved through
[1:22:29] faith and that's not of yourself
[1:22:32] I love you but it is the gift of God
[1:22:34] amen Romans 12 for I say through the
[1:22:36] grace given to me Amen unto me to every
[1:22:39] man that's among you don't think more
[1:22:41] highly of yourself than you ought to
[1:22:42] think but think soberly according as God
[1:22:45] hath dealt to every man the measure of
[1:22:49] faith
[1:22:49] amen amen a measure of faith now listen
[1:22:52] here brother sister don't ever let the
[1:22:54] devil tell you you don't have faith Amen
[1:22:56] that you don't have enough faith the
[1:22:58] Bible says it's a faith as a mustard
[1:22:59] seed amen
[1:23:01] uh hallelujah the devil said well you
[1:23:03] don't have enough faith so you can't
[1:23:04] receive the promise you can't get your
[1:23:06] healing you can't get deliverance
[1:23:07] because you don't have enough faith you
[1:23:09] had enough faith to believe what the
[1:23:11] devil was telling you I mean the devil
[1:23:13] works by that same faith by that same
[1:23:16] confession but he twists it to make your
[1:23:18] confession in something besides the Word
[1:23:20] of God but there's something in a human
[1:23:22] being that every human being on the face
[1:23:24] of this earth
[1:23:25] believes in something amen but if you'll
[1:23:27] stop believing the words of the devil
[1:23:29] and believe in God's Word and begin to
[1:23:31] confess God's Word watch what'll happen
[1:23:33] amen
[1:23:34] but you've got to empty your mind amen
[1:23:36] of all of the devil's ideas and all of
[1:23:39] your thoughts and all of your all of
[1:23:41] your weakness and fears and doubts amen
[1:23:43] and fill it up with the Word of God amen
[1:23:46] brother Branham said now faith is a
[1:23:48] revelation from God it's a revelation
[1:23:51] he's revealed it to you by His grace
[1:23:53] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[1:23:57] yourself up into faith how many's ever
[1:23:59] tried to work up faith oh yeah amen but
[1:24:02] it didn't work it doesn't work you can't
[1:24:04] pump it up
[1:24:05] work it up muster it up amen I love you
[1:24:09] you never had faith brother Branham said
[1:24:11] but it's give to you by the grace of God
[1:24:13] you never had faith but it's gift to you
[1:24:16] by grace and God reveals it to you
[1:24:18] therefore faith is a revelation and the
[1:24:21] whole Church of God is built on the
[1:24:23] revelation amen Oh am i the scripture we
[1:24:26] just read God has shined in our hearts
[1:24:27] to give light of the knowledge of the
[1:24:30] glory of God it was revelation that
[1:24:33] showed us the light of this message amen
[1:24:35] hallelujah you are out of some
[1:24:36] denominational field somewhere out in a
[1:24:38] barroom somewhere you

[1:24:45] light shine through and struck your
[1:24:47] heart Amen hallelujah I grew up in a
[1:24:49] message peel but I was in darkness when
[1:24:52] he found me a man I didn't know who I
[1:24:53] was or where I was at amen
[1:24:56] or what God's Will was for my line amen
[1:24:58] but when the light struck at a man by
[1:25:00] the grace of God he pulled me out from
[1:25:02] where I was and that gives me confidence
[1:25:04] to know that I'm not standing here today
[1:25:06] based on my own merit or my own ability
[1:25:10] what the grace of God picked me up from
[1:25:12] where I was hallelujah Hey look beyond

[1:25:32] just waiting to be quickened amen
[1:25:34] but God put that seed there hey man

[1:26:03] will be a reaction there will be a
[1:26:04] movement hey man there will be a joy

[1:33:29] just ugly it's got an ugly fence around
[1:33:32] a little ugly little fence room so I
[1:33:33] moved there I thought man that's an ugly
[1:33:35] fence I got to do something about this
[1:33:37] fence you know so I thought well I need
[1:33:40] like some vines growing out in or
[1:33:41] something so I went down to Menards you
[1:33:44] know and and and I and I was looking
[1:33:47] around at different things I thought My
[1:33:48] Morning Glory
[1:33:49] Morning Glory I'll get me some Morning
[1:33:51] Glory and I'll just plant that all along
[1:33:53] my fence they'll grow up it looked real
[1:33:55] nice and have flowers and stuff now if
[1:33:57] any of you in here are gardeners you're
[1:34:00] about to laugh at me

[1:34:06] you know take one seed every six inches
[1:34:08] put a little seed I was like I got
[1:34:10] plenty so I went all up and down that
[1:34:14] fence sprinkle in that Morning Glory boy
[1:34:17] my brother after a little while that
[1:34:20] stuff began to grow and it spread out it
[1:34:22] went all over the fence it went all over
[1:34:24] the yard it went all over my trees it
[1:34:26] went all over the vegetable red jacket
[1:34:28] took over everything
[1:34:29] amen it got into my my vegetable patches

[1:34:33] went all the way up to the tippy top
[1:34:35] just choked out everything amen oh my
[1:34:38] you know so every year I go and I I
[1:34:40] clean up that Morning Glory and I cut it
[1:34:42] back and I get it back down to the root
[1:34:44] and you know the funny thing happens the
[1:34:46] next spring
[1:34:47] Amen here comes that Morning Glory sure
[1:34:49] is anything I am convinced Amen you
[1:34:52] could drop a nuclear bomb on my house
[1:34:54] and you would wipe out every memory of
[1:34:56] Nathan Erickson amen but the next spring
[1:34:59] that Morning Glory would come forth just
[1:35:01] as Shores it that's the kind of scene
[1:35:03] that scene you

[1:35:53] with ink now but he said you've been
[1:35:55] written by the Holy Ghost on the fleshly
[1:35:58] tables of your heart amen
[1:35:59] saying it weren't written in Sunday
[1:36:01] school you weren't written in a seminar
[1:36:03] but the Holy Ghost took that thought of
[1:36:06] God that was in the beginning and he
[1:36:08] literally wrote it spoke it into your
[1:36:11] vessel amen Oh glory to God that means
[1:36:14] you're the word if you were in God at
[1:36:17] the beginning then you're one of his
[1:36:18] thoughts amen and every thought of God
[1:36:20] is eternal so you are just as eternal as
[1:36:22] God is eternal thank God for a message
[1:36:25] amen but it see you weren't just he
[1:36:27] wasn't content to let you stay a thought
[1:36:29] but he spoke you into this season as we
[1:36:33] read last night this time this place is
[1:36:36] a promise given to this bride and he
[1:36:37] chose this time to speak that into your
[1:36:40] heart that makes you the word brother
[1:36:43] Brown says in other words he said I turn
[1:36:45] it like this you are a writ epistles
[1:36:48] that have already been written already
[1:36:52] been written you know what that means
[1:36:54] that means it's the Word of God and you
[1:36:56] can't add to it and you can't take away
[1:36:59] from it I know that there's a the
[1:37:01] devil's got a whole bunch of footnotes a
[1:37:03] big long commentary on the mistakes of
[1:37:06] your life that he would like to take on
[1:37:08] to the book of you
[1:37:09] but it can't do it friends because you
[1:37:12] can't add to the word I know the devil
[1:37:14] like to take your joy I know we'd like
[1:37:16] to take your victory take your peace
[1:37:18] take the security of this election from
[1:37:20] you but he can't do it because you can't
[1:37:22] take away from the word amen he said my
[1:37:26] word is a seed but it won't return unto
[1:37:28] me void it's going to accomplish the
[1:37:31] purpose that I sent it for brother if
[1:37:34] you're the word of God this might sound
[1:37:37] like heresy but I believe that the true
[1:37:40] children of God the word of they're the
[1:37:42] Living Word of God spoken word children
[1:37:43] are just as infallible as this King
[1:37:45] James Bible sitting right in front of me

[1:37:50] the way that it's called heresy so

[1:37:54] you might make mistakes you might be
[1:37:56] toss and turn but the perfect will of
[1:37:59] God will be done regardless that's why
[1:38:04] I'm so glad you know I might go through
[1:38:06] the sunshine go through the rain but I'm

[1:38:19] ministries rose up great uh great people
[1:38:22] great churches and he said now they're
[1:38:24] laying in the scrap heap on the side of
[1:38:25] the road but I'll tell you what will
[1:38:27] keep you out of that scrap heap is not
[1:38:29] your effort it's not your righteousness
[1:38:31] not your talent or your ability or your
[1:38:34] zeal for God but it's that seed of
[1:38:36] election laying in yo hallelujah you
[1:38:41] believe that Oh
[1:38:43] glory to God Amen see that's what I'm
[1:38:48] shouting about glory to God amen oh my
[1:38:53] somewhere somewhere along the line
[1:38:55] somebody thought shouting meant
[1:38:57] Pentecostal somebody thought shouting
[1:38:59] meant immaturity but what about John
[1:39:01] amen when he saw his name written on
[1:39:04] that Lamb's Book
[1:39:05] something is hard they said everything
[1:39:07] under the earth everything on the earth
[1:39:08] and everything above the earth heard
[1:39:10] John shouting amen and worshiping God
[1:39:13] how are you knowing a man that his name
[1:39:16] was written on that book that's why when
[1:39:18] I look into this message amen and I
[1:39:20] began to realize by the light of his
[1:39:22] word Who I am when I began to look into
[1:39:25] the mirror of his word and be changed
[1:39:26] into that glory it makes me want to
[1:39:30] shout Amen you're a vessel of mercy
[1:39:39] that's what he called you to be
[1:39:41] Amen now there were many attributes in
[1:39:43] God that we're waiting to be expressed
[1:39:45] amen our God is a vengeful God he's a
[1:39:47] wrathful God on the unrighteous that's
[1:39:49] why that's why Romans said that he's
[1:39:52] there's vessels of Wrath have been
[1:39:54] prepared so that the wrath of God can be
[1:39:57] revealed amen but you are not those
[1:39:59] vessels of Wrath but you've been called
[1:40:01] here to be a vessel of mercy amen
[1:40:04] hallelujah he's not filled you with
[1:40:05] judgment filled you with fear filled you
[1:40:08] with condemnation he has filled you with
[1:40:10] mercy amen he has filled you with grace
[1:40:12] and that's what we're called to be Amen
[1:40:14] I know we got people around this message
[1:40:16] that are legalistic and they you know
[1:40:18] they can take the word and they can
[1:40:19] begin to cut with it and they can you
[1:40:21] know somebody if you're not careful you
[1:40:23] can take this message and you can just
[1:40:25] tear somebody apart with it you know
[1:40:27] what the problem is say man oh my you're
[1:40:29] filling up with the wrong with the wrong
[1:40:31] message hey man going to God because you
[1:40:35] know every time God sends a word to the
[1:40:37] earth to the world it's judgment but to
[1:40:41] the chosen elect it's always great amen
[1:40:44] I'll do that's what capstone came down
[1:40:46] crying grace grace to the world the
[1:40:49] message is indictment but to the bride
[1:40:51] it's Shalom
[1:40:54] please be upon you your light has come
[1:40:58] Hallelujah vessels of mercy that's why
[1:41:00] the Bible says he's committed unto us a
[1:41:02] Ministry of reconciliation think about
[1:41:05] it now all right god help us this
[1:41:07] morning but think about how brother
[1:41:08] Branham said that the bride's ministry
[1:41:10] would be just like Christ amen amen well
[1:41:13] Christ's ministry was one of redemption
[1:41:15] was it not amen so there's attributes in
[1:41:17] the bride of redemption attributes of
[1:41:20] reconciliation oh my that's why we love
[1:41:22] one another that's why we forgive one
[1:41:24] another
[1:41:25] Amen that's why we we have a testimony
[1:41:27] in this world of an atmosphere of love
[1:41:29] Amen not just to be a good Christian but
[1:41:32] because he has committed to this bride a
[1:41:34] ministry Amen he has hidden he has
[1:41:37] tabernacled his name in this bride and
[1:41:39] he's fulfilling the Ministry of Christ
[1:41:41] through you hallelujah is hey man that's
[1:41:45] why hey man that's why he's a hey man
[1:41:48] that's why there's something your heart
[1:41:50] and somebody cuts you off in traffic you
[1:41:53] say Father forgive him they didn't know
[1:41:56] who they were cutting off hey man
[1:41:58] somebody treats you bad he say Lord they
[1:42:01] don't know who I am
[1:42:02] amen amen but Lord you revealed to me I
[1:42:04] just say Lord I don't hold it against
[1:42:06] I'm a man because there's something in
[1:42:08] you amen now I'm not trying to make a
[1:42:11] big doctrine out of this or something or
[1:42:12] or say these ones are in these ones are
[1:42:14] out or anything like that but didn't a
[1:42:16] prophet say that for a glass of water
[1:42:18] a cup of cold water in my name for these
[1:42:20] things he said there's a whole class of
[1:42:22] people because of their the way they
[1:42:24] treat the bride and they may be allowed
[1:42:26] to enter into eternal people aren't we
[1:42:29] be Amen amen to realize that we have
[1:42:32] this great responsibility this great
[1:42:34] power dwelling in us not in our vessel
[1:42:37] Amen but because of whose dwelling in us
[1:42:39] because of whose temple you are when
[1:42:41] people come to you they can come into
[1:42:43] contact with God something can happen
[1:42:46] that can make a difference in somebody's
[1:42:49] life oh I want to live that way hey man
[1:42:53] is that all right that might be bold but
[1:42:57] hallelujah amen
[1:43:00] don't you know the bride has a ministry
[1:43:02] a man what she ate this book with John
[1:43:05] eight this book amen there was a word
[1:43:08] that said you've got to prophesy again a
[1:43:10] man don't just sit there and listen to
[1:43:12] it you better but then you got to
[1:43:15] prophesy him and there's got to be a
[1:43:17] word in your mouth and what this bride
[1:43:18] is preaching to this world is not a
[1:43:20] message of judgment not a message of
[1:43:22] well who cares about you I got mine no
[1:43:25] but she's saying let him that is thirsty
[1:43:29] come a man let every laughs eat everyone
[1:43:33] amen if they can't be bribed amen if
[1:43:35] they're totally lost let him go to a
[1:43:37] devil's hell having experienced the
[1:43:39] divine love of God one time that's the
[1:43:43] kind of people we ought to be that's the
[1:43:45] mindset we ought to have amen to be that
[1:43:48] redemption you know it was when Abraham
[1:43:50] manifested the attribute of an amateur
[1:43:53] Redeemer and claimed his brother lot
[1:43:55] that's when Melchizedek came to have
[1:43:56] communion amen all right I know I rushed
[1:44:01] over those things quickly I don't want
[1:44:03] to go all the way into him this morning
[1:44:05] amen I'm just all over the place
[1:44:07] having a good time I hope you're having
[1:44:10] a good time
[1:44:10] amen amen
[1:44:14] now you say well how could I
[1:44:18] fulfill that ministry how could I be
[1:44:22] that bride looking at this veil of flesh
[1:44:25] looking at this vessel amen how could
[1:44:28] God's glory fill a vessel like this with
[1:44:32] all the imperfections all the flaws and
[1:44:34] all the failures amen what's stumbling
[1:44:37] you amen what's blinding your eyes
[1:44:39] what's veiling it to you is the
[1:44:41] foolishness of God the Bible says there
[1:44:44] is a foolishness of God that's wiser
[1:44:46] than the wisdom of the world they
[1:44:49] foolishness of God and and and if you
[1:44:52] ever go read that that chapter in first
[1:44:54] Corinthians chapter 1 it'll really bless
[1:44:56] your heart when you begin to realize how
[1:44:58] that God operates is all
[1:44:59] in a way that comes so humble and it
[1:45:02] comes so it comes so lowly that we would
[1:45:05] miss it all together amen
[1:45:07] I'll give you an example in that chapter
[1:45:09] Paul says it's the foolishness of
[1:45:11] preaching that can save men's soul now
[1:45:13] I've never heard anything so foolish as
[1:45:15] preaching a man there's just nothing you
[1:45:17] know to get up here and and scream and
[1:45:20] sweat and just bounce around and and and
[1:45:23] and and and yet God can save souls that
[1:45:26] way that's the way that he speaks to his
[1:45:28] church it's through vessels of men
[1:45:30] that's the way that he can speak to you
[1:45:31] this morning it's through that
[1:45:32] foolishness of preaching but it is
[1:45:34] foolishness to the eyes of men amen
[1:45:37] hallelujah you know if I was in charge
[1:45:39] the way that I would do it Amen is every
[1:45:41] Sunday if it was me just setting up the
[1:45:43] order of the church brother Jack I I
[1:45:45] believe every Sunday if I had my way we
[1:45:47] would all come to church you know we
[1:45:49] gather around sing and do everything you
[1:45:51] know and then and then brother Jack
[1:45:52] would pastor Jack would come up to the
[1:45:54] pulpit and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:45:56] Ghost would come and he would just
[1:45:58] levitate about three feet in the air and
[1:45:59] light would shine out of his eyes and
[1:46:01] the whole morning sermon that God's
[1:46:04] message to his people would be delivered
[1:46:05] by divine prophecy but it doesn't happen
[1:46:08] that way you know because all week long
[1:46:10] you know he's thinking and and labor and
[1:46:12] say Lord what am I gonna bring Sunday
[1:46:14] morning what what do you have for your
[1:46:16] people you know and then a little
[1:46:17] problem will come up in the family he's
[1:46:18] got to go take care of that and then
[1:46:20] summer rides up over here in the church
[1:46:21] he's got a how inefficient they meant
[1:46:23] how foolish and yet God how many times
[1:46:26] over and over and over again has God met
[1:46:29] your need over this pulpit for the
[1:46:32] foolishness of preaching and I tell you
[1:46:34] if he can use a preacher that way he can
[1:46:36] use you too and then if God can speak
[1:46:39] through a donkey I believe that uh that
[1:46:41] uh
[1:46:42] that vessel doesn't matter how lonely
[1:46:44] you are how uneducated amen
[1:46:48] I believe God can use you I believe he
[1:46:51] can use your vessel amen the Bible says
[1:46:53] it's the wisdom of God that the world by
[1:46:56] wisdom knew not God in other words you
[1:46:58] cannot know God through your own
[1:47:01] intellectual understanding you might
[1:47:04] think you do but you can never truly
[1:47:06] know God up here and it was the wisdom
[1:47:10] of God that it's that way
[1:47:11] amen because if it took the smart and
[1:47:14] the educated and the philosophers amen
[1:47:16] and the deep people amen what hope would
[1:47:19] that drunk in a gutter have had amen
[1:47:20] what hope would that lost one of half if
[1:47:23] it took a real understanding if it took
[1:47:25] several years of Bible School to know
[1:47:27] God that's not the way it is brother God
[1:47:29] is known on the basis of faith and every
[1:47:32] human being a man has intrinsic faith
[1:47:34] that all you've got to do is set your
[1:47:37] faith in the Word of God you might not
[1:47:39] understand it altogether you might not
[1:47:41] fully see this message but you say Lord
[1:47:43] I believe it with all my heart
[1:47:45] amen watch God anointed and quicken it
[1:47:48] to you glory to God it's the wisdom of
[1:47:51] God that you don't know him by wisdom Oh
[1:47:54] what foolishness amen how do they Paul
[1:47:58] said because the foolishness of God is
[1:48:00] wiser than men and the weakness of God
[1:48:03] is stronger than men for you see your
[1:48:07] calling brethren how that not many wise
[1:48:09] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[1:48:14] many noble are called but God hath
[1:48:17] chosen the foolish things of this world
[1:48:20] that's me amen to confound the wise and
[1:48:25] God hath chosen the weak things of the
[1:48:27] world to confound the things which are
[1:48:29] mighty and base things of the world and
[1:48:31] things which are despised hath God
[1:48:32] chosen yes and things which are not to
[1:48:35] bring to nought things which are and
[1:48:38] here's why that no flesh should glory in
[1:48:42] his presence no flesh should glory in
[1:48:45] his presence all glory to God amen
[1:48:48] you see your car I don't know how it is
[1:48:50] down here in Florida amen
[1:48:52] back there in Bluffton we got a little
[1:48:54] group of people just a little not a
[1:48:56] megachurch
[1:48:56] but it's a no megachurch hey man and
[1:48:58] it's all the misfits and the rejects
[1:49:00] Amen it's the castaways it's the poor
[1:49:03] people the uneducated the people that'll
[1:49:05] never be imported they'll never be
[1:49:07] famous they'll never be kings and
[1:49:09] presidents and princes and celebrities
[1:49:11] amen but I tell you they're the children
[1:49:13] of God just like all the children of
[1:49:20] Israel of Abraham they just wandered
[1:49:22] through the world and kings and empires
[1:49:25] rose and fell around them but they were
[1:49:27] seeking a city not made with hands but
[1:49:30] it's a city that God is building now
[1:49:34] hallelujah
[1:49:35] there's your adoption friends you're
[1:49:37] just another brick in the wall of that
[1:49:39] city
[1:49:40] Alleluia amen you want to be part of
[1:49:44] that adoption you can't be of somebody
[1:49:46] hey man cuz I don't care how fine you
[1:49:48] might be a stone Amen in that house amen
[1:49:52] what's a adoptions a positional placing
[1:49:54] a positional placing alright
[1:49:56] isn't that what he said amen I don't
[1:49:58] care you take a stone and you cut it
[1:50:00] just perfect you make it just as
[1:50:02] beautiful as it can be I mean a
[1:50:04] beautiful stone an excellent life a
[1:50:06] religious man throw it out in the field
[1:50:08] and try to get shelter by it amen but it
[1:50:11] for you to come into position Amen you
[1:50:13] got to lift your brother up and pull
[1:50:15] them through your side and you got to
[1:50:16] lift another one amen and you've got to
[1:50:18] be built together amen it's not a one
[1:50:21] man calling it's not a one man ministry
[1:50:23] it's not great men and great ministries
[1:50:25] but it's everyone in the right position
[1:50:28] empty vessels for the will of God that's
[1:50:31] why he said if you're a if you're a
[1:50:34] factory worker if you're a farmer if
[1:50:36] you're just a little housewife trying to
[1:50:38] raise your children right if you found
[1:50:40] that position you are an indispensable
[1:50:44] portion of the economy of God amen the
[1:50:48] kingdom wouldn't make it without you
[1:50:50] we're not gonna make it without you
[1:50:52] brother sister hallelujah why don't you
[1:50:55] stop sitting around feeling sorry for
[1:50:56] yourself
[1:50:57] we're all just waiting for you to come
[1:50:59] and join arms with
[1:51:00] say man none of us got it all together
[1:51:02] none of us have the full understanding
[1:51:04] but if we stand shoulder to shoulder and
[1:51:06] find our position in that body one of
[1:51:09] these days this body will so be
[1:51:10] identified with our hand and then we'll
[1:51:13] have to be caught up to meet oh don't
[1:51:19] you know we have nothing to do but fall
[1:51:21] back in the arms of a loving gracious
[1:51:23] God this morning because it wasn't him
[1:51:25] that doeth not him that willeth but it
[1:51:28] was God that shows mercy when you
[1:51:31] wouldn't have chose yourself God did the
[1:51:33] choosing Amen hallelujah he said I'll
[1:51:36] have mercy upon whom I will have mercy
[1:51:39] so who art Thou O man amen sometimes we
[1:51:43] get say Lord why did you choose that one
[1:51:45] Lord why'd you choose that brother that
[1:51:47] sister they drive me up the wall amen
[1:51:50] but how many ever said Lord how could
[1:51:51] you it shows me Amen but one of these
[1:51:54] days you got to stop arguing with God's
[1:51:57] election and you just got to take God at
[1:52:00] His Word and just accept him for what
[1:52:02] he's done for you brother have said if
[1:52:06] God saw fit a meant to take the dust of
[1:52:09] this hurt and make one vessel to wrath
[1:52:11] and they just there's no hope we got to
[1:52:14] accept it by sovereignty but he also
[1:52:16] said if he takes that same earth and
[1:52:18] makes it into a vessel of mercy and he
[1:52:21] chose you Amen called you out of this
[1:52:22] world
[1:52:23] you've got to accept that but then many
[1:52:26] times that's the problem for people as
[1:52:29] they can't accept God's grace for
[1:52:31] themselves they can't look at a message
[1:52:33] and realize this is speaking of you Amen
[1:52:37] we recognize the message when it speaks
[1:52:39] of an end time prophet we recognize the
[1:52:41] message when it speaks of a fivefold
[1:52:42] ministry but what about that little
[1:52:44] housewife what about that factory worker
[1:52:46] Amen what about that one who just found
[1:52:49] their position living their life for God
[1:52:51] they got no pride in themselves they're
[1:52:53] just an empty vessel for his glory
[1:52:58] hallelujah
[1:53:00] we got to empty out all pride amen oh
[1:53:03] you got to empty it all out cast it all
[1:53:06] out till nothing's left but an empty
[1:53:08] vessel hallelujah now watch now what I
[1:53:11] see what I'm preaching you brother Brown
[1:53:13] said there's so many of us that likes to
[1:53:15] testify or we like to think that we are
[1:53:18] insufficient well that's right we are
[1:53:21] insufficient but he said but he said see
[1:53:25] but we make that an excuse come on now I
[1:53:29] have no education yes I have no ability
[1:53:33] I'm unable to do this and he said if you
[1:53:36] keep that up and do it that way keep
[1:53:39] going like that you can't amount to
[1:53:41] anything
[1:53:41] yes but the very thing that we make
[1:53:45] excuses by by our weakness God uses that
[1:53:49] very thing to tackle the job with
[1:53:52] hallelujah see he waits for us to get to
[1:53:55] that condition don't you see waits for
[1:53:58] you to get in that condition you say Oh
[1:54:00] Lord ah I feel someone worthy I feel so
[1:54:03] incapable I feel like such a failure
[1:54:05] God says finally I've got you in the
[1:54:08] position where you realize it's not your
[1:54:11] works Amen but it's my grace for you
[1:54:15] amen
[1:54:16] oh we take the excuses and says well I'm
[1:54:19] insufficient I can't do it and God takes
[1:54:21] that very thing to do the job with
[1:54:24] hallelujah
[1:54:25] oh my grace is sufficient for you my
[1:54:30] strength is made perfect in weakness God
[1:54:34] strength will never be perfected in a
[1:54:36] strong man and a strong woman see I'm
[1:54:39] not preaching compromised we're not
[1:54:40] preaching amen we're preaching grace not
[1:54:43] disgrace not leave anyway that you want
[1:54:45] to and either you're called or you're

[1:54:48] that can make you live in overcoming
[1:54:50] life I'm in a life of no compromise a
[1:54:53] life of no DeFede a life of joy amen
[1:54:57] unspeakable and full of glory amen

[1:55:01] understanding because it's foolishness
[1:55:03] amen to think that in all of the turmoil
[1:55:06] this life and the things that we go
[1:55:07] through and the ups and downs
[1:55:09] this life that we could have peace but
[1:55:11] our peace passes understanding because
[1:55:13] we're not looking at the circumstances
[1:55:15] we're not looking at the way it is but
[1:55:17] we feel that anchor every time we pull a
[1:55:19] little bit oh I know what I'm talking
[1:55:21] about

[1:55:33] you've been on the brink then you know
[1:55:36] that you're not the one doing the holy
[1:55:38] because if it was up to you you would
[1:55:40] have fallen away that's the grace of God
[1:55:50] hey man that's why I'm a believer not
[1:55:54] because I got faith but because the
[1:55:56] believer lives in the Amen oh yeah I
[1:55:59] have to believe not because I got faith
[1:56:02] but because I'm a believer and believers
[1:56:04] believe so I'm here walking in this
[1:56:07] faith walking in this light all by grace

[1:59:12] these days there won't be one stone
[1:59:14] laying on another of that whole system

[1:59:46] to give just uh I looked it up just four
[1:59:50] minutes wages Worth was all that she had
[1:59:52] to offer but because it was all that she
[1:59:55] had I meant God didn't look at the value
[1:59:58] of her offering he was looking at it the
[2:00:00] totality and there was something about
[2:00:03] that with a woman think of it in the
[2:00:05] middle of all those prints and priests
[2:00:07] he was looking at that poor little widow
[2:00:10] woman that's this bride brother sister

[2:00:15] week after week she went down to that
[2:00:16] temple and she just gave all that she

[2:00:41] brother Jack
[2:00:42] amen she was under some ministry that
[2:00:44] was supposed to feed her the word but
[2:00:45] instead was pumping her full of man's
[2:00:47] ideas and she meant taking advantage of
[2:00:49] she was in an abusive home maybe she was
[2:00:52] in an abusive ministry her daddy and
[2:00:54] mommy worked together anymore amen her
[2:00:56] daddy was in jail or whatever um she was

[2:01:07] just giving or offering to God and she
[2:01:10] went over and over and over again but
[2:01:11] one day she came into that building and
[2:01:13] it was the right place at the right time
[2:01:15] and she gave that meager little offering

[2:01:34] she's laying in the Word of God as a
[2:01:36] rebuke to you and I because we got so
[2:01:39] much prosperity and so we just give a
[2:01:41] little bit to God when we could give
