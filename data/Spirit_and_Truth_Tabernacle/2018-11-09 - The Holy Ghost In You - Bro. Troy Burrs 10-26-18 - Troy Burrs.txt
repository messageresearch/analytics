think give space to share a testimony especially what is done for you is we should wait for the next customer service to share this [Music] we've been doing some good things [Music] first of all I like to really think I'm for touching one spot something you might have heard Wednesday night Wednesday she went into the hospital we went away over the weekend comes back up a little bit we are went away for the weekend it's Orlando and after that trip on Monday she was supposed to fly on to Cleveland for doctor it's a pumpkinette in Cleveland and the whole weekend she wasn't feeling well and he said Sunday we went out and she just stayed in I'm sure the film but also she decided that she wasn't gonna make that trip she wasn't feeling good she was gonna come on home so she came back at home and Wednesday she wasn't really feeling good I woke up when I fixed the breakfast and she couldn't get out of bed and after after that I went on to work and my sister called me and said they'd taken her to the hospital you know because the doctor cause she had a test down previously the day before and they told her that she had blood clots on both our lungs and I'm said if she would have taken a trip she could she was that high risk for a stroke or a heart attack so I just we're gonna think up for the meeting you know this whole you know this leader hurts a state also just this yesterday I put an office in my supervisor and what so well I happened on full-time but it was like borderline force I know it's just the minimum time brings the one for that anybody else got a testimony they want to share tonight all right raise the Lord well amen don't worry y'all I'm gonna tell you I'm thinking God already in advance that bother you trying to get a job with sister Shonda working it cuz they given raises we try to build a building right so but we just thank God for things like I said we learned to appreciate where God break you from I remember a time where we was next to a bar and they would they would playing a lot worse music than this and you know it you you think you have my father's not trying to sit here and they play old Jam I'm trying to try to do that right and you're trying to get into the spirit and Oh glory count yourself so Mankato camera tap yeah hey but uh but you know we got a problem mighty long way in you know and I mean well we had the school next door we didn't have to worry about none of that so when we had to you know really relinquish the school anything could have happened and and we knew that this our landlord they constantly trying to get churches especially in this area because nobody wants to bring a business back here in the corner right you don't get any exposure anything like that so it's very hard for a business to be successful but as a landlord what they're doing is there's a business thing to them and they just got to bring in wherever they can get money and so churches are easy target when it comes to this but that's okay that's that's quite a rank we have to we've done it before we uh we gotta keep pressing though I will say if we can turn the game down on this ceiling might but we won't pick up that on the on the recording a man so but praise God a man God is good isn't he big man okay come on sis you know y'all got it with hey man I didn't I didn't I didn't know I almost missed that one god bless you hey man I actually have a few so the first one has to do with the program that I work in at school the Cancer boutique program there was a man there his name is Moe and he's very very [Music] overweight he doesn't take care of himself very well he has such a good heart and he came to the program to work out one day and his blood pressure was crazy crazy and he wasn't feeling well and he I have been talking to him you know every time he comes in the program because he's discussed guitar you know I feel that I just need to say hello to him when he comes in and make him know that there's people there who care and so his blood pressure was very very high the other day and he's he asked me who said you're a holy woman aren't you and I was like well yes I'd like to think so he was like but you're a woman of God and I was like yes that he was like would you pray with me now like okay so I prayed with him that his high blood pressure would come down and that he would feel better and by the time he left the that day he was walking laps around the track [Music] the other was my my knee I I injured my knee a long time ago my right knee and I was exercising and I was having so many problems with my knee and it was hurting me so bad and I was like man I'm gonna have to stop exercising which I didn't want to do so I prayed and I just asked God to heal that in you know I just kept feeling the symptoms of it hurt and I told my husband I was like this is a lie I'm healed you know and as soon as I said that to him the pain in my knees gone away there's a program that I had mentioned before that is paying for my schooling so I went for a meeting with them this week and they guaranteed me the money for my master's degree so for that Wow certainly proven himself man glory to God God blesses this anybody else before we transition all right okay amen well we're gonna actually when I brother Troy to come tonight he's gotta come in shared with us one that is appreciated answer the prayer we've been asking God to send help or raise up help in in this ministry and that's exactly what the Lord is doing Frank so I'm very grateful looking forward to what the Lord is place

mean I love the Lord amen hey man I tell you what we've really had a powerful service Sunday and I'm still drunk still feeling the effects I know God has done something for me Amanda brothers were talking just on Wednesday night that I feel a change happening in within the the church yes sir I feel that God has taken us to another level I really feel that God is really doing something in our myths so if we can just help us lower just you know just be mindful to the fans you know brother Jack said one thing their five is thirty the other night I'm sorry I'm not gonna hopefully have you understanding too long here that uh you know the power of the church is a prayer yes me [Music] prayer is what's going to change things we have been coming in this church on every other tools in mind and men not a women dr. Prince ooh I'm not taking them thank God for that all that all the prayer warriors but I we've literally seen prayers answered and on this and we've been praying for is that there's a number of things that we have been praying for since the beginning and one of those things is what you just mentioned we've been praying for our own church building amen but in that amen we're praying as well for rededication yes I of the temple bodies to take into that literal building whether Shekinah glory can come down and meet us there to change hearts and change lives deliver those that are bound heal those that are sick this is not a man in this hour but it's God in me amen Ephesians and I read this scripture I'm just gonna read one one one verse here and then and that's going to be for now anyway Ephesians 2 v the the 21st verse feed it the fifth chapter xxi verse a man I submitted your prayers I tell you what seems like soon as we left church Sunday he he unleashed an attack you know but you know what we're gonna just go on in and hide yes sir so I'm fully persuaded I'll let nothing separate me from the love of God you know we left the hellhound Bob but we loved his Caravan move right on yes sir we just gonna keep oh you upset the mode I give me in to go fool that's right keep pushing cuz I know as long as you man huh I'm doing something right that's right amen it said the 21st worse submit yourselves 1 submit yourself one to another in the fear of God now the 22nd wives submit yourselves unto your own as unto the Lord made a lord at a blessing to the reading of its work you may be seated Amen I wanna title if had to title this message the Holy Ghost in you we were talking about I made a few statements on the last service something and I said something that uh when I say well well we get to a place and and we under church and sometime if we're not careful Satan will fail as to sleep it'll become it's anything even sometimes I do electrical hood and one of the things that I have to be very careful of is to not get too complacent I have to be careful of even game of the guilt but I'm good at it I'm not ashamed said I'm good at what I do I'm good at what I thought and but it's when you're good at what you do when you're dealing with electricity is awesome it's easy sometime to get a little axe and it's that one time where you get a little axe and you make that one mistake and I deal with really high voltage there's no chance of oops you won't get a chance to say no and I said you just gonna have everything right with god yes oops is not an option right Oh dad you're you think we talk of the job some time here that there be a greasy spot on the flow where you want was and that's just the truth and no we're talking about some very high voltages coming into that Airport and some time that we have to work on and work on high so it's complacency is my enemy yeah yeah complacency is the enemy and and and and even and spiritually speaking complacency is the enemy we can't allow ourselves to be fed and asleep by the Dell right brother he would wanna they want us to feel like well you come this far you dude you've made some good strides you come in and you you chassis some changes in your life alright but you have to go on wait yes sir right we've to sing a song ninety nine and a half but in this our brothers and sisters we have my revelation of the word we realizing that by the help of the Holy Ghost we we will make that hundred yeah but there's some things that we have to we can't allow complacency to set in we have to stay hungry and we have to stay thirsty for God you cannot exhaust that way the more he reveals to you the more you realize the more you want it's something about all that food of God see there's nothing extra food we don't get fooled and get to a place like well I'm done nota but we eat the mo we won't yes her amen because the movie Pete the movie won't the problem is there something helped me something had a message the statue of a perfect man he said in paragraphs 132 statue of a perfect man paragraph 130 to say he says now a lot of people go up to the altar and pray and say Lord forgive me and the great experience of sanctification come upon me and these then you have a great time get up to the altar shouting right go back say bless God I got it all right he said no you just it's done you just get to a place where you can grow you ain't done nothing the only thing you did was laid the foundation right now you have to build upon the foundation that it's been laid right you know we think God sees it and it's nothing that we do right we are not the builders right we can't build all we have to do is submit it's submit to what the will of husband to do his will he said when we pray we pray on this wise our Father who hallow would be thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven in me amen he's also says seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added to you the kingdom of God and His righteousness now I want to say this week what we're striving for is to be was driving when we get that we ask our Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what we won't is a life the life of Christ living through us we won't the God to be tabernacle in us amen there was going down and he took the dust from the earth and he created a body and went to Abraham it was God Tabernacles in a body that body got hungry sat and ate with Abraham and again he came to Mary and said Mary you've been highly favored he went into the womb of Mary and created a blood cell and that blood cells nine-months developed into a body in that body went through trials and testings for 33 fled across all the sacrifices he 12 in a body that's to now again he wants to dwell in a body says in Hebrews he said a body that has prepared for my yeah amen we would put to the point my brothers and sisters where the whole world is grown and in travail and to see the manifestations of the sons of God that's not me that's not you all right that's dignity Oh two feet again what's that gonna take of me yeah submitting to the word of the Lord admitted to God's will I'm gonna go back there to Matthew Matthew I just read there Matthew 33 take me back to Matthew 6 chapter the 31 amen there's something real good in that as I was reading and studying I just can't look over Matthew 6:31 I'm sorry I got the right thing down yes yes he said that if a man when you got it okay he says that therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink oh we're with shall I be clothed what is he saying man don't worry about the natural things God is going to provide God is going to take care of those things we see a lot of times different ones struggle with well these these should I say carnal things oh well I got this to do there's nothing that you have to do that's more important come on to the seeking the kingdom of God absolutely nothing says here in 32nd it says for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly Father knoweth you have need of of these things he is still Jehovah Jireh seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you what things mine what things let me say this your righteousness is not good enough to get us out of here Oh yo best stick come on own yo best thing you can't live good enough amen there's nothing you you have nothing to do with it his righteousness in you yes sir not our you're not like you give you a lot of times I try to talk to people always look for opportunity to this slice up meaning that most people that don't really believe the Bible they're just say what all I have to do is be good I look good right there was many good people drowned in the flood yes sir good people right you could the promise I think you you your life you couldn't live no holiest didn't know priests that's right but they didn't recognize the word for that day hey man same thing at know it's time good people yes sir but they didn't recognize the word for their day and they didn't get in New York and they was punished punished so with it's not has nothing to do with our righteous like I say on your best day you can't live good enough alright it takes we got a live a certain way you got to do Jesus came in to the temple and saw that it was in there selling and carrying on in the jungle all right when over there gave him a good deep rope yes he just went off like a wild man they say well look at how he acted but you don't understand right see ya he don't beat you out the trouble because what you're doing you wanted failing to tell power that's right man see oh you were in the carnal mind they would say what that was that was not right he shouldn't did look at him that Fallon he gonna keep the Turk clean yes was righteousness righteousness in way what are we talking about racism you must be committed to the things of God unless they ain't trying to build a better boat I'm not trying to help Oh Trump get Bo Richards no I'm not driving God thank God for my job and he gave me the job and I do the best that I can on it all right why so that we can build a church wrong I want to provide my kids dogs I want to provide for my wife yeah want to be to provide on the white and I like to eat I like to have a little change in the park but you know way I'm not gonna sacrifice that for the Lord I don't have time I would but I'm telling you I love what the brothers say if I am NOT what does trying to get me the mood of Port st. Lucie [Music] we build a church one thing that excited me we looked at a place one time and there was a house for sale Roger Street I stopped to look into that the choices he's say here now in the message of dedication of the building of the Lord he said you can take a dead center Rock carnal in his mind and in his thinking a criticizes of the power of God and bring help me to the presence of the Holy Ghost they'll be something happened to it amen there'll be something happened to him sure entering into that lowly place with God Amen thank you brother entering that I'll only place with God he 12 says Moses in the next chapter in the thickness of the darkness there's where God dwells there's where the life states is in the midst of rock corruption where does the life stay in the sea after it's rotten when it dies to itself it brings forth new life yeah where does God state he will stay with you we talk about right he will stay with you hey man if you're willing to death all right say you have to sacrifice your wheel yeah submit your wheel to his will not my will but your will be done amen we want him to eat well these bodies alright Amen in the sacrifice of the Old Testament day when a priest had to go in and sacrifice for sin they think they threw the the sacrificial lamb on the altar and and it burned he says a biggie transform we were going through a transformation and when they throw the flesh of that animal carcass on the fire and it's Inge's and burned that flash is being transformed into a smoke paper that goes up to God as a sweet-smelling savour he said that no it's time he said I the sins of that time have come up to heaven and stunk in my notches but when you lay your flesh on the sacrificial altar to be burned by the power of the Holy Ghost in fact it goes up to God as the sweets not a saint yes sir amen you think we had a good time he had a good call ritika second Peter the first chapter amen second Peter the first challenge if you put that up on the board on my sister gave me some time I give this little bit about a cape amen a man says Simon Peter a servant and the apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious face with us through what the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiple multiple items are multiplying unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according to his divine power has given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to the glory and virtue whereby are we given unto us exceeding great precious promises that by themselves ye might partake of the divine nature the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through through lust amen keep on suit and besides this given to diligent in all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge temperance and to your temperance patience and to your patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity all right so we realize the Prophet saying all right now why but he said when you come to the altar and the Lord visits you the law you you you you know something this happened he the promised saying you ought to with this thought you have laid the foundation of faith to do what now I read the scripture and seek you first to keep it our own advantages and things may be ad white fang's add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge right temperance right patience brother the colonists and brother the times they man these other things that we are added to our life all right these are the things that must be able to man listen in the midden the message our blasphemous name he said now get this lesson here is what's wrong with the brand of Chavanel thing he said you see there is two different kinds of faith there's two different kinds of virtue all right he said there's two different kinds of match there's two different kinds of temperance all right hey man there's two different kinds of godliness he says one thing as prohibition is to know about talking about your the two different kinds of temperance he says one thinks it's prohibition they got they ain't got the kind of chippers that god is talking about it's that ungodly uncontrollable temper you got and the thing and things of that side fact that fast banking he says patience and so forth yeah he said there's a mockery of it listen I ain't pretending to be a nature giving faith a nature giving virtue there's a nature giving temperance all these things are nature giving and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith huh yeah ba get this and that by here the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there is a godly spiritual faith then what does that faith - faith recognizes only the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word and the Word was God in the Word was with God amen and the word is still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mill - because our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelations and upon this fund this foundation now he said you've laid the foundation upon this foundation I'll build my church upon not upon the mental conception of Church joining a mental conception of that but upon the revelation right amen he goes into just a shepherd's dream now I don't know how you think you gonna give a faith of Revelation without coming to church how long I just don't see how you're gonna do it why because in any time you knew you wanted something that the Bible says how about amount the two or three later thank you establishment here everything gonna be staffed for two or three right he said when you shoot know whether be rightfully yeah you lighten up because you're gonna hit the target a rifle has two sights on it has one up here close and then it has another one down at the end of the barrel yes sir now what you have with the target because so what do you have to do but what do you have to do when you on your knees at home Mutato if the only time you get word is when you come to church you have no point of whether that's the only time you got nothing compared to compared nothing to you have to spend some time all set in the word was wonderful it's wonderful this is the Word of God and this is what we go back but I promise you my brothers and sisters unless that thing is filtered they had the scrolls in Jesus day and they missed him yes sir because they did not recognize Johnny back and what'd he say right they were listening to that wild man-eating locusts and honey coming out of the woods see he didn't think love right right see so they let that man crazy that meant crazy I know I didn't listen to him but see if the word always come to our administer say this and I haven't found it yet I may but I trust this minute he say the Prophet is the usher you went to the presence of the Lord all right all right amen you have to not only read your Bible but you read your Bible through the message of the hour because that is what spiritual food is and that's the spiritual food you could wind up oh my god I got a I got a quote from surgeon sister time what if the Prophet had a it was a dream he had six dreams and one big and one of the dreams was there was ill he was with two brothers I forget the name of the man gave him a white canoe and the other two had a green canoe they were in the canoe and we they from the go across the lake but brother Branham says I said I'm not going to press alleged miss Kazue it won't make the journey he said well it go up and down alone debate by 39 or 40 mile you going on the bank and they said well why don't you get in the boat with these mothers they say no yeah I'm not going I'm not going and then all of a sudden he got the revelation of what that dream was yes he said oh the God was telling him not to go overseas to stay here right why just the store up the Eagles fool man he was given the Prophet Abraham and he met the perfect death and we have this eagle food not this is special food yesterday this is special vitamin to do what to build us we eat natural food we went over this last week we eat natural food and it sells to our body spiritual food it adds to our character faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness in God come and catch that thing always love I think you are sealed unit now oh then you are deity do you see there are there's another a temple amen there's another temple that that that that I got was in when Solomon was building the children a man said that they went up and got the seal from chocolate a man and they brought that cedar wood down to Jerusalem floated it down to Jerusalem and that cedar wood a man he said would represents humanity and and and and and that I mean they overlaid it with gold and gold represents digit now he took the men we take those virtues and build a man those virtues in us yeah says a buy of me gold tried in the fire he say that they think they take that goal and that gold has to be it has to be proven so each one of these virtues on you gonna have to be tested and tested through hard times text it to trial test it through tribulation beating that gold when it's it perfect when does that man and nickel with ladle then you did all right again I'll to see the King Nebuchadnezzar had a furnace and he so shadrach meshach could have maybe going to the furnace but there's another furnace they miss it everybody go go into the front we're gonna throw you into a French all right and God gonna put you in the furnace - all right won't we oh you going in I'd rather hear the buy of me gold yes sir pride and if I see this lady of CMAs I got the quote I'm getting ahead of myself ladies seeing age is a we in the cooker
