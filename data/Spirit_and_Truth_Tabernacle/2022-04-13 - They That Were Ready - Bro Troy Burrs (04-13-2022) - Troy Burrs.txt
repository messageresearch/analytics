TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] amen this evening and pray for the ones that are uh awake keep our pastor and the different saints that when went them to london in prayer amen but uh we're gonna keep moving on amen carry on in his absence amen because we have a work to do amen regardless of uh who might be here who might not be here amen um we do what we do for the glory of the lord amen if we were looking for people uh membership we wouldn't be here amen because there's many churches all over the place that has a they fill the auditoriums up amen but uh uh that's all right we're preaching to the bride i mean we know that the prophet explained to us that uh like in the days of uh noah when only five souls were saved amen so let us bow our heads stand our feet and bow our heads for a word of prayer where eight souls will save amen most gracious heavenly father lord we come to you oh lord this evening father god we ask you lord god to strengthen us in our bodies lord many have worked a long day of father and uh probably just a little tired o lord god and uh have expended themselves o lord and in their daily task oh lord god but we pray father that lord god those that made the sacrifice those that that are with us online lord father god you bless them oh father bless this little thought lord god that you've given me your father may it be edifying oh father god it may it go forth so father and do lord god what you intended for it to do lord god um take me out of the way of father god hide me behind the cross lord god may the words of my mouth lord god be edified in your sight of acceptable in your sight oh father lord jesus precious name we commit the service into your hands amen amen you may be seated amen uh just want to take amen for scripture if we will look at a few scriptures i want to start amen that's saint luke for a man in 18 amen saint luke 4 and 18. amen i originally had something altogether different but the lord kind of just changed it and uh when we go this this direction so amen i'm trying to okay i think luke 4 and 18 is breeds amen and um the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted and to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised amen and i thought this scripture you may be seated because i got a lot of scriptures to read amen you know a lot of add a blessing to the reading of his word you know just kind of led me to this when he's talking about heal the broken heart and the series that our pastor was doing on um hurt people hurt people amen i kind of just went back to that amen to see that jesus came to heal the brokenhearted amen but if you look deeply on that it says a number of things that he came to do heal the brokenhearted amen uh he came to uh preach deliverance to those that are in captive amen he also uh came to recover sight to the blind and i want to just mainly this this this aft this evening kind of just focus on sight to the blind amen if we look over here at um corinthians 2 corinthians the fourth chapter amen second corinthians the fourth chapter the third verse it says but if our gospel be hid it is hear to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we are for we preach not ourselves but christ the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus christ for god who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels vessels for the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us amen so we see two different scriptures there we see one that jesus said he came to give sight recovery sight to the blind amen and we see here that uh paul is preaching and he he said that if our gospel be hid amen it is here uh uh to them that are lost amen seeing that the god of this world amen has blinded them amen so uh uh we see two different contrasts there where where where where he is he's come to open the blinded eyes and give sight to the blind amen but the god of this world is doing just the opposite right amen but we see here in in in second corinthians the fourth chapter that the giving sight to the blind uh uh it goes with shining the light in this age amen shining the light on the gospel and we want to kind of just focus on that this evening real quick and we won't hold you too long amen but i want you if you will to let's take a look at the scripture amen in matthew 25 matthew 25 amen is talking about those uh those those foolish virgins there and he says the kingdom of god the kingdom of heaven uh be likened into ten virgins when they took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five of them were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and we see that uh the lamps a man um is is is associated with something that's giving light amen amen so uh we see that we have to uh god likened us to lamps in this hour amen so the five wives that took their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept amen they all slumped slumbered and slept and uh we see that the the message of the hour amen uh came to do three things it came amen to get us prepared for a rapture amen and in getting us prepared amen for or a rapture amen it had to first he had to wake us up amen because we were we were sleep we were we were we were lost uh uh in denominational ideas and and and things like that and uh uh we just didn't have a clear understanding of things amen and in order for him to to to reveal to us the things that decide what we first amen had to be woke we go on the bridegroom tear it and some slumbered and that midnight cry was made behold but made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us your oil amen i don't want to rush through this because uh uh uh we have a lot to say on some of these on some of these things and man we know that we are in uh an age amen the prophet called this age of the flying eagle where we are at this time under a prophetic anointing amen that eagle age a man where that eagle was able to fly to soar high amen and he was uh to to look uh uh far amen he was able to look uh down the road he's able to look behind and see things more clearly amen so if we see here in revelation 4 1 and he said uh and we also found out a man that he said come up hither amen we we ought to to come up hither into the teaching amen revelation 4 and 1 is also uh connected to the isaf is the teaching of the word for this age that we apply to our understanding that we will be able to see clearly amen that's the teaching of this age now amen uh matthew 25 it goes on to say now at the midnight the crowd was made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him we know that the cry was the message of the hour amen the crowd was the the messenger that sounded to call those to call the bride to a marriage amen see the wedding supper the rapture the the marriage takes place long before the wedding supper amen these things take place long before the wedding the wedding supper actually there is a union going on right now amen there is a courting ship there's a courtship that takes place where amen you get to know your husband amen and we just kind of want to focus on the light of this hour because uh when you talk about light being a lamp amen uh it's talking about basically it's twofold amen you being a light amen to those that you come in contact with those around you that you you may show them the way amen but the light that shines into your heart is to actually the revelation that is revealed to you amen because what it is is it gives you a basic understanding of a number of things who you are and who he is so you can't have a complete rapturing faith revelation until you fully understand who you are amen we'll get into that a little bit more down the road so these went in and then all these virgins arose and trim their lamps lamps are to do with being able to see in the dark amen and how many know that we're in the dark out amen so thank god for those lamps of amen that we are able to see in this dark hour uh and the lamp also refers to the spirit of a man if we look here in proverbs the 20th chapter the 27th verse it reads the spirit of a man is a candle of the lord the spirit of a man is a candle lamp unto the lord and we know that the spirit of a man consists of conscience memory imagination reasoning and affection am i right so the lamp is your spirit your mind where your comprehension is coming from amen so the oil of the holy ghost spirit that would cause your human mind to be illuminated by the revelation of the word had run out for these five versions for the foolish versions let me say that again the oil the holy spirit that would cause your minds to be illuminated amen by the revelation of the word had run out for these ten virgins amen but five got up and trimmed the lamps and made sure that they had oil in their lamps so they're consummated of having the oil in their lamps that they've got they flame the fire would not go out into their heart amen now understanding that that flame amen is what gives them amen the revelation of this hour amen because without that flame you can't see you're following me you you stumble in darkness but jesus said i come to give sight to the blind how did he when he was saying this he was saying it by accident he knew that there was a there was a holy ghost coming amen that was going to be able to amen keep the fire kindled in your heart and that is the very thing let me tell you something revelation oh my god is a supernatural event when the sometimes i believe that we and i can read it where the prophet even said it well sometimes we we we sort of take these things for granted we we we we cons we don't see the greatness of god because it's so simple he preached his message now that's ironic i was just studying this he preached the message god he didn't reveal the simplicity and revealing the same just before he preached the seals why because it was going to come so simple it's going to be so simple to the those that are so that are looking so deep and so highly educated and things like that and without let me say this without the oil without the lamb it's just words to you it's not going to illuminate you by revelation because there is nothing there amen to be illuminated amen so we see here amen uh let me go on revelation amen is is is supernatural thank you brother i i had it but i must have left it in there on the desk i had my blue rag yeah thank you i get i swear walking so amen if we look at the seals when the prophet preached the seals thank you brother he uh he said when the revelation was coming to him that angel came into the room and revealed to him the truth he said he was all he was going to come out and man it was all together different from his traditional thinking it was supernatural and in order for you to get it when you understand when you get a revelation when something comes and it's illuminated to your mind guess what it's a supernatural it's not just well i'm smart no the supernatural angel came down and revealed it to you amen i don't care how smart you are smart man can't see this many of them are blind in this day have no idea why because you can't get this by book just he the prophet said you can't get this by comparing scripture with scripture he said you can't get this by just comparing scripture with scripture it has to be amen a revelation from god a supernatural event amen but the wise answered and said no the foolish virgin said give us your oil for our lamps have gone out am i okay brother you still hear me amen unless uh the why the wise virgin answer said no not so there be not enough for us in you amen oil is the holy spirit and the scripture is showing us that even the wise didn't have an oversupply of the holy ghost they only had enough revelation of the word for themselves to be able to see their way in the darkness of that midnight hour he said but go ye rather to them that buy and sell for yourselves amen and then while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut amen and for a title i'm gonna title this message they that were ready they that were ready so we see that there were five wives and there were five fools foolish virgins amen all good pure virgin mean pure amen but the difference was five had oil and five did not all being a representation of the holy ghost amen and uh uh uh uh the other five did not have a revelation of of the gospel i can't understand how in this hour a person can have the holy ghost and not a word of god and deny the word of god see because in our traditional thinking we thought that the evidence of the holy ghost was maybe speaking in tongues you know back in my day they would you come to the church and they would pray for you and have you praying and tearing on the bench and they beat you in the back and say say jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus and until you started frothing at the mouth and you sort of got out of yourself emotionally that's when you got it that's just on your flesh i'm not that's that's fine to feel the i love to feel the presence of the lord some said when i was coming up in the baptist church you put they put the chairs out and you come around and you come up and you you you enjoy the service and you just want to be a part of church and you come and you sit in the chair and after that all of the mothers and the preachers line up and you go around and shake their hands and that's as far as they can take you but we have to go further than that my brothers and sisters we have to go all the way to the baptism of the holy ghost see i have a very good quote i don't know if i'm gonna get to it today amen but uh the prophet was talking about how amen that the tent was the uh tabernacle amen so he says on the outside of the tabernacle like the gate of the tabernacle amen you you can feel pretty good because you're getting close amen to to to to to the presence of the god amen see the the the the ark of the covenant was it was in the inner court behind the veil but as you get close you begin to feel the presence of the lord but see you say sometime in your life when you begin to get close you'll have rainy days and sometimes you'll have sunshine so in the sunshine days you feel good but also when the rainy times come you just don't know how to handle yourself amen and you go a little bit further into the into the inner court you still uh are subjected to sometimes rainy days and the sunshine the sunshine days you feel pretty good hey man you're on top of the mountain but when the rain stops and when the when the sun goes down and the clouds come and the rain stops amen now all of a sudden you you just you're not saved no more amen when someone uh i'm when someone in the church hurts your feelings all of a sudden you don't i'm not coming back no more all of a sudden when the pastor says something that you don't like all of a sudden you you claim you're saved but you're not coming to church anymore but see when you get on the inner side in a court amen there's no more gloomy days amen the light of the gospel is shining on the inside hey man you don't even know what's going on outside it could be raining and storming and no sun at all it doesn't matter to you because you're on the inside amen where the light of the gospel is constantly shining so no matter what your neighbor says no matter what your friend says no matter what your brother or sister does amen you have enough light amen to see beyond that and keep your eyes on the glory of the lord and don't let that stop you that's because you're in the inner court where the light is constantly shining so this is why the oil in your lamp is so important see what happened to those five foolish virgins they all the light went up and when the light get out you just don't know what to do with yourself amen you begin to stumble in darkness but i say this evening my brothers and sisters it is important to keep your oil in your lamp amen it would be a shame to come here week after week and to realize amen to let your oil get low amen and you know what it's not emotional it's not emotional i'm reminded i had i was thinking about it earlier and you know the scripture to uh uh uh says uh they that are hungry and thirsty shall be filled you must stay hungry the song says don't you let this gospel we have become common to you to where we're no longer hungering and thirsting amen because see if i may do a natural comparison when your natural body gets hungry hey man there are many things that you can go eat many things mcdonald's is on every corner burger king what's that new place wah-wah and all of these different things but is it what your body really needs so quite naturally you'll eat it and it'll do you some good it'll sustain you amen but it's not every it's not that what your what god wants you to have junk food i could go to the and get potato chips and soda and different things like that this food it may sustain me for a while amen but what is it going to do to the growth and and what my body really needs so you may hunger and you may thirst for righteousness you better look for what your body really needs i hope i'm speaking to someone today don't take out a convenience out of convenience well i'ma just go here and eat my spiritual food is it what you're really hungering for and the sad thing about it it'll satisfy you for a while it'll satisfy you for a while but you find yourself up and down up and down because you're not eating the right thing amen let's go on amen the prophet here made he says excuse me it was like the group amen had something in noah's day they had something that was revealed to them in their day that the rest of the world was blinded to the difference was that they had uh had anointed their spiritual eyesight of understanding by the message amen that that day of that day god has sent through a prophet sent them to enlighten them of their understanding to be able to see the darkness and the confusion of the time amen corinthians first corinthians two second chapter amen says but as it is written eyes have not seen nor ears have heard neither have it entered into the hearts of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of man's save the spirit of man which is in him even the things of god knoweth no man but by the spirit so you see that you must have the spirit of god in order to be able to understand the things of god you must have the spirit of god to be in order to be able to understand the things of god it goes on and says now we receive we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given unto us amen we see that that you'll hear a lot of times when when we're preaching here you hear amen things about the message and things amen about the prophet why because there was a message that came forth to wake us up out of our slumber there was a message from god that came forth amen to open the eyes of our understanding amen to do what we as ministers say it's not our job to dress you because see the bride has made herself ready but what we come to do amen to shout is hold a mirror up in front of you amen the mirror of the word of god amen and you it's yours responsibility amen to look into that word amen and and make changes as you see changes are needed amen because we all want to be ready want to be ready at that time amen the prophet preached a message be called preparation amen and in this time we're making preparation we don't want to be not making preparation like those foolish virgins in the bridegroom coming we have not made ourselves ready amen hallelujah so the uh uh we see in john 14 16 and 18 amen he says i will pray for the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you you see amen the spirit of truth is the spirit of god that would come into in into you so that you will be able to understand the word of your day see the oil in the vessel is the holy spirit that causes you to be able to see a man the word of god for your day amen to see the word of god for your day says in 18 here it says and i'll not leave you comfortless amen remember that it was the word that brings comfort to us he says i i will come to you look at that in 18 i will not leave you comfort comfortless i will come to you amen we look on here and say uh john 16 says i have yet i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now howbeit when the spirit of truth come when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth so we see here that the spirit of truth amen the spirit of truth is in you and he will be your god he would guide your mind to the correct understanding of the word by the message by the message of the hour now i want to i'm finna say something here the god will guide your mind in your heart to the message for your age the god will guide your mind and your heart to the message of the age he will also guide your life experiences so that when the time comes amen that will cause you to have an understanding of the things a man a deeper knowledge of himself the god will guide your life experiences to cause you to understand things to bring you into a deeper knowledge of himself so it is often the experiences of our life the things that we go through combined together with the word of god amen that will grow you in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior so we don't we don't with all the things we've been through amen i i appreciate god for the journey amen because what what look at joel it was out of the things that he went through that he was able to see some of the things that he was able to see amen so the life experiences the good and the bad and everything else it is the guy guiding you amen so that it when the time comes and the life experiences that you have and the word of god coming together amen to shine a light well this is why i was going through those things he was preparing me all the time amen he was preparing me all the time first john 4 4 chapter the fourth verse ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you then he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god hears us he's uh that is not of god here is not us hereby we hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of arrow so we hear the evidence according to john was being able to hear the word of truth that they were speaking of in that day amen in other words amen the evidence of a person with the spirit of god in the where they were able to hear and understand the correct interpretation of the word man we understand amen that like i was saying earlier that years before our pentecost different denominations had different understandings of what the holy ghost really was amen but we thank god for a profit in this hour amen in the church ages the revelation of jesus christ the prophet says here he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he would be as definitely throtted today as when christ withstood his efforts every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation amen but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we prevail over them you will recall i mentioned at the beginning of this message mr proud speaking this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus christ of jesus himself he says in the church and his work in the future ages then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it would take one it would take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require it will require supernatural instruction it will require the okay supernatural structure not just a student comparing verse with verse though that's good but a mystery requires the teaching of the holy spirit it never becomes or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know my brothers and sisters here in this ministry i believe i can speak amen in the past of his absence and say uh that that is the most important thing here that we are trying to do in this ministry is get people to the baptism of the holy ghost to the baptism it is the most important there will once say revelation is important but you can't have true revelation without the baptism of the holy ghost without the baptism of the holy ghost amen it is something we have a lot so we have different levels we have different levels we brother willis said something that he in the last time he preached here when we came to this message amen he said that we are looking for he says a holistic gospel amen and he was talking about he said when he was asking how when he got mad how we was we we were pretty clean we we looked good we were dressed well hey amen and uh so the problem was we had different ministers fighting over quotes is this right seals and thunders and tents and all these different things and back and forth but failing this group of young people because see what we're doing now is getting ready for a marriage and the holy ghost who is the teacher teaches us how to prepare ourselves how to prepare ourselves for this marriage that we are embarked on amen see so but but but a lot of times there were holes and there was gaps in that preparing because it was like the ministers were so big like he said arguing over quotes and different things they sort of forgot about the true purpose am i right is this right is that right you got a congregation of people sitting there unprepared for marriage unprepared for marriage and then when the when the struggles and of life and the different things come amen we wonder why so many has fell away because they wasn't prepared for marriage wasn't wasn't truly prepared amen and the only way to be prepared is to stress i would always stress it's the baptism of the holy ghost it's good to come to church it's good to be a christian but you got to go father it's good to come into the church he has to be in you he has to be in you and man we're not saying that it's a big emotional thing you don't have to come and slobber and cry and it's not coming out your nose and this that in the other because the mystery of this age is to be able to receive the holy ghost without sensation amen amen but i tell you what i love to have a god that i can feel sometimes amen my wife would get pretty mad man i don't come give her a kiss on the forehead or something come put my arms around and let her i know she go to get pouting around the house something ain't right any woman any woman would want their husband to come put their arms around you show you that i love you come and hold you when you say that sense of security amen same thing with our heavenly father sometime i need you to come and hold me let the word let the word of god just wrap all around me amen it just gives me strength and encouragement say thank you lord hey man willie was talking about the other sonny over there man out because i was studying so much at different things and just in such a place the song server was going on man i'm about to run out that door i'm taking off and like lord i feel so good i'm glad to be safe and the more i just enter in see that was the other message that i was going to preach i was going to talk about the door entering into that door what happened i was beginning to enter into a different level everybody was here and everything and they're saying and different things but i was in a whole nother level i had entered into something different amen well i did i wasn't even concerned with the people around me i wasn't even concerned with what was going on i had entered into something i had went into another door where it was just me and him me and him don't be afraid to go under that door amen don't be afraid sometime my brothers and sisters sometimes we get so mechanical amen i don't know why i'm going this way this wasn't even a part of it sometimes we get so mechanical in church amen that this got to happen at this time and this happened at this time and this happened at this time and we just like robots and everything we get up and we sing and we sit down and we listen and we go and we had a good time but we're not really entering into that door we're not really allowing ourselves to just we didn't come to see each other i love seeing my brothers and sisters but i tell you what i want to just see him amen i want to go beyond the outer court hey man i want to go beyond the inner court amen although it feels good we love singing and we raise our hands and everything and we got good songs and we got and we pat our feet and we have a real good time hey man but we just only out of court hey man sometimes i want to just go behind the veil amen when somebody look over and say what is wrong with that fella he don't went behind the curtain amen he ain't ain't nobody but him and jesus in there now amen and his worship is all together different amen he doesn't got caught up amen he's crying out to the lord lord feel me amen and that's what it's going to take my brothers and sisters not for these cold days start your service but we just get mechanical come in at a certain time sit down get up sit down and get up take a few stars and go home you ain't had church you went to a show but church is coming to meet him hey man your whole mindset when you come into the doors got to be different amen we know we have an order and everything and all those services especially now that we're in this building pray for us that we can get out of here and get our own building we can just stay as long as we wanna amen take the parameters from around us amen but you enter in you come in the song service and all of those things are designed to to get you into an atmosphere that you can receive from god amen there's more than one way you you receive from god by the word amen the word something strikes something in you sometimes it's okay amen for you to praise the lord don't disrupt the preacher now the deacon gonna have to come into escort you out the hallway you keep praising him out here because we can't interrupt the word amen because nothing comes before that amen but during the services and after service allow yourself a man to enter into that place with god consecrate yourself don't be so mechanical my brothers and sisters oh we came and we had a real good time that ain't enough that ain't enough we have to make sure we're ready and the only way to make sure that we're ready is by the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen i'm passing over because i hit a lot of this hey man you see here uh amen bear with me you love the lord amen in the feast of the trumpets amen i'm sorry so it's the 64 0719 1964 july 19 on the morning service uh paragraph 2 45 he says when finished that lady you'll see an age according to revelation 10 the mystery of all the bride would be node to the bride he said is that right listen close now the bride called out by the word christ himself calling out the bride amen i just want to interject here so after the seals opened in 1963 we'll see that the same pattern of our understanding of the word being completely changed around as the sermons of the prophet continued to be preached to us and all the mysteries of god continue to be made known to us by the ministry of the messenger's hour and so this also directly applies with this subject amen them that made themselves ready so my question is is is is is is that i asked what is the evidence i'll put it this way the evidence of the oil in your lamb a lot of people ask that question it's been natural question what's the evidence of the holy ghost but what is the evidence of the oil in your lamb amen the evidence of oil in your lamb amen is the ability to be able to recognize and see the word of the hour for your day the evidence that the oil is in your lamb amen that she'll say amen to every word amen she's no longer stumbling amen in darkness amen but see the word of god continue to unfold even into eternity amen the evidence of the oil in your lamb amen is is is as i go back to noah and and and and noah's day see they had to have an understanding a revelation amen that uh uh uh to get into the ark but it had to go beyond just the understanding and actually get in the yard it's okay to just have a revelation but if you don't actually do amen the word amen then do you really have a revelation or do you have uh uh what was are you just following the cry a lot of people just following the crime i do what they do but you don't have a real understanding for yourself you have to have a real and that's the evidence of the oil in your lamb amen amen i feel amen check the clothes i don't know what time is it brother y'all rem keep me keep me honest on those things amen but my brothers and sisters as the ministry if we don't stress amen in this hour the baptism of the holy ghost we have failed to people if we don't stress in this hour amen because that's the only thing that's the only way you're going to be able to get ready amen god's chosen place of worship he said notice that when you are truly baptized into him the true evidence is that you believe him the word god's chosen place of worship 1965 oh the february 20. paragraph 88 notice and when you are truly baptized into him amen the true evidence that you believe him the true evidence is that you believe him the word amen the true evidence so my brother um um you don't have to follow me on this one sister i know it's a lot of typing i got a lot of quotes and things here he said in one place the submerged church age amen if you're a true seed you will hear the word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you amen so these are different quotes and different things that the prophet has said amen to show us amen what is the actual evidence of the oil in our lamb the actual evidence that we that that we have what we claim we have now i'm not saying that that that that you don't that the ever not the holy ghost is not guiding you leading you and guiding you but you have to continue to follow the guide continue to follow the god amen because uh uh uh the bride is made there were five wives and there was five foolish virgins not before being under me to say who going to heaven and who not i'll never do that that is that is up to god ain't nothing to me i hope everybody make it but i ain't never been to a funeral where somebody didn't make it never in all my life been to a funeral where the person didn't make it to heaven everybody made it but we know better than that we know better than that the bride is making herself ready amen to go into a rapture amen by having the evening time light shining in a heart amen shining the light of understanding and revelation it is a supernatural event my brothers and sisters it is a supernatural event my my my plea this evening in closing amen is to uh say come in a man with a desperation now a lot of us been saved for many years we've been around the fire for many years but sometimes when we're around it for many years we we we be how should i say sometimes we get a little complacent we get it it just gets a little common to us oh that's just the ocean we live on the ocean say one man came from the forest and he passed by the other man and he wanted to get to the ocean so bad he says oh my god never seen the ocean i want to get into the ocean and he passed by a man leaving the ocean and it's just just the ocean because he just lived on it all his life but it's a special thing we have here amen and we should want more and more and more and more and more feel me and refill me with the holy ghost lord there's a lot around us that i don't even i i i don't know if they had an original baptism of the holy ghost see we have different different you know levels some been here for something in the church for a long time i received it back in 88 that's it 88. see because as you go out into the world your lamp burns out i was going to really break down i had some different quotes and different things and different of of what the lamp really is to define the lamp amen one place to prophesy the wick is you but then again he said another place you say the weak is your faith amen so your faith in the word amen it's the wick that actually burns and the holy ghost we know is the oil amen in your earthen vessel a man is the actual body of the lamb and sometimes a man you we when that ant lamp burns and burns it produces carbon so something every night then we got to come to church and trim our lambs amen get the carbon cleaned out of us amen so that we could see clear because if you carrying a lamp that's all carboned up it it slowly happens and you see a little less but you don't realize it because it's happened so slowly you don't realize that wait a minute a person that that that that that has problems with their eyes it sometimes happens gradually gradually gradually sometimes it happens so slowly that you you you find one man all of a sudden when they say well they starting to see you do this you start doing this and things like that you don't realize how far you have digressed and see and sometimes that maybe they have to take off the cataracts and things that nature hey man but it's just getting a little damn sometimes we have to come into church and say lord i need my lamps trimmed amen i just need a touch from you lord lord i need something no father god to just knock the carbon off the glass of my lamp so that i can see my way clearer amen i appreciate uh the testimony from sister nelly in closing amen uh uh and and just kind of explaining how sometime i land our sight just gets a little dim we get so caught up in the things of the world and and surviving and and and sometimes we can't see just really see we get we get it gets cloudy and then she was uh talking about how she's preparing for retirement and uh she was considering taking another job and and you guys remember the testimony and how the lord told her not to take that job he said haven't i taken care of you you know and and and and i know she by her testimony she said lord fought her with giving that testimony but little did she know that i too am trying to prepare for retirement and in doing so just kind of looking at finances and different things i begin to i don't know is it panic the right word um just get with just a little concern and we should be concerned about those things but i began to to allow you know on my job i just i need more money i need more money i'm trying to get this together i'm trying to make sure i'm ready and then when things don't fall into place like i think it should fall into place now i'm getting angry and it's causing me to have a whole different spirit see but when she gave that testimony thank the lord it just opened the eyes of my understanding wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute relax god is going to take care of you so as i begin to just look at that and different things i'm just saying i say just don't let this stress you don't let it because these kind of things will stretch you and stretch you i'm getting angry i'm angry with the boss and angry with the people and things like that and one all upset and find myself upset all the time carrying it but the lord came through that testimony and just gave me a word oh thank you jesus okay okay what he did just came and knocked a little carbon off my limbs so i could see a little clearer amen you love the lord amen i hope it was a blessing amen to you uh this evening amen and uh those men that might be joining us online i know some of the terminology and different things the man that you heard may may be a little different from what you're used to but if you have any questions feel free amen to reach out to our pastor amen and where there's a bible question there's certainly a bible answer there's
