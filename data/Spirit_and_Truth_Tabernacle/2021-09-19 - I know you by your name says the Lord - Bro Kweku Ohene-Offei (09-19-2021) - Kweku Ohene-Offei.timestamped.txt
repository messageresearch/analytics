[5:15] amen this morning as we was just in
[5:17] prayer and
[5:18] the little thought came to me
[5:22] you know our prayers would not be
[5:23] stopped
[5:25] it won't be stopped you know sometimes
[5:27] it just seems like they are delayed
[5:30] uh as it was in the days of
[5:33] daniel he was praying and amen and
[5:36] somehow his prayer got delayed and and
[5:38] the angel came and told him said we
[5:40] heard your prayer as soon as you prayed
[5:41] it
[5:42] not only did they hear the prayer but
[5:44] the answer was on the way
[5:47] but as the answer was on the way somehow
[5:49] the prince of persia got involved in and
[5:52] began to hinder amen this prayer from
[5:54] getting on the answer from getting there
[5:56] to daniel but you know when when michael
[5:58] the great prince stepped in he released
[6:00] gabriel to bring the answer to to david
[6:04] i mean to to daniel he brother anson
[6:05] said what you need to understand is that
[6:07] maybe it was hindered
[6:09] but it couldn't be stopped
[6:12] it might have been delayed but it can't
[6:14] be stopped
[6:15] and whatever you believe in god for this
[6:17] morning i'm here to tell you it cannot
[6:20] be stopped

[36:52] go out the reason being is that we're on
[36:55] a time constraint and the brothers don't
[36:58] um the brothers actually will be kind of
[37:00] doing the offering at a different time
[37:02] than after service they won't be doing
[37:03] it anymore after service so always try
[37:06] to give as you come in
[37:08] rather than when you go out and and uh
[37:11] and once we you know until we get
[37:13] ourselves just kind of
[37:14] in that if you need one of the brothers
[37:16] just to pick up your offering today to
[37:18] put it in there that's fine because
[37:20] after we pray over to offer the brothers
[37:22] we'll be taking the box in order to uh
[37:24] start you know uh handling the finances
[37:26] there the church so just please if
[37:28] you're in the house lord and you're
[37:29] gonna use the box do that as you're
[37:31] coming into the house of the lord rather
[37:33] than when you're leaving the house of
[37:35] the lord that would be greatly
[37:37] appreciated those that want to give
[37:38] online we still have
[37:40] cash app and we still have
[37:42] um
[37:44] um
[37:45] paypal amen i'm gonna tell y'all uh
[37:48] sister liz is the reason we got cash out
[37:51] and she was like brother jack can we
[37:53] just get cash out for the church i'm
[37:55] like uh paypal been working for a long
[37:57] time paypal was difficult
[38:00] but uh so cash app has been working very
[38:02] well and i thank her for that idea
[38:03] because it's it's been it's been it's
[38:05] been a good tool amen to use and just

[44:32] i'll be okay
[44:35] amen amen amen
[44:38] yes
[44:45] the confidence that we have is in the
[44:47] word of god
[44:49] it tells us that
[44:51] all things work together for good
[44:54] to them who love god
[44:57] to them who are called according to his
[44:58] purpose
[45:00] and there's nothing that
[45:02] overtakes the believer that god don't
[45:05] already know about
[45:07] it's not a shock it's not a surprise
[45:09] this
[45:10] it's a part of a plan
[45:13] and uh what we learn to do is accept
[45:16] what god allows amen praise the lord
[45:20] um
[45:21] we'll stand we're going to prepare to

[46:31] us in prayer as we as we go that the
[46:33] lord will just bless us a man abundantly
[46:36] uh there at the meeting it's good to
[46:38] have brother kwaku back he was away for
[46:42] a bit
[46:47] and
[46:48] he had to bury his father
[46:50] there in ghana
[46:52] and uh he was able to do some even some
[46:54] evangelistic work while he was there but
[46:57] the lord brought him back safely here
[46:59] and i said well we want to hear from you
[47:01] brother we've been missing you for a
[47:02] little bit so
[47:04] we want to hear from you in this morning

[47:19] thank you for those
[47:21] nail scarred hands
[47:24] the price that was paid and
[47:26] just think about it and
[47:28] like i said i'm very selfish i believe
[47:30] that if he would have went to the cross
[47:32] only for one person and that one person
[47:34] would have been me i think he would have
[47:36] suffered
[47:37] all the pain just for me
[47:39] i love him i praise him i
[47:41] thank him
[47:42] because i know
[47:44] i don't know where i'd be if it had not
[47:46] been for the cross so let's lift our
[47:48] hands

[51:38] unto our lord
[51:44] glory hallelujah to the lord
[51:47] he is merciful amen
[51:49] this morning we want to speak on a
[51:52] text
[51:53] i know you by your name says the lord
[51:55] amen
[51:58] i know you by your name says the lord
[52:01] and this is the third time i'm preaching
[52:03] this uh salmon
[52:06] i preached it back in ghana when i went
[52:08] to ghana
[52:09] and brother gabriel asked me to minister
[52:10] to his people in colombia and i was
[52:12] inspired to preach it
[52:14] and but each time i preached the lord
[52:15] brings bring it something else amen
[52:18] bring new things so we want to look at
[52:20] that topic and we want to read a
[52:22] scripture from jeremiah
[52:24] chapter one verse five
[52:27] maybe we're gonna start from
[52:30] verse four
[52:32] and we read from four let's say jeremiah
[52:34] chapter five
[52:37] sorry jeremiah chapter one
[52:39] verse four
[52:41] let's read up to nine
[52:43] but the key test is verse 5
[52:46] jeremiah 1 verse 4 to 9
[52:50] and we pick a test from verse 5
[52:53] then the word of the lord came unto me
[52:54] saying
[52:55] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[52:58] thee
[52:59] and before thou camest forth out of the
[53:01] womb i sanctify thee
[53:03] and i ordained thee a prophet unto the
[53:05] nations
[53:07] then said i ah lord god behold i cannot
[53:10] speak for i am a child
[53:13] verse 7 but the lord said unto me say
[53:15] not i am a child for thou shalt go to
[53:18] all that i shall send thee and
[53:20] whatsoever i command thee thou shall
[53:22] speak
[53:23] be not afraid of their faces
[53:25] for i am with you to deliver these says
[53:27] the lord
[53:28] then the lord put forth his hand and
[53:30] touched my mouth and the lord said unto
[53:32] me behold i have put my my voice in thy
[53:35] mouth amen
[53:37] for jeremiah he was afraid of the
[53:38] people's face but yours might not be
[53:40] people you might be facing a
[53:41] circumstance
[53:42] which could be
[53:44] overwhelming which could kind of sinking
[53:46] you down but the lord said that he know
[53:48] you by your name amen god bless you we
[53:51] may take our seats
[53:57] i know you by your name you want to read
[53:58] another scripture quickly
[54:01] the first verse the first scripture we
[54:03] read talk about
[54:04] predestination the lord
[54:06] knew you before the foundation of the
[54:07] world you knew your name not just your
[54:10] name but agueron but the new name is
[54:12] identity good you're gonna break down
[54:14] name and we want to read the present
[54:16] tense form of the same scripture amen
[54:19] jeremiah talks about he knew you before
[54:22] you were formed in the belly of your
[54:23] mother's room in what form before you
[54:25] even you existed in clay and dust the
[54:28] lord knew you
[54:30] so we're going to look at that formation
[54:32] and that creation of knowing you but
[54:34] then let's look at another scripture and
[54:35] see how the lord knows you right now
[54:38] amen
[54:39] let's read from romans chapter 8
[54:42] let's read the first verse and then we
[54:44] jump to verse 8
[54:47] and read through 11.
[54:49] romans chapter 8 verse 1
[54:54] 8-11
[54:56] romans 8 verse 1
[54:58] there is therefore now no condemnation
[55:00] to them which are in christ jesus who
[55:02] walked not after the flesh
[55:04] but after the spirit amen
[55:07] another contest uh pretty this way
[55:09] there's no condemnation to them which
[55:11] are incredulous
[55:13] who walk
[55:14] in the flesh after the spirit amen in
[55:17] the flesh means you are working in
[55:19] cystine element
[55:20] it's not a flesh of sin we are working
[55:22] in clay
[55:23] in dust in potassium sodium cosmic light
[55:26] this is thin element but you are not
[55:29] working after the ordinances of the
[55:31] cosmos you are working after the order
[55:33] of mercy sadiq the spirit of the lord in
[55:35] your heart amen
[55:37] so we want to look at that
[55:39] unless for the sake of time let's jump
[55:40] to verse 8.
[55:42] so then so then they that are in the
[55:44] flesh cannot please god
[55:46] but ye are not in the flesh or you are
[55:48] not in the cosmos
[55:49] but in the spirit
[55:51] if so be that the spirit of god dwells
[55:53] in you
[55:54] now if any man have not the spirit of
[55:56] christ he is none of his
[55:58] verse 10 and if christ be in you which
[56:00] he is in you amen
[56:02] how many can say this but the lord is in
[56:04] them
[56:04] glory hallelujah the body is dead
[56:07] because of sin but the spirit is life
[56:09] because of righteousness verse 11
[56:12] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[56:14] jesus from the dead dwarves in you he
[56:17] that raised up christ from the dead
[56:19] shall quicken your mortal body amen
[56:22] if jesus christ this is a present tense
[56:25] how many can see jesus christ dressing
[56:27] them
[56:28] glory hallelujah so if jesus christ
[56:30] dwells in you
[56:31] then the spirit of christ or christ that
[56:34] was in you will quicken the flesh which
[56:36] is called jesus
[56:37] amen
[56:38] remember
[56:39] in the days of jesus in his flesh
[56:42] when he has to face cavalry he was a
[56:44] human being don't think he was only
[56:46] almighty god yes he was the almighty god
[56:48] he's almighty god he will ever be the
[56:49] almighty god but when he came insisting
[56:52] element
[56:53] part of his flesh part of his being was
[56:55] subject on to the flesh
[56:57] so when he was faced with cavalry
[56:59] he prayed that father he prayed to the
[57:01] people of fire in him the christ in him
[57:04] that it be thy wall let his suffering
[57:07] come mean suffering passover me
[57:09] but let your world not my world amen let
[57:13] us take prominence not the flesh
[57:15] so because that was the purpose for
[57:17] which he came to this world to die for
[57:19] you and i amen so jesus christ faced
[57:22] mountains and he prayed to the spirit of
[57:24] christ in him and that the logarithms in
[57:27] him took care of the situation and
[57:29] whatever you are facing now the logos
[57:31] christ in you is more than capable of
[57:33] taking care of your situation glory be
[57:35] to the lord
[57:37] let's jump to
[57:38] uh so this is the present tense the
[57:40] spirit of christ dwells in you and let's
[57:42] look at when this flesh drops
[57:44] what else
[57:46] if the lord knows you and i by name
[57:48] who is the almighty god then he should
[57:50] have made plans before the foundation of
[57:51] the world as he told jeremiah that
[57:53] before you were conceived in your
[57:55] mother's womb or in earth when you talk
[57:57] about womb not only the womb of a woman
[58:00] the earth is a woman it's a female
[58:02] version of christ
[58:03] before you were put in clear and dust he
[58:05] ordained you amen before you were born
[58:08] in west palm beach or in florida or in
[58:11] los angeles or in miami or in
[58:15] atlanta orlando wherever you were born
[58:18] in africa the lord ordained you and knew
[58:20] you amen he knew ordained that
[58:22] particular sistine element
[58:24] the calcium the potassium
[58:26] he he desired to manifest himself in
[58:29] that potassium called by the jagdaff
[58:31] amen so the lord knows you by name and
[58:34] whatever you are going through is
[58:36] already been taken care of glory
[58:38] hallelujah to the lord
[58:40] and now what about what we finish our
[58:42] earth
[58:43] our earthly journey and we drop this 16
[58:45] element we put it back in the cosmos
[58:48] what else does the lord have for you and
[58:50] i
[58:50] glory hallelujah let's jump to second
[58:53] corinthians chapter
[58:55] five verse one
[58:57] two corinthians five
[58:59] one
[59:05] it says for we know that if our earthly
[59:07] house of this tabernacle were dissolved
[59:11] we have a building of god and a house
[59:13] not made with hence eterna in the
[59:15] heavens
[59:16] for we know that if the earthly house
[59:18] the existing element were to do were to
[59:21] be dissolved right now
[59:23] we have we already have not that we will
[59:25] have
[59:27] but we already have
[59:28] you already possess it he said where is
[59:30] he it's right in you amen glory
[59:33] hallelujah and that house is a building
[59:37] not made with hands
[59:38] not ordained by your dad and your mom
[59:40] your early dad and your mom
[59:42] but it was odin before the foundation of
[59:44] the world
[59:45] before palm beach came into existence
[59:48] before united states became united
[59:49] states before the earth was formed
[59:52] before the moon came into creation the
[59:54] lord knew you and ordain you and that
[59:56] body existed amen and that body is who
[1:00:00] you are amen and that is eternity that
[1:00:03] is your true identity
[1:00:05] and that is eternal in the heavens and
[1:00:07] when you talk about heavens you've got
[1:00:09] three types of heaven
[1:00:11] god bless you buddy by jeffrey heaven is
[1:00:14] the church
[1:00:15] heaven is you yourself or we can even
[1:00:18] make it fall you are heaven because you
[1:00:20] are the church
[1:00:21] heaven not this tabernacle we are
[1:00:24] sitting in not this building i'm talking
[1:00:25] about you amen
[1:00:27] brother stephen god bless you you are
[1:00:29] heaven amen sister richard you are
[1:00:31] heaven says that you are heaven amen
[1:00:35] amen heaven is you ride you amen
[1:00:38] and the heaven is the firmament
[1:00:43] that hydrogen and and the gases that i
[1:00:46] mean encompasses the firmament that is
[1:00:48] also being described in the scriptures
[1:00:50] as heaven
[1:00:51] then the most important heaven
[1:00:53] is the pill of fire
[1:00:55] is heaven what we know heaven
[1:00:56] is the sixth dimension
[1:00:59] is the celestial world which is right
[1:01:01] here many times you look into the skies
[1:01:03] and above the skies and above the skies
[1:01:06] not the third heaven paul went to
[1:01:08] his body was right here but he moved
[1:01:10] into dimension amen or dimension were
[1:01:13] manifested to paul
[1:01:15] so he said i saw a man in the third
[1:01:16] heaven he was talking about himself his
[1:01:18] celestial body was his flesh body was in
[1:01:21] somewhere in arabia in israel but in the
[1:01:24] true paul
[1:01:25] which could not die the true saint paul
[1:01:28] the true apostle paul was in the 16th
[1:01:30] dimension he was walking on a blue grass
[1:01:33] he was walking on a land
[1:01:35] he was walking on a path on a road that
[1:01:38] wasn't built by the engineers of this
[1:01:40] earth
[1:01:40] but elohim himself spoke into creation
[1:01:43] amen so we have a building that when
[1:01:46] this one is dissolved that burden is
[1:01:48] already in you glory hallelujah that is
[1:01:51] what we call the holy spirit because
[1:01:53] it's a spirit it's a celestial spirit
[1:01:55] it's right here but this is the element
[1:01:57] eyes cannot see it so we call it spirit
[1:02:01] it's not alienated from you is you amen
[1:02:03] but aaron god bless you
[1:02:05] amen that is who you are that is the
[1:02:08] eternal being in you that is a portion
[1:02:10] of jesus christ in you amen glory
[1:02:14] hallelujah when you say you have the
[1:02:15] holy ghost or you have jesus christ
[1:02:17] let's say our sisters they don't have
[1:02:19] the man jesus christ 2000 years ago
[1:02:22] with beard living in in their flesh no
[1:02:26] but the christ amen
[1:02:28] the elohim
[1:02:29] the almighty god the people of fire that
[1:02:32] was in jesus the flesh the symbol of
[1:02:35] fire is sitting in sister virginia amen
[1:02:38] a sitting sister with sin glory
[1:02:40] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:02:42] lord so he is in you in the form of
[1:02:45] brethren amen not in the flesh of jesus
[1:02:48] christ two thousand years ago that flesh
[1:02:50] finished his job
[1:02:52] and now he's got another flesh called
[1:02:53] but again and that is the flesh is
[1:02:55] dwelling in blessed be the name of the
[1:02:57] lord jesus christ amen so the lord knew
[1:03:01] you he knows you and he will ever know
[1:03:03] you it's a tenor a settled deal amen
[1:03:07] glory to the lord now let's break what
[1:03:09] is her name when you talk about the name
[1:03:11] he said i know you by your name says the
[1:03:15] lord what is a name
[1:03:17] a name is first it's a nature
[1:03:20] a name is your nature
[1:03:22] and your nature
[1:03:24] identifies you
[1:03:25] so a name is an identification
[1:03:28] if you mention
[1:03:30] brother um
[1:03:32] brother joseph
[1:03:34] his name is identifies him if you call
[1:03:36] by joseph says salinda is not going to
[1:03:39] get up we're talking about joseph
[1:03:41] because sister linda is not brother
[1:03:43] joseph sister is not a joseph so in a
[1:03:46] moralist family there's an
[1:03:48] identification
[1:03:49] but joseph has a nature his nature he
[1:03:52] wants to be a minister he loves to
[1:03:54] preach the word of god to his sisters
[1:03:56] he loves to minister he has to save he
[1:03:58] loves to serve in the house of the lord
[1:04:00] so that is his nature i don't see sister
[1:04:02] linda and abigail coming to grab the
[1:04:04] microphone when people are coming but
[1:04:06] brad joseph has got something about him
[1:04:08] that loves to do that amen
[1:04:10] she's not abigail and stalin have what
[1:04:12] they do at home so a name identifies
[1:04:15] your nature glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:04:19] a name is also an attribute
[1:04:22] it's a character
[1:04:23] it shows your characteristics
[1:04:26] a name is a ministry
[1:04:28] a name is a calling
[1:04:30] a name is a manifestation
[1:04:32] your name is an established
[1:04:34] establishment of who you are
[1:04:36] glory hallelujah your name is in fact
[1:04:38] your destiny amen
[1:04:41] and if you want to go into the
[1:04:42] scriptures when um
[1:04:44] the wives of
[1:04:45] jacob when they were pregnant
[1:04:47] they when they were bringing for their
[1:04:48] children joseph and uh
[1:04:51] benjamin and judah and isaka and rubin
[1:04:54] and what have you seen on their mothers
[1:04:57] prophesied the holy ghost move on to
[1:04:58] their mothers and they spoke their
[1:05:00] destiny into existence
[1:05:03] some of them were fishermen
[1:05:05] some of them were priesthood levi some
[1:05:07] of them were farmers some of them were
[1:05:09] different they were hunters ruben was a
[1:05:11] hunter and their mothers spoke their
[1:05:14] destiny through the holy spirit into
[1:05:16] creation before even they were expelled
[1:05:18] from the womb amen so before you were
[1:05:21] expelled from the womb before you came
[1:05:23] to the existing element the lord
[1:05:24] ordained you for who you are ordain you
[1:05:27] for a ministry ordain you for a calling
[1:05:29] ordain you for an establishment order
[1:05:31] you for a manifestation order you for
[1:05:33] blessing order you for the glory of the
[1:05:35] living christ in your life blessed be
[1:05:37] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:41] a name is also a connection
[1:05:45] glory hallelujah to your name to the
[1:05:46] name of the lord if i meet brother
[1:05:49] stephen there might be seven stephens if
[1:05:52] i mention
[1:05:53] stephen maybe all of them will look back
[1:05:55] or they realize that they don't know me
[1:05:56] no way but a brother stephen will come
[1:05:58] oh god bless you but a quick who because
[1:06:00] there's a connection between me and
[1:06:01] brother receiving
[1:06:03] does these savings may continue their
[1:06:05] way because they don't know me they have
[1:06:06] no connection with me but brother
[1:06:08] stephen has got a connection with me so
[1:06:10] if i call his name he's going to
[1:06:12] identify who i am
[1:06:14] amen so a name connects you to who you
[1:06:16] are
[1:06:17] glory hallelujah to you to the name of
[1:06:19] the lord a name is also a procession
[1:06:22] your name
[1:06:24] gives you your possession
[1:06:26] your earthly possession
[1:06:28] is all coded in your name because the
[1:06:31] name is your nature
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:34] if you are ordained to be a farmer
[1:06:36] you like to get tools to do the farming
[1:06:39] so you're going to possess a tractor and
[1:06:41] things that you're going to use for
[1:06:42] agriculture so your name and your
[1:06:44] identity will help you to identify your
[1:06:47] possession
[1:06:48] glory the name also connects family and
[1:06:51] love
[1:06:54] when a father or a mother mentions the
[1:06:55] kid's name
[1:06:56] they trust him
[1:06:58] they feel the love of god in you of the
[1:07:00] father in their lives
[1:07:02] sometimes kids will tell you that
[1:07:04] dad mom catch me because they have faith
[1:07:07] in you
[1:07:08] they love you they know you love them
[1:07:10] they can i mean four front long and a
[1:07:13] headlong and they know you're gonna
[1:07:14] catch them or backwards that catch me
[1:07:16] brother catch me and you're gonna catch
[1:07:18] them
[1:07:19] because they have trust in you
[1:07:21] the kids are not thinking about maybe
[1:07:23] i'm gonna hit my head a hard concussion
[1:07:24] no because god i trust in you
[1:07:27] how much more the living christ
[1:07:30] why can't you trust the living god
[1:07:32] regardless of circumstance
[1:07:34] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:07:37] because he knows you by name amen
[1:07:39] and no matter you might be seemed to be
[1:07:41] falling headlong he's already got his
[1:07:42] arms

[1:07:55] the lord jesus christ
[1:07:57] glory
[1:07:58] let's read one scripture just to cement
[1:08:00] the point before we move forward let's
[1:08:01] go to isaiah chapter 45.
[1:08:10] isaiah 45
[1:08:12] probably read from one to seven
[1:08:16] but now that says the lord who created
[1:08:18] thee
[1:08:19] or you o jacob

[1:08:33] you are the possession of the living
[1:08:35] christ
[1:08:36] you are the possession of eternity
[1:08:38] eternity possesses you
[1:08:40] you can't get lost
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:45] you can't go down
[1:08:47] because eternity possesses you
[1:08:49] he's got angels
[1:08:51] to hold you he's got a pill of fire in
[1:08:53] you to hear your sickness he's got the
[1:08:56] holy spirit which is the same thing
[1:08:58] to take care of you amen
[1:09:02] he said i called it by name thou art
[1:09:04] mine what an assurance when the almighty
[1:09:06] said you brother jeffrey you are mine
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:11] when thou passes through the waters
[1:09:13] he didn't say that because you are mine
[1:09:15] you are not going to get trials you're
[1:09:17] going to pass through some some deep
[1:09:18] waters amen and let's see what he said
[1:09:22] when you are passing through the trials
[1:09:23] and temptations of life thou
[1:09:25] for when thou passes through the waters
[1:09:27] i will be with thee and through the
[1:09:29] ravens they shall not overflow thee
[1:09:32] glory hallelujah the lord will not give
[1:09:34] you any trials that you can overcome
[1:09:36] whatever trust you permit in your way
[1:09:38] and my way is already overcoming the
[1:09:40] celestial dimension
[1:09:41] amen since richard god bless you you
[1:09:44] already overcome your trials you possess
[1:09:46] your inheritance amen because he called
[1:09:48] you by your name glory hallelujah
[1:09:52] when that work workers through the fire
[1:09:54] thou shall not be burned
[1:09:56] glory hallelujah
[1:09:58] do you have a history of that
[1:10:00] a measure
[1:10:03] whether the one that passed through the
[1:10:04] fire
[1:10:05] and the father could not consume them
[1:10:07] and the soldiers were consumed but they
[1:10:09] came out laughing not even one one one
[1:10:12] of their hair didn't get consumed
[1:10:14] because the lord knew them by name amen
[1:10:18] so when you are going through the fire i
[1:10:19] don't know the fire you are going
[1:10:20] through today but the lord is with you
[1:10:22] and the fire will not consume you
[1:10:24] the fire is burning certain things out
[1:10:27] of your life to bring manifestation to
[1:10:29] bring your true name your identity into
[1:10:32] reality amen
[1:10:34] when thou walkers through the fire that
[1:10:35] shall not be banned neither shall the
[1:10:37] flame kindle upon thee amen the flame of
[1:10:40] the fire is not going to consume you
[1:10:42] you know even smell the smoke on you
[1:10:45] you've gone through so many challenges
[1:10:46] and here you are rejoicing in praising
[1:10:48] the lord so what you are going through
[1:10:50] today is already overcome the lord has
[1:10:51] already done it for you blessed be the
[1:10:54] name of the lord
[1:10:55] the lord said he knows you

[1:11:01] bro morales what is your name
[1:11:05] god bless you go to revelation
[1:11:07] your name is jesus christ amen god bless
[1:11:10] you let's go for what i would say
[1:11:16] exactly your name is jesus christ your
[1:11:18] sister element is jose morales by your
[1:11:21] name your nature your identity your
[1:11:24] manifestation is jesus christ amen glory
[1:11:27] this is the element might be called
[1:11:29] cocoa organelle faith brother jagdaf
[1:11:32] but your name
[1:11:33] is jesus christ amen because he that is
[1:11:36] it lives in you
[1:11:38] jesus christ in you or the pull of fire
[1:11:40] in you is greater than josue morales
[1:11:43] muslim moralists may not be able to
[1:11:44] overcome everything whose morality has
[1:11:47] limitation coco has limitations but
[1:11:50] jesus christ in me in you does not have
[1:11:52] any limitation glory hallelujah remember
[1:11:55] when jesus got to the cross and the
[1:11:57] cross was heavy for him and he wanted to
[1:11:59] back off
[1:12:01] the christ in him overcame for jesus
[1:12:04] and the christ in you has already
[1:12:05] overcome for you
[1:12:08] glory be to the lord
[1:12:13] let's look at
[1:12:14] for the love that he has for you the
[1:12:16] lord identifies you let's look at some
[1:12:18] identification here
[1:12:21] i wanted to read
[1:12:22] a quote
[1:12:24] from the prophet message
[1:12:26] let's read uh says we will see jesus
[1:12:30] 61-1224
[1:12:33] 61-1224 says we will see jesus
[1:12:36] paragraph 34
[1:12:38] let's see how the lord identifies you
[1:12:42] witnesses about you amen that you are
[1:12:45] his
[1:12:46] you look look at the jet plane if you
[1:12:47] look at the jet plane every jet plane
[1:12:49] has got
[1:12:50] two wings
[1:12:52] left wing
[1:12:53] and the right wing
[1:12:55] but the body itself is the plane that
[1:12:57] people sit in and where they put the
[1:12:58] luggage you don't put the luggage on the
[1:13:00] wings
[1:13:01] you don't see the people on the wings
[1:13:03] you see the people in the plane the
[1:13:05] winds are forward for balancing
[1:13:07] and control and to keep equilibrium amen
[1:13:11] now the scriptures
[1:13:13] identifies you
[1:13:14] and they give a witness of who you are
[1:13:16] amen the scriptures are for your balance
[1:13:19] and the first testament and the second
[1:13:21] testament are for your balancing now two
[1:13:24] is that one is the number of omnipotence
[1:13:27] almighty with the attribute in him
[1:13:28] without expression
[1:13:30] two is a number of multiplication a man
[1:13:32] marries a wife to multiply himself
[1:13:35] now three is the number of what
[1:13:37] perfection
[1:13:38] when you marry what is the next thing
[1:13:40] you got children that is the perfection
[1:13:42] of the marriage amen so the lord
[1:13:45] preferred himself in certain testament
[1:13:47] so let's look at
[1:13:49] other scriptures sorry ada quotation
[1:13:52] 6 1
[1:13:53] 1 2 2 4 6 we will see jesus paragraph
[1:13:56] 34.
[1:14:00] maybe as they are looking for it okay
[1:14:03] we've got it now glory hallelujah now
[1:14:05] when i see the scripture the prophet
[1:14:07] read when i see what those men and women
[1:14:10] went through
[1:14:12] with back there and see to maintain
[1:14:14] this same gospel so the gospel has to be
[1:14:16] maintained
[1:14:18] by who you
[1:14:20] amen sometimes we put the whole thing on
[1:14:22] the lord
[1:14:23] but the lord wants you to maintain the
[1:14:25] gospel
[1:14:27] amen because he's hiding in you
[1:14:30] remember moses that was that moses was
[1:14:32] looking up to the lord and the lord was
[1:14:33] looking up to moses one moses was in
[1:14:36] front of the red sea
[1:14:37] and moses
[1:14:39] couldn't move forward
[1:14:41] moses was crying
[1:14:42] with two two million people behind him
[1:14:44] moses was crying to the lord and the
[1:14:46] lord led moses to moses i am you
[1:14:50] amen you are jesus christ moses had a
[1:14:52] lot of amnesia because when the lord
[1:14:54] called him he said i've made you what
[1:14:56] god
[1:14:58] moses began to give excuses that i
[1:15:00] cannot speak i'm a stamina i killed i've
[1:15:02] got criminal records in egypt i can't go
[1:15:04] back to egypt the law said don't worry
[1:15:07] if you can't speak your brother aaron
[1:15:08] will be your prophet prophet
[1:15:10] spokesperson
[1:15:12] by you i've made you the almighty god
[1:15:14] because i'm going to put my foot in your
[1:15:16] foot
[1:15:17] put my hands in your hands put my lips
[1:15:20] in your lips and i the almighty will
[1:15:23] speak through you
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:25] and whatever i place myself in there's a
[1:15:28] quickening there's a resurrection
[1:15:30] you become who i am amen
[1:15:33] glory hallelujah it's just like even
[1:15:35] your clothes when you wear your clothes
[1:15:37] it becomes part of you
[1:15:39] as long as it takes your sheep it takes
[1:15:41] your form and as long as you wear your
[1:15:43] clothes you can lift your hands
[1:15:45] the clue doesn't have any excuse they
[1:15:46] have to leave their hands
[1:15:48] if you put your hands down they bring
[1:15:50] their hands down because the clothes
[1:15:52] have become part of you
[1:15:53] and when the almighty put his flesh in
[1:15:55] you he's speeding you you become the
[1:15:58] almighty
[1:16:00] and nothing can touch you or terminate
[1:16:02] you until the almighty has finished with
[1:16:03] this element
[1:16:05] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:16:07] so the lord has put in you to maintain
[1:16:10] the gospel of jesus christ and let's see
[1:16:12] how the old testament sins and the new
[1:16:14] testament maintain the gospel is that
[1:16:16] and when
[1:16:18] to maintain the same gospel and when
[1:16:20] they preach this same gospel the same
[1:16:22] thing that happened in the old testament
[1:16:24] new testament and then just exactly the
[1:16:26] same
[1:16:27] so that it gives it one
[1:16:30] two three witnesses amen god perfect
[1:16:34] things with three witnesses every word
[1:16:36] is established the same god that dealt
[1:16:39] with the old prophets he's talking about
[1:16:41] the old testament prophet
[1:16:43] dealt with the apostles does the new
[1:16:44] testament a prophet it's just this
[1:16:47] different title the same sort of christ
[1:16:49] was in them they were prophet
[1:16:51] brother brother smiley is a prophet but
[1:16:53] a jack is a prophet
[1:16:54] we use the term pastor apostles deacons
[1:16:57] by the same jesus christ is in you the
[1:16:59] seasons are prophetess amen so
[1:17:04] he said every word is established the
[1:17:05] same god that that dealt with the old
[1:17:07] prophet dealt with the apostles and
[1:17:09] dealt with their prenuncing brethren
[1:17:11] okay now we're going to the third phase
[1:17:13] and here and here he is today dealing
[1:17:15] with the same way with his people with
[1:17:18] the same signs same wonders same gospel
[1:17:21] same power same god everything we three
[1:17:25] as a witness to us that this is the
[1:17:28] truth we don't want that we don't try to
[1:17:29] figure out what is the truth it is the
[1:17:31] truth amen
[1:17:32] if you are already not forget it out
[1:17:34] then you have to figure out today that
[1:17:35] the message that the lord send it to you
[1:17:37] through the seventh angel message is the
[1:17:39] truth of the gospel for this day amen
[1:17:43] glory hallelujah
[1:17:44] this is a true god giving it in three
[1:17:47] testaments wow we thought we had to only
[1:17:49] two testaments
[1:17:50] but the prophecy that in three
[1:17:52] testaments so we're gonna find out what
[1:17:54] those three testaments are see the
[1:17:56] history 36 the bible is the history of
[1:17:59] what god was
[1:18:01] so was the history so the history of the
[1:18:03] old testament the new testament is the
[1:18:05] history of the new testament so the new
[1:18:07] testament is a history
[1:18:08] it's already been sealed up
[1:18:10] so where are we now we're gonna find out
[1:18:12] amen because from adam
[1:18:15] up to jesus
[1:18:16] that was the old testament
[1:18:18] that was the law
[1:18:20] and they were sealed now jesus began
[1:18:22] grace
[1:18:23] and grace is another testament another
[1:18:26] witness after a certain point and
[1:18:28] something has took over so let's finish
[1:18:30] with the quotes and we come to that
[1:18:32] the new testament is the history of the
[1:18:33] new testament
[1:18:35] and the 19 council and the fathers and
[1:18:38] post
[1:18:38] 19 council is the history of the church
[1:18:41] then
[1:18:42] verse 39 and now
[1:18:45] now spanish will say ahora now
[1:18:47] now history is making on just as it was
[1:18:51] which this history will never be written
[1:18:54] no it's too close
[1:18:55] to to the coming now amen so now
[1:18:59] your life is making a history
[1:19:01] you are telling a story your name is
[1:19:04] identifying your ministry you are
[1:19:06] bringing forth a manifestation
[1:19:08] you are unveiling christ to the world
[1:19:10] but it's going to be too fast and
[1:19:12] there's no time to write that history
[1:19:14] amen it's a present tense
[1:19:17] uh word made for the day
[1:19:19] so the old testament from adam up to
[1:19:23] let's see jesus that was the old
[1:19:25] testament and that encompasses mainly
[1:19:28] the law of god even within the law the
[1:19:30] law should grace
[1:19:31] remember the lord the lord give the lord
[1:19:34] to adam that that shall not touch the
[1:19:36] tree in the midst of the garden that was
[1:19:37] hello if you touch it the very day you
[1:19:39] touch it you will die
[1:19:41] and that was a law and when other men
[1:19:43] touch it they died in the flesh
[1:19:46] but adam couldn't die because he is an
[1:19:48] eternal being amen
[1:19:50] just like jesus he died in the flesh but
[1:19:52] almighty god could not die he died only
[1:19:55] to manifest redemption but the people of
[1:19:57] fire cannot die amen so when you die in
[1:20:01] the flesh you are not dead you still
[1:20:02] walking in the dimension right here it's
[1:20:04] only the flesh that goes back to the
[1:20:06] flesh
[1:20:06] so now in the old testament even in the
[1:20:08] midst of the law
[1:20:10] the lord was dealing with grace
[1:20:12] with father abraham the lord gave an
[1:20:14] unconditional covenant to abraham with
[1:20:16] abraham he made a bunch of mistakes
[1:20:19] horrible mistakes but the grace of the
[1:20:21] lord was with father abraham he was
[1:20:23] still the father of faith and a man of
[1:20:25] faith with our mother sarah amen
[1:20:28] and the law was a policeman
[1:20:30] when you break the law the cops will get
[1:20:32] you
[1:20:33] if the law says that
[1:20:35] 60 60 miles per hour limit on this
[1:20:38] street or road and you go 90 the cops
[1:20:41] will get you and give you a ticket you
[1:20:42] go to the court and go and tell the
[1:20:44] judge why we're making 90 on on 60
[1:20:47] amen and that is the law
[1:20:50] so when you get the law you breathe
[1:20:51] along
[1:20:52] the law the police the enforcer will
[1:20:55] make sure that the law is respected the
[1:20:57] law will arrest you and after whatever
[1:20:59] consequence the law says you have to pay
[1:21:00] that punishment amen so that was the
[1:21:04] first testament and the first attribute
[1:21:06] of great elohim bringing his law into
[1:21:09] creation
[1:21:10] and so he ran the law and the police
[1:21:12] were catching people people were that
[1:21:13] people even died for for just breaking a
[1:21:16] little piece of the law of god sabbath
[1:21:19] picking up sticks
[1:21:21] which is nothing at this time you can go
[1:21:23] to the woods and pick sticks nothing
[1:21:25] will happen to you
[1:21:26] and last night i picked a stick i'll
[1:21:28] tell you a funny story that happened to
[1:21:29] me last night i was going to pray in the
[1:21:31] night and and sometimes i do exercise so
[1:21:34] i saw this raccoon and i see them all
[1:21:35] the time around the lake they do their
[1:21:37] own thing and i do my own thing so i was
[1:21:39] doing my exercise and one of them was on
[1:21:41] the tree he would drop down and he
[1:21:42] pretend like he's coming to me and i'll
[1:21:44] shout and he goes back to the tree and
[1:21:46] then he'll get up again and it's like
[1:21:48] we're playing games so it was this funny
[1:21:49] game he pretended like he
[1:21:52] he as if he's coming to me and i say hey
[1:21:53] go back go back and he goes back go and
[1:21:55] climb the tree and come back
[1:21:57] so one of the time he was really i don't
[1:21:58] know whether he was he wanted to be
[1:21:59] friendly
[1:22:00] so he was really coming to me like and i
[1:22:03] said i'm not ready for racoon this night
[1:22:07] [Laughter]
[1:22:09] so
[1:22:10] so go back and this time he wasn't going
[1:22:12] but he was coming so i took off one of
[1:22:14] my sneakers and threw it at a raccoon
[1:22:17] and he picked up sneakers and took it to
[1:22:19] the woods
[1:22:23] [Applause]
[1:22:26] i said what is this
[1:22:27] [Laughter]
[1:22:30] so he took my snicker to the raccoon i
[1:22:33] had only one snickers on and i said well
[1:22:35] let's just go take my i had myself
[1:22:36] wearing my kill him take my cell phone
[1:22:38] and key and go go home before he takes
[1:22:39] my cell phone
[1:22:42] and my keys
[1:22:44] so i went home no i took my i tried to
[1:22:47] figure out i went to get a stick and i
[1:22:48] saw some of them i threw the stick he
[1:22:50] wasn't even minding me i couldn't find a
[1:22:52] snakehead so i went home with i took off
[1:22:54] with snickers and i said you know what
[1:22:55] when adam was created it wasn't my issue
[1:22:57] let me just exercise around with my bare
[1:22:59] foot
[1:23:00] [Laughter]
[1:23:03] so i went home
[1:23:04] without one of my sneakers
[1:23:06] and i said lord i don't know what this
[1:23:08] game is about
[1:23:12] so this morning i got up and i went
[1:23:14] looking around and i saw the shoe in the
[1:23:18] woods know that's a law
[1:23:21] and i said
[1:23:22] was he supposed to be scared of the
[1:23:23] raccoon
[1:23:24] he wanted to be friendly with me
[1:23:26] but we've got complexes in our minds
[1:23:29] i remember when i got here people told
[1:23:30] me raccoons can attack
[1:23:33] i'm not i'm not the person who's really
[1:23:34] afraid of animals but i have that
[1:23:36] complex in my mind that maybe he was
[1:23:38] going to attack me
[1:23:39] but maybe the raccoon wasn't going to
[1:23:40] attack me he just wanted to be friendly
[1:23:43] but the fear in my mind caused me to
[1:23:44] remove my shoe and i had my shoe in the
[1:23:47] woods
[1:23:51] so that was it another testament to see
[1:23:53] one side of me that lord i need to have
[1:23:56] more love i need to have more faith i
[1:23:58] need to have more tenderness for
[1:24:00] creation because the raccoon wasn't
[1:24:02] going to attack me it was just to be
[1:24:04] have fun with me but i had complex in my
[1:24:06] mind
[1:24:07] so let's look at another attribute of
[1:24:09] grace
[1:24:11] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:24:16] and one time william brown had had
[1:24:18] similar problems he saw a uh what was
[1:24:21] the name
[1:24:21] killer boo
[1:24:23] and this bull was actually charging on
[1:24:24] him
[1:24:25] and he i mean tried to get his raffle
[1:24:28] there was no gun
[1:24:29] and then he had no choice but to now
[1:24:32] allow the other attribute
[1:24:35] the law was in the lowest kill it
[1:24:37] because he's going to attack you
[1:24:39] but then grace and love came in
[1:24:41] and when love came in
[1:24:43] he was able to speak to the right to
[1:24:45] today today to the killer boo the killer
[1:24:48] i'm not here to disturb you i know this
[1:24:49] your ground is your house i'm just going
[1:24:51] to pray for a brother or sister of mine
[1:24:54] go back to where you live
[1:24:55] and the killer went back to where he was
[1:24:57] sitting amen and the more love we have
[1:25:00] the more we create we control the
[1:25:02] elements of creation because the lord
[1:25:04] created you toward to be the god of
[1:25:06] creation
[1:25:07] not to be the fear of creation
[1:25:10] he created you to speak to creation
[1:25:12] because creation is under you you are
[1:25:14] the god of creation you are the god on
[1:25:17] this earth god is ruling through your
[1:25:19] members amen and you can take our
[1:25:21] accomplices
[1:25:22] and what we see with our eyes what we
[1:25:25] hear what we taste what we smell and
[1:25:27] allow the sixth sense
[1:25:29] which is faith and allow the eleventh
[1:25:31] commandment which is love to manifest we
[1:25:35] can walk where there's a lion because
[1:25:37] you've got a love for the lion and the
[1:25:39] lion can feel the love you have for him
[1:25:40] and the lion will not do no harm amen
[1:25:43] you can walk through situations which
[1:25:45] people will run away from it and you go
[1:25:47] and bring the victory out of that
[1:25:48] situation
[1:25:50] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:25:52] so the lord has this three testament
[1:25:55] a law which ran its call from adam to
[1:25:57] jesus
[1:25:58] then when jesus came in he opened
[1:26:00] another testament which is what grace
[1:26:04] asked by the judge preached uh two weeks
[1:26:06] ago that grace is jesus christ himself
[1:26:09] amen grace is a person and who is that
[1:26:12] person is the person of jesus christ
[1:26:14] glory hallelujah
[1:26:16] but a smiley preacher was the last week
[1:26:18] about jesus christ makes the difference
[1:26:20] or bring the changes amen
[1:26:22] jesus christ is the one that can bring
[1:26:24] grace when the police arrest you jesus
[1:26:27] christ can pay the ticket jesus christ
[1:26:29] can wash away the crime jesus christ can
[1:26:32] take care of of the law that you broke
[1:26:34] and bring grace into your life
[1:26:36] glory hallelujah to the lord so jesus or
[1:26:40] grace is the attorney the defense
[1:26:42] attorney he's a lawyer that takes care
[1:26:44] of your situation because when you break
[1:26:46] the law the police arrest you handcuff
[1:26:48] you you're going to jail you need to get
[1:26:50] what the best lawyer you can get and who
[1:26:52] is the best lawyer than jesus christ
[1:26:54] himself
[1:26:55] he comes here and said i'm the lord i'm
[1:26:56] the lawyer i'm defending uh bradgarin
[1:26:59] and he'll take care of you stand in your
[1:27:02] place yes you committed a crime you run
[1:27:04] 90 on 60. so you deserve to get maybe
[1:27:07] paid 200 to the state of florida but i'm
[1:27:10] the lawyer i'm thinking of the situation
[1:27:12] and he's he's behind me i put him behind
[1:27:15] me the lord the grace of god covers you
[1:27:18] the blood of jesus christ wash away all
[1:27:20] your sins
[1:27:21] you did commit a crime but the grace of
[1:27:23] god the holy spirit wash and cleanses
[1:27:25] your sin and you come out come out as
[1:27:27] white as known
[1:27:28] so from jesus when the lord broke the
[1:27:30] covenant of greece he opened it unto
[1:27:33] paul
[1:27:34] let me even go back to moses moses the
[1:27:36] one was there was the epitome of of law
[1:27:39] is that right
[1:27:40] the lord didn't start from moses it
[1:27:41] start from adam but moses was given
[1:27:43] special eyes to see to write the book of
[1:27:46] genesis in the beginning was
[1:27:48] god created the heaven and the earth and
[1:27:50] there was adam and there was his wife
[1:27:52] and there was mrs adam and they were at
[1:27:54] the animals but moses himself was a
[1:27:57] criminal
[1:27:59] what crime he was a murderer
[1:28:02] he killed somebody in egypt
[1:28:03] the one who was the greatest enforcer of
[1:28:05] the law
[1:28:06] the prophet of god was a killer
[1:28:09] am i right
[1:28:11] so he broke the law himself before he
[1:28:12] started living
[1:28:13] doing the job amen
[1:28:15] and the lord was telling us something
[1:28:17] and now paul
[1:28:19] moses actually did kill an egyptian
[1:28:21] physically
[1:28:23] when he saw an egyptian and a jewish guy
[1:28:25] fighting he stood for the jewish guy and
[1:28:27] he killed the egypt and he demanded a
[1:28:29] son
[1:28:30] but his sins were what were uncovered by
[1:28:32] the grace of god so was using him amen
[1:28:36] now paul paul was also a criminal what
[1:28:38] crimes he did commit he said he killed
[1:28:41] paul didn't kill physically but he
[1:28:43] killed by aiding and albertan
[1:28:46] eating an albertan is if i say let's say
[1:28:48] brother nehemiah go kill somebody
[1:28:51] it wasn't my hands physically that
[1:28:53] killed the person but then i was the one
[1:28:55] aiding an albertan
[1:28:57] for him to kill so paul was the one
[1:28:59] killed by eden and albertan but he was
[1:29:01] still a criminal so paul said that i'm
[1:29:03] not even worthy to be called an apostle
[1:29:06] because the blood of the sins were on my
[1:29:08] hands he partook
[1:29:10] through eden albertans by killing the
[1:29:12] saints
[1:29:13] but then the grace of god was more than
[1:29:15] sufficient for paul
[1:29:17] so now we see grace coming in now
[1:29:19] there's another law so the grace
[1:29:21] throughout the seven churches ran its
[1:29:23] course from jesus christ who opened that
[1:29:25] covenant gave it to apostle paul and he
[1:29:28] ran from sminer pergamos up to the
[1:29:30] seventh church age then the lord brought
[1:29:32] in
[1:29:33] another covenant the covenant of love
[1:29:36] that is perfection amen
[1:29:39] if you look at jet plane
[1:29:41] like i said it's got two wings the left
[1:29:42] wing and the right wing
[1:29:44] they are for balancing but the most
[1:29:46] important part is the body of the plane
[1:29:48] itself that is where lives are kept
[1:29:51] that's where human beings are kept
[1:29:53] that's where luggages are kept you don't
[1:29:55] put your luggage on the wings
[1:29:56] you don't put human beings on the wings
[1:29:58] you don't tell humans to hold their
[1:30:00] wings we are flying from
[1:30:02] amsterdam to miami so hold on wings and
[1:30:05] we're going to get to uh miami safely
[1:30:07] it's not going to happen
[1:30:10] because it's not meant for humans to be
[1:30:11] on their wings it's just to balance the
[1:30:14] plane amen where human being life is
[1:30:17] what is the body of the plane so the
[1:30:19] third testament is where we dwell
[1:30:22] love sorry law and grace was to balance
[1:30:26] love
[1:30:27] amen the love of christ manifested the
[1:30:30] law of god
[1:30:32] and it manifested grace to keep the
[1:30:34] balance you commit a crime but the grace
[1:30:36] of god is sufficient for you
[1:30:39] because of what his love for you
[1:30:42] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:30:44] so love is the what is the judge
[1:30:48] now in the court of law the police will
[1:30:50] come and
[1:30:50] recite your crime
[1:30:52] i saw
[1:30:54] jeremiah breaking the running 90
[1:30:58] i saw koku breaking into this house
[1:31:01] i've got evidence
[1:31:03] with a camera with a video yes
[1:31:06] did you break into the house yes i broke
[1:31:07] into the house what were you trying to
[1:31:09] do i'm good i was going to steal a car
[1:31:11] so you've got a crime right there but
[1:31:13] then you've got a lawyer which is greece
[1:31:15] but then when the judge comes in
[1:31:17] he looks at the police he look at
[1:31:20] the lawyer he take his hammer he's close
[1:31:24] it's a foolish case he's forgiven
[1:31:26] he didn't even commit a crime
[1:31:28] but you have evidence that they
[1:31:30] committed a crime
[1:31:31] the judge has got the financier
[1:31:33] the judge doesn't even need the the
[1:31:35] lawyer to defend you
[1:31:36] the judge is that your sins which were
[1:31:39] red crimson uh read as as as read could
[1:31:43] be your sins are all wiped off
[1:31:46] and his grace and his love
[1:31:48] has forgiven you you are spotless you
[1:31:51] are sinless daughter and son of the
[1:31:54] living god go and manifest jesus christ
[1:31:57] amen
[1:31:58] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:32:00] let's take another example from birth
[1:32:03] natural breath
[1:32:04] when a child is born
[1:32:06] before a child is born when anyone is
[1:32:07] pregnant for nine months what is the
[1:32:08] first thing comes from the
[1:32:10] womb of the woman water
[1:32:13] what is the water for
[1:32:15] it's a balancing it's a sign that a
[1:32:18] child is coming
[1:32:19] now when the water comes what else comes
[1:32:22] blood
[1:32:23] blood is als another weakness blood is
[1:32:26] stronger than water
[1:32:27] water is the first pool
[1:32:29] there's life coming but the mother is
[1:32:31] not expecting water
[1:32:33] he's not going to carry the water that
[1:32:34] broke from a womb and said oh god bless
[1:32:36] you bye sweetheart i've got the water
[1:32:38] for you that's not what your husband is
[1:32:40] looking for that's what the family is
[1:32:42] looking for
[1:32:43] they want to see what life
[1:32:45] they want to see a being they want to
[1:32:47] see a body
[1:32:49] your husband and your family are not
[1:32:51] going to rejoice because you brought
[1:32:52] water broke from your womb oh mom i've
[1:32:54] got this water from my womb that's not a
[1:32:57] child no that's not your baby
[1:32:59] that's just a water
[1:33:01] that was a witness that life was coming
[1:33:03] so the life the
[1:33:05] the the water comes first the blood
[1:33:07] comes face then what comes the third
[1:33:09] pool
[1:33:10] now a baby a live girl a live boy a twin
[1:33:14] whatever draws from your womb
[1:33:16] and there's a quickening power there's a
[1:33:17] voice the baby begin to cry and god
[1:33:20] glory hallelujah there's life
[1:33:22] i've got my daughter i've got my son
[1:33:25] i've got a grandson i've got a nephew
[1:33:26] i've got whatever you have then the
[1:33:28] family begin to rejoice they put their
[1:33:30] baby on on the tummy of their mother now
[1:33:32] begin to bond you begin to identify
[1:33:35] you're going to possess is we're going
[1:33:37] to establish because it's a name amen
[1:33:40] your name you knew that baby by name
[1:33:42] amen when woman is pregnant they buy
[1:33:45] stuff before the baby is born
[1:33:47] they even choose a name for the baby the
[1:33:50] mother choose a name whatever you want
[1:33:51] to call the name
[1:33:53] i don't want to i don't understand that
[1:33:54] you want to tell us something god bless
[1:33:56] you
[1:33:57] you choose a name for the baby right
[1:33:59] now the baby doesn't know that he's got
[1:34:01] a name the baby is just a it's just a
[1:34:03] muscles
[1:34:04] one is in the mother's womb he doesn't
[1:34:06] know what's going on she doesn't know
[1:34:08] what's going on but the mother and the
[1:34:09] father
[1:34:10] knew the baby or knows the baby by name
[1:34:13] amen
[1:34:14] the baby just kicking in their mother's
[1:34:16] womb he doesn't and he's just feeding on
[1:34:18] their mother but he doesn't know
[1:34:19] he doesn't even have a spirit until the
[1:34:22] baby is born then the spirit the lord
[1:34:24] says move into the baby and the baby
[1:34:26] christ then they begin to begin to with
[1:34:29] time not even the first day going to see
[1:34:31] her mother so now when babies are born
[1:34:33] their eyes look at one direction
[1:34:35] they don't see even if you are looking
[1:34:36] their face they don't see a time comes
[1:34:38] they begin to identify their mother and
[1:34:40] their father and they begin to smile
[1:34:43] amen now now they are beginning to
[1:34:45] recognize who they are
[1:34:47] glory hallelujah
[1:34:49] and you and i are on the same platform
[1:34:51] just like the queen of shiva we were in
[1:34:53] adult worshiping but we heard about
[1:34:55] salomon the greatest king of the land
[1:34:58] and there was something that was craving
[1:35:00] to hear from solomon
[1:35:01] and then when we got to salomon we threw
[1:35:04] all our idol worshipping our way and we
[1:35:06] had to learn things from the kingdom of
[1:35:08] solomon in the kingdom of someone they
[1:35:10] sink they blew trumpet they were holy
[1:35:13] they were righteousness they were
[1:35:14] walking after the ordinances of solomon
[1:35:17] but greater than solomon is here
[1:35:19] the lord jesus christ himself is here
[1:35:21] and the lord jesus christ has got
[1:35:23] ordinances
[1:35:24] and he's got a concept and it's got
[1:35:26] revelation it's got manifestation and
[1:35:29] attribute for you and i to learn and
[1:35:31] manifest amen said that you will not run
[1:35:34] away from raccoon you know give your
[1:35:36] shoes to raccoon
[1:35:38] that attribute is love amen what you can
[1:35:41] overcome yourself you will come this guy
[1:35:43] here and you move by the pill of fire in
[1:35:45] you that i'm a son of god i don't care
[1:35:48] the river surrounding me i don't get the
[1:35:50] situation around when i speak creation
[1:35:53] obey me
[1:35:54] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be
[1:35:57] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:35:59] he is worthy of our praise amen
[1:36:04] i feel so much energy here in this
[1:36:06] school
[1:36:09] when i was going i knew somehow i didn't
[1:36:11] know we were going to come to school but
[1:36:12] by revelation i know that i won't come
[1:36:14] back to the same
[1:36:15] the same place
[1:36:17] i wanted to talk about jack when i say
[1:36:19] you know what let me just leave it
[1:36:21] but i knew i won't come back to the same
[1:36:22] place so i look at the place
[1:36:25] and i enjoy it for the last time
[1:36:27] and i knew so i wasn't surprised when
[1:36:29] when i came in the place has changed
[1:36:31] and i feel so much energy here
[1:36:34] do you know that the energy in the
[1:36:35] system the lord put energy by creation
[1:36:38] in places
[1:36:40] even in a job place when you go to a
[1:36:41] place on the street restaurant
[1:36:43] sometime when you're going there's
[1:36:45] crowded
[1:36:46] you feel a little bit stressful
[1:36:49] sometimes you go to certain places you
[1:36:51] have a little bit of depression
[1:36:53] because the energy there some people
[1:36:55] emit negative energies
[1:36:58] and the energy is being shared by other
[1:36:59] people but when you go to let's say a
[1:37:01] restaurant places where they feel people
[1:37:04] and you could see their spirit you can
[1:37:06] respirate you feel like
[1:37:09] you are more at ease
[1:37:11] there's more energy for you but where
[1:37:13] this crowd where there's a lot of people
[1:37:16] around no stampede your spirit doesn't
[1:37:18] rest over there
[1:37:20] and i could see for me
[1:37:22] i rest more he
[1:37:23] might feel like my spirit feels more
[1:37:25] attitude is here
[1:37:27] then we enjoy the class at the the
[1:37:29] church over there
[1:37:30] but here is more relaxing and the lord
[1:37:32] will take us where he wants to take us
[1:37:34] amen
[1:37:42] so we don't worry about
[1:37:44] the name because it's a middle school
[1:37:46] we look at what the lord is doing
[1:37:49] we don't worry about classroom no
[1:37:51] there's more energy here you're more
[1:37:53] free here you don't have other churches
[1:37:55] and noise
[1:37:56] and preaching and singing coming in here
[1:37:59] when you you can
[1:38:01] chat over after service there's more
[1:38:03] energy
[1:38:04] there's more there's no competition we
[1:38:05] don't have to disturb nobody there's
[1:38:07] more energy and the lord knows where
[1:38:08] it's taking us to amen
[1:38:10] so the lord moves from glory on to glory
[1:38:13] from experience onto experience and
[1:38:15] enjoy whatever the lord gives you
[1:38:18] we are more blessed amen
[1:38:20] i don't want to divide into into but
[1:38:23] i'll tell a testimony in africa when i
[1:38:25] started my church in ghana we sat in a
[1:38:27] classroom
[1:38:28] and then we moved into we had a piece of
[1:38:31] land but the land wasn't developed
[1:38:33] so we put in you know bamboo probably
[1:38:35] some of you don't know bamboo
[1:38:37] but we put bamboo and we put leaves palm
[1:38:40] leaves
[1:38:41] not a aluminium sheet no no roof palm
[1:38:44] leaf on it
[1:38:45] and i told my people that we are going
[1:38:46] to our land and said no how can we go
[1:38:49] why we've not developed the land i said
[1:38:50] no let's go because there's so much
[1:38:52] disturbances in the classroom when we
[1:38:54] moved there there was so much energy
[1:38:55] we're so much at peace because it was
[1:38:58] our own possession
[1:39:00] and then we move into wooden structure
[1:39:03] we put a wooden structure and put
[1:39:05] aluminium roofs on top
[1:39:07] that was what the maybe the second pool
[1:39:09] if i should call it the second pool
[1:39:11] then we move into concrete
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:15] so the lord moves from greece unto unto
[1:39:16] greece unto greece amen or from grass
[1:39:19] onto greece
[1:39:20] i remember when we were in london that's
[1:39:22] when we started building putting on
[1:39:23] burden structures concrete so the lord
[1:39:25] knows what he's doing he wanted to
[1:39:27] appreciate each step
[1:39:29] the lord was the possession was was the
[1:39:31] author and epitome of love
[1:39:34] but when he created adam
[1:39:36] his love was there already but he gave
[1:39:38] adam law to keep
[1:39:41] amen and the lord was good in his time
[1:39:44] and the lord moved him to grace
[1:39:46] and moving to perfect love
[1:39:48] amen so the lord moved us from uh
[1:39:51] the cl
[1:39:52] the church from where we were it was
[1:39:53] great we enjoyed it the lord did
[1:39:55] manifestation here is more greater amen
[1:39:59] and a lot of moves to where he wants us
[1:40:00] to be amen
[1:40:03] so so don't don't don't remember and
[1:40:06] mourn that oh why are we in the
[1:40:07] classroom rejoice dance and praise the
[1:40:09] lord glory hallelujah rejoice and just
[1:40:12] serve the lord be happy amen
[1:40:15] it's not the room that matters it's our
[1:40:16] harder matters
[1:40:18] it's the holy ghost in you that matters
[1:40:20] amen
[1:40:21] so rejoice and and let's give our pastor
[1:40:23] all the support that we can give and the
[1:40:26] lord knows what he's doing amen
[1:40:28] it's not it's not easy to be a leader
[1:40:31] it's not easy at all to be a leader when
[1:40:33] you're a leader you've got thousand
[1:40:34] things on the mind this to fix this to
[1:40:36] face it is the grace of god and the love
[1:40:38] of christ amen and when we give support
[1:40:40] to our leaders then the blessings of the
[1:40:42] lord will flow when we mama like the
[1:40:44] people of moses then we stay behind we
[1:40:47] stay in egypt for too long amen so let's
[1:40:50] rejoice and be happy and give our leader
[1:40:52] all the support
[1:40:54] and everything will line up amen and
[1:40:56] whenever the lord wants us to live here
[1:40:57] the lord will make it happen glory so
[1:40:59] keep praying let's keep praying and keep
[1:41:01] rejoicing and keep doing what you're
[1:41:03] doing the lord has already been set up
[1:41:04] for us
[1:41:06] glory hallelujah
[1:41:08] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:41:10] christ
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:12] god bless you by the job for what you're
[1:41:14] doing it's not easy to be a pastor
[1:41:17] but a smiley can give us he's a witness
[1:41:19] a man it's not easy to lead people
[1:41:22] it's not even easy to lead animals
[1:41:24] that's why people certain people don't
[1:41:25] like human beings they rather adopt a
[1:41:28] dog and a cat
[1:41:30] because the dog and a cat is he has a
[1:41:32] wall but his will is can easily be
[1:41:33] controlled but for human beings
[1:41:36] psychologists call it homo
[1:41:38] they have a theory called homo
[1:41:40] mechanicals and homo dynamicals it's not
[1:41:42] big
[1:41:43] mechanical like a microphone is a
[1:41:45] mechanical object you can do whatever i
[1:41:47] want to do it cannot object to that but
[1:41:49] then when it comes to himalayan brother
[1:41:50] joseph
[1:41:52] maybe the mother wants to feed him with
[1:41:53] plant food
[1:41:55] but he might say
[1:41:56] mom i don't want plant food maybe i want
[1:41:58] to eat meat
[1:42:00] [Laughter]
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:05] [Laughter]
[1:42:14] and so
[1:42:16] and so stamana has to work hard
[1:42:18] to make sure but i just even plant food
[1:42:21] and i know my mother was sweet
[1:42:25] because he's not a mechanical being but
[1:42:28] i would say can i talk about you a
[1:42:29] little bit just to emphasize something
[1:42:31] i remember one time but someone that
[1:42:33] told me but jose told me oh my wife is
[1:42:35] putting me on plant food for one week so
[1:42:37] he did it and after the sweet text me
[1:42:38] said luke tell your sister and put a
[1:42:40] weekend
[1:42:44] he said tell your twins and puerto rican
[1:42:46] i'm not going to stop eating pork
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:53] i think someone doesn't
[1:42:56] he said i'm not going to stop eating
[1:42:58] pork and i was we're laughing and
[1:42:59] laughing then after a while i said i
[1:43:01] think i think i'm going to i'm going to
[1:43:03] i'm going to i'm going to do what mandy
[1:43:04] told me i'm going to be on plant food
[1:43:06] you see human being is not a mechanical
[1:43:08] being you have to work hard
[1:43:11] he might not understand the vision he
[1:43:12] might object to it but you'll be patient
[1:43:15] be loving be prayerful and be kind and
[1:43:18] you'll cut he'll be cut right into the
[1:43:20] vision amen
[1:43:22] so don't criticize certain things you
[1:43:24] must understand why we are here amen the
[1:43:26] lord has us here for purpose and at the
[1:43:29] right time he will take us here to where
[1:43:31] he wants us our school and our church
[1:43:32] amen
[1:43:34] blessed be the name of the lord lord
[1:43:35] jesus christ
[1:43:42] samantha has done a human job to try to
[1:43:44] get a puerto rican to stop eating pork
[1:43:47] and be on plant-based food bravo god
[1:43:49] bless amanda
[1:43:51] [Applause]
[1:43:55] so sometimes we have to work hard to get
[1:43:57] what we need to get we have to pray and
[1:43:59] samana said oh i'm not going to i'm just
[1:44:01] going to pray for him and the prayers
[1:44:02] did a trick
[1:44:04] so prayers
[1:44:06] and love will bring the manifestation of
[1:44:08] christ
[1:44:09] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:44:11] you pray you commit things into the lord
[1:44:14] if you don't feel comfortable here you
[1:44:16] just pray
[1:44:17] don't don't be angry don't stay at home
[1:44:20] because we school we church in the
[1:44:22] school room
[1:44:23] some people are churching under trees
[1:44:26] at church under bamboo tree i remember
[1:44:28] there was a time when it rains
[1:44:30] we go to the nearby house
[1:44:31] we pack our tools and go because when
[1:44:33] you have a
[1:44:35] plant leaf as your roof when it rains
[1:44:37] you know what happens it just comes
[1:44:41] so sometimes we having a wonderful time
[1:44:43] in the rain comes and we run away to the
[1:44:44] nearby house when the rain stops we come
[1:44:47] back and go back and forth
[1:44:49] and we're enjoying it
[1:44:51] we're just happy and rejoicing and
[1:44:52] praising the lord even for giving us a
[1:44:54] piece of land
[1:44:56] amen
[1:44:57] glory hallelujah
[1:45:02] so thank god we have our instrument we
[1:45:04] still have uh engineers around we still
[1:45:06] have uh

[1:45:10] all the body of christ our brothers and
[1:45:12] sisters amen nobody's dead we are here
[1:45:15] so why don't you rejoice and be thankful
[1:45:17] to the lord
[1:45:18] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:45:21] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:45:23] christ

[1:45:25] and when in doing the things of the lord
[1:45:28] it doesn't come cheap i want to read

[1:46:22] my redemption and your redemption it
[1:46:25] didn't come cheap to the lord jesus

[1:46:29] we were not there physically to see how
[1:46:31] jesus christ suffered
[1:46:32] but it was mutilated
[1:46:34] so his demeanor
[1:46:36] his form didn't look like a human being
[1:46:39] that is how he looked like
[1:46:42] it wasn't as our redemption wasn't
[1:46:44] wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of

[1:47:40] to get a suit
[1:47:41] three piece suit with twenty dollars
[1:47:43] they're gonna look here i think you are
[1:47:44] the wrong place go to salvation army you
[1:47:46] can get something for 20 dollars
[1:47:50] and so it's a redemption eternal life
[1:47:52] didn't come true to the lord jesus
[1:47:54] christ he has to put his own life down
[1:47:56] it wasn't a simple death but it was a
[1:47:58] death with suffering
[1:48:00] so that when you come out
[1:48:02] just like the water lily the water lily
[1:48:04] go through a lot in the river beneath
[1:48:06] the earth but when the water really
[1:48:08] comes above the earth is the one of the
[1:48:10] most beautiful plants
[1:48:12] around the river around the lake because
[1:48:15] that's good to fight his or her way out
[1:48:17] to come up so the lord has put his quote
[1:48:20] your name
[1:48:21] in you your name is the nature of christ
[1:48:23] in you is the cut of jesus christ in you
[1:48:26] and the lord is bringing out that
[1:48:27] attribute your manifestation and it
[1:48:30] doesn't come cheap it comes with a price
[1:48:32] amen the lord has put a ministry in you
[1:48:35] be you a sister or a brother everyone
[1:48:37] has got a ministry
[1:48:38] but i joseph has got a ministry
[1:48:41] every one of us has got a ministry so
[1:48:42] brother i'm not brother jack no you
[1:48:43] don't have to be bad jack
[1:48:45] be who the lord has made you to be
[1:48:48] you might be the sweeper you might be
[1:48:50] the cleaner you might be the one who
[1:48:52] support financially you might be the one
[1:48:54] who witnesses and bring people to the
[1:48:56] church
[1:48:57] in the bible was it stephen in the bible
[1:48:59] he used to witness
[1:49:01] and look at the supernatural the lord
[1:49:02] did in his life
[1:49:03] the lord gave the holy ghost to peter
[1:49:05] peter was the one who releases the holy
[1:49:06] spirit but stephen and a small apostle
[1:49:09] they go and they go and witness and then
[1:49:11] when it comes to their feelings hebrews
[1:49:13] we've got this uh lady this young man
[1:49:15] here they want to hear the gospel we
[1:49:17] witness to them and we want you to come
[1:49:18] in you know you
[1:49:20] bring in a masterpiece amen so the jack
[1:49:23] cannot go and witness to everybody in
[1:49:24] west palm beach and come and preach and
[1:49:26] do things he needs to do the lord has
[1:49:28] given each and everyone a ministry
[1:49:30] and the ministry doesn't come cheap amen
[1:49:33] and let me give her a testimony of my
[1:49:35] trip to ghana i just want to infuse it
[1:49:37] and i'll keep on with it with the same
[1:49:38] one
[1:49:39] i started fine i had two things on my
[1:49:41] mind two major things one was barrier of
[1:49:44] my father that was not too much
[1:49:45] important but the most important thing
[1:49:47] that was on my heart was a church to
[1:49:49] raise amen
[1:49:51] so when i went i passed through england
[1:49:53] just
[1:49:54] for transit when i got there i think on
[1:49:57] the sixth god bless you by the jerry
[1:49:58] brady gave me a ride
[1:50:00] i got there and everything went smoothly
[1:50:02] until i got to heathrow terminal five
[1:50:05] when i got there
[1:50:06] they said oh we needed to um
[1:50:09] make a booking to do covet tests when
[1:50:11] you go to ghana so people yes we have it
[1:50:13] here we have the code you pay 150 when
[1:50:15] you get there but then british airways
[1:50:17] have their own rule the rule is
[1:50:19] there's another website somewhere to pay
[1:50:22] the money and if you didn't pay the
[1:50:23] money you are not buying british airways
[1:50:26] wow
[1:50:27] about probably more than 10 people we
[1:50:30] couldn't board so i had to stand there
[1:50:32] and buy another ticket for the next day
[1:50:34] so i came back went to a hotel came by
[1:50:37] the next day the same british always
[1:50:39] they say oh this time around
[1:50:42] where's your passport where's your visa
[1:50:44] i had a u.s passport and i said the last
[1:50:46] time i went they told me not to get a
[1:50:48] passport not to get a visa because i'm a
[1:50:49] ghanaian and i'm a born ghanaian so when
[1:50:51] i get together i get a vest on a river
[1:50:53] there's a no way
[1:50:54] you're not going you need to get a visa
[1:50:56] so you have to call ghana embassy to
[1:50:58] give a visa to me the long story short i
[1:51:00] couldn't go that day
[1:51:02] and buying ticket up on ticket
[1:51:04] so i had to go to ghana embassy in
[1:51:05] london to get a visa
[1:51:07] and just i was i was there for about
[1:51:10] four or five days
[1:51:12] and i spent about four to five thousand
[1:51:14] dollars
[1:51:14] just going just like that
[1:51:16] and i got to a place i said you know
[1:51:18] what i know i'm going to ghana if i have
[1:51:19] to go back to the us and reroute to
[1:51:21] belgium or germany i'm going to do that
[1:51:24] there was a pregnancy in me i need to
[1:51:25] deliver the child amen there was a seed
[1:51:28] in my heart that the lord put in my
[1:51:29] heart years ago and that seed has to
[1:51:32] manifest
[1:51:33] glory hallelujah and i'll bring it to
[1:51:34] where we are now
[1:51:36] so
[1:51:37] by thanks me together i got a visa and i
[1:51:39] went
[1:51:40] the funeral wasn't
[1:51:41] it was important to me but that wasn't a
[1:51:43] major thing even during the funeral i
[1:51:45] was seeing a lot manifesting things
[1:51:48] about the church
[1:51:49] so after the funeral we rested for a
[1:51:50] week and then we came back to the same
[1:51:52] place to start a church it wasn't a
[1:51:54] silver platter things of value come with
[1:51:57] a price amen not only financially but
[1:52:00] the stress you go through traveling i
[1:52:02] was moving through triangle
[1:52:04] going to all the time just moving come
[1:52:06] to the old church and i was also the
[1:52:08] lord is doing new things even in the old
[1:52:11] church the youth and the brethren the
[1:52:13] lord was doing wonderful things
[1:52:15] one of my
[1:52:16] one of my co-co pastors his daughter i
[1:52:18] dedicated her about 14 years ago and she
[1:52:21] said i've got a song i said wow he said
[1:52:24] the lord has given me three songs that i
[1:52:26] wrote myself and i want to sing it to
[1:52:28] you and to the church and he's been
[1:52:29] singing to the church so beautiful so
[1:52:31] she signed a song for me and we started
[1:52:32] the youth because the youth is the
[1:52:34] future of today and tomorrow
[1:52:36] amen
[1:52:38] so
[1:52:38] my the old church i wasn't worried too
[1:52:40] much about the elderly people but the
[1:52:42] young people are coming up that was
[1:52:43] where my heart was so i was ministering
[1:52:45] in two major places and going to accra
[1:52:48] moving here and there all the time there
[1:52:50] was one time that i was i nearly broke
[1:52:52] down i stretched my body beyond beyond
[1:52:54] what the body could take
[1:52:56] but things of value comes with what with
[1:52:59] a price and if you're not ready to pay
[1:53:01] the price you can't serve the lord
[1:53:03] even if you sin there's a price to pay
[1:53:06] people can go to jail for years
[1:53:09] and if you serve god there's a price to
[1:53:11] pay
[1:53:12] by serving the lord the price is
[1:53:14] positive
[1:53:15] there's a blessing there's a reward but
[1:53:17] i'm saying that i think i didn't finish
[1:53:19] reading the quotes let me go on a little
[1:53:21] bit god bless you the same quote the
[1:53:23] last one that we read
[1:53:25] transparent transformation
[1:53:27] he said
[1:53:28] paragraph 79 i said to bring this
[1:53:30] message it wasn't easy see
[1:53:33] nah no it isn't easy i had to forsake
[1:53:36] everything that was dear to me even my
[1:53:38] own people everybody but you see the
[1:53:40] value of it is you see is to do the will
[1:53:43] of god
[1:53:44] it's a blessing to the soul regardless
[1:53:46] of how what you lose
[1:53:48] money friends position job
[1:53:52] whatever properties
[1:53:53] the value is in serving the lord jesus
[1:53:55] christ
[1:53:56] when you are connected with your creator
[1:53:59] when you are established in the perfect
[1:54:00] world of the creator
[1:54:02] your heart is at peace because you know
[1:54:04] that all the dimension
[1:54:06] of the world is working for you
[1:54:08] i will continue let me just finish
[1:54:09] reading the quotes
[1:54:11] so the val is and to do that which
[1:54:13] knowing that there's something in me
[1:54:15] when they when they say they was going
[1:54:16] to put me away thought i lost my mind
[1:54:18] baptizing in the name of jesus christ
[1:54:21] contrary to the church and all these
[1:54:23] things they say he's crazy
[1:54:25] but you see no matter what they said
[1:54:27] there's something has to be done and god
[1:54:28] just takes a person sticks him in his
[1:54:30] hand and do what you need to do amen
[1:54:33] now it's common to be baptized in the
[1:54:35] name of jesus christ
[1:54:36] every chap a lot of churches are
[1:54:37] baptized in the name of jesus christ not
[1:54:39] there it's nothing strange
[1:54:41] but in the time of william abraham to be
[1:54:43] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:54:45] which is in the bible you can read
[1:54:47] crystal clear from acts chapter 2 verse
[1:54:49] 36 to 38 repent and be baptized in the
[1:54:52] name of the lord jesus christ for the
[1:54:54] promise unto you
[1:54:55] william brahman didn't put it there
[1:54:57] jewel professed about it and apostle
[1:54:59] paul and the prophet put it there but
[1:55:01] just to baptize the name of jesus christ
[1:55:03] they thought he was crazy he was
[1:55:05] bringing strange doctrines and people
[1:55:07] disown him people forsook him
[1:55:09] in serving the lord you have to pay a
[1:55:11] price
[1:55:12] be you a sister a pastor a deacon
[1:55:15] a child sometime people mock you for the
[1:55:18] way you dress our sisters brothers we
[1:55:20] don't go through that much
[1:55:21] because your haircut probably doesn't
[1:55:22] change
[1:55:24] unless maybe you had to wear your rings
[1:55:25] and hard dreadlocks but if you are maybe
[1:55:28] plain brother you you didn't change much
[1:55:30] you still wear jeans but for the sisters
[1:55:32] to switch from wearing certain dress
[1:55:34] pants and and bikinis and those things
[1:55:37] to dress like ladies they have to pay a
[1:55:39] price what is the price mercury
[1:55:42] what is the price you're gonna be
[1:55:43] isolated people look at you up and down
[1:55:45] and laugh at you people like will not
[1:55:47] even employ you some jobs will not
[1:55:49] employ you because of the way you dress
[1:55:52] but that's the price you pay
[1:55:54] if you want to serve the lord are you
[1:55:55] ready to serve the lord are you ready
[1:55:57] for the price or you want to go with the
[1:55:59] flow
[1:56:00] now you have been ordained
[1:56:03] and called
[1:56:07] and preordained for a certain destiny on
[1:56:09] earth
[1:56:10] and if you are ready to pay the price
[1:56:13] you can't count your blessing
[1:56:15] i remember i was standing in london and
[1:56:17] i was like even my bank
[1:56:19] one of the time i before i went i
[1:56:21] traveled to mexico for two weeks
[1:56:23] and i called i went to my bank to make
[1:56:24] sure that
[1:56:26] i used my debit card i don't use credit
[1:56:27] card as of now
[1:56:29] but then they did my bank began to put
[1:56:31] limitations on my debit card
[1:56:34] and they blocked it completely
[1:56:35] so i had to coach his bank that hey i'm
[1:56:38] the one in london i'm the one spending
[1:56:39] those money so release my release my
[1:56:41] account for me samantha can testify and
[1:56:44] i went through about five hours just to
[1:56:46] get my my bank but the lord knows what
[1:56:48] he was doing
[1:56:50] and when i went to ghana i remember we
[1:56:52] went to we started we went to convention
[1:56:53] on friday the fact we didn't preach
[1:56:56] saturday there was a wedding at the
[1:56:57] place so we had to wait for the wedding
[1:56:59] around four o'clock and we started
[1:57:01] singing we i took a cross session of the
[1:57:02] church the old church we took because
[1:57:04] sometime one past test ministers alone
[1:57:06] go to preach
[1:57:07] all that people see ministers they don't
[1:57:09] say what is the church like who are they
[1:57:11] like but sometimes their sisters tell a
[1:57:13] story they are alive just looking at
[1:57:14] them they could see they could descend
[1:57:16] your spirit they could see their christ
[1:57:18] in you and that is an attraction to even
[1:57:20] the sisters so we took cross-section
[1:57:22] adult young teenagers different sections
[1:57:25] about 15 and we went and the night when
[1:57:27] we started singing and preaching the
[1:57:29] pill of fire took over
[1:57:31] and souls were touched
[1:57:34] people began to come in
[1:57:36] wanted to be baptized and i think in the
[1:57:38] night we finished after they preaching
[1:57:39] around eight o'clock and everybody
[1:57:41] didn't want to go so we started praying
[1:57:43] for everybody and praying we to about
[1:57:45] midnight almost eleven something
[1:57:48] and one of my cousin he came to take a
[1:57:50] mic and he gave a testimony was in tears
[1:57:53] he said the lord has brought a new key
[1:57:55] to them that key is through his cousin
[1:57:58] and their lives were not going to be the
[1:58:00] same
[1:58:01] the past is gone and they have a new key
[1:58:03] the gospel key
[1:58:06] the religion of jesus christ for them
[1:58:08] and he was in tears as was giving that
[1:58:10] testimony so this sunday we continued
[1:58:12] there was another wedding on a sunday so
[1:58:14] we had to wait but we preach on and we
[1:58:16] had about five 20 people give their life
[1:58:18] to the lord five were ready to be
[1:58:19] baptized
[1:58:20] in africa we do more baptism in rivers
[1:58:22] and lakes
[1:58:23] and so the rivers were dried it's a
[1:58:25] place full of mountain we went and they
[1:58:27] told us to go to their source the sauce
[1:58:28] was also dry so we couldn't baptize them
[1:58:30] we just put it on hold but we've got
[1:58:32] about at least 20 people that have given
[1:58:34] their life to the lord they have given
[1:58:36] their hearts to the revelation of jesus
[1:58:38] christ for this hour you don't know what
[1:58:40] you have
[1:58:42] what you have now what is common to you
[1:58:44] yes you go about you know i have my
[1:58:46] problems i have my issues but what you
[1:58:48] how and who you are now
[1:58:50] somebody would have wished to be you
[1:58:55] even in the midst of your limitations
[1:58:56] and your challenges and problems someone
[1:58:58] would have wished to be you
[1:59:00] for the spirit of christ that dwells in
[1:59:02] your heart
[1:59:03] regardless of your circumstances and the
[1:59:05] circumstances are just to build your
[1:59:06] character
[1:59:07] amen
[1:59:09] they'll go in their time don't worry
[1:59:11] we're not going to stay here forever
[1:59:13] you're not going to be in middle school
[1:59:14] forever
[1:59:15] so be happy and rejoice
[1:59:16] the lord has said as a transition point
[1:59:19] for a purpose amen
[1:59:21] sometimes when our heart is on summer
[1:59:23] the lord has a way of temperance and
[1:59:24] turning things down he wants us to look
[1:59:26] at him all the time
[1:59:28] not to look at material things
[1:59:30] not to be over over elated or we're
[1:59:33] going to get a new church a new school
[1:59:34] oh yeah glory hallelujah it's good but
[1:59:37] the lord wants us what let us be be in
[1:59:39] uh how do you call it being equilibrium
[1:59:42] be balanced
[1:59:43] amen
[1:59:44] he wanted us to look at him him first
[1:59:46] not that building in the school face
[1:59:48] he want to look at him because if the
[1:59:50] building is we have got a flashy
[1:59:51] building and our heart is not for him
[1:59:54] then the burden is a waste of time
[1:59:56] if if the lord gives us the most
[1:59:59] powerful uh a cathedral with all the
[2:00:02] pipe organs and everything and we pay
[2:00:04] for it and we go there with arms wrists
[2:00:07] then that doesn't please the lord
[2:00:09] so the lord make sure you bring us to a
[2:00:11] classroom
[2:00:13] a little school room here but happy full
[2:00:16] of energy and when we finish here he
[2:00:18] knows when to take us from this place
[2:00:20] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[2:00:22] christ
[2:00:24] glory hallelujah to the lord
[2:00:26] [Applause]
[2:00:28] he knows you by name
[2:00:30] he knows your situation by name
[2:00:32] he called you
[2:00:34] you weigh him you are him before the
[2:00:36] foundation of the world you are his
[2:00:37] attribute in manifestation and is
[2:00:40] bringing out his life in your life
[2:00:43] and all he wants you to do is love him
[2:00:45] and surrender to him
[2:00:47] like i said a child can can love the
[2:00:49] parents
[2:00:50] can love the father the grandparents say
[2:00:53] grandpa catch me
[2:00:55] grandma catch me because of confidence
[2:00:57] and your problems that you have
[2:00:59] if you can love the lord your problems
[2:01:01] will be
[2:01:02] it will diminish
[2:01:04] you know how it diminishes
[2:01:06] because you have confidence
[2:01:09] even if it's sickness that the lord has
[2:01:11] healed you you've a rapha
[2:01:13] it is his word
[2:01:14] that he said his name is the overrapha
[2:01:16] rapha means what the healer
[2:01:19] of all your infirmities
[2:01:20] and he will heal you
[2:01:22] and the healing is in you
[2:01:24] and even if you make your mic make up
[2:01:25] your mind like shadrach meshach meshach
[2:01:27] and abednego that lord even if he
[2:01:29] doesn't deliver us from this fire
[2:01:31] we will not bow to idols
[2:01:33] and if the law doesn't heal me i have to
[2:01:35] go with this sickness to death glory
[2:01:37] hallelujah i'm going to rejoice and
[2:01:38] praise the lord all my life to my last
[2:01:41] breath
[2:01:42] and if you have that determination the
[2:01:44] problem is already gone because it's not
[2:01:45] going to bother your mind you know that
[2:01:47] the lord has really taken care of and
[2:01:49] that's what the lord wants to bring it
[2:01:50] just like i was using my story the lord
[2:01:52] doesn't want you to fear raccoon
[2:01:53] and when i was scared of raccoon he made
[2:01:55] sure that raku took my shoes to the
[2:01:56] woods
[2:01:57] next time i'm going to have to be brave
[2:01:59] and embrace the raccoon he's a creation
[2:02:01] of god and i'm the i'm the creator
[2:02:04] you are the creator
[2:02:06] we are the one the lord told adam that
[2:02:08] you are the god of this earth
[2:02:10] he spoke into creation
[2:02:12] but again you are a creator there is a
[2:02:14] creative power in you
[2:02:16] but you are going through what you are
[2:02:17] going to do for first scriptures let's
[2:02:19] look at the lord jesus christ
[2:02:20] when he was born one was being born
[2:02:23] there was not even a place for him to be
[2:02:25] born
[2:02:26] they tried all the inn in is a hotel
[2:02:29] none of them will have them over there
[2:02:32] they even wanted to pay probably doubled
[2:02:33] what they paid we don't want you here
[2:02:36] and peter no peter joseph probably
[2:02:38] didn't understand mary how maybe mary
[2:02:40] will look at joseph joseph why
[2:02:43] we've got the money we want to pay
[2:02:45] triple but they don't want why what's
[2:02:47] going on but mary didn't know that there
[2:02:49] was a scripture written
[2:02:50] that jesus the messiah was born inward
[2:02:54] in a pen
[2:02:55] in where lamps
[2:02:57] are brought forth
[2:02:59] not to be born in a big fanciful
[2:03:01] hospital
[2:03:02] saint mary's or
[2:03:04] cleveland hospital
[2:03:07] but to be born in a home where animal
[2:03:09] not just even in a home
[2:03:10] a home is
[2:03:11] gorgeous
[2:03:13] but where lamps
[2:03:15] ride feed and eat and sleep as thinking
[2:03:17] place
[2:03:18] to fulfill a scripture
[2:03:21] when he was born
[2:03:23] was a herod wanted to kill him
[2:03:25] so they have to run him to africa egypt
[2:03:28] to hide him over there
[2:03:30] they crossed the what they call a swiss
[2:03:31] canal hidden in egypt for so long years
[2:03:35] until herald died and when herod died
[2:03:37] they knew the lord took joseph now herod
[2:03:39] is dead bring the messiah the child to
[2:03:41] israel
[2:03:42] when he got there his son was raining he
[2:03:44] said hey his son is here
[2:03:46] and he's as bad as his father
[2:03:48] then it's okay take him to nazareth
[2:03:51] to keep him over nazareth
[2:03:53] but then they didn't know that the
[2:03:54] scriptures
[2:03:56] had to be fulfilled because it has to be
[2:03:58] called a nazarene
[2:03:59] he was consecrated to the lord
[2:04:01] so he has to be what taken to nazareth
[2:04:04] first
[2:04:05] to be hidden nazareth
[2:04:06] until the situations were smooth before
[2:04:09] he comes to is it galilee or where he
[2:04:10] was
[2:04:11] so your life is full of fulfilling
[2:04:14] scriptures
[2:04:15] you might know i was standing in london
[2:04:17] and i was wondering what's going on here
[2:04:19] i know the lord has since under control
[2:04:21] and i know the seed in my heart has to
[2:04:23] be planted
[2:04:25] i have to relieve just like a woman a
[2:04:26] woman when he's pregnant is 9 months you
[2:04:28] have to give birth you can't hold it any
[2:04:30] longer your belly is this way you are
[2:04:33] tired you're walking this way all you
[2:04:35] want to do is what have your baby and be
[2:04:38] at peace and when god puts something in
[2:04:40] your heart
[2:04:41] to do
[2:04:42] you can't rest
[2:04:45] he anoints you
[2:04:46] just like he did unto mary and joseph
[2:04:49] and they were running jesus to egypt
[2:04:51] in africa bringing back to uh to israel
[2:04:54] to nazareth the bible said that the
[2:04:56] scriptures might be fulfilled
[2:04:59] so your life are you messy jesus christ
[2:05:02] are you mr jesus christ are you

[2:06:17] but you are the body you are the third
[2:06:19] of them amen not even a third you are

[2:06:24] corinthian somewhere i said
[2:06:25] when i was a child
[2:06:27] i i spoke like a child and i knew things
[2:06:30] in parts fractions are not complete so
[2:06:32] we are not in the in the first testament

[2:06:37] in the fullness of christ
[2:06:38] amen all of christ has been poured into
[2:06:41] you
[2:06:42] glory hallelujah to the lord the
[2:06:44] fullness of god is in brother brother

[2:06:52] amen his name is satina this is a
[2:06:55] cherise crisis in you manifesting his
[2:06:57] glory
[2:06:58] and you have to thank the lord and
[2:06:59] rejoice the lord will bring somebody in
[2:07:01] your life because you're a messiah you
[2:07:03] don't know why the lord brought this
[2:07:04] person in your life the person might be
[2:07:06] messed up was it by the jackal but
[2:07:08] brother smith friendly preaching that
[2:07:10] but abraham when he was young he had a
[2:07:12] friend who was drunk and all drunk up
[2:07:14] and gave me a place to sleep
[2:07:17] what would you have done oh i don't want
[2:07:19] a drunkard in my house
[2:07:21] you have to be sensitive to the spirit
[2:07:23] and he prayed for the friend he was
[2:07:24] drunk and maybe vomiting thrown up and
[2:07:26] seeing all kind of
[2:07:28] i mean trash
[2:07:29] but ram was looking at the seed in him
[2:07:33] and the lord created the right
[2:07:34] atmosphere when's the star is it nearly
[2:07:36] the dancer had a demon went to dance and
[2:07:38] had a demon and when he came he was
[2:07:40] drunk but when he saw the demon he woke
[2:07:42] up
[2:07:45] all the craft and alcohol left him he
[2:07:47] saw a bat
[2:07:48] flapping in the room a demon physically
[2:07:51] he said wow this is this must be real
[2:07:53] and begin to shook him he quickened him
[2:07:55] to know that i needed help
[2:07:57] and he was trying to hide where abraham
[2:07:59] was
[2:08:00] amen
[2:08:01] so there are people that they might be
[2:08:02] dull they might not be sensitive to
[2:08:04] their spirit
[2:08:05] love them when the right time comes the
[2:08:08] lord will raise the situation to wake
[2:08:10] them up in your life
[2:08:11] the lord might have brought somebody it
[2:08:13] could be a family person it could be
[2:08:15] somebody in your life maybe you love
[2:08:17] them they love you but their life
[2:08:19] doesn't line up
[2:08:20] but you keep pouring the love of god in
[2:08:22] here in their lives keep blessing them

[2:08:26] are the messiah to them you are jesus

[2:13:41] on today
[2:13:44] i know you're by your name saith the
[2:13:46] lord
[2:13:47] sitting there listening to
[2:13:49] brother quake who just so much was
[2:13:50] shared and
[2:13:52] just thinking on last sunday
[2:13:54] i left church
[2:13:56] just feeling like i've been in church
[2:13:58] and this sunday i'm leaving church again
[2:14:01] feeling like i've been in church
[2:14:03] i've been encouraged i've been
[2:14:04] strengthened and
[2:14:06] just just appreciate how the lord uses
[2:14:08] the different
[2:14:09] uh ministering gifts that we have in our
[2:14:11] midst and
[2:14:12] amen and um i was just just just just
[2:14:16] really really blessed this morning thank
[2:14:18] you
[2:14:19] uh brother quaker just for just yielding
[2:14:21] yourself and just allowing god to speak
[2:14:23] to you to us
[2:14:24] amen uh before we
[2:14:26] go
[2:14:27] um y'all can be seated just for a minute
[2:14:30] uh i actually
[2:14:32] there was two people that had approached
[2:14:35] me um within the last
[2:14:38] little bit and just mentioned to me that
[2:14:40] they they had testimonies that they
[2:14:41] wanted to share and
[2:14:43] i just wasn't sure when we were going to
[2:14:44] have time to to get it all worked out
[2:14:47] uh but i wanted to give some room for
[2:14:50] that amen on today
[2:14:52] since we do have a little time and and i
[2:14:54] know one with sister nelly she asked
[2:14:56] about just wanting to be able to share
[2:14:57] testimony and also uh brother josue
[2:15:00] asked about being one uh wanting to
[2:15:02] share a testimony so i want to just give
[2:15:04] them a little space say man just to
[2:15:06] share
[2:15:07] uh from their hearts i'll ask for the
[2:15:09] whole way to come first and then i'll
[2:15:11] let sister nelly come after that amen so
[2:15:14] brother elsa if you don't mind you can
[2:15:15] come and just share the testimony that
[2:15:16] you have in your heart that you want to
[2:15:18] share
[2:15:22] god bless you all
[2:15:25] um
[2:15:28] you know i never thought about what
[2:15:29] brother quake was saying
[2:15:31] you know we were we were kind of like
[2:15:34] we didn't like the sound on the other
[2:15:36] the the church over there the back it
[2:15:38] was bothering us preachers would come
[2:15:39] and they're worshiping at the same time
[2:15:41] so we kind of i was one was like man
[2:15:43] lord can you do something about that so
[2:15:45] he did like it is a lot more peaceful we
[2:15:48] we're out here by ourselves so
[2:15:51] i think it's kind of like a a
[2:15:54] little taste of when we have our own
[2:15:56] building you know we can fellowship
[2:15:58] brother brother brother troy don't have
[2:15:59] to come out there shh
[2:16:01] none of that so so we actually like that
[2:16:04] that's just one one thing that i can say
[2:16:05] possible i didn't even think about it
[2:16:07] but it blessed my heart when he said
[2:16:09] that
[2:16:10] um so i told brother jack you know
[2:16:13] there's just a little something that's
[2:16:15] going on
[2:16:16] um both of my shoulders actually won on
[2:16:19] the shoulders
[2:16:21] and um
[2:16:23] really
[2:16:24] for for about like
[2:16:25] two months already he's been going on
[2:16:27] and he got to the point where it just
[2:16:29] bothered me so much
[2:16:30] and i told mandy i said mandy you know
[2:16:32] like make me a doctor's appointment you
[2:16:34] know i want to kind of see what's going
[2:16:36] on
[2:16:38] with my shoulder
[2:16:39] and um and i told her that you know i
[2:16:42] believe i actually asked brother kweku
[2:16:45] when when i picked him up from the
[2:16:47] airport
[2:16:48] and
[2:16:49] we had to go pick up the keys and and uh
[2:16:51] brother jerry's he had his keys and i
[2:16:53] told brother quake i said brother quaker
[2:16:56] you know i need you to pray for him he
[2:16:57] said won't we wait till we get to
[2:16:58] brother jerry's house and and we'll
[2:17:01] we'll all
[2:17:02] join together we will pray you know so
[2:17:04] we did that
[2:17:06] and we prayed over my shoulder and i
[2:17:08] told
[2:17:09] mandy pray for me linda abby pray for me
[2:17:13] but the joseph prayed for me i mean
[2:17:14] there's some people praying for this
[2:17:16] um and and i told mandy i said you know
[2:17:19] in the meantime that the lord
[2:17:21] uh uh uh heals me because i'm believing
[2:17:23] for my healing
[2:17:25] um
[2:17:25] why don't you just make a doctor's
[2:17:27] appointment and then we'll just kind of
[2:17:28] figure out and if the lord wants to use
[2:17:30] the doctor
[2:17:32] then he use the doctor i'm just
[2:17:34] whatever whether it's through the doctor
[2:17:36] now i'm believing that god is going to
[2:17:37] heal me
[2:17:38] um so i went
[2:17:40] actually to to get some x-rays done and
[2:17:43] they took some x-rays and after the
[2:17:45] extra i went to my supply house where i
[2:17:46] pick up uh supplies for my business and
[2:17:49] and the guy there he's telling me where
[2:17:50] you coming from he said coming from i
[2:17:52] told him i'm coming from x-rays and i
[2:17:54] told him what was happening he's like ah
[2:17:56] i mean that's exactly what i'm going
[2:17:57] through here i'm going to surgery on on
[2:18:00] next friday i'm going to to surgery
[2:18:02] and i was like
[2:18:04] you know he's like the doctor said i got
[2:18:06] this and it's exactly what it is when
[2:18:07] you're sleeping you can't sleep it's
[2:18:09] it's incredible pain i said a sec he
[2:18:11] described exactly what i'm going through
[2:18:13] and he said that the doctor said that it
[2:18:15] was the only surgery that can fix that
[2:18:17] you know so um
[2:18:19] i started doing some research with abby
[2:18:20] and nina in the car and joseph we
[2:18:22] started doing some research of the pain
[2:18:23] that i was having and exactly like he
[2:18:26] said he said what you have is a it's a
[2:18:28] it's a tear on your tendon
[2:18:31] and and there's like nothing they could
[2:18:33] do like you literally have to do surgery
[2:18:35] so when i got to the house i'm like baby
[2:18:36] i know what i have you know i haven't
[2:18:38] gotten the results i know exactly what
[2:18:40] it is
[2:18:41] and and she's like no you can't speak
[2:18:43] like that you can't i said i'm not
[2:18:44] speaking
[2:18:46] i'm just saying that's what it is now i
[2:18:48] can tell god exactly what he needs to
[2:18:49] fix you know she's like you can't speak
[2:18:51] i'm like i'm not speaking out of faith
[2:18:53] i'm just saying this is what it is now
[2:18:55] i'm telling god directly especially i'm
[2:18:57] gonna be specific what he needs to fix
[2:18:59] you know and then she's like no you
[2:19:01] can't speak that he said the only way to
[2:19:03] fix that is surgery i was like no now
[2:19:08] you talking some stuff
[2:19:10] now now now you're telling me i'm just
[2:19:12] saying what it is now you're telling me
[2:19:13] that the only way that they can fix that
[2:19:15] is through surgery you know so i was
[2:19:18] like nah
[2:19:19] i believe that god can heal me you know
[2:19:20] and then what i'm saying this i
[2:19:23] god has still haven't gave me my healing
[2:19:25] yet i'm believing for my healing but
[2:19:27] what i want to
[2:19:28] share this testimony was because after
[2:19:30] that
[2:19:31] the the next morning mandy called me and
[2:19:33] she said you know i just remember
[2:19:35] something and and a few like about a
[2:19:38] year ago i was having some pain in my
[2:19:40] heels when i woke up in the morning like
[2:19:42] i for until i warmed up i really
[2:19:45] couldn't walk and they did some tests
[2:19:47] and they and they took some s-rays and i
[2:19:49] had these bones splints on my heels
[2:19:53] right and the doctor like they took like
[2:19:55] this one for sure they took the x-rays i
[2:19:57] have the x-rays i'll bring them to y'all
[2:19:59] if you want to see them and i had those
[2:20:01] a bunch of them split and the doctor
[2:20:02] said you know what the only way this
[2:20:04] thing is going to get fixed is we have
[2:20:06] to do surgery we go in there we scrape
[2:20:08] them off you know and we started praying
[2:20:10] for that and
[2:20:12] about a month went by
[2:20:14] and
[2:20:15] i didn't i i was waking up in the
[2:20:17] morning i told i told her i was like
[2:20:18] look i'm like i don't have it no more so
[2:20:21] i haven't took in another x-ray to see
[2:20:23] that they're not there but
[2:20:24] if they're still there god took i
[2:20:26] remember one time brother brother uh uh
[2:20:29] troy was preaching he said that the the
[2:20:32] god didn't take the hebrew voice out the
[2:20:33] fire but he he took the heat out of the
[2:20:36] fire so maybe they're still splinting
[2:20:38] there but i don't feel them so so mandy
[2:20:42] she told me she's like you know baby i
[2:20:43] was telling you that the only way that
[2:20:45] they can fix that was through surgery
[2:20:47] but
[2:20:49] they said that the only way they can
[2:20:50] take those plans out was through surgery
[2:20:52] and they never did the surgery and
[2:20:54] you're fine with it you know so
[2:20:56] so
[2:20:58] my testimony was just it's like a
[2:21:00] pre-testimony i'm letting you guys know
[2:21:02] that i believe that god can heal this
[2:21:05] there's a tear there's three different
[2:21:07] ways there's like a full tear and
[2:21:09] there's a half tear whatever it is
[2:21:11] doctor hasn't even told me what it is
[2:21:12] but regardless what it is
[2:21:14] god already like he brings
[2:21:16] things to your remembrance you know we
[2:21:17] sometimes we don't need examples from
[2:21:19] the old testament we just our own you
[2:21:22] know so i think my my wife that she's
[2:21:25] like you know baby i just want to lift
[2:21:26] your faith up god already did that they
[2:21:28] didn't have to do surgery so i believe
[2:21:30] that god can heal
[2:21:31] i just want to ask you guys to to join
[2:21:33] in prayer for me um um
[2:21:36] the devil wants to like they said that
[2:21:38] if they do that surgery then i would
[2:21:39] have to uh uh take about two months that
[2:21:42] i can't like move my arms and and and i
[2:21:45] i'm not going through that i believe
[2:21:47] that i'm not going to go through that i
[2:21:48] believe that god already provided my
[2:21:50] healing he showed me through what he
[2:21:52] already done that he can do that and i
[2:21:54] just want to encourage you all that that
[2:21:56] that
[2:21:57] remember what god did for you he did it
[2:21:59] for you one time he could do it again
[2:22:01] he's never done it and he did it for me
[2:22:03] he can also do it for you guys so keep
[2:22:05] me in prayer god bless you all
[2:22:12] i don't have my oil but we're going to
[2:22:13] pray for brother i'll sway father we
[2:22:16] come according to your word you told us
[2:22:18] to lay hands on the sick and they shall
[2:22:20] recover
[2:22:21] so lord these uh problems that he's
[2:22:23] having with his shoulders we know how
[2:22:24] that would impact his work reaction to
[2:22:26] it touch him even right now that you
[2:22:28] bring healing to his body and that
[2:22:29] whatever the condition is it would be
[2:22:31] cursed at the root
[2:22:33] father that you would just be manifested
[2:22:35] once more in his body just as you took
[2:22:37] care of the the the splints lord there
[2:22:39] and
[2:22:40] all the problems we've had with his uh
[2:22:41] with his uh lord his feet now take take
[2:22:44] control of this the shoulders father
[2:22:47] you're the one that designed his body
[2:22:48] you made it and father we uh we know
[2:22:50] that you made it to not have all this
[2:22:52] pain so god we just believe you bring
[2:22:54] healing to him in jesus name
[2:22:56] amen amen god bless you god bless you
[2:23:02] praise the lord
[2:23:05] i thank god for that testimony i mean
[2:23:07] sister nelly if you don't mind coming at
[2:23:09] this time we'll have her just share
[2:23:11] uh just what the lord had placed in her
[2:23:13] heart
[2:23:14] she says i i'm ready brother jack i got
[2:23:16] a testimony i said okay
[2:23:19] amen god bless you god bless you
[2:23:24] um it was so long ago my mind ain't long
[2:23:27] so i
[2:23:35] um
[2:23:37] there was an incident um something was
[2:23:39] did to me and i was it wasn't actually
[2:23:42] did to me i perceived it in a way
[2:23:44] and you know and we as christians
[2:23:47] sometimes we started acting like you
[2:23:49] know in my i never said anything but in
[2:23:52] my mind
[2:23:54] i had my righteous ignition had done
[2:23:56] rose up and i was telling somebody off
[2:23:59] in my mind
[2:24:01] it is truth and high good it's what it
[2:24:04] is all right
[2:24:05] uh
[2:24:06] and in my mind i'm just going on and on
[2:24:09] about you know do you know who i am and
[2:24:12] you know just just you know it was
[2:24:14] in my mind
[2:24:16] and uh it was before i went to work and
[2:24:19] usually you know if i get to work early
[2:24:22] before i get to work i'll sit in my car
[2:24:24] you know read a scripture whatever have
[2:24:26] you this particular morning that you
[2:24:28] know my little righteous indignation had
[2:24:30] done rose up and
[2:24:31] i got to work and i just opened up the
[2:24:34] bible
[2:24:35] and god had um
[2:24:37] when i turned opened up the bible it was
[2:24:40] just this scripture of everything i had
[2:24:43] done done had done brought me down so
[2:24:45] bad
[2:24:46] i say lord jesus help me
[2:24:49] so the testimony is that you have to be
[2:24:51] careful even in what even though you
[2:24:54] don't speak it when you run it through
[2:24:56] your mind if it's not christ-like you
[2:24:58] need to cast it down because we're
[2:25:01] coming to a time in a day well that
[2:25:04] we're going to start speaking things and
[2:25:06] if you can't handle the things you know
[2:25:08] you start thinking things because
[2:25:10] somebody did something wrong and you
[2:25:11] going off on them in your mind and it's
[2:25:13] bad when you start speaking things
[2:25:16] you're killing that person you're you're
[2:25:18] not prospering that person if if it's
[2:25:21] not good and it's not like christ we're
[2:25:23] not supposed to be doing it so the
[2:25:25] testimony is to be careful what you even
[2:25:28] think in your mind
[2:25:31] [Applause]
[2:25:46] lord for that
[2:25:48] uh
[2:25:49] god know how to bring it out at the
[2:25:50] right time
[2:25:53] i know exactly what he doing
[2:25:55] i just that that's that's that's that's
[2:25:57] all right that's all right
[2:25:59] um
[2:26:00] well

[2:26:24] that certainly was i i used to have to
[2:26:25] apologize to the preachers look you're
