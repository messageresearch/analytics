sometimes in life things that you might be going through in a job there's a purging that comes sometimes to be a family there's a purging that comes but the purging process always brings something greater amen it never you never decrease in the purging process it's all to be beneficial to you and uh so we we learn to thank God in the midst of the purging process and brother Diggs was just saying how well he had another thought in his mind I seen him do it and I'm just glad he gave that little inspiration because it just took me right back down the memory lane and you know God God has done some Supernatural things for us and another dig start wiping his feet up yes and just I remember me and my daddy going into that place and and you know we we they um they just would not turn the music down and we just trying to ask certain like everywhere we go people just blasting aside with music until we came here right but uh but but but they were blasting that music and they wouldn't turn it down and say look I said I said Iglesia Iglesia Iglesia and because I know they didn't speak English I said church next door man see we ain't got no reaction the man was a woman they ain't got nothing to do with that we gonna do what we doing right over here I mean that lady would not listen and the two guys that was with us that was with her they were trying to get to just just let them have church no no no no no no we over here doing our thing they over there doing that saying my God rough spirit so I said well nothing I can do and as I was walking out the door me and my dad we walked out got to the carpet of the door and I just remember the scripture sometimes God just quickened the word to you and I just remember the scripture if they won't receive you in a certain city just wipe your feet as you're leaving that city so we just wiped out I wiped my feet on the mat and I walked out the door and I didn't know that my daddy saw what I did so my daddy did the same thing walked out the door the very next week that place was shut down would be seen again see so we don't see them do it we know what God is able to do he's a supernatural God and he's our God amen so sometimes we just gotta wait on them you know and amen the sunrise say I don't mind waiting don't mind waiting on the Lords amen I I just appreciate the Lord so I'm excited about what God got for us today let me just read these announcements amen and um um one of the other things that I want to I forget to uh announce it but Brother Anderson is having a family camp in June I believe it is in June so I got the information at home and I'll make sure I bring it but anyone will be want to be a part of that that would be great but it's a big they're doing a Family Camp up there in South Carolina uh in June so just want to make you aware of that so we have a couple birthdays a man uh sister Charisse is having a birthday on Tuesday she and her twin Shanice hey man Charisse and Shanice on Tuesday the 13th so we say happy birthday to them and on Saturday uh my mom sister Birds they may be having a birthday and then we say happy birthday to her amen for for next Saturday amen uh on Wednesday we'll be here at 7 30 p.m for service and then uh virtual streaming will continue through Twitter and Facebook and and our church website john423.org uh also don't forget this afternoon we have the youth Fellowship amen at 2 30 and that's going to happen at our home so this is for ages 16 in London we want parents to do two things first and foremost honor the time of 2 30. amen they have to go and prepare some things before our youth get there and then the other thing is just make sure everybody have a change some change of clothes because some of the activities that they will be doing uh will it could cause you to get a little dirty so we don't want you to mess up your church clothes y'all know it used to be a time that uh people had oh [Music] [Applause] y'all don't know nothing about that yeah I don't know nothing about that they they had church clothes they had school clothes and they had play clothes they even don't get them mixed up don't don't do that in your church clothes and don't do that in your school clothes you put on your play clothes all right uh but that Fellowship ain't gonna be taking place amen at 2 30 so keep that in mind on this Tuesday night Brothers will be in Virtual prayer meeting and man we invite all the brothers to be a part of that and um we have our box in the back for our Christmas giving and just want to just make mention of this uh years ago um when we were going to Pinnacle palms and right before covet we saw changes begin to happen and we were just not allowed to kind of go into that door anymore and when covet came it was it just shut it down could not go back to Pinnacle Palms so at that point in time we began to pray especially as brothers we would get on the prayer line and we'd just start praying and asking God to open up the next door for our Outreach opportunity and the Lord opened the door for the pantry that is a Outreach opportunity I actually have a prayer request from one of the ladies that comes to the pantry um and and we're going to pray for her today but we have an opportunity to kind of share Christ and just just Express you know concern and care for people there and you know so um a few years ago as we were doing a business meeting I was telling everyone we're not looking for a whole bunch of opportunity to try to get our hands in let's take what we got and be efficient with what we have right make a difference with the ones that we have right and uh so one of the things that we that we did is uh we've been doing the turkeys for the last couple years since we haven't had something that the church would take on and uh and and that has spread people would just start telling their friends but these people get turkeys these people get turkeys I like that testimony because uh what happens is that if somebody knew that has never come before they get a chance to be touched by something that we do they get that opportunity it's an Outreach opportunity we never want to forget that and um so this time around what I felt led is we used to take the cards out and we would you know the gift cards for Christmas we just give them out we gave them to the school last year and we would go out and walk the neighborhood and give but we got people that come right to that pantry every week that would be blessed by those gift cards so my my plan is again be efficient with what we already got we don't have to spread ourselves thin let's be efficient with what we got and let's make a difference right there so what we're doing is we're going to give those gift cards to needy families right there at the at the pantry and uh but but I want to invite our young people to come out and be a part of that I think we're going to do it during a time where ain't no school amen the school will be out so our youth a man will be able to kind of come if the parents can just get them there we'll coordinate them you just be there and we want you to be the ones merry Christmas happy New Year Jesus Loves You amen we want our young people to be able to do that so we're gonna we're gonna be doing it the the the the giveaway is going to be on December 22nd I believe is a date so the last day to bring your cards will be next Sunday December 18th so bring your gift cards just drop them in that box in the back amen I think it's a gold box but just put fill out the little uh a card we want you to write a little note to the person that you're giving it to you don't know who whose hands is going to end up in so let the Lord lead you and what to write Amen to them so we want you to do that and so next Sunday would be the last sentence we'll give we'll have the box out but on December 22nd will be the date that we'll be giving it out at the pantry at the pantry so keep that keep that in mind amen all right [Music] um so tonight there'll be another service brother digs will be preaching there at bride of Christ Tabernacle amen there in Boynton Beach so 6 p.m the service will start and we're looking forward to that and don't forget Christmas Sunday Christmas Sunday we will not be allowed to meet here in the school because there's no uh custodian a man that that close up for us so we will be going to the Fairfield Inn uh right down the street 2045 Vista Parkway just right down the street here right behind the Walmart new hotel there and they are giving us their conference room for us to have our Christmas service amen I was supposed to be preaching that service but word got to me a man that brother gwinner was gonna be around [Music] so I've been uh sinners from text messages and uh in hopes that he'd be willing to share a Christmas thought with us amen so we'll see what the Lord does Amen but we're excited amen about that uh I I didn't plan it but I'm gonna get if it works out I'm gonna get the whole month of December off uh amen I had to preach and uh in Arizona and I do also have another meeting coming up in Tennessee before the year the

Jesus Christ's name we pray the church say amen amen amen you have your Bibles let's go to um II Peter chapter one second Peter chapter one and then we're gonna we're gonna go back to uh Saint John chapter 10. you know what let's let's read Saint John chapter 10 first then we'll come to Second Peter Saint John chapter 10 verse 37. Saint John 10 and 37 the Bible says if I do not the works of my father Believe Me Not but if I do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him Hallelujah Glory hey let's go to Second Peter chapter one oh my Saint John is speaking of a life second Peter chapter one let's start at verse four the Bible says whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen may the Lord blessed reading of his word you can have your seats amen you know by the by the grace of God I want to speak of something that we're Familiar of or just a slogan that we're familiar but we kind of want to look into it a little bit you know and today I want to use for a subject bride material hey man Brad material we hear that all the time you know I'm bright material but you have to you you ask the question what makes you bright material you know when you say well uh I know God sent the prophet there's a lot of other people that believe in that same material there's a lot of other people that have been in this Services a lot of the people that got the books and tapes so they'll say I got the same material you got so what makes you different than them Hallelujah and you take bride material there has to be something that makes you worthy of being called a bride amen before man uh marries a woman the thing that that that that locks it in he's looking for a certain characteristics Hallelujah and that's what that's that's the meat of the message this morning the bride is known by our characteristics there's something that she will be identified by Hallelujah and no doubt when I think about material these these material that we're looking at they're not only in you Hallelujah they're not only in you but it's the makeup of all these materials that makes you ride because you know if you if you take my jacket and you take my pants both of them have some of the same materials in it but they're used for different things Hallelujah if you take my time even my jacket in my pants my time may have some of the same material amen but I don't wear my tie on my sleeve I wear my tie around my neck so the material in this was made for a special purpose Hallelujah the material in my jacket was made for a special purpose the materials in my shoes was made for a special purpose so I'm saying to you that the material God made in you that God put in you was made for a special purpose church if we look at the characteristics of something Hallelujah the characteristics identifies what it really is hallelujah and you know we got churches all over the world churches all over the place and some of these churches got some of the same works you got in it then Jesus he said if you if you can't believe me by my words Believe Me by the very works that I do Hallelujah so he wanted to say look at the material of my whole makeup and that's what we're looking at in this end time we're looking at the whole makeup of the believer not just you being able to pay tithes Hallelujah the Pentecostal church is doing better than you [Music] think you look better than we do they don't mind seeing a pastor in a Bentley foreign seeing them in a nice seeing some nice clothing Hallelujah they give willfully in that area Hallelujah they're made of the material to give Hallelujah in church they give and they give abundantly Hallelujah but you know with us we'll find scriptures to back up on together so you can't just say I'm right because you pay tithes they pray just as much as you pray and God pray that's right you say well Brothers I'm faithful Hallelujah Jehovah Witness got us beat every morning they are dead in the trenches knocking on the doors with dogs getting slammed in their face but they still go to the next house sure it's what they believe in what they believe in they give their whole heart and soul to it even if it's wrong and we got truth and we're not as dedicated soon as somebody don't say what we like we gone we pick everything up and we're going to another spot oh my you got Hallelujah you say well brother Jesus I I'm just tired I can't I can't go to this meeting and you know I don't feel like traveling the moment's got you beat Hallelujah when the young brothers are being trained they put them on a bicycle they tell them to go in this area and I want you to witness what makes you Pride material these boys get on the bike and they ride through the neighborhood witnessing what they believe Church well about us [Applause] so what's the material of the Bride cause we can see and and I'm and I'm being honest I'm talking about myself I can look at denominations and see areas that where they weigh more they got way more Christianity than I do Hallelujah I know I remember I was working on a job and it was a hole in his brother who worked with me and you know the boss man will say uh I need you to go do this and go do that after I'm finished I'll be like man please I didn't did my job most people know I'm a Son of God I speak things into existence and can't follow a simple instruction oh and the wholeness man he said okay all right I'm going let's go do it made me feel this big Hallelujah Church what is it about us hallelujah that even though we got so much truth there's a little bit of arrogacy in US there's a little bit of laziness in us there's a little bit there's a little bit of something in us that doesn't reflect God but we say we're Pride material holy can you love like Jesus loves when you know something is wrong thank you Jesus Hallelujah woman was brought to him and caught in adultery seen the material honey the evidence was placed right before him what did he do earlier he could look past what she did Hallelujah and speaking to her future that's bright material Hallelujah but when we see something wrong the first thing we do is we judge it by the trial Hallelujah if we judge it by the trial amen we can't receive the life of job because job went through a trial with no explanation Joe went through a trial he did nothing wrong but he was accused of his brother in Hallelujah not by his characteristics but by what he was going through wow amen says I'm here let me hit this right quick oh my the prophet of God says he says you see a man's character is made known by his works whatever you are your Works prove that you are no matter how much you testify you know some people testify because they want to be seen but let's move on whatever you say Pro or con you know some people have a special because they won't be people to know how good their voice are some people get up and play their instruments and have specials and things because they write songs and have no anointing and then the song leader after you get up and sing your special with with no anointing just because you wrote it and all these things mess up the whole service and the song leader has to get up and get the anointing back flowing again because he's being graceful unto you the Bible says be skillful in all things things you know I thank God for the people who say well brother I just can't seem they know their position they're gonna try to create an anointing Hallelujah an anointing comes with a gift [Music] now I ain't telling nobody not to sing Hallelujah but what I'm saying watch motive and objective watch out motive and objective cause you're projecting something amen there's a certain characteristic behind everything we do earlier there's the characteristics behind me preaching this word this morning what is it I'm trying to get you closer to God holy why because I don't have a church I don't have any place to bring any of you so what's my purpose here hallelujah to make your life better Hallelujah he says no matter how much you testify whether you say a pro a con that has nothing to do with it your words tell what you are tells what you are inside every job that you do manifests is what you are every job that you do Hallelujah in the church or out the church whatever you do you should do it unto the law because it's supposed to project the characteristics of Pride materials appreciate you Pride material is supposed to be able to endure suffering Pride material is supposed to endure Hallelujah being able to have patience and wait on God amen listen church if we think about character just uh just a uh uh the definition of character it says can be character can be defined listen to this as a collection of personality traits within our Behavior she's so character speaks of ingredients just one thing because one thing we might be good of but what are you collectively Hallelujah you might be good getting to church on time but that doesn't make up your character Hallelujah you might be good at praying but it has to be collectively other things that go in line with your prayer Hallelujah see church amen as Christians and people of God there's a supernatural material we're made of and it has nothing to do with the skin Hallelujah because if I'm gone and you can't see me Hallelujah what's the reality of who I am what you think about me when I'm going and the preaching is over with and my name come up hallelujah what you gonna speak about me is the characteristics that you believe and seen in me you say man that man is a good preacher but that's not the whole collection of who I am and as Believers amen amen the church-aged book amen is is is not all Who We Are the seven seal book is not all who we are being able to say God said the prophet is not all who we are because this message is a collective Hallelujah of things that God has brought back to the believer and as we receive this message we receive the character of God Hallelujah but the message is not a man exactly right are you with me Church see broad material what makes us bright because everybody believed they going to heaven we got loved ones who then died and we went to the free to to the funeral and the preacher preached him in heaven and you knew their life didn't reflect the place they was gone to your life right now Hallelujah the life you're living right now in and out the church speaks of your journey in or out the church speaks where you're going and if you would happen to Holy eyes closed and your spirit leave your body the characteristics that you've been projecting up until now tells your destiny because remember remember the prophet of God said death does not change who you are Hallelujah it only changes your Dwelling Place so let me ask you church are you dwelling in heaven you're supposed to be in heaven right now I'm not waiting on Hallelujah for my for my for my for my death sentence I'm not waiting Hallelujah for the skies to crack I'm already in heaven Hallelujah [Music] oh my God but what we have to believe about ourselves that there is a pit of potential in us hallelujah to be the wife of Christ no matter what you might look at no matter what you might think about me God put something in me to meet his requirements and what I have to do is live a life worthy Hallelujah of being called Hollywood the bride of Christ because a man ain't just going to take a woman off the street and say I'm ready to marry you no there's a certain criteria she got me amen you can say what you wanted man some some brothers like eyes Hallelujah some brothers like hair some brothers like skin tone different thing Holly and some brothers like personality just because hallelujah amen I might like hair that doesn't mean that doesn't like personality her skin tone amen her personality is a collection of the character I'm looking for because when you think of a woman hallelujah amen that had character amen you know you could say Ruth yeah Ruth was Ruth Ruth was a woman of character amen she was a woman who came from a certain place and her character but her character was moved it holy character listen to this one other thing about character we must if we must identify with your character can also be molded by influence in your life because because Ruth's character was molded by the influence of Naomi that's why the Bible says yet the younger teach the older teach the y'all and you sisters are eight you owe the sisters I put in position to help mow the character of these younger are you bright material because this is what a real wife does a real a real wife she teaches the girls up under her Shadow how to be a real wife amen amen amen praise the Lord but when we when we think about the characteristics of something we think about that the root word character everybody all right character can be identified by the collection of personality traits it's traits it's things that are already there see a trait is something that you don't add it's already there see I got treats on my father in me whether I like it or not because sometimes I do something and my mama say you ain't nothing like you just like that Gene Diggs trace of my father honey whether I ever seen him do it or not she can look at me and say I've seen this before [Applause] Hallelujah and if your bride material we should be able to see the traits of Jesus in his absence in you because when you go to acts the fourth chapter Hallelujah when the disciples came the people the Bible say they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus why because they seen the same traits Hallelujah they asked John the Baptist are you the Messiah why because they seen the traits of God inside of them we should see the same thing in us in our churches in our families Hallelujah we should see the collection of the tastes of Jesus Christ it is not something that you put on it's not something that you make up it's something that just oozes out of you some of y'all Glory when something ooze it just comes out you can't stop it she will not make it on herself bride we're just bearing the fruits of broad material because a sheep he doesn't ask for wool he just Bears it no matter what the weather's like no matter what kind of condition he's under what's in him it automatically begins to develop ment amen oh my why because the the potential of a thing is already there right and the father of God say it was potentially it was just potential and anything potential is not yet is not the real thing yet praise God it's not you not seeing it in his full form right Hallelujah give me the first video uh sister brother whoever doing it praise the Lord y'all know I be getting messed up on that saint of God okay turn the volume up when you get to it okay cute baby animals let's go listen good give me some volume oh give me a little bit more y'all hear that [Music] okay that's good that's good that's good take it down you can stop it now what is y'all hear y'all hurt you're a kitten but you know what that really was that was a roar Ed like it was a kitten maybe lying it doesn't know how to meow so even in a baby stage it was roaring [Applause] some say You're Gonna Hear My Praises Raw [Applause] Church it don't know how to be but what it is even in a baby stage it wasn't meowing you hear how harass me that cry was and you say it's cute but he's saying wait did I get bigger [Applause] hey man let's not make a mistake of the characteristics by the stages in this Hallelujah the king of the jungle traits inside of it as a material Hallelujah inside of it that calls it the king of the Beast foreign that's why you are us we should be able to say when you see me you say the father I got the traits of a king in me [Applause] you say the move is on the bride Hallelujah why because we're bribe material right right don't you know church that Jehovah Rapha is in you Jehovah Shalom is in you Hallelujah Jehovah tiskin who is in you Hallelujah the attributes of God is in his church it's in his wife hallelujah oh my but we look at that we look at that baby lion now some of y'all who are not familiar with the lion you thought that was a kitten like oh it's so cute it's so cute listen to it [Applause] and some of y'all have been around so long you still but it's time for you to roll [Applause] it's time for you to say I know who I am it's time for you Hallelujah to possess your land Hallelujah church we got inspiration we got songs that have been written that we ought to take the land little by little that song is what for the pride material we're the only ones that can look at a song and say hey that song was written for me Hallelujah go away but there's too many of us we're still in a baby stage where you got the potential to be something great you got the potential Amen to be something amen that will take notice when you're around who am I you judge something by the characteristics in it let's keep going a little bit it says this is seen in our integrity so your integrity makes up a collection a part of the collection of your character Hallelujah where is the Integrity in the church think about it Church when I think of Integrity I think of a man that tooks Abraham's wife the king who who was actually being tricked he he he was being tricked what he was doing he was following his heart he saw something he wanted and he went to get it Hallelujah but he didn't realize he was messing with bride material oh my God whoa and sometimes things will happen to you but you got to hold your integrity don't cut down on a kind of level amen keep your integrity no matter what they say about this message hold on to your integrity amen because I don't witness this message by what brother Branham did I witnessed this message by what God did in my life hey guys Hallelujah [Music] see the message is not a book and a tape the message is a person yeah go away and you know people say ah brother D's you just said you know I didn't ask I didn't have somebody uh email me and say I'll be trying to excite the people and I'll be like duh [Music] why would you want to listen to somebody who don't believe in what they preaching to you why would you want to listen to somebody who's not confident in what they telling you you can experience the same thing why would you want to listen to somebody who's telling you about the experience Hallelujah and they're not overwhelmed by it telling the testimony of it church I can tell y'all some things God has done for me Hallelujah and it gets me to shaking Hallelujah it gets me to a place brother Jack where I can say I seen him do it Hallelujah I walked in the hospital Hollywood where they say you got diabetes and walked out saying you ain't got it the doctor said I ain't got it not just my testimony their testimony Hallelujah I went to one hospital by the time it was over with the doctor was asking me how come this test negative and this test positive I said I don't know all I know is I'm Healed see when you're confident in the things of God the characteristics will make other people see what you see Hallelujah but church we as people of God like I say is when I think about integrity it brings me to this man of abimelech earlier and church she says he he he was like hey why went to Abraham was like man why did you lie to me why'd you tell me that like I said last night one of the key things we have to get out the church to identify the character of God is fear all right there's too much fear in the church we get rid of that fear we'll see some Supernatural things look at the Believers when there was no fear earlier and sometimes when you're afraid that's when God comes Hallelujah to show you who you really are look at amen look at Gideon's greatest accomplishment it was in times when he was afraid and God came on the scene he's there hiding behind the wine press and God comes and speaks into his life and tells him who he really are he's telling Gideon your bride material he says get in Hallelujah you're a mighty man of Allah and he's behind the wine press hide some of us are hiding because of fear and you know there's a word I'm so sick of hearing since Virginia Hallelujah there's a word that we've let integrate in our churches and we're trying to make it normal my anxiety wow it's gotten so common that we're in Fighting Fear in our life because it sounds intellectual my anxiety anxiety is no more than fear stop claiming that stuff over yourself have no anxiety [Applause] I believe in God I heard preachers say my anxiety touch me with my anxiety you're saying my fears I'm claiming my fears and the Bible says the thing you fear will come upon you [Applause] it's not a characteristics of bride material [Applause] my anxiety hold your butter Lord help me my church the Integrity of something will speak of his character you know it's it's like a person going through something and you don't know why they're going through it but they holy peace and they stay faithful to God they keep coming to church and all y'all can see what they're going through see Integrity Integrity will push past eyes being on them Joe's wife said how long how long will you hold on to your integrity wow will you try to keep believing in this thing and the more the trial persists the more Revelation came out of job say woman you speak as the foolish woman you expect now these words shock me you'll remember the first time already he said you expect to receive all good and no evil at the hand of the Lord so some things you think you say oh God I messed up God allows you to mess up God wanted you to mess up because it was going to give him a pathway to show you one of his characteristics his characteristics as a deliverer Hallelujah so God would allow things to happen why just to demonstrate who he is there's things in our life that brings out his traits Hallelujah oh my god listen Church when we think about character and the characteristics of something now that that little baby lion hallelujah what it is everything that's in it is already in it all it has to do is sit back and be patient see the mama and the daddy Ain't Gonna Take It on a hunt It Ain't Gonna Take It On the Hunt because they know it's not ready yet so what they'll do they'll put it in a place of protection and say wait God come back but in the waiting process that doesn't stop it from being who it is Hallelujah that doesn't stop it from being king of the jungle that doesn't stop a church look at this look at that meow and that raw Hallelujah church that that that little Roy that we heard has the potential to go five miles it's already in it but as it grows Hallelujah its vocals get stronger and stronger Hallelujah whether it knows it's happening or not it's going through a transformation as it grows there's something happening on the inside of the church while we're growing there's something happening inside of the Bride while we're waiting to walk down the altar yes you know a woman Hallelujah will she know her wedding date she falls deeper and deeper in love with the ceremony so y'all brothers ain't laughing cause you got to pay for it preach 1010 one of my close friends when she was getting married I could just see the look on her husband face her husband to be and he was like oh my God he looked like he was so drained like he was so worried about this and that inducing that and she'd been waiting for years to get married and he was like why am we spending money on this we're spending money on that so I pulled him aside and I said bro let her have this moment I said bro let her have this moment because she's been waiting a very very long time money can be replaced but this moment gonna live with her forever Hallelujah all the different bridesmaids that she call all the groomsmen Hallelujah to play the venue the food all the stuff he gonna live with her Hallelujah forever for the rest of her life Hallelujah it gonna be something that she take with her Hallelujah everywhere she go when she see you she gonna remember the ceremony and right now we're in the ceremony and some of y'all don't know who you're marrying Hallelujah you sitting around giving him mannequin worship [Applause] you change clothes but you're still in the same position Hallelujah church you can dress a mannequin up make it look real nice but it'll never speak back it'll never move it'll never talk to you why because there's no life inside Hallelujah and the real bride of Christ she will always speak back when the word is being preached because there's something inside of her that's being identified Hallelujah that's why when when Michelangelo Hallelujah created a statue of Moses everything that was in his mind was standing before him he saw the characteristics of everything that was up here until it was so real to him he said talk to me speak and when the characteristics of God hallelujah goes out of his mind into you where he becomes a real reflection God said it's not whatever I say is whatsoever you say see we see we got we got so much stuff on tape we don't even realize God is developing character in us remember the story of John Ryan holy that's not just for healing I noticed every time Jack gets up and he said we thank the Lord for the new church is that not the same thing we saw in John Ryan [Applause] thank the Lord for the new church thank the Lord for the new parking lot thank the Lord for a building we don't have to let nobody open up for us [Music] and God I'm believing you Hallelujah to do this very quickly Hallelujah words on Ryan said Hallelujah we think it's all about healing no the spoken word is for whatever you may need those characteristics of the spoken word is in you whether it be for a church or whether it be for healing in your body whether it be for your finances amen speak over your situation [Applause] but the thing about it Hallelujah ain't enough of us speaking a a wedding ceremony yeah the main two parts are the bride in the Grooms but everybody else in there make up the wedding but the thing about a powerful wedding it can be online and you'll be like man that way that went boy that went was off the hook sometimes you you you when something is so great it's so powerful you you you lose words you mean that thing was on the hizzy oh no for real on my chiller am I in the book words cannot express what God means to us and the Bible says hallelujah sometimes there's moaning and groaning that goes out they were stinking Hallelujah when you can't find the words that needs to be uttered because you think about that ceremony amen the thing about it you can look at it and watch it on a film or get a tape whatever you'll be like man that was powerful I mean he was he was it looked like it was so nice but if you was in the wedding I can tell to that person who say hey hey did you know I've seen you had on this I see you it looked like it was nice it was it was good I said you know what I was there so what you talking about I was a part of Holly I heard the tone in her voice when she said I do Hallelujah I heard the confidence in his voice when he said I will I was there and there's things about God Church Hallelujah that we can say I was there the prophet of God said when he went down Hallelujah cross he said I was there I was in him he's talking about George Washington and all the different stuff as an American I was there that's all right but I don't want to be too much identified with America because of his characteristics my mama but the experience of something brings it on a whole other level when you experience something you know what there's people watching us right now and they're sitting at home on their couches so I'm on my in the bed pillow and they watching us let me tell you something you ain't in church [Applause] if you're going through the motions I know church is on so let me do my due diligence and cut it on and watch it just in case somebody asks me what the preacher talk about but let me tell you something you ain't here so you can't feel this anointing we feel [Music] oh let me let me stop because you know one thing about Hallelujah watching me on on online you can pause me honey we gonna come back to this better yet let's fast forward him you can make me say things I ain't ready to say that you know what's made streaming so popular fear oh yeah fear has made people willing to stay home instead of being in church the fear of covering the fear of catching germs Hallelujah well let me tell you something Church there's a characteristics in our life that will always fight every germ every day every hour and it's called by his stripes we are healed so I'd rather not live in fear but I'd rather live in faith the Bible says hallelujah if these things be in you and abound you will never be buried in this scripture Hallelujah what's the base of where he preached the statue of a perfect man but if I can y'all know I'm about to close don't get nervous Church if you know this Hallelujah when you think about the the attributes of sin and fear and sickness and all these things what if I could prove to you that sickness ain't even real wow that's right I'm gonna tell you right now diabetes ain't even real cancer ain't even real yeah Hallelujah depression ain't even real ity heartache and pain ain't even real and you might be sitting right here and you say I don't know about that but I know somebody who died of cancer well let me ask you a question can somebody leave this earth before it's God's time so did they die of cancer or they die because God was ready for them to go let's put it in a proper perspective and let's go a little bit deeper in Hallelujah the prophet of God said sin is not a creation Hallelujah so if cancer is not a creation is it real if diabetes is not a creation is it real if it wasn't created that means it's a perversion Hallelujah and I want you to look at your sickness and you speak to that perversion and say I command you to go back into the original condition [Applause] what's the original condition Hallelujah of sadness Joy because Joy came from what the creation of God Hallelujah so Church we're believing in things that are not even real cancer comes from wounded cells it's not a creation in your body it's a perversion in your body so what gives it life your fear the characteristics of fear will produce sickness what is fear false evidences appearing real life but you give me a man or a woman with no fear in their life they'll operate Hallelujah under the under the potential God created them with life even though Peter was a liar cussing like a sailor ready to fight cutting off ears aiming for next y'all can say what you want I don't believe he was aiming for ear cut your hair off not in them days if they pull a sword out they were ready to use and YouTube are you coming to get my Jesus foreign I got a brother back home brother Brian Brian Jackson and when we come in church me and him will especially if I'm doing the songs are you like you know what we're gonna kill up some demons today he said don't worry about you got your thousand I got my thousand and say well let's go and what he mean is why you worshiping I'm worshiping with you Hallelujah so when we get about saying you know one thing about me when I'm worshiping you sitting there just looking at me you just give me more ammunition [Applause] you staring at me that don't make me stop that make me worship hard cause I know there's a spirit on you that don't understand what it means to give God praise the Bible says he inhabits the Praises of his people God dwells in the midst of our place so what is it in your life stopping you from giving God praise Hallelujah the Bible Hallelujah the prophet of God say God is an object of worship so what is it hithering you from worshiping got to be a perversion in your life [Applause] in your life cause you do you think anybody gonna be tired in heaven not at all and we got dreams we say boy I can't wait to get to heaven let me tell you something you ain't gonna get there without no praise [Applause] you got these teachers and different people around Hallelujah in the Pulpit trying to tell us stay away from your emotions I beg your partner all right yeah we got close with the prophet of God say anything with emotion without emotion is dead holy and these little places if it ain't got no emotion you need to go to the graveyard and bury it because I'll brother be careful be careful about your emotion glory to God well let's bring it into the simplicity if you Brothers never show any emotion to your wife how she gonna know you love her cause you get tired of you paying the bills [Applause] God give me a good enough job I'll pay the bills you got to show her some affection you got to say her name like nobody else can say [Applause] when you ain't there she's smiling waiting on you to come home cause there's something about the way you say her name [Applause] there's a characteristic behind your life but you know some of us got so much messaging us we don't even know how to woo one another [Applause] [Music] man didn't work eight hours and you stealing your nightgown you still got to have to bond it on your head I know some of my designer now but come on man [Applause] you bride it has to be more than just a certificate it has to be you being able to enter into his presence and making him enjoy you will God to enjoy me he tell the Angels shut up Deeks is singing right now [Applause] you're right my story you hold it all together [Applause] she has a song some of y'all might not like but this identifies with me all the overall me never indeed Reckless Love of God oh it chases me down if I still I'm fine leave the 99 I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it still you give yourself away all right [Music] God's love is reckless you say Brothers what you mean it's Reckless God loves you so much he'll run in a fire God loves you so much he'll run the Lion's Den God loves you so much he'll make a seapod God loves you so much he'll make a storm turn into peace yeah come on somebody his love is reckless whether God will come sit in a fire with you what other God will come see the Lion's Den with you his love is reckless [Applause] cause there's no Shadow he won't light up there's no wall he won't kick down lie he won't tear that coming after me thank you he'll keep the walls down he'll tell the lies down just to show me how Reckless is love cause I might be that one out of the 99. oh my God hallelujah we got a God that's not hindered by circumstances his love is reckless calling it but a good Reckless Hallelujah a reckless meeting Unstoppable a reckless meaning unquenchable a reckless meaning irreversible once God made his mind up about you he couldn't change it [Applause] but if we look at the characteristics or something the characteristics of a thing tells what it is I want to read you something before I get out your way listen this is in the message um uh God identified by him by his characteristics this is in a 64 320. and I'm gonna start at paragraph 14. but I want you to catch something because we're talking about bride material but I'm saying that look Church we got a lot of people and and we're not here to to put our eyes on people to try to be the judge no the only thing we want to look at is ourselves okay I I don't want to put my eyes on Jack and what Jack doing not between him and God my job is to still love him like a brother no matter what my eyes may see that's when we miss the characteristics of God when we see somebody going through something we trying to find reasons why they're going to it but I say hallelujah amen and I didn't told y'all this before the best Ministry God has ever put on the face of the Earth Hallelujah is to shut your mouth Ministry [Music] [Applause] and I'm still practicing that to this day cause I got one more girl [Applause] and she at the age where she got questions that she will fight you with the word the prophet said this and the prophet said that Hallelujah and if it's correct what you gonna do as a father you got to say okay no matter how you might feel Hallelujah you have to shut your mouth and let God deal with it see that's the hardest part brother Solomon you looking at it you saying if I don't give I don't hit the Venus then go this way this way or that way God might want it to go that way so he can deal with them and then they can see they went the wrong way and then they can come back there's always room to come back hallelujah what you have to realize as a parent Hallelujah if you dedicated your child to God they belong to him but the problem is too many of us try to take them back [Music] he said well you was raised up in church you was just using that look they know that you know you you just don't know how hard it is for them out especially kids that grew up in church the prophet of God he was talking about Billy Paul he said for Billy to go in the world he has to walk over my life [Applause] yo kids my kids if we live the life before them well they can see the characteristics of God before they smoke before they drink before they dance before they party whatever they thinking they want to do they have to think about me first [Applause] because they were raised up under a certain character amen oh my yeah and we got a promise it said raise them up in the way that you're going when they get older it won't depart from man so if you don't raise them up the entire 18 20 whatever they is and they may I'm gonna flash back on y'all use some owl words they may be out there going Buck Wow see y'all young people don't know nothing about that one that's one of the hours all right that means losing a mind because you think about a bucket going crazy because somebody on his back and he want it all and young kids go out there in the world don't realize it's the devil on their back and the other thing they go cause everybody trying to get the devil off they back but the only way you can get them off is to come back to God [Applause] cause you take a wild horse how do you tame it by love sir you can get it you can get it you can get the greatest Cowboy ever he'll jump on there and he'll get bucked too but it ain't that horse gonna only stop bucking till he feel like his life is not in danger Hallelujah okay what time more time okay listen uh paragraph 14. let's look at the characteristics of something right now he's talking about animal life and his first time a reason to talk about a sheep and a deer they look similar and they got some of the same characteristics but we're gonna pull some things out of here for broad material all right listen he says now if you didn't know the difference when you was tracking a sheep or a deer now he's talking about hunting and he's and he's hunting for something he said you didn't know the difference in tracking a sheep or a deer you couldn't tell the difference less you was a shrewd Hunter see well again what I'm gonna deal with tonight what separates the hunter experience why he said because they make the same kind of tracks there are churches got the same tracks you got right they listening to the same message you listening to they praying to the same God you praying amen got some of the same tracks they bow when they run away and and then you see one standing at a distance with his head head why you would hardly know the difference they operate under some of the same humility you do come on looks like the same bow [Music] look you ever seen somebody in the store uh a sister that dressed got a long skirt you can immediately identify that some kind of Christ somewhere in there right because of how she's dressed and you have a little confidence in approaching a Why by what you see oh my God but that ain't it remember it's a collective of things listen he says they're about the same size across the wrong part it's white just like the deer it'll be very hard to tell them listen to this but his horns identify as characteristics and horns type out the pouring of the anointing and it's the horns of a sheep and a deer that tells what is what now if you go in the word you look in the Bible Hallelujah Saul and David had the same Horn of oil poured on them by the same prophet so what made Saul any different from David or David any different from Saul being able to commit to the anointing in their life Saul was just as anointed as David was but what Saul can do Saul couldn't self-reflect under that anointing but David could when Saul made mistake it was the people it was just it was the witchy Angel he was just he was dead it was everything it was everybody else but Saul right when God said go down there kill hey gag kill all the Hamlet guys so I heard the word went out to do it and got distracted see the real anointing of God the prophet God said what is the anointing supreme power under control knowing how and what [Music] so it's the anointing in your life that separates you Hallelujah from any other kind of church you being able to surrender under that anointing and I'm not talking about just good singing amen because they'll blowout doors off everybody but they were getting down and one of my favorite songs they saying turn it around turn turn Taffy little Taylor out her turn it around and they'd be saying that song but but what separates different singing it and me singing it Hallelujah is that me Hallelujah I'm not singing it under a homosexual anointing [Applause] y'all don't have a homosexual leading to worship you got a man of God you got a man who knows who he is so when he's saying that song there's a certain characteristic following it or characteristics of Deliverance [Music] yeah I'll sing their song but I'll sing it under a different anointing not the same anointing and you know them people I heard that song writing in the blue book and this and that man please this light like that like they said this 20 20. got time to be arguing with you about who wrote the song whoever wrote it I'm singing it now and I'm singing it under the anointing of the Holy Ghost [Applause] no Shadow you won't light up Hallelujah what is that anointing and God tells him specifically what to do he's hearing directly from a prophet and he knew that Prophet had the voice of God coming through Saul could hear it and not respect it and you know we're in that day well I don't think brother Brown meant that I don't think brother Brown I mean I don't think but what about what your spirits say inside the Holy Ghost Inside will agree with truth bring that praise God hallelujah and if it's God hallelujah it won't pull you into a sinful characteristic oh the Bible say when you're being drawn away you're being drawn away by your own lust you know what that means that means you really want to do it [Music] but the hell because of covet you want to stay home all alone God just God just allowed us to happen so you could show who you really are and now your home staying church member streaming believer I heard all right Spencer saying this tire was just covered and people weren't coming to church and you don't you know they could go on the street and see if you watching it or not and they were streaming and this and that you know people knew certain people were staying home and they started to have what they call a potluck we call it we call it Fellowship dentals yeah bring your food bring your dish and sometimes we call it a cookout oh yeah but they were having a potluck and he said hey if you ain't been coming to church this pot look ain't for you continue to stay home [Applause] you're saying brother Randy Hallelujah cause you know what's gonna happen when we stepped into this new building hallelujah it's gonna be people coming we ain't seen for months cause they gonna hear the news all spirit and two guys we got a new building we owe you a part of the church now but ain't nobody seen you in months and now you we you a part of it now we oh let me tell you you might as well start making your way back cause it's gonna happen [Applause] it's gonna happen don't be one of them people we're gonna be looking at all side at when you walk through the door where you been at oh you're back in church now you've been out the country don't be one of them people hallelujah as you can see ain't no covet in here [Applause] only thing in here is Jesus [Applause] people still using that iron Cove at this and I just got to be aware protect yourself I thought it was the blood protecting us [Applause] [Music] but look so everybody all right so he wouldn't allow himself to self-reflect under that anointing but when David did wrong and things happen in David life like we were saying the other night about Bathsheba and what David did and God allowed all that to rise up if David had premeditated murder inside of him that wasn't a part of God characteristics so what God began to do was beat that goal wow God began to beat that goal David had lying inside him God started to beat that goal David had sneaky things inside God began to beat that goal all that came out of one trial [Music] and he was a King David let's let's take let's go in a little bit deeper with it the Bible says he was a man after God's very own heart he thought like God thought he felt what God felt [Music] oh but he had to go through something to get the real characteristics of God to be pure so God let him go through something to get all that filth out of him Hallelujah all that lying premeditated murder cheating and scheming and all that stuff get it all out and then God hallelujah you know one thing about self-reflection what helps you to self-reflect the hearing of the word because Saul heard the word from a prophet and couldn't self-reflect But Here Comes The Prophet Hallelujah talking to David the same one who poured the oil the same anointing and now David Hallelujah Nathan is telling me say look because there was a man who had one Sheba the other one had a hundred and this and that on and on y'all know the story and what I love about it Hallelujah God by the time he finish with David he said hey you you know how we operate if you wanted another one all you had to do was ask you don't have to be Shady you don't have to be hating on the next brother or sister because God blessing Hallelujah all you got to do is ask tell y'all don't hate on me when y'all see me riding around in my Maserati [Applause] well he ain't a manager he's well I ain't supposed to be blessed your faith might be on the Corolla level [Applause] ain't nothing wrong with that if that's where your faith that you operate in it Hallelujah but my Faith's gonna turn heads [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah hooray our faith should change the world but look when Nathan comes he says all this stuff David says I'ma kill him whoever he is I'm gonna kill him and like yeah David you need to kill yourself because I'm talking about you and David didn't even recognize what he was doing to the word beginning to show him what was happening and then he could self-reflect and David the first thing David said Lord I have seen he didn't blame it on he didn't even blame it on Bathsheba when the prophet said she knew he'd come out there a certain time and she come out there and do it on purpose what Oh my he didn't blame it on best she we didn't blame it on nobody he said Lord I have seen I did this and right then and then he received Mercy when you confess your sins the next thing for you to receive is Mercy Hallelujah amen because there's always a warning before judgment and now David receives Mercy why because he was able to self-reflect under the anointing that's bright material he says but the horns identify the characteristics but them by them horns the anointing the Sheep has the horns that's round Hallelujah see Church the anointing in this bride Hallelujah is well-rounded amen I mean one time Jack preached a message he was preaching about being sober Christians let's be sober don't be joking about all the Miracles and all let's be sober all right let's understand what we have and do not have right let's be sober Hallelujah see he says his Horn's around he said and a deer has prongs that run out see they run out here I am I want to be seen look at my anointing it's time for me to sing a special I'm the same expression giving us more than what we want and other things a deer wouldn't go quite that high to feed you hear that a deer won't go that high to feed but a sheep will go to the highest Heist to feed on their words deer be like I'm good as long as I'm able to make it to church on time I'm good I don't you know I don't want to get emotional I ain't no need to say hallelujah I believe we got the word foreign okay let's keep going he said and then the goat walking also there is a characteristics in a goat and a sheep see it went from sheep to Deer now to sheep to Gold it went from Deer Hallelujah which is a make-believer now it's going to Goat which is a unbeliever but they're both being compared to a sheep which is a True Believer but you can see some of the same characteristics in that sheep that's in that deer and in that gold some of the same material but listen he says and then the goat walking also there is a characteristic goat and a sheep that you would have to know the difference in them when you are up high so I don't know about you but Jack bro smiley but you can tell when people got spirits on them when the anointing fall down and God started to deliver and did and deal with people and and want to bring them into something High they're gonna take a water break time to go feed the baby got to get out of that presence well he said you identify you tell the difference how by its walk right but it's like by its walk right now Hallelujah the characteristics of this bride is showing her walk I don't know about you amen I can go to the beach but I can't go naked what's up my walk won't allow me to do it I can go to a restaurant with a bar Hallelujah but I can't drink why because that ain't a part of my walk my walk is different you know some people say well ain't nothing but a little casual wine High Castle you got to get it cause when we was younger we had a wine called MD and drinking that way I will make you lose your mind praise God Mad Dog think about the church why would you drink something called Mad Dog it's telling you what it's gonna do to you the person who made it they were inspired by the name they call it Mad Dog and as they get drunk over that wine they turn into a Mad Dog ready to fight everything ready to cuss everything ready to do all that while it was the walk that identified it he said but hurry the Sheep came to go can't go as high as the Sheep he said because they both dwell in high mountains he said you know the difference but if you notice a goat stumbles himself as he walks all right look at the look at it look at the wording good dumbled himself it's something he's doing he wasn't tricked it's something he's doing stumbles himself by the things he desires and normally when somebody stumbles they get back up stumble and get back up stumble and get back up but that sheep hallelujah look at it he said he stumbles himself as he walks where a sheep sets his feet down like this as he walks so what that sheep does he pays attention to where he's stepping he sets himself Hallelujah before he goes and makes a step Hallelujah because he doesn't want to stumble himself right right yes you see the characteristics see the characteristics that makes up a bride Hallelujah before they do anything they pray about it because they don't want to stumble themselves they don't just follow their hearts you got people say well I'm following my heart the Bible say the heart is wicked and deceitful Above All Things who can trust it you just follow your heart you go stumble yourself [Applause] that's exactly right but that's sheep Hallelujah he sets his feet he prays about it he gets under Hallelujah a channel where you can hear from God and when he makes a step he steps in confidence amen those are the characteristics of bright material let's keep going he said he sets his feet down like this and he walks the characteristics the way he makes his tracks even the way he steps hardly as he steps and steps and steps the holy the tracker can look and say that's a sheep by the trail he's leaving behind and your testimony honey the life you live will tell us whether you're a Believer or Not by the tracks you make yeah think about it yeah I'm just being honest I know some people who consider to be Believers and I've asked you know do you know so-and-so like that man please [Music] because of the tracks they've made the life they live I want all of us to examine Hallelujah our name our our characteristics who we are when we're not in one another's presence what they'll say about you I ain't saying I ain't saying everything they say true but I'm saying you got to know that you live in a righteous life you know one thing one one thing about Family Hallelujah your kids they know who you really are all right that's why when things happen things go down Hallelujah I make sure amen that I'm right in the eyes because I don't have to worry about defending myself they will mess with me if you want them my girls I tear you off better not mess with their daddy Kobe Bryant ain't invented a girl dad Hallelujah some of us been there a long time Hallelujah before you ever put a ball in his hands some of us have been tending to these girls and they see the real you your children see the real you they see if you study when you at home or the only time you pick up a Bible is when you come to church oh [Music] please don't turn me into the Bloodhound [Applause] the characteristics of your life Hallelujah should be more than just a church person in church yes sir amen but you should have a reflection on you when you're out there in the world you know I I Fellowship among Hallelujah unbelievers when I'm at the gym and all of them call me rap but they know there are certain things I ain't gonna do holy when they start getting together maybe be somebody new coming to the gym and they'll be like they like me in the gym because we all be clowning and cutting up having a good time but when it comes to the real you Hallelujah when they get ready to go part and everything and somebody asks say y'all gonna invite rap they speak up for me on their own Reb ain't gonna come to this and ain't nobody feelings hurt why because they respect you when you're real and they'll be ducking in high and you know they appreciate somebody who got conviction but those of us who one minute you in the church and next minute you ain't taking you serious ly why are you doing it because some of y'all be practicing in the mirror you ain't going to the club but the club in your mirror at the house let me see if I can do this damn you might as well go do it it's in your heart just go and cut the music on get it out your sister go ahead and self-reflect listen I'm about to close don't get nervous this is as you identify your gay he said the characteristics the way they make it make his tracks you identify your game by the characteristics of what it does now he's going to the tracks to what he does he said and how it acts now we're talking about Brown material what you do and how you act tell us whether you buy material he said and what it feeds listen we just met a young man he started talking about Gino Gino Jenkins Gino Gino Jennings and like I told him I said one thing about Gino Gino gonna bring you back to the to the scriptures and you're gonna say the Bible says the Bible says that the Bible says that but at the same time he doesn't have the understanding we have but I can appreciate him for the for what he's trying to do Hallelujah get people to Christ but then again what I'm gonna talk about tonight there's another level there's another level than being able to compare verse with verse Hallelujah it takes the problem the the property the church he's saying it takes a special person we're not just comparing verse to verse for the sake of an argument exactly hallelujah what he feeds and everything it identifies Itself by the characteristics and this is what I love he's saying and then you jump one you know what he's saying you put a deer I mean you put a goat and you put a sheep you got both of them standing there you walk up on them you jump at one and the characteristics that tell you what it is that sheep just gonna stand there and look at you but that goat gonna put his head down and he gonna charge you Hallelujah why because he know he got something on his head he got something on his head that could hurt you we're not using the revelation of this hour to hurt people that's not the characteristics of a sheep [Applause] I'd like to see but I just stand there and look at you how you doing crazy stuff hallelujah hallelujah but that goal even people who got ghosts as pets they trying to go on YouTube they turn around and they be like stop stop you back on up they'd be like Julie don't do it Judy don't Judy hey let me tell you something he don't be playing is in his nature of the book and he didn't mutant fan and you didn't gave it food you didn't put it in a nice house a barn put a put a shelter over his head and it'll still turn his back on you that's like people come into church Jack you feed them you give them good word good atmosphere we worship and saying and when something happened they still talk bad about spirit and Truth all right all right all right wow a bunch of goats yeah and let me say this I ain't no better than nobody I got my own issues I go through I'm preaching by experience Hallelujah and you know sometimes you go through things you think you gotta write to do what you're doing I don't feel like I don't feel like singing I don't feel like worse I don't feel like nothing I remember one time I was going through something I was getting depressed and you know what happened I stopped dressing up coming to church start wearing jeans and Jordans sitting in the back of the church and a brother he started noticing me he went on vacation he was on vacation he called me he said give me a call when you uh you get this message and I can honestly say me and him we don't call each other and talk all the time we go to the same church we respect each other this and that praise God this and that but we not always on the phone hollering and talking to each other but he started to see something Hallelujah and out of love how do he call me hey I know you you might be going through something he said but you know ain't my business Ain't Nobody Business he said but let me tell you something though he said I saw you sitting in the back of the church and I thought to myself that is not brother Diggs and the next thing that came out of his mouth he said hey don't let the devil steal your joy that's right that's what happened Hallelujah people leave God leave church because they lose their Joy David said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation in the midst of his child because once you lose the joy of a thing it's easy to step away from it a preacher can't preach if there ain't no joy in it a singer can't sing if it ain't no joy in it there has to be some Joy and you know when he said that it was like a check yeah you know it's like the green light came on you're like hold up bro all them clothes you got and you wearing jeans to church you enjoy the church that next service yo I put on a three piece come on brother I put on a three-piece hat that hanky had the cufflinks had to tie everything and I boss up in there like a son of God [Applause] I found somebody like a Son of God I was walking but it was looking like I was doing the moonwalk and I walk up in there let the devil know I'm back in position and I sing and worship like I never sang and worship before holy cake is a word to restore and bring out those characteristics that's already there Hallelujah yeah we get discouraged sometimes yeah we get upset we get angry but can you self-reflect those are the characteristics of the Bride can you self-reflect he said indeed you jump one and watch what happens you can tell the way they go you can tell by the characteristics of different animals so Church there's more things we can say but I think you get it when we're talking about bride's material remember there's a collection of things that make up Who You Are so just make sure you got your ducks in a row and and I ain't talking about your own checklist I'm talking about your self-reflection y'all know what I do there's times where I get along with God and I begin to inquire of him what he have for me not what I have what he have for me and I begin to inquire of him and I lay before him and I wait until it's made clear right now I don't know about y'all but I've seen him do it I've been in service Hallelujah with tones and interpretation come and they talking directly to me by name foreign not something where the devil can come and say well that was for the whole church no I'm talking about something for you your name was called God talked directly to you I ain't talking about something oh brother Brandon call somebody name they was in he said and this happened in West Palm Beach no he call your name [Applause] we are in Bible days Church you know you know even in that message I'm thinking about and I'm trying to close I'm thinking that message I've seen him do it it take me to Hallelujah Hebrews 11. all right and you're talking about Harley the things of faith that had happened you know in one place he said cold the mouth of lions all right we're in that day we're in that time Hallelujah there was a person in Zimbabwe watching somebody's child Hallelujah and as he was watching the child they left the back door open and the child went out the back door and then they don't know how long the child was going they went to looking for the child and they couldn't find the child not only that day that whole day the next day they sent out everybody looking for the child listen that a little baby baby couldn't even talk we're wondering out in in in in the woods of Zimbabwe in church somebody saw a group of lions sitting around a little baby [Music] lions were sitting around the baby and the baby

pump the brakes on and do something I want you to catch the full inspiration of it but but while they're working on it I'll just kind of tell you the scene of it that first the first one we showed you that line in the baby stage and it was raw and it was like and it looked like it's like it's saying me I don't know it was roaring and in that moment it was very adult adorable and people put their

the overwhelming never-ending Reckless Love of God come on give them Praise In This Place my God my God how many appreciate and [Music] you know I was just thinking to myself as he was preaching the same man he is one of a kind [Music] of a Kind a ain't nobody like brother Diggs just uh just the way God made him and I love just the maturity there he was talking about how somebody uh criticized them for exciting the people you know and and I have to say this it's evident that whoever wrote that didn't know brother Diggs and what I mean by that they don't know his story amen and see when you don't know my story you don't understand why I act the way I act and why I do the things I do you don't know my story right and and I mean a man that was uh uh pretty much on his deathbed you know and having to go through a cancer surgery at a very very young age God bring him out of that you know and um I mean you got something to be excited about I'm a man that's been chained from Death to life right and you know and other things that you know we have seen just throughout the years I remember brother Diggs coming here a blind man came to Okeechobee to preach it was a blind preacher coming Okeechobee and uh when he came you know he could not see uh the only time his eyes was open is when he'd open up his Bible and he read his text and he start preaching but soon as he closed the Bible the eyes would close again and uh he went to Golden Corral praise the Lord and he need a little help to get some food and bro smiling I just told him to say look man if you want some food you have to go go up there and get it yourself because I ain't got time to be feeding myself then trying to feed you to your grown man you have to get up and go eat get it yourself brother dick say okay if that's the way it is I'm going to get it myself and from that day God healed them and he's never been the same sex and you're gonna tell this man not to get excited [Music] when God do something like that for you I guarantee you'll get excited too praise the Lord amen but the maturity to be able to respond to a person like that and say look uh you know who would want just a dead man talking to him oh yes of course I I need to have some excitement and and some join what I'm doing then I can present that to the people and they get excited about it you know uh I I look at the church today and I got my little my little niece here and and I when I when I announced and told them that brother Duke's going to be here how old are you Kennedy nine nine years old and um mama told us and the brother D's going to be there in a certain such a weekend and my niece has to kind of coordinate her schedule a certain way so she can be in church and she went and coordinated all the different people she I'm I'm talking about a lot of coordination and I ain't gonna be able to be here this weekend I can't do this at nine years old she got this thing all mapped up Church on Friday night church on on Sunday morning I need to be there and I know you know Saint Saints I want to come and you know hear the word of God and we appreciate that but like he told us today streaming is different I don't stream but I know what I'm talking about and for me I mean when I've been I've actually tested positive for covet I did amen I tested positive and I did the right thing by not coming to get everybody sick I did the right thing see but when I was home streaming I was having a very hard time I can't wait to get back into the house of God and if you're a streamer you ought to feel the same way I can't wait to get in the house of God it's something about people telling you about what happened then you experiencing yourself I don't want you to tell me what happened I want to be there to experience it myself so I tell you come on down the church doors are open amen the doors of the church are open come on to the house of God and like I say streaming got popular through fear fear did it we don't want to be operating like that and then I'm not saying I'm gonna be the covet is real covet is real that's something I think people don't create it but it's real people get sick from it they do they do but I tell you what God is still a Healer he's a deliverer and uh you don't have to be afraid of it don't don't be walking around being in fear don't God and gave you the spirit of fear so much it was saying here today even though and don't use words like my anxiety I I've been I've been waiting on the Lord for a sermon and I'm going to preach on that because it just seems to be so accepted but I want y'all to watch something just something that I've been watching um the generation that came in unto us that generation is going through a lot of anxiety and and mental issues they're they're they're and and they many of them talk about going through these mental things and uh it's a spirit don't forget that every sickness is a spirit no matter what medicine they can give you to try to help you steal a spirit if diabetes is a spirit cancer is a spirit right high blood pressure a spirit all these things are spirits and brother Brandon went to a deeper level at these things not just through science and medicine but he found he went to the root of it the spirit right and uh you know so a lot of a lot of a lot of young people you know and and really realize now the scripture actually say that we would be weaker foreign [Music] that seems to be going through a lot of the uh depression and uh just a lot of mental things that they go through it's a real thing I'm not trying to belittle it in any way it's a real thing watch the Next Generation that's coming behind them and if you know if you don't notice in the Next Generation coming home we have a lot of children in the Next Generation that are fighting autism that's another spirit and now if that generation lives and has children what will they with what will their children be fighting we got to break this Spirit now and one of them is that not not claiming things [Applause] I ain't gonna be claiming it amen hallelujah he came to set the captain free and I'm free indeed so I mean just just be careful what you let come out your mouth Lord I Thank you for the new church in the new school I thank you for healing my body I thank you for healing my children I thank you for every provision that you've made I
