TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] we want to welcome you to the house of the lord tonight uh certainly good to be in his presence those that are joining us online we welcome you also to the house of the lord um i mentioned on a sunday that we wanted to just kind of do a special at least start a teaching tonight being that this is the first wednesday year we're kind of doing something a little different we will get back to our study on ephesians chapter two but i wanted to just inject something here tonight and and don't know if i have enough time to get through all the material tonight so uh maybe tonight and maybe next wednesday and um and we'll just take it from there but we wanted to just do a special teaching on dreams and uh just trust that the lord will just speak to our hearts in this so before we get started tonight let us just bow in a word of prayer and then we'll pull up the scripture in acts chapter 2. let's just pray father we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity that we have to um lord just gathering to and to and to uh worship lord and uh to hear your word to sit at your feet we we we thank you for that uh we pray god tonight that you would just reveal yourself to us through your word that you'd help us lord to see what it is that you want us to see in god that we would just align ourselves accordingly and father um just want to also whisper a prayer for our nation and all the things that are going on here in our nation and god i pray that you just keep your people covered you would um um keep them under the cover of your wings that no evil would come their way and uh lord we uh we know that we're citizens of another kingdom and lord you are our king you are our lord you are our master you are our leader and we thank you for that god so help us lord jesus just to navigate in these troublesome times in which we all live lord we're looking for for today that you will come for us and now take us home now our prayer is just as john prayed at the end of the book of revelation even so come lord jesus so father we just pray tonight as we come and gather here that you would just minister to all of our hearts in jesus name we pray amen amen uh i want to go to the book of acts and um we'll read and um start at verse 15 this is the verse that we actually read on sunday and um i wanted to just uh uh read this again as we uh just get started in this teaching uh tonight teaching on dreams here in acts 2 verse 15 it says for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams now we want to make that clear as uh is these are not the only people that would dream dreams uh are the old men uh but what we hear what we gather from the scriptures that god will use dreams now god will use prophecy god will use all of those things uh in these last days so this is something that we should look forward to in the body of christ it says verse 18 and all my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out uh in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will shall wonders in the heaven in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved so thank god for his word my first quote is going to come out of the message moses um i have it listed there on the on the page and as we're just getting that prepared i wanted to first just start off by saying when we're talking on this subject i realize that this is what we would consider a delicate uh subject especially if you're gifted in this area this could be a delicate subject and uh you know i do understand that but i also want to say that i really believe that god uses dreams and he uses visions according to scripture according to joel 2 what we read in acts 2 is actually a fulfillment of what joel to spake and um you know so joel 2 speaks it and prophesies it and then acts 2 as a fulfillment but what joel 2 said is that in the last days so what was fulfilled at pentecost is still being fulfilled uh even today i mean even today so we have to be very careful uh we don't want to have a um an approach where we don't welcome gifts no we welcome gifts in this body we welcome gifts there's just a certain way things must be done in order for god to be glorified all right so uh so here we what we're looking to do is try to establish both a scriptural approach and uh even also using uh information from the message you know the prophet has given us very clear instructions so we want to try to bring all those things together as we teach on dreams amen so our first quote is coming out of the message uh moses and the prophet says this he says now um it's to my humble belief that gifts gifts are not handed out you know i forgot to read a scripture um let me hold on one second romans 11 29 i forgot to read that amen romans 11 29. amen all right romans 11 20 11 29 it says this um for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance so uh let's just go now into this quote it'll it'll bring out um that scripture it says now it's to my humble belief that gifts are not handed out with hands amen that that means i can't pray over you and give you a gift especially when it comes to dreams or visions and all that you we don't pray these are things that people are born with amen so to my humble belief that gifts are not handed out with hands gifts are for ordained of god gifts and callings are without repentance so you know oftentimes people have gifts uh before they even come to know the lord like you if you were a dreamer or a person that could see visions i know people that see visions and don't even know jesus praise the lord right don't even know jesus but they see all kind of visions they just be perfectly right right and there are people that could have dreams that don't know the lord that have not surrendered their life to the lord so you know uh gifts and callings are without repentance you know the scripture tells us but brother branham says gifts are for ordained of god gifts and callers are without repentance you can say things and try and make these things act right and believe right and to work right but they are not uh but they are not unless but they are not unless god himself is behind it right so we don't get anything from it unless god himself is behind the gift he said it's nothing it's not nothing you try to bluff a man you can't bluff satan he won't be bluffed you've got to know where you're standing that's right and gifts and callings are without repentance they're born into the world god foresees things and knows his prophecy what's coming to pass and he starts something here to meet it up there and when he's seeing that the time of the people's going to need this he had a little boy born peculiar at birth by the name of moses he was given the name name of moses from pharaoh's daughter because he was taken from the water if you know the bible uh sunday school story of it so you know brother branham's just using the life of moses and saying how that gift was for ordained of god uh god could see certain things but getting ready to come upon the earth certain things given to come upon his people and he ordained the gift to be there to actually help assist the people praise the lord uh if we can catch this a gift is actually that comes to actually help assist god's people amen if we can get that a gift comes to assist a gift does not come to magnify itself but a gift comes to assist the body of christ hallelujah brother branham when he came on the scene what did that do it assisted the body of christ glory to god when god gives you a man a pastor that's to assist you amen god gives you an evangelist that's to assist you and any gift that god gives to the body a teacher you know uh uh you know all the fivefold ministry any of that god uses to assist his people bring the people to perfection right so gifts are are are without repentance but gifts are used once they're surrendered to god they're used to actually help the people they're used to help the people glory to god amen amen amen little um as i i'm a go to this next quote out of palmer worm locust and cankerworm caterpillar uh just something that recently um was shared with me and and and i had to just evaluate this you know brother branham made a statement about um the threefold mystery of christ he says that there was three things that god had in his mind that he wanted to do one he wanted to reveal himself to his people uh two he wanted to have the preeminence in his body of believers and three he wanted to restore the people back to eating conditions again and the minister said his brother eugene braun he said you know what i found in my ministry is that you know um most of my sermons are going to always deal with one of these three folds right whether it's to reveal god to the people whether it's to help people get to a spot where they're allowing god to have the preeminence in them or to just share with them how we're going back to eating conditions again he said most of the time my message is going to always kind of deal with that area glory to god one of those three areas and i think you know when when we look at this because this is what's important to the body of christ you know uh that threefold mystery is what's really important to the body of christ so you know let's go on a little further here amen in uh in this uh he says the palmer worm out of the message pomegranate cankerworm caterpillar he says i've seen a lot i've seen a lot called discernment right so sometimes people think they have discernment but it's not really discernment amen right he said i've seen a lot called discernment i don't believe him he says but i know there's truly a discerning spirit of god he says uh the gift of knowledge that calls and speaks and it's perfect every time now i want to tell you something this is what we're desiring uh that's something that's going to be perfect every time hallelujah you don't want to miss with this you know uh i was um uh sharing with you all you know just uh she told me i could call her name but i don't i don't want to call her name um a relative of mine was just sharing a dream with me that she had and and the dream was saying uh the portals of heaven are open the portals of heaven to open and you know and um you know really didn't take much much to interpret that but you know the the thing of it is is that what i got from is that the portals were open for her right and uh you know because she kept telling people in the dream can't you see the portals are having to open the portals i say yes see see god is showing you that the portals of heaven are open for you so you got to get in wise open you got to get in right and i say but now since you shared it with me praise the lord i'm going to claim that the portals of heaven are open for me because the bible says the secret things belong unto the lord our god but once they are revealed then they belong to us so i'm taking it personally since you gave it to me i'm gonna say the portals are open for me so you know she was uh saying how her pastor also was uh uh giving you know different comments and and everything about this and you know and uh and then um you know from there the pastor went to sharon about some other dreams and you know some of the things that i was listening to i said i don't know if i agree with that you know and and then the pastor went on to kind of say that you know the lord told the pastor that uh it was going to be president trump well when the election went the other way the lord i mean the pastor stayed by stood by the lord told me and then the bishop started going against the pastor hallelujah they husband and wife praise the lord and they start going and the bishops say now they ain't what god told me i'm saying wait a minute we want something that's going to be perfect every time right we don't want we don't want confusion in the body of christ because the bible plainly states that when people get things wrong like that they supposed to be stoned now that's the bible but now my grace is extended today so brother branham say go to the altar and get that evil spirit off of you praise the lord because do you realize that evil spirit can get in the midst of a gift i want you to catch that a evil spirit can get in the midst of a gift that's why it's so important that we align these things according to scripture because we don't want an evil spirit on us now i can tell you real quickly how you how you know you got an evil spirit if you get offended by what i'm saying you got a bad spirit because i'm giving you the words praise the lord all right i'm going on it says this it says uh uh but i know there's truly a discerning spirit of god the gift of knowledge that calls and speaks and is perfect every time he says we're earnestly contending for that amen i almost i i embolded that and wanted to highlight it in my notes we are earnestly contending for that that i mean wears perfect every time look he says that faith that was once delivered to the saints i know there's dreams and and stomach uh and stomachs full of fresh meats are all uh are are or are full of something other another that causes you to have nightmares now think about what he just said you can get your stomach full of something and it'll cause you to have a nightmare amen and you actually think it's coming from god but your stomach was full of something oh my right it says uh uh caused you to have nightmares and you jump up and call it a vision but there's a real genuine vision of god that's right god promised it amen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he does that and it never fails the bible says if there be one among you who's spiritual or prophet and let him speak and what he says if it comes to past and hear him for i'm with him if it don't don't hear him amen this is this is this is all right to me i mean uh you say something the lord told you this lord tell you that and that thing don't come to pass the bible tells us not to listen to you amen now that's not that's not uh you know a thing where you know people are disassociating themselves no no the bible says don't listen you can't keep coming up saying the lord said this lord no the last thing did not come to pass now i'm i'ma just be honest with you you know we watched somebody say the lord said this lord said that we start documenting especially you give dates and times we document when did you say that was going to happen praise the lord because when it don't happen now you're looking for ways out of it no and what we just found out that's an evil spirit praise the lord amen look at this he says uh let him speak and what he says if it come to pass and hear him from with him if it don't don't hear him because he's a false prophet god can't lie god tells the truth all the time amen let it be so now we find that that's the truth there's those things right so he goes on in this next quote and i'm just i'm gonna just kind of share a number of things here just to lay our platform uh on this and you know i pray that this be something that you know if there's ever a question you can go back to this tape and listen to it this is how we want to handle things here you know in some churches uh gifts just completely just all just about rule the church praise the lord i might as well just be honest gifts rule the church i know some churches certain people that have a dream a vision or whatever they get up and said before the church and the church just stop everything they're doing because this person said nobody checked it to see if it was accurate nobody praise the lord so you got to have we got to have this thing in order a gift can't run the church and then if that gift if people don't accept that gift amen then they end up leaving the church praise the lord that's the truth in it huh i i i'm telling the truth you know i you all know uh you well i'll i'll tell you maybe you don't know this but the the story i'm going into this uh greater than solomon is here that's my next quote uh but there's a story of a man in the bible he was an advisor to the king his name was a hitherfail and a hitherfail had a tremendous role by being the advisor to the king but uh but one time a hitherfail came out and gave some advice and uh and when he gave the advice um another guy i forget his name he stood up and said no i don't think that's the right advice let's do it this way right and uh and and everybody agreed with the other guy so hitherfail got so offended that people did not accept his gift can i put it that way people did not accept his advice people did not accept his gift that a hitherfail went home and hung his self all because his gift was not accepted now there's something wrong when you when you when you get that upset that you'll leave a church because your dream wasn't accepted hallelujah right amen your vision wasn't accepted amen don't don't allow your your your your your uh your gift to get that high right that it's above the word of god amen look the bible actually tells you that a man's gift makes room for itself so you don't have to get mad about a gift never get mad about a gift never never allow that to happen to you it shows that there's something wrong there all right i'm going further i'm going further praise the lord it says um in this message of greater than solomon is here he says prophets have the word of god and are born the prophet now um and now i'm gonna just tell you some people like to use this quote the wrong way because you know when a prophet don't actually have to have his um his prophecy checked by nobody amen a gift of prophecy has to be checked a gift of prophecy has to go through discernment so what people do to try to bypass discernment they say i was born a prophet praise the lord i'm i know what i'm talking about here tonight they they say i was born a prophet no no no no no no no no no what you're trying to do with that statement is bypass the order that the prophet established for us amen amen amen glory to god prophets have the word of god amen so if you're born a prophet what's the word that's coming forth amen right prophets have the word of god and are born a prophet a gift of prophecy is different that's a gift amen now there's uh nine he said there's five ordained gifts in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists now that is the five gifts that god places in the church by his for knowledge then there's nine gifts that's locally in the church speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues a gifts of wisdom amen and knowledge and prophecy and so forth them's nine spiritual gifts that operates through the church but there's not five offices that god puts in the church and oh how we love to see them all operating he says one of them is a pastor teacher and those things then the other comes along and confirmation hallelujah so see what what happens first god establishes by giving the fivefold ministry and then the other gifts come along in confirmation to those gifts all right church glory to god hallelujah let me i want to make sure i nail that one down the other gifts come along in confirmation to that gift not to lead that gift praise the lord because people will use their gifts in order to try to lead the pastor that's not the way things are supposed to go it your your gift comes on in confirmation hallelujah i'm reading what the prophet said amen all right it says one of them is pastor teaching those things and i mean even even you can't you you cannot supposed to leave any of the five-fold minister with it with a dreaming gift you're not supposed to do it it's supposed to come and confirm all right he says one of them is a pastor teaching those things then the other comes along in confirmation gifts are to magnify that's what the prophet said gifts are to magnify and god's just got got it so even a fool will not be excused i like that god got it god got the thing so right that even a fool can't be excused from this he says willie it says it's so simple the way god has made them and i like that look at this statement the more simpler you become the greater you'll become before god if you ever want to be exalted make yourself humble hey man make yourself humble if you ever want to be exalted just make yourself humble i can give you all an example just somebody that that's that's that that that that's very humble very humble and and god exalted them in our midst i'm gonna use brother kwaku for an example you all know how brother kwaku came here to the church didn't even know there was a message church here in the area didn't even know happened to see sister amanda in school and had a conversation you know and she told them about the church and brother quake who came and when when he came the brothers uh you know his first time here and and that's what you're supposed to do you you're watching we don't we didn't know brother kwaku so the first time here we don't put people on the front row their first time here they might have a gun right they might shoot the passer right out of the pulpit and you got them on the front row no you don't do that i'm just i'm giving you all the business tonight i'm giving you all the business right i mean you know everything got to be anointed i mean the the you know the the the the people that's in position to watch they got to be anointed they got to know what they doing right so so so you know brother brother quake who come no they didn't put him on the front row they put him right back in the back where everybody can see him but the quick will come the first week sit back there amen the word sit quietly second week come back amen the word but by the third week brother quaker stop making this up to his making himself to making his way toward the front and say i'm a part of this body this what i've been looking for right i'm a part of this body and then from there we didn't even know that he was a preacher sat here for months never even never announced i mean been missionary all over south america and we didn't even know he just amen to the word amen to the word amen just a little conversation that he had with uh i think brother josue and brother jose say what you a minister brother jose called me so quick he said brother jack i say well brother okay all right all right i got in touch with brother quiku right away i said brother on uh new year's eve night we want you to give 15 minutes 15 minutes say we got to preach it that night but just give us 15 minutes just exalted 15 minutes by the way brother quake who came up here exalted in 15 minutes and dropped the mic i said see this is a brother that we can trust see if you humble yourself god will do the exalted hallelujah hallelujah the more simpler you become the greater you'll become before god that's right don't never now that's that's two negative words that's that you according to the english language you're not supposed to use it like that but i think the point actually is driven home even more when we use it like that don't never don't never try to lift yourself up when you do you bring yourself down we're not bringing you down you're doing that to yourself because you're lifting yourself you're bringing yourself down amen he that exalts himself shall be a base that's bible so gifts are to magnify and uh and the first thing i want to i i want to bring in another quote here i want to say this we actually welcome the gifts here at spirit of truth tabernacle gifts are to magnify especially the gift of dreaming that's what we're dealing with tonight and we welcome that gift here at spirit and truth tabernacle brother branham makes a statement here in the message church order and and i thought this was very very appropriate he says now may the lord bless you bless you all uh it says and i trust that this will be carried out to the very best of your knowledge and may the holy spirit watch over each one of you it says and may every officer of the church feel his post of duty knowing this that god is going to hold you responsible for how you held your office in the church now you see that pastor know who you're responsible but god holds you responsible for how you hold your office in the church he says each one will have to give an account amen amen praise the lord each one whatever office you hold in church you have to give an account to god for how you handle what god gave you amen and i and i want to take that further than just people in office i want to see each one of y'all with a gift that god has given you and you're not using it for his glory you'll give an account to god for the gift that he gave you let me go further and to the laity and the dear gifted saints look at that word that he uses the dear gifted saints that's in our church now i'm speaking this i'm i'm borrowing the prophet's words to speak this the spirit and truth tabernacle the gifted saints that's in our church because i believe we got gifted saints right here i believe that and i thank god for the gifted saints amen he says the dear gifted saints that's in our church those who prophesy or speak with tongues or interpret and look at this or have revelations gifted saints can have revelations praise god now we got to watch that too because you know you the prophet did tell us that um you can't live higher than your this revelation the prophet said that amen so sometimes folk want to go a little higher amen especially you know we we drop you know maybe maybe the lord used us to say something in the sermon on on sunday then at the church we get what we call parking lot preaching can i talk about it just for a little bit parking lot preaching and parking lot preachers always trying to show something different than what was just spoken that's the wrong spirit that's the wrong spirit amen hallelujah glory to god uh i before i became a a minister a pastor anything i just fellowship around the word i didn't i never went outside in the parking lot to try to tear down somebody's sermon now if you have to tear somebody else down to build yourself up something wrong amen hallelujah all right he says um or have revelations we have j he said this we are just so happy to have you in the service and i want to say the same thing we're happy to have gifted people in the service he says and we will give you i'm speaking on behalf of spirit and truth tabernacle to gifted people we will give you full cooperation in everything that the holy spirit shall prove i want to make sure we get that on the line the holy ghost got to prove it amen all right everything that the holy spirit shall prove that he has said to you and we love you and we believe that these gifts are in you and if you have a right opportunity and a scripturally presentation of it see all this the right opportunity cause sometimes it's the wrong opportunity i'm gonna get into that a little bit later on sometimes sometimes you don't need to share that you gotta know when to share when not to share praise look sometimes some things are for you and you alone praise the lord so nobody else need to know that that's god speaking directly to you amen right he said he said so so he says uh uh if you have a right opportunity and scripturally presentation of it uh that you will make you will make great workers in our midst and may the lord bless you all is my sincere prayer so i want to say right now that we welcome gifted believers gifts and callings are without repentance we know that but once you become a man a christian and you're surrendered to the lord and god continues to use the gift that he gave that you were born with uh we welcome that here we're welcome it's just a certain way that we think we need to do things that's all that's all we're trying to say we we don't we don't we don't bind it we want to see gifts we want to see them freely used but there's a way that that it must happen it must happen that was got to come that way if it doesn't come that way then we can't use it all right all right so we have a scriptural approach when dealing with this i'm using this message uh uh expectations i'm going here just stay with me i'm gonna certainly take my time on all this tonight and and like i said we'll we may have a part one and part two of this but uh let me just read these quotes it gives us a foundation for how things will be done praise the lord hear the message expectation the prophet says in the old testament there was two ways they had they they have of having a message one of them was by a dreamer it says the other one by a prophet and then they have the urim thummim it says you ministers know what i'm speaking of of the urem urim thummim what's on the breastplate of aaron now if a dreamer dreamed a dream look at this now if a dreamer dreamed a dream and it was told and it didn't flash them lights the lights that was on the urine thumb so you know he tells his dream and if it didn't flash them likes on the urim thumin it wasn't right he says and if a prophet prophesied and the lights didn't flash on the urem thumb it was wrong it says but if it did flash it was right now since the going away of the urim thumb this is what the prophet said god's bible is the urum thummim if a dreamer dreams a dream or a prophet prophesies and it ain't in the word of god what are we supposed to do let it alone if it ain't in the word of god so anytime somebody shared a dream the first thing you thinking about is how does this fit with the word of god if it does not connect with the word of god don't even consider it and what i find oftentimes that people try to put it in the word of god they want to make it fit the word of god no don't do that don't do that i mean i tell you what just share your dream the same way that they would bring it here to the urim thumb the urine thumb is the one that kind of you know that the priests were the one that actually held the urine thermal let me put it that way too the priests are the one that actually held the urine thunder so they brought it before the priest and then they had to flash them praise the lord so what what what we i mean eventually and i'll share this with you but what we want to do if it's something spiritual for the church bring it before the pastor before you take off running with it to everybody else hallelujah bring it before the pastor before you take off running with everybody else amen all right so he says uh god's bible is the euro thunder if a dream of dreams a dream or a prophet prophesied and it ain't in the word of god then let it alone that's right but if it's on here god's speaking that's right this is god's your thumb it is his word heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not now i want to just kind of go back and and pick up a scripture out of deuteronomy 13 uh here you know uh the the prophet tells us clearly that they used the urim thumb to to to determine whether dream was accurate or not whether it came from god or not if it flashed under your thumb if a prophet prophesied and it flashed into your thumbnail if those lights flashed then it was from god if it didn't flash then it wasn't from god and the urine thumb today is the word of god we see how it compares with the word of god amen all right now here in deuteronomy 13 verse 1 says if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder it says in the sign of the wonder come to pass wherever he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them now look at this the sauna wonder actually comes to pass where they speak unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them now we already know no matter how supernatural this is this is against the word because they're not supposed to have no other gods before him so no matter how supernatural it is right if it's against the word you do not go after that now here verse 3 says thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dream of dreams for the lord your god proveth you oh what a statement what a statement so sometimes what happened god will allow you to hear things to see how you respond because god wants to prove you see if you'll stay with the word or not are you going to get caught up in the emotion of it no the word must be first heavens and earth will pass away but my word will remain forever look at this it says thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dream of dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether you love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul so sometimes a gift will come to prove you to see where you stand amen i'ma tell you right now where i stand i stand with the word of god all right so i wrote a note here a dream could be perfectly right but if it leads us away from the word then the dream was a test to see what we would hold to and i will always hold to the word of god and i wrote this in my notes heavens and earth will pass away but my word will remain forever and uh so here's a another statement the prophet said them gifts are given to you not to play with not to say glory to god i speak with tongues hallelujah you're you're degrading yourself when you do things like that you're degrading yourself they're given to you to work with not to play with amen i'm going further if we can get everybody to put the word of god above their gift we will be a blessed and spiritually prosperous church i'm going to say that again if we can get everybody to put the word of god above their gift we will be a blessed and spiritually prosperous church can i say this also every dream is not of god every dream is not of god now let me just read a little bit more for you just to kind of prove these things so every dream is not of god this is coming out of the message of paradox and look at this man sharing his dream with the prophet he says uh let me stop just a minute a man come to me not long ago come from overseas the man was wrong that's all brother brandon said the man was wrong he says he had three or four children and a wife and he was running around with a woman over here i don't say anything immorally but it just didn't look right amen you see you have to watch what you're doing in the eyes of the public you're written in pistols so this man just running around with this sister you know and his wife and his kids back home he's just running all over the u.s brother ramsey that don't look right that don't look right but you run around with that sister like that amen amen amen amen you know i i i i i question you know because sometimes you get gifted people together and they just run with each other the little text messages go back and forth email messages go back you got to watch that you got to watch that i mean you know and this you know and it's like a church that's happening within a church i've seen it i've seen it with my own eyes you get a real gifted person people start leaning on that gifted person what the lord tell you what the lord tell you the lord ain't told me nothing well they won't move until the lord speak to that person like god can't speak to you right don't don't don't you we want the word first church amen amen hallelujah if we didn't learn nothing we should have learned that that and pentecost that was not the way to do things by leaning on different people that was gifted don't do that lean on the word of god all right let me go here so he says um he was running around with a woman over here i don't say anything immorally but it just didn't look right you see you have to watch what you're doing in the eyes of the public your written epistles and he said i kind of called his hand on it i said sir i hope you don't think i'm rude but i just like to say something as a minister don't you think that the people here will think oh he said no no that's all right in my country see now but you ain't in your country you're here that's all right in my country i said but you're not in your country see you you're over here and a people will and and if people will think something about that he said i said do you know the woman yes i said do you know her background i he said i did brother man i said he knew her background it says he said yes said brother branham i know she's living right now with her fourth husband said and brother branham you know what she is she's such a sweet woman said i went to the lord and i said lord tell me what's the matter with this woman oh lord have mercy jesus just look at his prayer lord tell me what's the matter with him the prayer don't even sound right lord you ought to know what's the matter with it she on her fourth husband amen and they the others ain't dead you don't need you don't need to go to god and ask you what's the matter with this woman amen it's pretty obvious what's the matter with it he says uh uh uh she's living right now with her fourth husband said brother random you know uh what she's such a sweet woman i went to said i went to the lord i said lord tell me what's the matter with this woman said why why would you bless her with the holy ghost and everything and living in adultery now first of all she ain't got the holy ghost my brother just because she's showing all these emotional signs don't mean she got those the holy ghost gonna get in line with the word of god amen right it says why uh would you would you bless him with the holy ghost and everything and living in the daughter he said well said you know the lord give me a dream you can't blame god for all these dreams the lord gave me a dream he said i seen my wife living immorally with another man and i said and i said and said then she come up to me and fell down and said will you forgive me uh and said shu and said then the lord said i forgive her said uh you see no matter if she has done the the way she's doing i forgive her brother random said i said sir your vision or your dream was sweet but it don't line up with the word of god it says that's right god can't say one thing and take it back over here he's gonna say one thing and stay with it till it's accomplished and that which it was purposeful then you see the paradox so if that thing don't line up with the word of god you got to say uh uh uh i'm not gonna agree with you brother random toaster brother that i don't care how how how sweet that dream is you probably sold that to so many other people but now you don't run into somebody's gonna tell you that is off the word and if that's off the words you're off the word and really i i can imagine the advice was go back home to your family and stop running around with this woman now if he didn't want to do that praise the lord he would forsake that counsel and he would go hang himself if you get what i'm saying spiritually amen all right i'm going a little further this is out of the message god testifying of his gifts he says look here how many in here ever dreamed a dream can i just see hands if anybody's ever dreaming to me all right so that's what the prophets say let's see your hand if you dream the dream let's see your hand and i know i've dreamed i've dreamed you know some dreams but i i am really not a dreamer i'm not uh i sleep hard and uh as i read this quote for the brand i'm gonna kind of tell us that you know people that sleep uh hard like that they typically don't dream dream a lot but people that uh that are what we call light sleepers anything anything move just a sheet of paper move in the room at night stay up right if the fan catch a sheet of paper they up if a fan catch a sheet of paper and i'm sleeping i don't hear it don't hear it people can be breaking in the house i mean they're gonna have to almost come and shake me sir i'm in your house oh okay but i i just i don't i i sleep hard when i go to sleep you know so so typically people like that they don't dream they don't dream but others that that sleep light they dream quite often now let me just put it this way god made me the way that i did i am he made me to sleep hard god made the light sleeper the way that they are he made them the sleep life god the gift and the calling is without repentance that's just the way it is so i tell you this much when i do dream i take it seriously when i take when i when i when god give me a dream i take it very seriously because i know that it's nothing but the lord i don't know if i have time to share this and i i'm not sure if i if i i want to you know there was a dream that i had before um even starting truth tabernacle it was a dream that the lord gave me um uh and i and i had to take it seriously i had to um you know and i won't i'll just leave it i won't share it i'll just leave it like that but uh but what i'll say like this when god does give me a dream i always take it quite seriously because i just i don't have them that often i really don't i'll tell you one that i had about two years ago i was uh praying over we want to have the easter services and i said you know we got these brothers in the church we want to use them and i said i want to one of these real quaker i want to use brother troy i want to use brother jerry said lord i just don't know how to line up these services i don't know what what what to do you know just just which way to go with this and um and then while i was sleeping one night uh i had a dream it was a sunrise service and brother jerry was preaching the sunrise service so when i had that dream i got up at the next one i got in touch with jesse brother jerry i had a dream last night uh and that you were preaching the sunrise service i say so i know you supposed to be on sunday morning i know that much the other brothers will figure out but you supposed to be sunday morning sunrise service he said pastor if you had a dream about it i'll be ready praise the lord and we had those services but god gave that to me in a dream that that he was supposed to be preaching that sunrise service so sometimes the lord will speak like that and you know we you know it's pretty clear so you just move out with what god gave you but here let me just kind of bring this quote in and maybe i'll bring a scripture in right after this if i can it says um out of the message god testifying of this gift he says look here how many in here ever dreamed of dream let's see your hand well the bigger percent of you well what if i say it you dream your dream now could you do it no sir it's impossible right if i come up here and tell you since you had dreams before dream me a dream right now that's impossible that's impossible it says so it's impossible to me to see a vision for this woman or that man ever who gives you that dream is up to them praise god it's not up to you no matter how much you want it i want i want to really drive this home i really do no matter how much you want it and and can i just put it this way i don't think we should be going around praying asking god to give us a dream i don't think there's something wrong with that when i'm going and i'm asking lord give me a dream about this god give me a drink you know the devil hears that prayer the devil can hear that prayer so the devil can also get into your subconscious and cause something to happen you think it's god right when you have the gift of dreaming it's not you controlling the gift god controls it god drops the drop drops the dream down when he wants to not when we want it i mean i you know i was reading the scripture a little earlier in the the psalm and i'm gonna come right back to this quote but saul was making a statement um he couldn't get a dream he couldn't get urum you know he couldn't get a word from a prophet so he went to the witch of endor you got to be careful see because if you don't get it from the lord then you'll kind of make something up and and then then the question has to be asked why do you want that dream so bad what's the purpose praise the lord amen look at this says ever who gives you that dream is up to them it's not up to you no matter how much you want it it's what they say whether god gives it to you or not is that right that's the same way it is here he says well there's there's people here in here that i notice hands while ago that never dream dreams they just sleep sound they don't dream at all now i'm gonna try because i know there's people here that know don't try to argue with me i know there's people here that doesn't understand see does not understand he says here's what it is here's a man's conscience conscious right here the conscience you live in and live in now we're taught by science that you're dreaming you're in your subconscious all right he says did you ever see a person dreaming you think you dreamed all night it isn't that long it says uh he says just a moment a little bit you've done dream hours of dreams you think you actually think you done dreamed hours of dreams some of y'all you know you you know you woke up you can you know exactly what time you woke up fell back asleep and by the time you felt you had a dream that seemed like it was lasting for forever and you only had it for a few minutes my god he says um he says you've done dream hours of dreams you think but just a moment a flash while it's going through the person that's dreaming is not sound asleep but you people here who does not dream dreams your subconscious will be way back to a place where you do where you do not reach reach to it and sleep he says you can't help that you can't help it he says you were born that way something that has root has a rulership of you and made you and made you that way so you can't help it and you people who dream dreams you can't help that it wasn't uh you don't have no control of it it's your subconscious so you know you don't have a control over these things and um i mean whether you are a dreamer or you're not a dreamer you don't have control over it it's god made you that way for a purpose now those that god made and he he's blesses them to be able to give them dreams um you just surrender it to the lord but you know as he was saying here you don't have it rules you you don't rule it i was thinking on this person that had a dream and joseph dreamed in genesis 37. um and his dream he dreamed that his sheath rose above the sheath of his brothers now i mentioned to you that sometimes you have to watch when you share in your dream you need to you need to you know sometimes it's not appropriate you just need to hold on to it god gave it to you that's him dealing directly with you now joseph had a dream in genesis 37 that his chief rosa his chief rose up above his brothers and that their sheets would make obesity to his and as i was reading it i thought to myself first he didn't uh first of all he didn't pray and ask god for this dream that's not what happened to joseph god just showed joseph dre but he wasn't praying lord show me a dream where i'm gonna be greater than my brothers that's not joseph's attitude praise the lord right you know he just he just went to sleep god gave him a dream and then he came by his shed so first of all he didn't pray and ask god for the dream it was just given to him secondly i want to say with joseph's dream his timing on sharing the dream may have been a little off now why because before he actually had a dream his daddy had just given him that rainbow coat and his brothers was already upset with him hallelujah his brother was already a little jealous of him of getting this rainbow coat and now he's going to go to sleep and get this dream and tell his brothers how you know what i saw all y'all was bound down worshipping me now his timing was a little off that really got his brothers upset hallelujah but you know the other thing that that that happened here you know and i want to say this i believe he was operating under enthusiasm because he was quite young when these things was happening to him glory to god nevertheless genesis 37 9 god gave joseph a second dream and this time he sees the sun the moon and 11 stars bound before him joseph goes immediately out and he begins to share this second dream with his brothers and that is what created problems this is why he ended up in a pit because he operated a little bit too early but you know what god was going to bring in the past anyway god gave him the dream god was going to bring it to pass and it took a number of years before that dream came to pass and i i believe i believe that the reason god had to wait a number of years because he had to shave a little joseph off of joseph and there's some things that we go through in life that god has to actually shave a little bit of us off in order to keep us humble right see when it when by the time joseph's brother showed back up into his life and he started seeing the dream manifested joseph was a different man and if your gift ain't changing you there's something wrong your gift does not exalt you your gift actually exalts god hallelujah right and i mean but you look at joseph's uh joseph's life and and everything yes the dream certainly came to pass but before it actually came to pass joseph had to go through a lot of stuff thrown in the pit raised up out the pit sold into slavery working in you know in egypt and and somebody's house and and and i mean just being promoted from one position to the next and now he's like almost second to charge in part of his house and then politics wife had to come against him and lie on him he run away from the lie and left his coat behind and then was told that uh he he tried to take advantage of politics wife and they threw him in prison got in prison and uh and his gift was still operating in prison he was actually interpreting dreams praise the lord hallelujah glory glory glory see that's i think i think that's something that we miss you know here um typically a person that actually has the ability to dream dreams is a person that god can use to interpret dreams amen god can use them that way if they're humble enough to be used that way amen but we got to watch even how that happens because you know you get people in you know like like was it absalom that was in the church he was in uh in his daddy's church and he got to the spot he's like you know i i just wish that the people would bring their issues to me because i could handle it we ain't got to bother daddy with that we ain't got to bother the king with that i can handle it you got to watch that because see aslam reason that he wanted to handle it because apps don't have ulterior motives amen you know i'ma say this uh now and and i'll i'll come back and say it again uh i i i and and i'm gonna set the platform for it i'm gonna give you some more more quotes and all that i won't do it tonight i set myself a timer we'll go so far and then i'll pick up again but i won't say this now i i think if it's something really related to the church it should always pass through the pastor if it's actually if it's related to somebody in the church let it go through the pastor amen now i'm gonna tell you this as the church grow pastor can't handle all that i'm be honest with you but what the lord is what the lord's just kind of led me to do is just kind of set up just you know the bible saying the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established i got some people that got the spirit of discernment and we're gonna use that spirit of discernment right so as that dream passed through the pastor the pastor's gonna give it to some people that got the spirit of discernment and then we're going to pray and see what the lord say about it then we'll give an answer and if the lord don't give an answer we won't give an answer we won't make it up as we go if god don't give nothing we just didn't get nothing praise the lord right and i'm gonna read you a quote because it was a little young lady she got upset with brother branham now you've been interpreting everybody else's dreams but you ain't interpreted mine he told the sister look here you say look let me just tell you your mom and daddy got confidence in me and i want you to have the same confidence in me he says if god don't show me the dream i can't show it to you and he had to give this us just just calm down relax just wait because everybody think every you know my dream is really important no just wait on the lord we let it pass through the pastor and and the lord just kind of already led me to you know different ones that he want me to start out with you know as far as being able to you know let's let's just passage through let them pray about it and then let's see what god says about it if god don't say nothing we don't say nothing amen right but but i think you got to have you know as gifts come you got to have uh two or three witnesses because the bible say let every word be established in the mouth of two or three witnesses amen amen they balance that with the word of god see how how it connects with the word of god and if it don't connect with the word of god we don't see nothing here we don't see nothing here now you might get upset well i see something okay that's up to you we don't see nothing amen hallelujah so i think you know the only person that wouldn't be able to have to go through a process like that would be the prophet himself the rest of us need to go through a process all right have it checked by the urine thumb bring it before the priest i was telling how joseph was given the ability to actually interpret dreams and god was using that while he was even in prison but while while he was there in prison he had been stripped of everything he was by the time his brothers came back to him joseph was a different man joseph was a completely different man he won he won and actually you never even heard joseph when his brothers came back you never heard joe say remember that dream no remember them two dreams that the lord said he didn't have to say nothing like that i guarantee the brothers remembered i guarantee the daddy remembered but joseph didn't have to remind them but what joseph did want to do is test their spirits glory to god and when they stuck the little cup inside benjamin's back then he finally got a re he got a way to see how his brothers had changed as well gloria over over the years we all should have been changing by now we i feel like you know we've had this the the message for uh quite some time and uh uh the word of god has been given to us and now it's up to us to apply what what has been given to us uh the church should be so much further up the road spiritually mature to be able to handle these things amen but if we don't i felt that it was very important let's let's get a structure around it because um if we got a structure around it then it'll keep the church together a gift can divide a church a gift it can divide a church i don't want to see a gift divide us i want to see the gifts you know used by god and and you know like i said we welcome it here at spirit and truth tabernacle but there's a process that we want to do things there's a way that we want to do things sometimes god give you something and you know sometimes not it's not for you just go you know what i had a dream about you no don't just wait you don't know what's going on there just bring it to the pastor or you know and it's it's easier just send it to me text me or or what's at me or something like that because you know i get all the details and i can just kind of look at the details then i pass it on to you know some others that i know that are gifted with with discernment let it let what do you see in this pray over this tell me what you see in this and i and i always want people to pray first sometimes it's obvious but pray anyway pray anyway look at this joseph when he got the second dream he was not seeking the lord asking him for that dream and the reason that he wasn't is because the prophet says we don't have control over the gift god is the one that has control over the gift and he gives it to us as he sees fit so um let me stop there for tonight and i will pick up i got some more notes and things like that that i want to share uh and also just the structure around what i just shared i'll bring that structure and some quotes around that on next week but we just want to get started talking about this and and i just i'm i'm really excited about what god has in store if we can get everybody amen operating in this channel i believe god gonna bless this church uh he's already blessed the church he already has but let's get a structure around what we're doing let's let's let the holy spirit uh just just guide us lead us you know through uh this this this next season that we have let's let's let the holy spirit do it amen let's pray father we are uh grateful for the word of the lord that you have given to us lord as we're just embarking upon this teaching on dreams god i i pray that you would direct us and know lord that sometimes when you get to talking about these things um lord is is it's a it's a difficult subject and lord we just want to say it in a way where we welcome gifts with god but we also just keep the order that you've given us god that we could just see you manifested in our midst ultimately we want you to be the one to get the glory we want you to be the one to get the honor we want you to be the one to get the praise so father i just i just pray lord that all the gifted people that you have brought here to this church lord that they would just surrender their gifts to you and the lord as they surrender you would use them abundantly bless them fathers my prayer and father i just pray that even as we go through this that maybe others lord will just begin to rise up and and father just uh maybe have a desire to to walk in what you've called them to there might be some here that you have given the ability to be able to interpret dreams god let them rise up they might have that spirit of discernment uh just like they could have the spirit of speaking in tongues the the anointing of speaking tongues the anointing to uh be able to uh interpret the tongues god there's others that have been given that spirit of discernment that word of wisdom and knowledge father i pray that all these gifts all nine of them will be manifested in our midst and lord be operating uh the way that you establish for to operate here in the church we welcome your spirit we welcome uh lord your your gifts you give them to us without repentance but lord we surrender uh back to you god and acts that you would get glory out of it in our lives we love you father we pray these blessings in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen i'll just mention uh we got a couple announcements that i just need to make mention of before we would uh leave tonight uh don't forget on this saturday and sunday uh brother trevor will be with us uh he and his family they'll be here with us we'll be having a special youth service on saturday night at 7 00 p.m uh so um just keep that in mind on saturday night other thing i i forgot to mention uh i got a call i believe from brother west go i think it was monday i think it was monday uh some of you all might know but sister ermina that used to attend the west coast church she passed away uh i believe it was monday that she passed away uh she was in a nursing home for the last few years and i understand that she was down in fort lauderdale and uh closer to a family but the lord called her home and i understand i believe she was 90 years old 91 91 years old so the lord gave her a very full life and we thank god for that uh she had been a part of a couple of the churches here in the um in the area and i believe sister mina even had the opportunity to have uh personal interview with the prophet and um so uh that brother wesker called me today and said that they were hoping to try to do some type of a memorial service for her maybe on saturday morning at 10 a.m i believe it'll be done at his church they're trying to get things worked out where they can do a memorial service for her so we'll try to keep you posted on that if you desire to go so saturday evening we'll have a um service here 7 p.m brother trevor will be coming uh

she's preparing for surgery strengthen the body or god to endure what she has to go through god the hands of the doctors the nurses each and everyone that's providing care for her god just be with her through this entire process and just raise her up for your glory uh lord is our prayer and father we uh we continue to pray that uh for your healing touch we know that god medicine is one way that you
