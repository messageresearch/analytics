[54:08] at 84.
[54:10] And and and when you know he say, "I
[54:13] want the devil to get the victory." No,
[54:14] the devil got a black eye.
[54:18] Um
[54:19] because the Lord just reminded you of
[54:22] all those songs that's been in your
[54:24] spirit for for years. And we just
[54:26] appreciate you so much. You and Sister
[54:28] Capus. And Amen. We thank God for you.
[54:31] So, Amen. We appreciate appreciate the
[54:34] special this morning. Um, I'll ask that
[54:38] you would turn your Bibles. I I know
[54:39] that um, Brother Solomon acknowledged.
[54:43] We we we would like to know the sister's
[54:45] name, though. Is this Sister Virginia's
[54:47] sister?
[54:48] Okay. What What's your name?
[54:50] Leticia.
[54:50] Leticia. So good to have you with us.
[54:52] Amen. I think I recently saw a picture
[54:55] of y'all somewhere. Amen. So, uh, but
[54:59] it's good to have Sister Virginia sister
[55:01] with us. Amen. on today. Um I am going
[55:04] back to a very familiar passage that
[55:07] we've preached on for the last couple
[55:09] years in Joel chapter 1 and Joel chapter
[55:11] 2. And uh we'll pick up a thought as I
[55:15] mentioned to you all on last week. I
[55:17] have been um
[55:19] uh desiring just to touch this as we
[55:22] prepare for the meetings. There are a
[55:24] lot of things that are coming up in the
[55:26] upcoming weeks that I won't get a chance
[55:28] to uh speak before the meetings. Uh next
[55:32] week we have a guest minister and then
[55:35] the week after that uh I know that I
[55:38] have my wife's family uh the family
[55:42] reunion. They've been going 50s
[55:44] something years straight. So we'll we'll
[55:47] be there in attendance and then after
[55:48] that we'll be coming uh right into the
[55:51] meetings. But I wanted to try to uh set
[55:54] a foundation. Amen. If I could uh for
[55:57] that. And as uh brother Solomon was just
[56:00] saying, if that's the inspiration for
[56:01] the meetings, then we're looking for God
[56:03] to do that.
[56:06] Amen. We want to see testimonies of
[56:09] restoration that come out of the
[56:12] meetings. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[56:16] and if you know somebody that need to
[56:19] experience restoration, I want to
[56:22] encourage you to invite them uh to the
[56:25] meetings because if you just get them
[56:28] there, then God is able to do something
[56:32] supernaturally.
[56:34] Praise God. Amen. I I believe that. So
[56:38] uh here in uh Joel 1 and chapter the
[56:41] first chapter verse uh 4 it says that
[56:45] which the palmer worm hath left hath the
[56:49] locust eaten and that which the locust
[56:53] hath left hath the cankerorm eaten and
[56:57] that which the cankerworm hath left hath
[57:01] the caterpillar eaten. My God. Brother
[57:04] Random called the this insect. It's
[57:08] actually uh four different stages of the
[57:12] same insect and he call them the little
[57:15] rascal.
[57:17] little rascal because this little rascal
[57:20] not only come into the church but this
[57:22] little rascal comes into individual's
[57:24] lives
[57:26] and uh and it starts just little simple
[57:28] things and then you know as a palmer
[57:31] stage and then next thing you know it
[57:32] comes to locust stage and then it goes
[57:34] to uh a cankerorm and and and and then
[57:38] caterpillar and by the time it get to
[57:40] that caterpillar like oh my goodness it
[57:43] look like it's hopeless until we go to
[57:46] chapter too. Yes, sir.
[57:48] Amen. This shows us that God sees what
[57:53] the what the little rascal rascals have
[57:57] done. Amen. And God's not pleased with
[58:01] what the little rascals have done. So
[58:04] God has a plan for them little rascals.
[58:09] Hallelujah.
[58:11] Uh verse 23 says, "Be glad then." How
[58:15] can you be glad when all this done
[58:16] happened?
[58:18] But the scripture says, "Be glad then,
[58:20] ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the
[58:23] Lord your God, for he have given you the
[58:27] former rain moderately, and he will
[58:29] cause to come down for you the rain, the
[58:32] former rain, and the latter rain in the
[58:34] first month." Now I want to uh just
[58:37] highlight that we're looking for amen
[58:40] spirit and truth to be uh expressed
[58:44] there in our meetings. We want to
[58:45] experience the power of the Holy Ghost
[58:47] uh but we want the revelation of the
[58:49] word to come as well. Right? So we're
[58:51] going to get both of those. He says,
[58:52] "And the floor shall be full of wheat
[58:55] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[58:59] and oil." And we are in the year of
[59:02] overflow. And I will restore to you the
[59:09] years that the locust hath eaten, the
[59:11] cankerorm, and the caterpillar, and the
[59:14] palmer, my great army, which I sent
[59:17] among you. And ye shall eat in plenty,
[59:20] and be satisfied. And praise the name of
[59:23] the Lord your God, that have dealt
[59:25] wondrously with you, and my people shall
[59:28] never be ashamed. Amen. And ye shall
[59:31] know that I am in the midst of Israel,
[59:33] and that I am the Lord your God, and
[59:35] none else, and my people shall never be
[59:38] ashamed. And it shall come to pass
[59:40] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[59:42] upon all flesh, and your sons and your
[59:45] daughters shall prophesy, your old men
[59:47] shall dream dreams, your young men shall
[59:49] see visions, and upon the servants, and
[59:53] upon the handmmaids. Uh, in those days
[59:56] will I pour out my spirit. Amen. The
[1:00:00] Lord added a blessing to the reading of
[1:00:01] his word. Let us Amen. just have a a
[1:00:04] brief word of prayer. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:07] Father, we are again grateful for the
[1:00:11] opportunity we have to come into the
[1:00:13] house of God. We have felt your

[1:00:23] confident that Lord anything can happen
[1:00:26] when you come into the room. So Lord, if
[1:00:29] there is uh sickness, Lord, we pray that
[1:00:32] you would deal with sickness. And if
[1:00:34] there is uh salvation, that you would
[1:00:36] bring salvation, uh father, healing, uh
[1:00:40] deliverance, Lord, filling and refilling
[1:00:42] of the Holy Ghost, God, whatever the
[1:00:45] people are in need of this morning, we
[1:00:47] pray that you would meet the need. And
[1:00:48] we trust, oh God, that you would just
[1:00:50] get the glory and honor out of uh what
[1:00:53] would be spoken and what would be
[1:00:54] received. we take control over every
[1:00:57] thought that is not amen the thought of
[1:01:00] God. But father may we uh be able to
[1:01:02] channel our thoughts Lord that we could
[1:01:04] hear from heaven uh on this day. It's in
[1:01:06] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can
[1:01:10] be seated in the presence of the Lord.
[1:01:12] Uh we will use for our title uh today. I

[1:01:21] will restore saith the Lord. Uh there is
[1:01:26] um a little quote here that I'd like to
[1:01:29] get us started with and um out of the
[1:01:34] message adoption um the prophet gives us
[1:01:38] something here
[1:01:40] and he says uh look listen to uh this.
[1:01:45] It says predestination
[1:01:48] looks back to fornowledge. It says I
[1:01:52] mean election looks back to fornowledge
[1:01:55] and predestination
[1:01:57] looks to destiny. It says don't forget
[1:02:00] that election looks back here. Uh here
[1:02:04] it is. I was a cockleberg. I was born in
[1:02:09] sin shaped in iniquity. I come to the
[1:02:13] world speaking lies. born among sinners.
[1:02:16] That's everybody's testimony. And here
[1:02:18] it says, uh, father and mother and all
[1:02:21] my whole family sinners. I was a
[1:02:25] cockleber, right? But all of a sudden, I
[1:02:28] become a wheat grain. How did it happen?
[1:02:30] He says, uh, uh, that what is that?
[1:02:33] Election. How did I become a wheat
[1:02:36] grain? He says, election. God before the
[1:02:40] foundation of the world elected that
[1:02:43] cocklebar
[1:02:45] uh was to become a grain of wheat. Now I
[1:02:48] know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm
[1:02:50] saved. He says how do I do it? He says
[1:02:53] look back and see that he predestinated
[1:02:56] it long time ago by fornowledge he seen
[1:03:00] that I would love him. So he made a
[1:03:03] propitiation through his own son that
[1:03:06] through him I might become from a cockle
[1:03:09] bird to a grain of wheat. Amen. Now
[1:03:12] where am I at now? I'm saved. I'm
[1:03:15] walking in the grace of God. He says
[1:03:17] what does predestination look to
[1:03:20] destiny.
[1:03:21] Oh my my my my my. Yeah. I'm happy to be
[1:03:25] saved. I'm happy that Amen. God has
[1:03:28] changed my nature. But now there's a
[1:03:30] destiny. Amen. There's somewhere that
[1:03:32] we're going after we get here. He says,
[1:03:34] "What does predestin look?" He says, "To
[1:03:36] destiny. Where will he take me to and
[1:03:40] where am I going? That's got you. There
[1:03:42] you are." Amen. So, you know, I was just
[1:03:45] thinking about this uh this word uh
[1:03:48] predestination. How brother Brandon was
[1:03:50] talking about how this uh this looks to
[1:03:52] destiny. Uh predestination actually
[1:03:54] looks to destiny. And and I know that
[1:03:57] this is a word that um uh in in in the
[1:04:01] church world uh they have a lot of
[1:04:03] confusion with but uh but but let's
[1:04:06] let's at least le read the scripture.
[1:04:09] Amen. And then let the scripture help us
[1:04:12] kind of settle some of the confusion.
[1:04:14] Let's go to Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4
[1:04:17] uh through 10. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:04:22] Predestination is looking to destiny.
[1:04:25] God is taking me somewhere. Amen. He's
[1:04:28] taking you somewhere as well.
[1:04:29] Hallelujah. Ephesians chapter uh 1 uh
[1:04:33] verse uh four it says, "According
[1:04:36] as he hath chosen us in him before
[1:04:42] the foundation of the world, that we
[1:04:46] should be holy and without blame before
[1:04:50] him in love." When were you chosen?
[1:04:54] Oh, hallelujah. Amen. Then there was
[1:04:58] nothing you could do about this this
[1:05:00] selection.
[1:05:00] That's right.
[1:05:01] Amen. If you were chosen before the
[1:05:03] foundation of the world, then that's
[1:05:05] exactly what it is. You were chosen by
[1:05:07] God before the foundation world. Now, we
[1:05:09] want to we're going to try to clarify
[1:05:11] this now, but let's let's keep reading.
[1:05:12] He says, uh, "Having
[1:05:15] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:05:18] children." So election it is uh is it's
[1:05:21] it's looking looking at fornowledge but
[1:05:24] this predestination is looking at
[1:05:26] destiny. Destiny is taking us to
[1:05:28] adoption. It's taking us to our placing
[1:05:31] in Christ.
[1:05:32] Oh hallelujah. Amen. Predestination
[1:05:36] provides a way for your placing.
[1:05:39] I'mma say it again. Predestination
[1:05:42] provides a way for your placing.
[1:05:45] Oh my my my. having predestinated us
[1:05:49] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:05:52] Christ to himself according to the
[1:05:55] pleasure of his will. This ain't even
[1:05:58] got nothing to do with any of us. This
[1:06:00] is all for God's pleasure.
[1:06:02] God get pleasure out of seeing you serve
[1:06:06] him.
[1:06:08] That's right.
[1:06:09] Oh my my my my. Maybe you don't seem to
[1:06:12] get any pleasure out of it. Maybe you
[1:06:15] feel like this is a boring life. Maybe
[1:06:18] you feel like, amen, there there's more
[1:06:20] out there, amen, for you to do in the
[1:06:22] world. But what you go out to do in the
[1:06:24] world going to lead you to hell.
[1:06:28] God gets pleasure out of seeing you want
[1:06:31] to serve him.
[1:06:33] Brother, it pleased God when them Hebrew
[1:06:36] boys got thrown into that fire furnace.
[1:06:38] It pleased God so much that he told the
[1:06:41] angels, "No, you're not going down
[1:06:43] there." And no, you're not going down
[1:06:45] there. They say, "God, what you going to
[1:06:47] do about this? Look at what they took a
[1:06:49] stamp of view. Look at where they at
[1:06:50] right now." He said, "Don't worry about
[1:06:52] it. I got a plan in mind."
[1:06:55] Hallelujah. And God himself, this this
[1:06:58] was not an angelized job. This was a
[1:07:01] Godsized job.
[1:07:03] And sometimes God wants to step into
[1:07:06] your situation. Amen.
[1:07:08] Amen.
[1:07:09] That's what he did with the Hebrew boys.
[1:07:11] They saw the fourth man
[1:07:13] that took the heat out of the fire.
[1:07:15] Look, God gets pleasure. It's his
[1:07:18] pleasure. Amen. That's why we serve him.
[1:07:21] That's why we live for because he gets
[1:07:22] pleasure out of the life that we live.
[1:07:25] A holy sanctified life.
[1:07:27] Hallelujah.
[1:07:28] Let me go on. He says in verse 6 uh Paul
[1:07:31] tells us to the praise of the glory of
[1:07:34] his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:07:38] accepted in the beloved. Hallelujah. in
[1:07:42] whom we have redemption through his
[1:07:44] blood, the forgiveness of sins,
[1:07:46] according to the riches of his grace,
[1:07:49] wherein he hath abounded towards us in
[1:07:51] all wisdom and prudence,
[1:07:53] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:07:56] his will, according to his good
[1:07:58] pleasure, which he hath purposed in
[1:08:00] himself, uh, that in the dispensation of
[1:08:03] the fullness of times, he might gather
[1:08:06] together in one all things in Christ,
[1:08:08] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:08:10] on earth, believe in him. So as I was
[1:08:14] just looking at this word uh
[1:08:16] predestinate that we found there in
[1:08:18] verse 5 where it says having
[1:08:19] predestinated us into the adoption of
[1:08:21] children uh the Greek lexicon
[1:08:24] uh gives a definition of this of this
[1:08:27] this word in the Greek lexicon is
[1:08:29] pronounced as prozizzo uh pro prozzo
[1:08:33] uh but in um the definition is to
[1:08:36] predetermine
[1:08:38] to decide beforehand
[1:08:40] uh and um Uh they they said in the New
[1:08:44] Testament it's God decreeing from
[1:08:45] eternity.
[1:08:47] Amen. To for ordain to appoint
[1:08:49] beforehand. Amen. So and when it says
[1:08:52] that we we were uh chosen in him before
[1:08:55] the foundation of the world, this mean
[1:08:56] God decided beforehand. Now we got to be
[1:08:59] careful with that because it's not just
[1:09:01] God deciding beforehand. It's God
[1:09:05] knowing that you would decide
[1:09:07] beforehand.
[1:09:08] That's right.
[1:09:11] Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] He could predestinate based on what he
[1:09:13] knew you would do.
[1:09:17] Oh, hallelujah. I'm so glad that he knew
[1:09:20] what we would do with the word in this
[1:09:22] hour. And and and and and I want to just
[1:09:24] I want to cuz I'm I'm coming to
[1:09:26] something here I want to I want to read
[1:09:28] to you. But but God knew what you would
[1:09:31] do with what we call the express word.
[1:09:35] Also, God knew what you would do with
[1:09:38] the predestinated word.
[1:09:41] All right, let me read another scripture
[1:09:43] out of Romans 8. Um, for this word
[1:09:46] predestinate, God uses this language in
[1:09:49] the scripture, so it's certainly perfect
[1:09:51] for the church to use this same
[1:09:52] language. Romans 8. And let's go to
[1:09:56] every Christian's favorite uh verse,
[1:09:59] verse 28. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:10:03] Glory. Glory. verse 28 says, "And we
[1:10:07] know sir,
[1:10:09] glory to God."
[1:10:11] Hallelujah.
[1:10:13] That all things
[1:10:15] work together uh for good to them that
[1:10:18] love God.
[1:10:20] Amen. To them who are called according
[1:10:23] to his purpose.
[1:10:27] Amen. For whom he did forno.
[1:10:31] Amen. And he also did predestinate
[1:10:36] to be conformed is predestination takes
[1:10:38] us to destiny. And this destiny, amen,
[1:10:41] to be adopted. This destiny to be
[1:10:43] conformed to the image of Christ.
[1:10:46] Amen. All he also did predestinate to be
[1:10:49] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:10:52] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:10:54] brethren. And you know, I remember
[1:10:57] growing up in church when we first came
[1:10:58] to this message, we used to hear a lot
[1:11:00] of sermons about predestination. And uh
[1:11:03] and and it was it was it was a certainly
[1:11:05] a blessing to hear. But I think some of
[1:11:08] us got a a misunderstanding of it. Amen.
[1:11:11] Because you know, we felt that if we
[1:11:13] were predestinated, then we could just
[1:11:14] do whatever we wanted to do.
[1:11:16] All right.
[1:11:17] No, that's not what predestination's all
[1:11:19] about. and and we felt that I could just
[1:11:21] keep sinning and if I'm predestinated,
[1:11:23] God going to bring me back anyway. No,
[1:11:25] that's not that's not how you view
[1:11:26] predestination. When you realize
[1:11:29] predestination actually has a destiny
[1:11:31] tied to it.
[1:11:33] Hallelujah. The destiny is not for you
[1:11:35] to continue in sin.
[1:11:37] The destiny is for you to become more
[1:11:39] like Christ.
[1:11:40] Yes, sir.
[1:11:41] Amen.
[1:11:42] Hallelujah. Amen. So, it says this. Now,
[1:11:44] I I I love this this this the writings
[1:11:47] of Paul in this chapter. It says, "For
[1:11:49] whom he did forno, he also did
[1:11:50] predestinate be conformed to the image
[1:11:52] of his son, that he might be the
[1:11:54] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[1:11:57] whom he did predestinate, them he also
[1:12:00] called." Amen. And whom he called, my
[1:12:04] God, look at all this that goes with
[1:12:06] this. Them he also justified.
[1:12:10] Brother, predestination, amen, gives you
[1:12:13] access to justification. And this
[1:12:16] justification is just as if you never
[1:12:18] did it in the first place.
[1:12:20] Hallelujah. Whatever the devil tried to
[1:12:22] pin on you, that was not me, Satan.
[1:12:26] Glory to God.
[1:12:28] Glory to God. Amen. Amen. I I want to I
[1:12:31] want to accept them charges. Amen. He He
[1:12:33] says this says, "Mom, whom he did
[1:12:35] predestinate, he also called and whom he
[1:12:37] called, them he also justified and whom
[1:12:39] he justified, them he also glorified."
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:42] And Paul say, "Now, if y if that ain't
[1:12:44] enough to make you shout, what about
[1:12:46] this one? What shall we say
[1:12:49] to these things?" The things that he
[1:12:51] just spoke,
[1:12:52] "What shall we say to these things?"
[1:12:54] Hallelujah.
[1:12:55] Yes, sir.
[1:12:56] If
[1:12:57] God be for us,
[1:13:00] who can be against us?
[1:13:03] Brother, that ought to give freedom to
[1:13:05] every believer.
[1:13:07] If God is for you, then who can be
[1:13:08] against you? I don't care what devil is
[1:13:10] pointing his finger at you, that devil
[1:13:12] is a liar.
[1:13:15] Amen.
[1:13:15] Your God is both your judge
[1:13:18] and your lawyer
[1:13:21] and the jury.
[1:13:22] Amen.
[1:13:24] Brother, if God be for you, who can be
[1:13:25] against you?
[1:13:26] Amen.
[1:13:27] Brother Random says something here.
[1:13:29] Amen. in um in the in the message
[1:13:33] junction of time and I want to just make
[1:13:36] sure uh we we we have this
[1:13:40] this this statement um that I'm I'mma
[1:13:43] pull out of this quote. I want you to
[1:13:45] understand that predestination is based
[1:13:47] on God's omniscience.
[1:13:50] Predestination is based on God's
[1:13:52] omniscience because he's a all knowing
[1:13:54] God. Yes, sir.
[1:13:56] And and with him being all knowing, this
[1:13:58] is not like a uh when when I used to
[1:14:01] play basketball, we have pickup games
[1:14:04] and uh and you know, we we have to shoot
[1:14:06] for captains. So, we stand there on the
[1:14:09] foul line and we stand at the
[1:14:10] three-point line and and you have to
[1:14:12] shoot and whoever make whoever the first
[1:14:14] two guys make the shot, they get a
[1:14:15] chance to pick the team. And um and we
[1:14:18] all, you know, we all standing out there
[1:14:20] trying to shoot and make a shot and and
[1:14:22] uh if if you didn't make the shot, you
[1:14:24] have to depend on the guy that's picking
[1:14:26] the team as to whether he gonna pick you
[1:14:28] up or not. Hallelujah. He just saw you
[1:14:30] shoot now and you just missed
[1:14:32] everything. So this you brricked that
[1:14:35] that that that that free throw. You
[1:14:37] bricked it. So he like this guy can't
[1:14:39] shoot. And and you start you you start
[1:14:41] observing all around to see who the
[1:14:43] players are because you trying to win,
[1:14:45] right? And and so so so so when uh when
[1:14:48] you're out there on the basketball
[1:14:49] court, this is not for ordination.
[1:14:52] This is something that's actually
[1:14:54] happening at the moment.
[1:14:56] That's right.
[1:14:56] Right. I I I'm picking this guy based on
[1:14:59] my assessment
[1:15:01] of what he just did with that that shot
[1:15:03] that he did. Or if I've seen him play
[1:15:05] before,
[1:15:06] hallelujah, then I want to pick him and
[1:15:08] put him on my team. Or maybe he has some
[1:15:10] height and I need somebody to get some
[1:15:13] rebounds. or maybe he's a little quicker
[1:15:15] than the other guys. He might be able to
[1:15:16] steal the ball. I I I'm based on my
[1:15:18] assessment of these guys, I'm gonna pick
[1:15:21] four other players to play alongside me.
[1:15:23] That's not how God predestinates.
[1:15:27] Not at all.
[1:15:27] That's how man operates, but that's not
[1:15:30] how God operate. God before the
[1:15:32] foundation of the world, he knew how you
[1:15:35] would operate in this earth. Especially
[1:15:38] when you came in contact with the
[1:15:40] revealed word or the expressed word or
[1:15:43] the predestinated word.
[1:15:45] Yes sir. Amen.
[1:15:46] Amen.
[1:15:46] God knowing how you was going to respond
[1:15:48] to that, he says, "Okay,
[1:15:50] we can uh predestinate based on this and
[1:15:52] we can provide destiny based on their
[1:15:55] decision, not my decision." But let me
[1:15:58] tell you something. Your decision to
[1:15:59] serve him is something that brings him
[1:16:01] so much glory. truth.
[1:16:04] Even when you're going through
[1:16:06] and you still want to serve him,
[1:16:08] it bring him so much glory.
[1:16:11] Jesus.
[1:16:12] Let's read this out of Amen. the
[1:16:14] junction of time. It says, "Did you ever
[1:16:17] read over there in Romans nine how he
[1:16:22] said before either boy was born, Esau
[1:16:24] and Jacob, it says, uh, I hate one and
[1:16:29] love the other one." It says, "How can
[1:16:32] he be just and do that?" So, how can he
[1:16:35] be just and do that? It says, "By
[1:16:39] fornowledge,
[1:16:41] he knew what a rascal Esau was." I like
[1:16:45] that. What a rascal Esau was. He knew
[1:16:47] what a rascal Esau was. See, and he
[1:16:51] could predestinate. Not just say uh say
[1:16:55] say the word predestinate is not a good
[1:16:57] word to use. is for knowledge because he
[1:17:00] wouldn't just uh he wouldn't just that
[1:17:03] deliberately turn away because you have
[1:17:06] he wants you to go away. He He's not
[1:17:08] willing that any of you should perish,
[1:17:10] but by forn knowledge, he know that
[1:17:13] you'll do he know what you'll do even
[1:17:15] before you ever come on the earth.
[1:17:17] Right?
[1:17:18] God Oh, I if if if you if there's a
[1:17:22] scripture I'm I'm coming to it, but he
[1:17:24] knew you before the foundation of the
[1:17:27] world.
[1:17:28] And he knew what choices you were going
[1:17:30] to make once you got here to this world.
[1:17:32] And based on him knowing the choices
[1:17:34] that you would make, he could
[1:17:35] predestinate. Hallelujah. He says this.
[1:17:38] He says he's not willing that any of you
[1:17:40] should perish, but by for knowledge he
[1:17:42] know what you'll do even before you come
[1:17:44] uh on the earth. Sure for knowledge.
[1:17:47] He's infinite. He's God. He's
[1:17:50] omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient.
[1:17:53] See, he knows all things, all wisdom,
[1:17:55] all time, covers all space, all power.
[1:17:58] He's infinite. He if he isn't that, he's
[1:18:00] not God. If he isn't almighty God, if he
[1:18:04] can't do all things, he's not almighty
[1:18:06] God. But if he's almighty God, he can do
[1:18:08] all things s. So that's the way we have
[1:18:11] to believe him. Amen. So he's referring
[1:18:14] here to Romans 9 and uh we can pick it
[1:18:17] up. Romans 9 11-13 is what he was just
[1:18:19] referring to. Uh and God God through his
[1:18:22] fornowledge, through his his wisdom, a
[1:18:25] that's how he predestinates. Amen. Not
[1:18:28] just by picking and choosing and I want
[1:18:30] you, I don't want you. No, it's it's
[1:18:32] it's what you want.
[1:18:36] This is based on what you want. Do you
[1:18:38] want him?
[1:18:40] Do you want to serve him? Do you want to
[1:18:42] live for him? And and let me tell you,
[1:18:44] if you don't, God got somebody that does
[1:18:46] want to live for him.
[1:18:48] And the one that wants to live him will
[1:18:50] bring judgment to your life.
[1:18:52] Amen. In your generation, God will have
[1:18:54] at least one witness that say, "I'm
[1:18:56] gonna live for him regardless of what
[1:18:58] happened. I'm still gonna live for him."
[1:19:01] Oh my my my my. Amen. He says this in
[1:19:04] Romans 9:1 says, "For the children,
[1:19:07] being not yet born, neither having done
[1:19:11] any good or evil, that the purpose of
[1:19:14] God according to election might stand
[1:19:17] not of works, but of him that calleth."
[1:19:21] Amen. He says, "It was said unto her,
[1:19:23] the elder shall serve the younger." As
[1:19:26] it is written, Jacob have I love, but
[1:19:29] Esau have I hated. And notice this, uh,
[1:19:32] uh, Paul is saying before they were even
[1:19:35] born,
[1:19:36] God could say, "Jacob I love,
[1:19:39] but Esau I hated." Now, you got to look
[1:19:42] at Jacob and Esau. You got to go back
[1:19:44] and look at these guys life. Amen. Uh,
[1:19:47] Jacob was a rough fella. the the a
[1:19:50] shyster. Brother Brandham call him
[1:19:53] always tricking people.
[1:19:55] I mean just it was just his nature to do
[1:19:57] things that that that just just got
[1:19:59] underneath his skin. This man tricked
[1:20:01] his brother,
[1:20:04] right? He tricked his own daddy
[1:20:07] and and and the mama knew she could
[1:20:08] cause that boy to do something like that
[1:20:10] because it was in his nature. When he
[1:20:12] got his father-in-law, he tricked the
[1:20:14] father-in-law. Yeah.
[1:20:15] And because he was tricking everybody.
[1:20:17] He got tricked on his wedding day.
[1:20:19] You got to watch what seeds you sow
[1:20:22] because they'll come back on you now.
[1:20:26] Hallelujah. This man was tricking
[1:20:27] everybody. But when he come in contact
[1:20:29] with God,
[1:20:31] hallelujah. When he had that experience
[1:20:33] where his his his walk changed,
[1:20:37] he wasn't tricking nobody no more.
[1:20:38] Hallelujah.
[1:20:40] My God. My God. And that that thing went
[1:20:42] down into his sons too now. Oh yeah.
[1:20:45] They say, "Now, you know that man, these
[1:20:46] guys just defiled our sister."
[1:20:49] What we want to do is just come up with
[1:20:51] a little plan. We'll have them all try
[1:20:52] to become like us.
[1:20:54] And the best way we can do it is they
[1:20:55] they they now they weren't born like us.
[1:20:58] But what we what we can do is have them
[1:21:00] go through this this circumcision and
[1:21:02] they'll be more like us.
[1:21:04] Now, them boys didn't they tricked that
[1:21:06] that was a trick because they knew when
[1:21:08] the man when they had them men agree to
[1:21:10] being circumcised, then the men couldn't
[1:21:12] fight.
[1:21:12] That's right. And after they got them
[1:21:14] circumcised, they went and killed all of
[1:21:16] them.
[1:21:17] See that? That thing was going from
[1:21:18] generation to generation.
[1:21:21] Oh, hallelujah. That's why you need a
[1:21:23] change inside of you so things don't
[1:21:25] pass to the next generation.
[1:21:27] You know you need a change.
[1:21:29] Amen.
[1:21:30] You know you need deliverance because I
[1:21:32] want that thing to stop here.
[1:21:35] Amen.
[1:21:36] Amen.
[1:21:36] Amen.
[1:21:37] But Esau, Esau did everything his daddy
[1:21:39] asked him to do. But but Esau just
[1:21:41] didn't he didn't he didn't have any
[1:21:43] respect for the birthright, right? He
[1:21:45] didn't have he didn't have respect for
[1:21:46] for for just about anything. He just
[1:21:48] knew it was coming to him because he was
[1:21:51] first born,
[1:21:52] right?
[1:21:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God don't want
[1:21:54] you to have that type of attitude,
[1:21:57] right? He wasn't desperate for nothing.
[1:21:59] Jacob was desperate for birthight. I
[1:22:02] mean, anything he could get, he was
[1:22:03] trying to get a blessing.
[1:22:04] He wanted the blessing. He wanted the
[1:22:06] birthright.
[1:22:07] And he would do whatever it took. And
[1:22:09] based on God knowing this man's amen
[1:22:12] decisions that he would make,
[1:22:15] God could hate one
[1:22:16] and love the other.
[1:22:18] That's right.
[1:22:19] Amen.
[1:22:19] Now, I want to tell you something. There
[1:22:21] are some folk that God is getting ready
[1:22:23] to restore
[1:22:24] and they I'm I'mma say it like this.
[1:22:26] They have said some things about you.
[1:22:29] They have said some things to you.
[1:22:32] They have walked away from the word.
[1:22:34] But God is getting ready to bring them
[1:22:35] back.
[1:22:36] Amen. And it's your response to them
[1:22:39] that God is watching.
[1:22:42] Yes, sir.
[1:22:44] Hallelujah, church.
[1:22:46] Amen. You better bury some of that stuff
[1:22:48] done that happened in the past.
[1:22:50] Amen. You better better learn to forgive
[1:22:52] and and and and try to forget. I know
[1:22:54] you can't forget, but try to forget.
[1:22:57] God, I know it happened, but I ain't
[1:22:58] going to bring it up.
[1:23:00] Amen.
[1:23:01] Oh, glory to God.
[1:23:03] People can feel whether you love them or
[1:23:05] not. Amen.
[1:23:06] Amen.
[1:23:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God ain't about
[1:23:11] to restore your favorite people.
[1:23:14] He going to restore the ones that that
[1:23:15] really cross you.
[1:23:19] And he says, he says, "This one I love."
[1:23:24] All right.
[1:23:25] Okay.
[1:23:26] So, do we know where we at?
[1:23:28] And don't be shocked when you see these
[1:23:29] things. This is this is a part of God's
[1:23:32] predestinated plan.
[1:23:34] Amen.
[1:23:34] Okay. Hey, let us go on a little
[1:23:35] further.
[1:23:36] Yeah.
[1:23:36] Amen. Predestination does not give you a
[1:23:39] license to sin.
[1:23:41] Uh predest true predestination
[1:23:43] uh in invites the predestinated one to
[1:23:46] surrender in love and also
[1:23:48] predestination going to continue to look
[1:23:50] to destiny while election looks for
[1:23:52] looks to for knowledge. Brother Brandon
[1:23:54] makes a statement here in the message
[1:23:56] restoration of the bride tree.
[1:23:59] It says this. Um Jesus said it'll be the
[1:24:03] same thing at the coming. Oh then the
[1:24:07] evening light of Malachi 4. I like that
[1:24:11] statement. The evening light of Malachi
[1:24:14] 4 come shining through the darkness.
[1:24:18] Amen. To bring the evening light on the
[1:24:21] predestinated word. The evening light of
[1:24:24] Malachi 4
[1:24:27] came shining. Amen. Through the darkness
[1:24:30] to bring the evening light on the
[1:24:33] predestinated word. So there were things
[1:24:36] written in the Bible uh about this age
[1:24:41] in which we're living. And since they
[1:24:43] were already written before we were even
[1:24:45] born, it was already in the scripture.
[1:24:48] When you picked up the Bible, Amen. And
[1:24:51] and most that would go to just the
[1:24:52] average church, they would have no idea
[1:24:54] what some of these things were that were
[1:24:56] written. But it was there in Malachi 4.
[1:24:59] It was there in Revelation 10.
[1:25:02] It was there in St. Luke 17. It was
[1:25:05] there. It was all over the Bible.
[1:25:08] And and and it took Amen. It it took the
[1:25:12] evening light of Malachi 4 to shine on
[1:25:15] them scriptures.
[1:25:17] And when we saw and and I I've said it
[1:25:19] before, I'm going to say it again. I'm
[1:25:21] not following this message just because
[1:25:25] of the miracles, the signs, and the
[1:25:26] wonders.
[1:25:28] The reason I follow a message is because
[1:25:29] I can see it in the scripture.
[1:25:34] If I couldn't see it in scripture, I'd
[1:25:36] just be just like everybody else. But
[1:25:38] because I can see it in the scripture,
[1:25:41] it gives me clarity. Yes, sir.
[1:25:43] Amen.
[1:25:44] Oh my God. And and I'm I'm I'm so
[1:25:47] convinced that no matter what anybody
[1:25:49] else does, I'm staying right with this.
[1:25:53] And not only not only am I standing I
[1:25:55] think we many of us have proven, Amen.
[1:25:58] that no matter what happens, we're going
[1:26:00] to stay right with this word.
[1:26:03] What word are we standing with? The
[1:26:05] predestinated word.
[1:26:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:10] Not let I I want you to understand not
[1:26:13] only were you predestinated but the word
[1:26:16] itself was predestinated.
[1:26:19] And when the predestinated seed come in
[1:26:21] contact with the predestinated word,
[1:26:23] brother, something is about to happen.
[1:26:25] Amen.
[1:26:26] It's already happened.
[1:26:29] Glory to God. Let me keep on reading.
[1:26:31] Amen. And he says uh the then the
[1:26:34] evening light of Malachi 4 comes shining
[1:26:37] through the darkness. Amen. To bring the
[1:26:40] evening light on the predestinated word.
[1:26:43] Hallelujah.
[1:26:45] Uh uh he says what's the fourth message
[1:26:47] to be? What's that fourth messenger? To
[1:26:50] shine the light on the word. The word is
[1:26:54] predestinated. It's it it has to come
[1:26:56] forth. Something has to do it. For God
[1:26:59] said, "I will restore," sayaith the
[1:27:02] Lord. "I will restore." Right? The
[1:27:05] evening lights come shining through on
[1:27:07] that predestinated word. Yes, sir. Let
[1:27:11] me just finish reading this if I can.
[1:27:13] It's so much inspiration here for me.
[1:27:16] Um, you know, I I go through a a number
[1:27:19] number of things. I I think about my
[1:27:20] brother-in-law back there, brother
[1:27:21] Smiley. And when um he tells his
[1:27:24] testimony quite often, how uh you know,
[1:27:27] he he did a lot of things to get free
[1:27:30] from from what the enemy had him bound
[1:27:31] there. It says uh but when he come to
[1:27:34] that church and and and y'all y'all
[1:27:36] might not know uh brother but brother
[1:27:38] George Manley was around at that time
[1:27:42] and brother George was always witnessing
[1:27:44] and and and and brother Smiley probably
[1:27:46] got hemmed up with George Manley.
[1:27:49] Brother George Manley and but brother
[1:27:50] George Manley always spoke in mysteries,
[1:27:55] you know, I mean he he just he just you
[1:27:57] know he says uh and and back there we we
[1:27:59] were under inspiration you know of seven
[1:28:02] thunders give faith and brother George
[1:28:03] always seven thunders give faith and I
[1:28:06] believe brother Smile one time said
[1:28:07] brother what what is the seven thunders
[1:28:09] and brother George answer it's a
[1:28:11] revelation
[1:28:12] see you speaking in a mystery God don't
[1:28:15] want us just talking mysteries I mean
[1:28:17] brother tell me what the seven if You
[1:28:19] going to say seven thunders get faith.
[1:28:20] Tell me what the seven thunders is.
[1:28:23] Hallelujah.
[1:28:24] Glory to God. And but it's just
[1:28:26] mysterious. I'm going just help you. I'm
[1:28:27] not going to just leave you there. If
[1:28:28] you The seven thunders is the mysteries
[1:28:31] contained in the seven seals.
[1:28:33] So if anybody ask you what the seven
[1:28:34] thunders is, it's the mysteries
[1:28:36] contained in the seven seals. That's
[1:28:37] that's a very simple answer and it is
[1:28:39] the answer,
[1:28:40] right? But but brother George didn't
[1:28:42] make it. He didn't break it down like he
[1:28:43] said, brother. This a revelation. But
[1:28:45] you know what? Even though he was
[1:28:46] speaking mysterious. Oh my. It didn't
[1:28:49] shake. Brother Smiley.
[1:28:52] He said something to this.
[1:28:55] I don't I don't understand all this yet,
[1:28:57] but it's something to this. And And
[1:28:59] there was something on the inside. Even
[1:29:01] though he was bound with drugs and
[1:29:02] everything else at that time,
[1:29:04] brother, there was a light that struck
[1:29:06] on the inside.
[1:29:08] You can't look at the man's outward
[1:29:10] condition. God is looking on the inside.
[1:29:14] And when God knows that there was
[1:29:16] something placed there, when he comes in
[1:29:18] contact
[1:29:19] with the predestinated word,
[1:29:22] oh, that's the thing that keeps you for
[1:29:25] over 30 years.
[1:29:28] Hallelujah,
[1:29:30] brother. The other programs wouldn't do
[1:29:32] it,
[1:29:33] but when you come in contact with a
[1:29:35] predestinated word,
[1:29:37] a change happens.
[1:29:39] Hallelujah.
[1:29:41] Oh, I'm trying to get somewhere. I know
[1:29:42] what I'm talking about.
[1:29:44] A change happens when people come in
[1:29:47] contact with a predestinated word.
[1:29:49] Amen.
[1:29:50] All you got to do is just get them into
[1:29:51] the atmosphere. Look, we we we having
[1:29:53] meetings and and the preachers that we
[1:29:55] got, they preach the word.
[1:29:57] Hallelujah.
[1:29:58] Can I put it can I put it this way? They
[1:29:59] preach the predestinated
[1:30:02] word.
[1:30:03] Amen.
[1:30:04] Let me keep reading here.
[1:30:06] Something has to do it. God said, "I
[1:30:08] will restore, sayith the Lord. I will
[1:30:10] restore right. The evening lights come
[1:30:12] shining through on that predestinated
[1:30:13] word." Yes, sir. Oh, it shall be light
[1:30:16] in the evening time. The path to glory
[1:30:18] you will surely find in the waterway is
[1:30:21] the light today. It's buried in the
[1:30:24] precious name of Jesus. Young and old,
[1:30:26] repent of all your sins. The Holy Ghost
[1:30:28] will surely enter in for the evening
[1:30:30] lights have come. It's a fact that God
[1:30:33] and Christ are one. He says, "There they
[1:30:36] are one together, one in us." The same
[1:30:40] signs human beings can't do is a man is
[1:30:42] manifest themselves comes out the word
[1:30:45] to bring forth the predestinated word of
[1:30:47] God out of the roots of the tree back
[1:30:49] yonder that all the denominations that
[1:30:52] refused and refused and refused. But
[1:30:55] there will come a light forth. Amen. Uh
[1:30:58] there will come a light will rise.
[1:31:01] Whereabouts over in Jerusalem? No sir.
[1:31:03] Evening lights will not rise in
[1:31:05] Jerusalem. The evening lights goes
[1:31:07] where? In the west. They had their day
[1:31:10] and refused it. So the evening lights
[1:31:12] will shine in the west. We've seen that
[1:31:14] through the ministry, amen, of William,
[1:31:16] Mary, and Brandham. We thank God for
[1:31:17] that. He he's he was talking about these
[1:31:20] um this fourth message. And we realize
[1:31:22] that um the four uh death messengers,
[1:31:25] the palmer worm, the cankerorm, the the
[1:31:28] locust, the caterpillar, they ate and
[1:31:30] just brought death to the church.
[1:31:32] Amen. Not just to the church, but even
[1:31:34] in our own individual lives. They've
[1:31:35] been these rascals been just eating up
[1:31:37] and just messing up stuff.
[1:31:39] Folk been backslitting for years.
[1:31:42] Years. Don't know how to get out of what
[1:31:44] they're in.
[1:31:45] But but here's the thing. I I I God made
[1:31:47] a promise.
[1:31:49] God sees them in that condition. And God
[1:31:51] made a promise. I will restore, sayeth
[1:31:53] the Lord.
[1:31:54] Now, there's only one thing God needs us
[1:31:56] to do, and that is just share. Amen.
[1:32:00] this opportunity with the people to
[1:32:02] bring them into his presence.
[1:32:04] Hallelujah. All it takes is for light to
[1:32:07] strike the seed.
[1:32:09] We go and we create the right atmosphere
[1:32:11] and light strike the seed. You we will
[1:32:14] see restoration.
[1:32:17] I don't care how bad off a person is.
[1:32:20] We will see restoration because God made
[1:32:22] a promise.
[1:32:24] All we got to do is just get them there.
[1:32:26] And when you get them there, keep them
[1:32:27] there.
[1:32:28] Hallelujah. Keep I mean get get around
[1:32:30] them and talk with them like you coming
[1:32:31] back to the service tonight.

[1:33:54] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:33:55] Amen.
[1:33:56] Glory to God. Help me, Lord.
[1:33:59] I don't know why I felt that.

[1:34:39] come, you ought to be encouraging. Now,
[1:34:41] I know you're going to I'm going to see
[1:34:42] you tonight, right? You come back
[1:34:43] tonight. Oh, I'm going to see you in the
[1:34:45] morning, too, right? Wasn't that a
[1:34:46] blessed service? Wasn't that a good ser?
[1:34:47] Create an atmosphere.
[1:34:50] Amen. Hallelujah. You know that you know
[1:34:52] how the devil going to fight people
[1:34:53] trying to keep them away from this. You
[1:34:55] got to be that encourager. I'm looking
[1:34:56] for you tomorrow.
[1:34:57] Yes, sir.
[1:34:58] I'm saving a seat for you tomorrow.
[1:35:00] Hallelujah.
[1:35:02] Glory to God. All right. All right. All
[1:35:04] right. So, these four stages, Amen, of
[1:35:08] this insect, this rascal, palmer,
[1:35:11] cankerworm, caterpillar, locust, uh they
[1:35:13] ate, but there was four life messengers,
[1:35:16] brother Brandham said, that came uh to
[1:35:18] the earth. And one was the ministry of
[1:35:20] Luther. Another was the the the the the
[1:35:23] ministry of of Wesley. And then he said
[1:35:26] the the what God did amongst the
[1:35:28] Pentecostals.
[1:35:30] Amen. That brought life back into the
[1:35:32] church. It brought confusion too.
[1:35:35] But it did bring life back into the
[1:35:36] church. But the last thing to come to
[1:35:38] bring life that fourth amen uh life
[1:35:41] messenger was the predestinated word of
[1:35:45] Malachi 4. The ministry of William
[1:35:48] Brandham is what brought the additional
[1:35:49] life back into the church. Puts us back
[1:35:52] on the word. Hallelujah. Now look at
[1:35:55] this. Uh it was very similar and and and
[1:35:58] and and what happened with the four
[1:36:01] stages of Ezekiel's dry bones. And let's
[1:36:03] just kind of pick up a scripture out of
[1:36:05] Ezekiel 37. Amen.
[1:36:09] Glory to God. Verse three. Oh yes. Yes.
[1:36:14] Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:17] Amen. Look at this hopeless situation.
[1:36:21] Hallelujah. In Ezekiel uh 37:3, "And he
[1:36:24] said unto me, son of man, can these
[1:36:26] bones live?"
[1:36:29] And I answered, "Oh Lord God, thou
[1:36:32] knowest."
[1:36:34] And again he said unto me, "Oh,
[1:36:36] hallelujah.
[1:36:38] You know whether the bones can live."
[1:36:40] And God God Yeah, God does know because
[1:36:42] he ordained
[1:36:44] for ordained predestinated for them
[1:36:47] bones to live
[1:36:49] even in their dry condition. God had
[1:36:52] already promis God knew in his mind
[1:36:54] these bones were going to live.
[1:36:56] Look at this. He says again, he said to
[1:36:58] me, "Prophesy
[1:37:01] upon these bones."
[1:37:02] Right?
[1:37:04] Can I Can I say it like this? Speak to
[1:37:07] your hopeless situation.
[1:37:10] Lord.
[1:37:11] Amen.
[1:37:12] Amen.
[1:37:12] You know how it changes through what you
[1:37:14] say.
[1:37:15] You know how it got in that condition?
[1:37:17] By what you said.
[1:37:20] Now you need to change it by what you
[1:37:21] say.
[1:37:22] Speak life into that condition.
[1:37:25] It wasn't I mean God going to use
[1:37:27] Ezekiel to bring the bones to life
[1:37:30] again. He says, he says again, he said,
[1:37:32] "They prophesy upon these bones and say
[1:37:34] unto them, oh ye dry bones, oh my, my my
[1:37:37] my, hear the word of the Lord.
[1:37:42] Thus saith the Lord God unto these
[1:37:45] bones, behold, I will cause breath to
[1:37:49] enter into you, and ye shall live." I
[1:37:52] believe that. I believe that. He says,
[1:37:55] "And I will lay senus upon you and and
[1:37:58] will bring uh bring up bring up flesh
[1:38:00] upon you and cover you with skin and put
[1:38:03] breath in you and ye shall live and ye
[1:38:06] shall know that I am the Lord."
[1:38:09] Look at this. He says, "So I prophesied
[1:38:12] as I was commanded and as I prophesied,
[1:38:15] there was a noise.
[1:38:17] God moved immediately."
[1:38:19] Hallelujah. Come on.
[1:38:20] Come on.
[1:38:21] As I prophesied,
[1:38:24] there was a noise. I believe a noise is
[1:38:26] taking place right now.
[1:38:28] Brother, the the the the inspirations I
[1:38:30] will restore, sayeth the Lord.
[1:38:33] We prophesying to every dead bone.
[1:38:36] That's right.
[1:38:37] My God. Hallelujah. And as as he was
[1:38:40] prophesying and he as I I I prophesied
[1:38:43] as I was commanded and as I prophesied
[1:38:45] there was a noise and behold a shaken
[1:38:48] and the bones came together bone to his
[1:38:51] bone and when I behold lo the senus and
[1:38:54] the flesh came up upon them and the skin
[1:38:57] covered them above but there was no
[1:38:59] breath in them. Hallelujah. It says then
[1:39:03] said he unto me prophesy unto the wind.
[1:39:07] Prophesy, son of man, and say to the
[1:39:09] wind, thus sayeth the Lord God, come
[1:39:13] from the four winds, O breath, and
[1:39:14] breathe upon these flame that they may
[1:39:17] live.
[1:39:18] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and
[1:39:21] the breath came into them, and they
[1:39:23] lived and stood up upon their feet, and
[1:39:27] exceeding and great army.
[1:39:29] We're looking for God to do just
[1:39:32] these type of things in our midst. Yes,
[1:39:35] I'm talking about real restoration.
[1:39:37] Brother, if this weren't restoration, I
[1:39:39] don't know what it was,
[1:39:41] I mean bones. The the situation looked
[1:39:44] hopeless.
[1:39:45] But when he begin to speak to bones,
[1:39:48] God be to restore bones.
[1:39:52] Here there was there was there was four
[1:39:55] stages. The palmer worm, the locust, the
[1:39:56] cakeworm, the caterpillar. The palmer
[1:39:58] ate the brotherly love. That's the fruit
[1:40:00] that he ate. The locust ate divine
[1:40:03] fellowship. The canka worm uh was
[1:40:07] attacking the bark of the tree. He was
[1:40:09] attacking the doctrine or the religion
[1:40:12] of the covering. I'm I'm I'm I want to
[1:40:15] make it very clear. The canker worm
[1:40:19] attacks the doctrine.
[1:40:23] The cankerorm
[1:40:25] gets caught up with believe the sign.
[1:40:31] that the canker worm used to believe
[1:40:35] these things
[1:40:37] but somehow something happened a spirit
[1:40:39] came on them and they stopped believing
[1:40:41] this
[1:40:42] canko worm
[1:40:44] h
[1:40:45] but cankerorm goes on the caterpillar
[1:40:48] stage and that sucks the life right out
[1:40:51] of them look at them many of them out
[1:40:53] there
[1:40:54] life is gone
[1:40:55] oh my my know how to get life back into
[1:40:58] them just get them into the environment
[1:41:00] That's right.
[1:41:01] That's right.
[1:41:02] And them bones can live.
[1:41:05] Them bones can live. And not only can
[1:41:07] they live, they will live.
[1:41:09] But it's based on what you saying to the
[1:41:11] bones now.
[1:41:12] Oh my god. My God. My God. I'm happy to
[1:41:16] see you bone.
[1:41:21] I'm blessed to see you.
[1:41:24] You don't know how what you mean to the
[1:41:26] body.
[1:41:26] You were such a blessing to me. always
[1:41:29] have been a blessing to me.
[1:41:33] I can't even function without you.
[1:41:36] My God. It's when when you see these
[1:41:39] types of people coming in. Don't you be
[1:41:41] alerted.
[1:41:42] Just remember we are under the
[1:41:44] inspiration of something. What is this
[1:41:46] inspiration? I will restore
[1:41:49] saith.
[1:41:51] Amen.
[1:41:52] The Lord.
[1:41:53] Amen.
[1:41:54] Amen. I got to I I need to I I want to
[1:41:57] show you your importance in this.
[1:42:00] The way you handle people,
[1:42:01] the way you speak to people.
[1:42:04] Don't be like the prodigal son's
[1:42:05] brother,
[1:42:07] but be like the prodical son's father,
[1:42:09] right?
[1:42:10] Be ready to give him a ring of gold.
[1:42:13] Put him on a robe.
[1:42:15] Kill the fatted calf.
[1:42:17] Huh?
[1:42:18] Invite him to the food truck and buy
[1:42:21] them something to eat.
[1:42:22] All right. All right.
[1:42:25] Woo Lord, I'm telling you, church, it's
[1:42:27] the way that we handle people.
[1:42:30] Glory to God. Not I remember what you
[1:42:32] said about me and and I never forgave
[1:42:34] you for that. No, don't you come up with
[1:42:36] that nonsense.
[1:42:38] Hallelujah.
[1:42:39] Amen.
[1:42:40] Right. But see, see, see, that palmer
[1:42:42] worm ate the brotherly love and Amen.
[1:42:44] the fruit. The locust ate the leaves of
[1:42:46] divine fellowship. The cankworm, he it
[1:42:49] attacked the bark of the tree, attacked
[1:42:51] the doctrine, the religion, the
[1:42:52] covering. And then the caterpillar
[1:42:54] sucked the whole life out. Amen. But
[1:42:57] just like in Ezekiel's uh prophecy uh
[1:43:00] when he spoke to those bones it four
[1:43:03] stages of life came. First was the senue
[1:43:06] was laid back on him which was the
[1:43:07] tendon the natural cords that hold the
[1:43:10] body together. Amen. Then it brought
[1:43:12] flesh. That's the soft part of the
[1:43:14] animal body. And we need a heart of
[1:43:16] flesh. A tender heart towards God and a
[1:43:19] tender heart towards our brothers and
[1:43:21] sisters.
[1:43:22] Amen. He also covered them with skin.
[1:43:24] And that's the natural covering for our
[1:43:26] flesh. Amen. And the last thing he did,
[1:43:29] he put he put a breath in them. Amen.
[1:43:32] Which was the spirit giving life to
[1:43:34] them.
[1:43:36] Oh, we're looking for all this to happen
[1:43:38] here in this message. Um,
[1:43:43] Hebrews chapter 7 part one.
[1:43:47] I want to
[1:43:49] bring this in because
[1:43:51] God God knows exactly where his people
[1:43:54] are. God knows exactly what his people
[1:43:58] have been going through.
[1:44:00] God God is aware of all of that. Amen.
[1:44:04] God is not caught off guard by any of
[1:44:06] it.
[1:44:07] But he and and he say this is a great
[1:44:09] army that he sent amongst us.
[1:44:12] Hallelujah. God allowed these things to
[1:44:13] happen. But it's how we respond, how we
[1:44:16] react uh when we start seeing
[1:44:18] restoration. Amen. Uh here in this this
[1:44:21] message of Hebrews chapter 7 part one,
[1:44:23] brother M says if you take it over in
[1:44:25] Jeremiah 14, he means 15, he says, God
[1:44:29] said, I knew you before you was even
[1:44:32] formed in your mother's womb and I
[1:44:34] sanctified you and ordained you a
[1:44:36] prophet to the nations. Then what can
[1:44:38] you say uh that you did?
[1:44:40] Right?
[1:44:41] What can you say that you did? No, it's
[1:44:43] nothing that we did. He says, "What can
[1:44:45] I say that I did?" It's God that showeth
[1:44:47] mercy.
[1:44:48] God knew us before the foundation of the
[1:44:51] world. He's not willing that any should
[1:44:53] perish. Certainly not. But if he is God,
[1:44:56] he know who would be saved and who
[1:44:58] wouldn't be saved. Or he didn't know
[1:45:00] anything. If he didn't know, if he
[1:45:02] didn't know who would make the rapture,
[1:45:05] I like that statement.
[1:45:07] If he didn't know who would make the
[1:45:08] rapture before the world was ever
[1:45:11] formed, then he's not God.
[1:45:13] Now, can I tell y'all something?
[1:45:15] It's people that are not here right now.
[1:45:19] Yes, sir.
[1:45:22] They're in a backsliding condition.
[1:45:24] But God already knew that they were
[1:45:26] going to make the rapture.
[1:45:27] All right.
[1:45:28] All right.
[1:45:29] In order for them to make the rapture,
[1:45:31] hallelujah,
[1:45:33] then there's a predestinated word that
[1:45:35] has to come to them.
[1:45:37] Hallelujah. And for them to respond to
[1:45:39] that predestinated word. Amen. Right.
[1:45:41] that's going to cause them to get in
[1:45:43] line with rapture conditions.
[1:45:46] Amen.
[1:45:47] So, if God already knows they're going
[1:45:48] to make the rapture, then God has to
[1:45:50] make a way for them to be restored.
[1:45:53] Hallelujah.
[1:45:54] Amen.
[1:45:55] And all he told us to do is just hold
[1:45:56] the meetings.
[1:45:59] Oh, can I can I put it this way? Your
[1:46:00] your finances, God going to bless you
[1:46:03] because you gave towards the meetings,
[1:46:05] right? And we we we just have to create
[1:46:07] the environment for the restoration to
[1:46:10] occur. We don't have to do the
[1:46:11] restoration, just create the
[1:46:13] environment.
[1:46:14] Yes, sir.
[1:46:16] Jesus,
[1:46:17] watch it. We're going to hear some
[1:46:18] powerful testimonies.
[1:46:20] I I believe that it says if if he didn't
[1:46:22] know who would make the rapture before
[1:46:24] the world was ever formed, then he's not
[1:46:26] God. If he's infinite, he knowed every
[1:46:28] flea, every fly, every louse, every
[1:46:32] every tiger that would ever be on the
[1:46:34] earth before the earth was ever formed.
[1:46:36] That's right. He knew all things before
[1:46:37] the foundation world. He knew us. The
[1:46:39] Bible said he knew us and predestinated
[1:46:42] us. I I love that. Let me just read
[1:46:44] Jeremiah 15 and I'm gonna move move on
[1:46:48] to just a little something here.
[1:46:51] This is all for his will, for his
[1:46:53] purpose, for his glory. Jeremiah 15 says
[1:46:56] this, "Before I formed thee
[1:47:00] in the belly, I knew thee. And before
[1:47:03] thou camest forth out of the womb, I
[1:47:05] sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a
[1:47:08] prophet unto the nations. Before you was
[1:47:10] even born, God already knew you. And and
[1:47:12] I love when it says, "I knew," that
[1:47:14] means God had fellowship with you.
[1:47:16] Hallelujah.
[1:47:17] God had fellowship with you.
[1:47:19] God God had fellowship with you in the
[1:47:21] beginning. And And if he knew you in the
[1:47:23] beginning, he knows you now.
[1:47:26] And he knew that he was not going to
[1:47:28] lose you in the beginning.
[1:47:30] He won't lose you now.
[1:47:32] Mama wrote the song, I never lost one.
[1:47:36] All that the father's given me. Oh,
[1:47:39] what's going to happen to them?
[1:47:43] All that the father's given me,
[1:47:46] they will come. But we have to we have
[1:47:49] to welcome them as they come.
[1:47:52] That's exactly.
[1:47:52] Come on, church.
[1:47:53] Amen.
[1:47:54] I want you to understand. Amen. Uh
[1:47:57] something here. The reason that you
[1:48:01] you have to um have this welcoming
[1:48:05] spirit
[1:48:07] is um
[1:48:12] it's because God has orchestrated
[1:48:16] and God has a way for people to come to
[1:48:21] life.
[1:48:23] Oh my.
[1:48:26] In the book of uh Acts chapter 8, there
[1:48:28] was a story of
[1:48:31] Philillip
[1:48:33] and Philillip was uh he was actually in
[1:48:36] a city running a revival. He's doing
[1:48:38] this great meeting. There was great
[1:48:41] things happening. But there was one soul
[1:48:44] on the back side of the desert riding in
[1:48:47] a carriage to go home. This was a a a
[1:48:49] Ethiopian uh soldier. And uh God caused
[1:48:54] Philillip to leave the revival where he
[1:48:56] was. He says, "Go there to the the
[1:48:58] backside of the desert and you'll, you
[1:49:00] know, he didn't even tell him what he
[1:49:01] would see,
[1:49:02] but when he got to the back side of the
[1:49:04] desert, he saw a chariot and he just ran
[1:49:06] up on the chariot." And when he runs up
[1:49:08] on the chariot, what he could hear is a
[1:49:11] man in there reading his Bible.
[1:49:13] Oh my.
[1:49:14] Hallelujah. And as the man was reading,
[1:49:17] he was reading there in Isaiah, you
[1:49:19] know, and and as he was referring, you
[1:49:21] know, back to the book of Isaiah. And
[1:49:24] uh, you know, he was wounded for our
[1:49:25] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[1:49:27] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:49:29] pieces upon him with his stripes were
[1:49:30] healed. The the the the Ethiopian was a
[1:49:32] little confused like who who is this
[1:49:35] prophet talking about? Is this prophet
[1:49:37] talking about himself or he's talking
[1:49:39] about somebody else?
[1:49:41] All right.
[1:49:42] Hallelujah. But Philillip was the one
[1:49:44] that had the understanding of what that
[1:49:46] scripture was. Amen. So, Philillip had
[1:49:49] to break it down because Philip had come
[1:49:51] in contact with the one the scripture
[1:49:53] was talking about.
[1:49:55] The Lord Jesus Christ. So, Philip began
[1:49:57] to break down this scripture. Oh my. And
[1:50:00] as he begin to just open, amen, the word
[1:50:02] to this man, there was something inside
[1:50:04] that man heart that agreed with
[1:50:07] everything Philip was talking about, he
[1:50:10] says, he said, "Wait a He said, "Stop
[1:50:12] this chariot."
[1:50:13] He said, "There's water right there. Can
[1:50:16] anybody forbid me from being baptized?"
[1:50:19] Hallelujah.
[1:50:21] I mean, immediate change happened once
[1:50:23] that man came in contact with the
[1:50:24] predestinated word.
[1:50:26] That's right.
[1:50:27] Amen.
[1:50:28] Here's a statement that brother Brandham
[1:50:29] said. He says it was an angel that told
[1:50:32] Philillip to go there to the desert. The
[1:50:35] angel couldn't go to the desert and have
[1:50:38] this conversation with that man.
[1:50:42] Philip had to be the one to have the
[1:50:44] conversation with that man.
[1:50:46] And the reason that this was in place
[1:50:48] because God has orchestrated
[1:50:50] that the seed
[1:50:53] has to pass
[1:50:55] through the body.
[1:50:57] Amen.
[1:50:58] Amen.
[1:50:58] Amen.
[1:50:59] God wants to use your body
[1:51:02] so that the seed could pass through
[1:51:05] the body
[1:51:12] hallelujah to the lamb of God.
[1:51:14] Amen.
[1:51:14] This why you got to have the right
[1:51:15] attitude.
[1:51:17] This why you got to have the right
[1:51:18] spirit.
[1:51:19] God wants to use your vessel. I I I'm
[1:51:21] trying to make it as clear as possible.
[1:51:23] God wants to use your vessel to cause
[1:51:25] the seed to pass through to somebody
[1:51:27] else.
[1:51:27] Jesus. The word seat,
[1:51:31] the predestinated
[1:51:33] word seat,
[1:51:35] it has to come through you.
[1:51:39] Oh Jesus, not the preacher.
[1:51:43] You,
[1:51:46] let me read it. spoken words original
[1:51:49] seed
[1:51:55] says
[1:51:57] notice the unic over here we're getting
[1:52:00] he says we're going to get into
[1:52:01] something deep now watch this seed
[1:52:04] church this real church with the real
[1:52:07] true sperm notice the unic had been with
[1:52:09] all the deities now remember God never
[1:52:12] committed God never committed his
[1:52:14] preaching in his gospel to an angel how
[1:52:16] many knows that how many knows at
[1:52:17] Galatians 1:8 and and if an angel come
[1:52:20] from heaven and preached something else
[1:52:21] besides uh they had preached let it be a
[1:52:24] curse. So the angels wrong if he's
[1:52:26] different from the word God came on down
[1:52:29] below angels and committed it to men
[1:52:33] which were sons. You believe that? Now
[1:52:36] watch now he never committed it to
[1:52:38] angels. Notice he did not do it. And and
[1:52:41] I'm going to tell you another thing God
[1:52:42] didn't do. God didn't commit preaching
[1:52:43] to a tape recorder.
[1:52:44] No sir,
[1:52:46] right? Amen.
[1:52:47] Or a CD player
[1:52:49] or a telephone that can play MP3s.
[1:52:52] That's not That's not where God
[1:52:53] committed it. It's to preachers. This is
[1:52:55] why this is why it's important for
[1:52:57] people to come to service and hear
[1:52:58] preaching.
[1:53:00] That's where God committed it.
[1:53:01] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:04] Watch. He says this. He says, "Now,
[1:53:06] Philip had been up to Pentecost
[1:53:08] Jerusalem to worship." How many says
[1:53:10] amen to that? The unic had been with all
[1:53:12] the DDs and LDs and everything. But why
[1:53:15] didn't he get something? He come back
[1:53:17] down studying the prophet of prophecy of
[1:53:19] Isaiah. Although an angel directed
[1:53:22] Philillip to him, but the germ of life
[1:53:26] had to come through the body.
[1:53:30] Philillip, oh brother, now now we're on
[1:53:32] now we're on the line. Where did the
[1:53:35] germ come from? Through the angel. The
[1:53:39] angel showed him where to go. A angel is
[1:53:42] a messenger. Here's a son. Philillip had
[1:53:44] the germ, the message, the word. That's
[1:53:49] how a child can be born.
[1:53:52] My Philip had had his hands upon him.
[1:53:55] Philip baptized him in the name of Jesus
[1:53:58] Christ. There come forth the spirit of
[1:54:00] God. Sure. Now, the germ had to come
[1:54:02] from the body. What body? Christ's body.
[1:54:05] Correct. And Philip was a member of the
[1:54:08] body. The germ comes from the body. You
[1:54:12] are the body. This why we need everybody
[1:54:14] at church.
[1:54:15] That's right.
[1:54:16] Amen.
[1:54:16] You You help bring people to life.
[1:54:20] The seed passes through you. The germ of
[1:54:22] life passes through you.
[1:54:26] Amen.
[1:54:27] You don't know who will be there the day
[1:54:28] that you was planning on missing.
[1:54:31] And somebody might have been looking for
[1:54:33] you specifically.
[1:54:35] That's true.
[1:54:37] Hallelujah.
[1:54:38] And you out of place.
[1:54:41] But predestination brings you to
[1:54:42] destiny. It puts you in your place
[1:54:46] in Christ.
[1:54:47] Amen. The seed or the germ has a pass
[1:54:51] through the body. Look at this. He goes
[1:54:52] on to give us a little bit more. It's
[1:54:53] not just with Philip and the unic, but
[1:54:54] this this happens also. He says, "Now
[1:54:56] listen, the same thing took place in
[1:54:58] Acts 10:48. Peter was on the housetop.
[1:55:01] An angel directed him to Kia's house.
[1:55:04] But when uh but where did the word come
[1:55:07] from?" The body. Oh, I feel pretty good.
[1:55:10] feel like traveling on. He says an angel
[1:55:13] come and said, "Don't worry. Don't call
[1:55:15] nothing unclean. Just go on. Don't think
[1:55:18] nothing." And while Peter spake these
[1:55:21] words, not the angel. Oh my. See, that's
[1:55:26] I'm expecting that. Why the holy the
[1:55:27] ministers just while they speaking the
[1:55:29] word, the power of God just fall all
[1:55:30] over the place. But the it's and and God
[1:55:33] want to do that. God want to prove
[1:55:35] himself. This that's how lives are
[1:55:37] changed when the spirit comes in on the
[1:55:38] word, right? He says this. He says uh he
[1:55:41] says um um uh the the body oh my feel
[1:55:44] pretty good feel like travel. And the
[1:55:45] angel come and said don't worry. Don't
[1:55:46] call nothing unclean. Just go on. Don't
[1:55:48] don't don't think nothing. And while
[1:55:50] Peter spake these words not the angel
[1:55:52] not the cardinal. While Peter spake
[1:55:55] these words what? He was the body. He
[1:55:57] had the word. The word took hold. Oh
[1:56:00] brother. Woo h. He says oh a angel
[1:56:04] directed it but the life come through
[1:56:06] the body of Christ.
[1:56:08] God will establish the meetings, but he
[1:56:11] needs your body.
[1:56:12] Amen.
[1:56:13] Amen.
[1:56:14] God will have a a a a high school that
[1:56:17] will open up the auditorium for us, but
[1:56:18] he needs your body.
[1:56:21] Amen.
[1:56:22] Amen.
[1:56:23] Let me go a little further. It says,
[1:56:25] "Paul on his way to Damascus, a vision
[1:56:28] directed him, but Ananas had the germ.
[1:56:33] Had the word." Amen. The prophet Ananas
[1:56:36] saw a vision and said, "Go up there and
[1:56:37] and lay your hands on him." Said,
[1:56:40] "Brother Saul, the Lord appeared to you
[1:56:42] on the road coming down here." Now, now
[1:56:44] he tells Ananas to go lay your hands.
[1:56:46] Why? I mean, because brother Brand say
[1:56:49] the germ was passing through Ananas even
[1:56:51] to a messenger.
[1:56:57] The germ is passing through
[1:56:59] Anonyas
[1:57:01] to the messenger for that age.
[1:57:06] And Ananas was afraid to go deal with
[1:57:08] Paul.
[1:57:10] Oh, I'm I'm going somewhere.
[1:57:13] Ananas was a little afraid to go deal
[1:57:15] with Paul.
[1:57:16] It might be somebody that might go to
[1:57:17] the altar. You know their life story.
[1:57:20] You might be a little afraid to go deal
[1:57:22] with them. But remember, the seed passes
[1:57:26] or the germ passes through us.
[1:57:29] So when you go and lay hands on them and
[1:57:31] pray with them at the altar,
[1:57:34] you don't know what is actually
[1:57:35] transpiring. I can tell you what's
[1:57:37] happening. Restoration
[1:57:40] is occurring. But you have to be in your
[1:57:42] place. You have to be prepared. God has
[1:57:45] a predestinated word for a predestinated
[1:57:48] people. But it needs us ready.
[1:57:52] The Holy Spirit be telling go pray pray
[1:57:54] with that sister. Go pray with that
[1:57:56] sister.
[1:57:57] Brothers go pray with that brother.
[1:57:58] Brother, go pray that God God will be
[1:58:00] leading you and you got to be obedient
[1:58:02] to the spirit.
[1:58:03] That's right.
[1:58:04] That's right.
[1:58:04] Look, look, look, look, look. Let me
[1:58:06] tell you something. In meetings, we
[1:58:07] expect deliverance.
[1:58:09] Amen.
[1:58:11] Amen.
[1:58:11] And you don't know what kind of what
[1:58:13] kind of conditions people going to come
[1:58:14] in there. I want to tell y'all young
[1:58:16] people, be reverent when you're there in
[1:58:17] the services. You don't know what type
[1:58:19] of spirits people coming with. And and
[1:58:21] when the spirit leave, it's looking for
[1:58:22] another house to go into. back.
[1:58:27] So, you need to come. You need to be
[1:58:28] prepared yourself. You don't know. We
[1:58:30] done we done been in meetings and and
[1:58:32] and uh I mean, my god. And we had a a a
[1:58:36] prayer line and this one sister, my God,
[1:58:39] she she she she really she had um she
[1:58:44] had she had a spirit on her.
[1:58:46] And man, what a what a what a
[1:58:48] demonstration that happened before
[1:58:50] everybody. But you know what? That same
[1:58:52] sister today, she's probably watching
[1:58:53] right now. That same sister today, I can
[1:58:55] look her in the eye and I can see God
[1:58:58] made a difference in her life.
[1:59:01] That same sister sends her tithes and
[1:59:03] offerings to the church.
[1:59:05] The sister that was bound at a meeting.
[1:59:09] Oh my.
[1:59:10] But when I but and I had I I I knew the
[1:59:13] I knew the sister uh from what had
[1:59:15] happened in the meeting. But when I met
[1:59:16] her years later, I said, "Is this the
[1:59:17] same sister?" Yes, the same sister. I'm
[1:59:20] telling you what God is able to do.
[1:59:22] The power of God is greater than any
[1:59:25] power of the devil.
[1:59:28] We have to be prepared.
[1:59:30] Our spirit man has to be ready for what
[1:59:32] God has given do. We will see
[1:59:34] restoration.
[1:59:37] We will see it. And some of your family
[1:59:39] members need it.
[1:59:41] Just invite them to the services.
[1:59:43] Oh my. Some church, y'all be ready.
[1:59:46] Look, look, y'all can't just can't be
[1:59:47] waiting for the the preachers to do
[1:59:48] everything. Y'all need to be ready. God
[1:59:50] lead you. Go pray with somebody. Pray.
[1:59:52] But make sure now make sure your life is
[1:59:54] right.
[1:59:54] That's right.
[1:59:55] Cuz a demon will embarrass you.
[1:59:58] I've seen that happen, too.
[2:00:00] I seen a brother go into office and this
[2:00:02] brother was bound with demons and we'd
[2:00:05] all have to take uh shifts
[2:00:08] and and we sit with him for a little
[2:00:10] bit, make sure he didn't hurt himself,
[2:00:12] you know, we sit with him. And one
[2:00:14] brother walked in there, preacher walked
[2:00:16] in there to the meet and to the to the
[2:00:18] office like he gonna take his shift and
[2:00:20] and work with this brother. That devil
[2:00:22] rose up and looked at him and said, "You
[2:00:24] watch too much TV. You can't cast no
[2:00:26] demon out."
[2:00:28] Embarrassed him.
[2:00:36] Let me finish reading this.
[2:00:40] And see, now you're afraid that the
[2:00:42] devil gonna embarrass you. You ain't
[2:00:43] going to go into
[2:00:50] I I can I can I can just I can just see
[2:00:52] God like
[2:00:55] all this word that I done gave y'all.
[2:00:57] Y'all still don't know who y'all are in
[2:00:58] Christ.
[2:00:59] Y'all y'all running from devils now.
[2:01:01] No, just stop watching TV.
[2:01:06] Amen.
[2:01:07] Amen. Let's let's let's go on.
[2:01:12] Um Paul on his way to Damascus vision
[2:01:15] directed him but Ananas had the germ had
[2:01:18] the word. Amen. That prophet Ananas saw
[2:01:20] a vision said go up there lay your hands
[2:01:23] on him said brother Saul the Lord
[2:01:24] appeared to you on the road coming down
[2:01:26] here. Uh how did he know? He had the
[2:01:29] word the the word of the Lord came to
[2:01:31] the prophet prophesied went up there and
[2:01:34] said he he come up he sent me up here
[2:01:36] that I might lay hands upon you and you
[2:01:39] you'd heal and receive the Holy Ghost
[2:01:41] and receive your sight and uh and the
[2:01:44] scales fell off his eyes and he rose and
[2:01:46] was baptized in the name of Jesus and
[2:01:48] went to study an angel directed it.
[2:01:51] That's right. But Paul had the seederm
[2:01:54] actually ananas right? It takes the
[2:01:56] spirit of God, the seed to give life
[2:01:59] eternal my.
[2:02:02] So you call yourself a predestinated
[2:02:04] seed, you got a germ of life in you and
[2:02:06] you got to be able to give that to
[2:02:09] somebody else.
[2:02:14] Lord, I love this. All right, this is my
[2:02:17] last quote that I want to read. This
[2:02:18] quote is uh coming out of the
[2:02:21] restoration of bride tree and uh when
[2:02:23] the Lord just kind of put this on our
[2:02:25] heart to have these meetings and I knew
[2:02:27] that we were under the inspiration of
[2:02:28] our restore said the Lord get back in
[2:02:30] step is what we uh start out last year
[2:02:32] with and then this year we had an
[2:02:35] overflow of that same theme uh which put
[2:02:38] us in the year of overflow. Hallelujah.
[2:02:40] And uh but this is the quote that I put
[2:02:43] on the flyer for everybody. And uh just
[2:02:46] trusting that the Lord will just anoint
[2:02:48] the ministers to come, amen, with
[2:02:50] sermons that would just bring about this
[2:02:53] restoration. Amen. Here out of the
[2:02:55] restoration of the ro tree, brother
[2:02:56] Brandham says this. Notice
[2:02:59] the same insect, that little rascal, the
[2:03:03] same insect that started and killed the
[2:03:06] tree in the beginning started right back
[2:03:09] at them Lutheran br Lutheran branches,
[2:03:11] but what? It can't kill it. I like that
[2:03:14] statement. Even though it tried to, it
[2:03:17] can't kill it. And we got some loved
[2:03:19] ones that that went through all these
[2:03:21] stages of these these uh these these
[2:03:23] these rascals, little rascals. But I'mma
[2:03:26] tell you this. According to this
[2:03:28] prophecy, they cannot be killed.
[2:03:32] They can't be wiped out.
[2:03:33] Amen.
[2:03:34] The devil can't take them out.
[2:03:36] The devil might delay some things, but
[2:03:38] he can't take them out.
[2:03:40] And I done seen the devil try to do it.
[2:03:42] But I also watch God heal those
[2:03:45] even in their condition. God brought
[2:03:47] healing to their body. I'm talking about
[2:03:48] supernatural healing,
[2:03:51] major surgeries that many people don't
[2:03:54] walk away from. But not only walk away,
[2:03:56] I'm driving again.
[2:04:00] All right.
[2:04:00] I'm flying again. I'm doing all kind of
[2:04:02] things. And and and the people that
[2:04:04] gather around to pray
[2:04:05] was the people that had the seed in
[2:04:07] them.
[2:04:09] That's right.
[2:04:11] Amen.
[2:04:11] Amen.
[2:04:12] Amen.
[2:04:12] And you don't realize when you're
[2:04:14] praying, it brings life. You carry it as
[2:04:17] a predestined seed. You carry the germ
[2:04:20] of life in you
[2:04:23] and it brings life to others. The devil
[2:04:25] couldn't kill him. I'm so glad.
[2:04:28] Amen.
[2:04:28] Look at this. Look at this. He says, "It
[2:04:32] can't kill it." Can't kill it because
[2:04:34] God has done said,
[2:04:37] "I
[2:04:39] oh my my my my my I will restore." That
[2:04:44] insect started on Luther to kill all the
[2:04:46] Lutheran branches. It come right over to
[2:04:48] Wesley and killed all the Wesley
[2:04:50] branches. But the main part of the tree
[2:04:53] keeps coming. Now notice in the old time
[2:04:56] when the tree was killed, it was killed.
[2:04:59] That's in old time. Went plum to the
[2:05:01] roots when it killed it back there. But
[2:05:04] this time,
[2:05:07] because the word, oh Lord,
[2:05:11] but this time, because the word is
[2:05:12] predestinated,
[2:05:14] there is nothing going to stop it.
[2:05:20] I say amen.
[2:05:22] Amen.
[2:05:23] Because the word is predestinated.
[2:05:25] What's what's the predestinated word?
[2:05:26] What is the predestinated word? If you
[2:05:28] don't know, I'mma tell you. The
[2:05:30] predestinated word is I
[2:05:34] will restore.
[2:05:36] Saith
[2:05:38] the Lord.
[2:05:42] Ain't you glad that you ain't got to do
[2:05:43] the restoration?
[2:05:46] You ain't got to do it. You just got to
[2:05:48] create an environment for the
[2:05:49] restoration to happen. Amen. But once
[2:05:52] you create a environment, God do the
[2:05:54] rest of it. I will restore
[2:05:58] saith
[2:05:59] the Lord.
[2:06:01] Invite them to come to church.
[2:06:04] Some of us already hearing people that's
[2:06:05] already said, "We heard about y'all
[2:06:07] meetings and we coming." I mean
[2:06:08] backsliders
[2:06:10] saying that they coming already. They
[2:06:11] they Now, now let me tell you something.
[2:06:15] The devil heard them say that they
[2:06:16] coming.
[2:06:17] That's right.
[2:06:18] The devil already heard that. And what
[2:06:20] you think the devil's going to do?
[2:06:24] All kind of stuff the devil going to
[2:06:26] throw in the way this going to happen.
[2:06:29] That's going to happen. And and if they
[2:06:30] tell you I can't come because this say,
[2:06:32] "Wait a minute. We going to pray right
[2:06:33] now.
[2:06:34] Right now.
[2:06:35] This thing got to change." We know God
[2:06:37] look look when when the angel troubling
[2:06:39] the water, you got to get in then. You
[2:06:41] can't come next week. You got to get in
[2:06:42] when the angels trouble in the water.
[2:06:44] Right. So, so, so we know God I mean
[2:06:46] that it's something about a meeting
[2:06:48] atmosphere and environment that the
[2:06:50] believers get together and there's been
[2:06:52] people waiting on meetings like this for
[2:06:53] a long time.
[2:06:55] They love coming to West Palm Beach.
[2:06:57] Saints from all over just we love
[2:06:59] coming. Brother Wesco used to have them
[2:07:01] meetings. We just love coming to the
[2:07:02] meeting. We had a wonderful time.
[2:07:05] Amen.
[2:07:06] The Lord has called Brother Wesco home.
[2:07:09] His birthday was Friday. would have been
[2:07:11] Friday,
[2:07:12] but God's calling home. But you know
[2:07:13] what? He has he he deposited enough in
[2:07:16] the rest of us
[2:07:18] that we know how to do this.
[2:07:21] Exactly.
[2:07:21] Now, let's do what we know how to do.
[2:07:24] [Applause]
[2:07:31] This time, because the word is
[2:07:33] predestinated, there is nothing could
[2:07:36] stop it. God said, "I'll restore no
[2:07:38] matter how much they organize, how much
[2:07:41] they do this, that, or the other. I'm
[2:07:43] going to restore it." That settles it at
[2:07:46] the at the laughing, making fun,
[2:07:49] scoffing, calling holy rollers,
[2:07:52] nonsense. Can you believe that?
[2:07:58] People done said some real bad things
[2:07:59] about this message. But brother Brandham
[2:08:01] say I don't I don't care what they said
[2:08:04] because God had a predestinated word
[2:08:07] and his word goes above it trumps
[2:08:09] everything that they said that his word
[2:08:11] say I will restore all of that you know
[2:08:13] and I'm going to tell you like this it
[2:08:14] just make the testimony that much
[2:08:16] greater
[2:08:19] holy rollers nonsense everything you
[2:08:21] want to God said I'll restore sayith the
[2:08:24] Lord just as sure as he raised Jesus out
[2:08:26] of the grave under three days under
[2:08:29] three dispensations
[2:08:30] uh uh or or three sections. He is going
[2:08:33] he is going he is going he is going to
[2:08:38] raise the church to its fullness and
[2:08:42] power again. I will restore
[2:08:47] saith
[2:08:48] the Lord.
[2:08:51] What a promise from God.
[2:08:53] We come underneath this inspiration.
[2:08:56] We do our part. Just let God use us in
[2:08:58] what way whatever way he desire. Uh be
[2:09:01] be prayerful. Uh be connected to the
[2:09:04] spirit. Don't do things out of order.
[2:09:08] You know the spirit lead a sister to
[2:09:10] pray with a sister. Yeah. Pray with that
[2:09:11] sister and be looking for opportunities
[2:09:12] where you can be there to pray. Amen.
[2:09:15] Yeah, there's food on the outside, but
[2:09:16] make sure we take care of what's on the
[2:09:18] inside first before we get to the food.
[2:09:20] That's right.
[2:09:21] Just be ready, church. You might see
[2:09:23] somebody there and you just you feel led
[2:09:25] to go up and just chat with them a
[2:09:26] little bit. talk with him. I mean, I
[2:09:28] recently ran into a sister and she was
[2:09:29] she was telling she said, "You know, I
[2:09:31] be watching the services online and
[2:09:33] I'mma come and I'mma see y'all." I said,
[2:09:35] "You know, you know, that's like being
[2:09:36] at home." She said, "You sound like
[2:09:38] Brother Wesco.
[2:09:40] He was my He was my spiritual father.
[2:09:42] You know, what can I say?" It rubbed off
[2:09:44] on me, right? But uh but but but I I I
[2:09:47] said, "You know, it's just like home.
[2:09:48] So, anytime you can you can come to that
[2:09:50] church anytime. We ain't going to look
[2:09:51] at you funny because you ain't been here
[2:09:52] in whatever amount of time. I don't even
[2:09:54] know how long you ain't been here. it
[2:09:55] don't matter. And she was saying, "I
[2:09:57] just ain't been to church in a long
[2:09:58] time, and I I just want to I just want I
[2:10:00] said, "Come on. Come to church, you
[2:10:02] know, just come. We don't have we ain't
[2:10:04] got no problem. It's home for you."
[2:10:07] And I really feel that way.
[2:10:09] Amen.
[2:10:10] Oh, God. I I I I I I know that um if we
[2:10:14] just get people into the right
[2:10:16] atmosphere, no matter how far Satan has
[2:10:19] taken them and whatever the devil's
[2:10:20] done, it don't matter.
[2:10:22] This time,
[2:10:23] I believe
[2:10:24] this time. Yes, Lord.
[2:10:26] He promised as a predestinated word that
[2:10:28] I'll restore.
[2:10:29] See, back back in the day,
[2:10:32] we used to have some restoration
[2:10:33] services. And I've seen people that
[2:10:35] would come in and go out and come in and
[2:10:37] go out and But you always pulling for
[2:10:39] them. And I remember every time we would
[2:10:42] have a restoration service, Brother
[2:10:43] Wesco, make us sing that song.
[2:10:50] Restoration has finally come. I've been
[2:10:52] restored back to my place in God. Right.
[2:10:54] And and man, we used to sing that song.
[2:10:56] We wore it out.
[2:10:58] But uh you know, I tell you what, I I'm
[2:11:00] just looking for God to do something
[2:11:02] special. And and I know if we have the
[2:11:05] right environment, we have the right
[2:11:07] heart,
[2:11:08] God can do what he want to do.
[2:11:10] That's it.
[2:11:11] And let me tell you something. If God
[2:11:13] ever gave you a a opportunity to
[2:11:16] experience hell like he gave brother
[2:11:19] Brandon, he gave him the opportunity to
[2:11:20] experience hell and he gave him
[2:11:21] opportunity to experience heaven. when
[2:11:24] they experienced hell, he said, "I
[2:11:26] wouldn't even want my worst enemy
[2:11:28] to come to a place like this."
[2:11:32] He said, "I wouldn't want my worst enemy
[2:11:34] to come to a place like this." That's
[2:11:35] that's that's how serious it is. We the
[2:11:37] rapture is upon us. The the the the the
[2:11:41] uh we're we preached a sermon a few
[2:11:42] weeks ago, modern events made clear by
[2:11:44] prophecy. We know where we're standing.
[2:11:45] This is that. And even brother Quinton
[2:11:48] picked it up picked up that quote uh on
[2:11:50] on Thursday night I mean Wednesday night
[2:11:52] and it was just showing how there's a
[2:11:54] gathering that also take place when we
[2:11:56] see the pope coming from the United
[2:11:58] States of America. There's also supposed
[2:12:01] to be a gathering that takes place for
[2:12:03] the bride.
[2:12:05] It's happening.
[2:12:06] It's right before our very eyes. And you
[2:12:09] got plans to be somewhere else during
[2:12:11] the meeting.
[2:12:13] Lord, I pray that God will take the
[2:12:16] scales off your eyes and help you see
[2:12:18] how late the hour is.
[2:12:20] We need to be ready. If the meeting
[2:12:22] ain't for nobody, it's for me.
[2:12:25] I need God. I need more of God than I
[2:12:27] ever needed before.
[2:12:29] I'm so glad. I ain't got to do the
[2:12:31] restoration. I just got to provide the
[2:12:32] environment for the restoration to
[2:12:34] happen. I will restore, saith the Lord.
[2:12:40] God bless you, church. God bless you.
[2:12:47] Let's have a word of prayer. Amen.
[2:12:50] Father,
[2:12:51] we are grateful
[2:12:54] uh for
[2:12:56] your promise. We thank you for your
[2:12:58] truth.
[2:13:00] We thank you God uh for this inspiration
[2:13:03] that you have given to the meetings.
[2:13:06] Lord, as we just get our hearts prepared
[2:13:11] and get our minds
[2:13:14] centered,
[2:13:16] Lord, around what you were planning to
[2:13:18] do, Lord, in our midst. May we be
[2:13:20] mindful of opportunities we have to
[2:13:22] invite others to the meetings,
[2:13:25] Lord, listening just as Philip was
[2:13:27] listening to that Ethiopian just reading
[2:13:30] the scriptures. He knew that, oh my,
[2:13:32] there's something here, Lord. Sometimes
[2:13:35] we can hear people talking, oh, wait a
[2:13:36] minute, there's something there. And
[2:13:38] Father, this a trigger would take place
[2:13:40] and we begin to Lord just try to get
[2:13:42] people into that atmosphere.
[2:13:46] Father, and I I just pray that God, you
[2:13:48] would help us to to to really get our
[2:13:51] focus in this in this season cuz Satan
[2:13:53] is so shrewd. Got all kind of little
[2:13:56] things that he's doing here and there.
[2:13:58] And Lord, it's uh it would cause us to
[2:14:01] lose our focus. But father, we want to
[2:14:03] we want to maintain focus in this hour.
[2:14:06] We trust Lord Jesus that you would help
[2:14:09] us.

[2:14:19] meetings and and Father, we just pray
[2:14:22] your blessings would come back upon the
[2:14:23] people that they would experience such
[2:14:24] an overflow spiritually, financially,
[2:14:29] physically, uh emotionally, mentally.
[2:14:32] Father, that you would move in a
[2:14:34] supernatural way, Father.
[2:14:37] We want to hear powerful testimonies
[2:14:38] coming forth, Lord, of of what you've
[2:14:41] done, Father, and what you're doing in
[2:14:43] our midst. We we can't wait to hear
[2:14:45] those testimonies. I pray your blessings
[2:14:47] upon each one, Father, the ministers
[2:14:50] that will be coming, oh God, to to bring
[2:14:52] the word of life uh to the people, God,
[2:14:55] bless them. and give them fresh
[2:14:56] inspiration,
[2:14:58] God, that they would be able to tap into
[2:15:01] uh Lord, just this the the the theme of
[2:15:03] the meeting, oh God, you know, uh what
[2:15:06] you'll have them say and God, may it may
[2:15:08] just be a uh an anointing there when the
[2:15:11] people when the ministers speak, Father,
[2:15:12] it be so powerful that they can't even
[2:15:14] stand the minister. Lord, let the Holy
[2:15:16] Ghost have its way. We're looking for
[2:15:19] restoration. We're looking for healing.
[2:15:22] We're looking for deliverance. We're

[2:21:25] example of a a sister that was prayed
[2:21:27] for during a meeting and he saw the
[2:21:29] sister later and he was even surprised
[2:21:32] that you have changed the sister's
[2:21:33] circumstance and you have made a
[2:21:35] daughter out of her Lord Jesus. Father
[2:21:38] Lord as humans we have so many needs but
[2:21:40] Lord the greatest of it is to be like
[2:21:42] Jesus Christ is to receive your word
[2:21:44] Lord even during the meetings father I

[2:22:26] Father, follow each and every predicated
[2:22:27] seed, enrich them and overtake them and
