[0:09] forever and there is nothing greater
[0:11] than you. Oh Lord God, be with us in
[0:13] this message, oh Lord God, and bless our
[0:15] time with you, oh Lord, in the precious
[0:16] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[0:20] Amen. Amen. So, the title of the
[0:23] message, we'll get right into it. Um,
[0:25] the Lord put on my heart, um, is the
[0:29] image of overflow and the struggle with
[0:32] the subtitle of you are your victory.
[0:36] Right? You are your own victory. And so,
[0:39] we're going to start our reading out of
[0:41] John
[0:43] uh John 14
[0:46] uh vers 12 through
[0:50] 20. can just say amen once you get
[0:52] there. And we'll
[0:54] start reading that to get the foundation
[0:56] of our
[0:58] message. And it reads, "Verily, verily,
[1:01] I say unto you, he that believeth on me,
[1:04] the works that I do, he do also." And
[1:07] here's here's a good part. And greater
[1:10] works. So the theme of the year is
[1:13] overflow. So God already saw in mind
[1:16] that there would there would ha there
[1:17] would come a time where there would need
[1:20] to have a overflow anointing fall on a
[1:22] peculiar people for them to do now the
[1:25] the prophet told us it's not to do
[1:26] magnifying works in him but just greater
[1:29] meaning more than what he did right so
[1:32] we should actually see more of God than
[1:34] what he was in flesh in the Lord Jesus
[1:37] Christ right so it says and greater
[1:39] works than these shall he do because I
[1:42] go unto my Father, and whatsoever ye
[1:45] shall ask in my name, that will I do,
[1:47] that the Father may be glorified in the
[1:49] Son. If ye shall ask anything in my
[1:52] name, I will do it. If you love me, keep
[1:55] my commandments, and I will pray the
[1:57] Father, and he shall give you you
[1:59] another comforter, that he may abide
[2:01] with you forever. Even the Spirit of
[2:03] truth, whom the world cannot receive,
[2:04] because it seeth him not, neither
[2:06] knoweth him, but ye know him. For he
[2:09] dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
[2:12] I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[2:14] come to you. Yet a little while in the
[2:16] world shall see me no more. But because
[2:18] you see me because I live, ye shall live
[2:21] also. And we like to see this verse
[2:24] right here. Verse 20. At that day ye
[2:26] shall know that I am in my father and ye
[2:30] in me and I in you. May the Lord add a
[2:34] blessing to his word as you take your
[2:39] seats. Alrighty. Um, so we're going to
[2:42] get directly into a quote uh that the
[2:45] prophet had uh spoke to just get a
[2:48] little bit of context for what we're
[2:50] going to speak on. It's uh it was in
[2:52] written in the it was spoken in the word
[2:54] the spoken word is the original seed
[2:57] 620381 paragraph uh
[2:59] 327 through 3
[3:02] um 330 wait 332 a little bit 332. All
[3:08] right, I'll just I'll just start reading
[3:09] it while they get that together.
[3:11] It reads, "That proves that God speaks
[3:13] his message through his servants. Always
[3:15] has." That's right. Now, the power of
[3:18] the believing church, that's you and I.
[3:20] Christ has all power in heaven and
[3:22] earth. So, you believe that? That's what
[3:24] the prophet says. Now, what if he's in
[3:26] you? Has Christ got all the power? The
[3:29] church there said, "Amen." He said,
[3:32] Matthew 28:18. All right. He is the seed
[3:35] word in his body and he in us becomes
[3:38] the seed word in us. what all that God
[3:41] was, he poured into Christ. All that
[3:43] Christ was poured into the the church.
[3:46] That's the power. Now watch God's God.
[3:50] Remember God's law of reproduction. Now
[3:52] remember after its kindness, right? The
[3:54] seed of Christ, the word must come
[3:56] through his body which is me and you,
[3:58] right? We have a role to play in this.
[4:01] God God has great expectation
[4:04] uh for our part on uh on earth. And and
[4:08] in fact, one of the revelations that the
[4:10] the prophet God revealed to the prophet
[4:12] in the book of Revelation was the
[4:14] revelation of Christ and also of Christ,
[4:17] the works that Christ would do, but also
[4:19] the works that his body would do too in
[4:22] this last day. Right? And in order for
[4:24] you to be able to do the works of
[4:26] Christ, you have to have the seed of God
[4:28] inside of you. There's an image that you
[4:30] have to have in order to be able to do
[4:32] those works. So he reads here, he says,
[4:33] "Are you getting tired?" All right, just
[4:35] a minute now. Let's just hold quiet and
[4:38] pray. I want to get this in real good. I
[4:40] want the I want this to grind down. The
[4:43] seed of Christ must mu s must come
[4:46] through his body. Not through a
[4:48] denomination, but through a bornag again
[4:50] seed of the word. It must come through.
[4:51] Now remember what it is. Christ seed.
[4:53] How does my how does my seed come?
[4:55] Through the body. How does the apple
[4:57] seed come? Through the body. And in uh
[5:00] paragraph 332 reads, seed is through the
[5:02] body and the church is the body of
[5:04] Christ. That's right. the Bible church.
[5:07] This birth produces that's the new birth
[5:09] himself and body his church and his word
[5:11] so that the people can see the
[5:12] confirmation of Hebrews 13:8 Jesus
[5:15] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[5:17] forever. So the greater works God
[5:20] expects to see those in his people of
[5:23] today. So this is a little continuation
[5:26] from the message that I preached last
[5:28] time. We talked about how um Christ had
[5:31] received his overflow after he had come
[5:33] on earth and he obeyed the will of the
[5:35] father and God took him through diff
[5:37] different trials of his life to show
[5:39] that he was fit to rule. Um and so now
[5:42] from reading this quote we know that
[5:44] that power that Christ has already been
[5:47] given is now in us just by receiving the
[5:50] baptism of the Holy Spirit. Right? That
[5:52] power is something that is uh it's it's
[5:54] a real power. It's a power for that.
[5:57] When you speak the word, you should see
[5:59] results come too. And if you don't see
[6:01] results coming through, then that means
[6:02] there's something there that's wrong,
[6:04] right? So before we get a little bit
[6:07] into uh this image, we want to see why
[6:10] this struggle comes into the play
[6:12] because the title is the image of
[6:13] overflow and the struggle because
[6:15] usually there's always a struggle that
[6:17] comes into play with the things of God.
[6:19] Even when Christ was born, right, uh his
[6:23] birth, his parents had to hide him. his
[6:25] parents had to uh uh take him all over
[6:28] the place because there was a struggle
[6:29] going on because of a work that was in
[6:32] this child. Right? And the enemy it
[6:35] looks at your life the same way. Right?
[6:38] Not just Jesus Christ. The enemy is
[6:39] looking at your life because God wants
[6:41] to do something through your life as
[6:42] well. Right? So, we're going to look at
[6:46] this struggle and how the struggle comes
[6:47] to play in Genesis uh chapter 3 um verse
[6:53] 15. And I'll go ahead and read it. And
[6:56] it reads, "And I will put enmity between
[6:59] thee and the woman, and between thy seed
[7:02] and her seed, and it shall bruise thy
[7:05] head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
[7:09] Right? Now, this is God speaking to the
[7:12] serpent, right? And it's interesting
[7:14] because it makes us realize once you
[7:17] kind of really put your spiritual
[7:18] thinking caps on there that um not only
[7:22] has God given us promises to stand on,
[7:25] but the enemy has promises from God that
[7:27] he can stand on as well. Right? So just
[7:30] as much as you standing on the word,
[7:33] he's standing on the word too for what
[7:34] he can do to you. Right? So we see now
[7:37] we got to struggle because we both got a
[7:39] word from God.
[7:40] But thanks be to God that our word has a
[7:44] greater ending. Amen. God put
[7:47] stipulations in us that we have to win.
[7:51] Right? He put a difference there. So no
[7:53] matter the struggle which is going to be
[7:54] there, you have to come out on top just
[7:57] because God said so. Right? So he's
[8:01] given the enemy promises to stand on. Uh
[8:04] and the enemy I mean he believes the
[8:06] word fully. He doesn't doubt the word at
[8:09] He doesn't doubt not one one dot of the
[8:12] word that God has given him to bruise
[8:14] each and every single one of our heels.
[8:16] He believes it fully. So that means we
[8:18] have to believe the word fully too in
[8:20] order to combat against him as well. Um,
[8:23] and you know, sometimes we get into um,
[8:26] the prophet described it as sometimes
[8:28] you get the blues or you get down and
[8:30] stuff like that and you know, you begin
[8:32] to complain about having chronic back
[8:34] pain and you begin to start complaining
[8:36] about uh, getting colds and you're
[8:38] struggling about this life struggles all
[8:40] over and woe is me and stuff like that.
[8:43] But we have to remember uh, as believers
[8:46] uh, that we shouldn't worship our
[8:48] circumstances, right? We should not
[8:51] worship the circumstances and the
[8:53] troubles that come in our life. No
[8:54] matter how great they are, they're just
[8:57] obeying God's word. They're just obeying
[9:00] the word of the Lord. So, you can't
[9:03] really get upset with them. That's why
[9:04] uh the Bible says, "Do not be overcome
[9:06] by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[9:09] Right? So, you have to overcome what the
[9:11] enemy is doing with you by believing the
[9:13] word. You can't get upset with him.
[9:15] Yeah. You just have to believe that,
[9:17] hey, God's allowed you to do this thing,
[9:19] but I still have a word that shows I'm
[9:22] going to be on top at the end of this
[9:23] thing.
[9:25] Amen. Right. The Bible says that
[9:29] everything obeys the voice of God. That
[9:30] includes Satan and his angels. They all
[9:32] obey obey the voice of God. So, we're
[9:35] going to go back and see a scenario
[9:37] where um Jesus was before Pilate, and
[9:40] it's actually John 199
[9:43] through3. And we're going to re we're
[9:45] going to see how Jesus um how Jesus
[9:48] dealt with a situation where he was
[9:51] going through a time where they this is
[9:52] a time where they had captured him and
[9:54] they were trying to crucify him. Um and
[9:57] it reads and went and verse 9 reads and
[9:59] went again into the judgment hall and
[10:02] saith unto Jesus whence art thou? But
[10:05] Jesus gave him no answer. And I like I
[10:08] love I love the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:10] because in the word when you read the
[10:13] word a lot of times people like to look
[10:15] at what Jesus was doing but you need we
[10:18] have to put ourselves in his shoes in
[10:20] our situations. So when the enemy comes
[10:23] to you with questions you don't have to
[10:26] respond to everything he says. Right?
[10:28] When he prevents you, when he when he
[10:30] presents you with fear, when he presents
[10:32] you with a a doctor's report or he
[10:34] presents you with some kind of doubt,
[10:36] you don't have to respond to him, you
[10:38] don't have to debate with him. The
[10:40] beautiful thing about the word is the
[10:42] word doesn't need to be debated in order
[10:44] to come to pass. In the beginning, God
[10:47] spoke the word, believe it, and it was
[10:49] so, right? So, there's no other way that
[10:51] you can do it. You can argue with the
[10:52] devil all day, all day, all day. But at
[10:55] some point there's some questions you
[10:57] just don't answer him. So Jesus just
[11:00] didn't give any response back. And and I
[11:03] like that because it shows that silence
[11:05] is a weapon.
[11:08] Silence is a weapon.
[11:11] Amen.
[11:13] So in verse 10 we see then saith Pilate
[11:17] unto him speakest thou not unto me. So
[11:19] he's getting a little bit upset. So that
[11:21] makes the enemy upset when you don't say
[11:23] nothing to him, right? When you don't
[11:24] respond, that makes him upset. That's
[11:26] right. Right? Cuz it shows you don't
[11:28] believe in what he's saying. So he said,
[11:31] "Knowest thou not that I have power to
[11:33] crucify to crucify thee and have power
[11:36] to release to release thee." So now he's
[11:40] trying to inject fear into Jesus, right?
[11:44] But the the beautiful thing about this
[11:45] thing is that Jesus knew that the reason
[11:49] why he was going through what he was
[11:50] going through was because God had
[11:52] ordained it. So there was nothing that
[11:54] Pilate could say to him that could shake
[11:56] him. Now Jesus was a man and Pilate in
[11:59] this instance we know was the Roman uh
[12:02] empire that was the most powerful empire
[12:04] of the day. So when he says something,
[12:06] it had a weight behind it. And the thing
[12:08] I love about Jesus is that he struggled
[12:10] just like we struggle. So sometimes when
[12:12] we hear the doctor's report, we feel the
[12:15] pressure of what's been said, right? or
[12:16] when we hear some kind of uh bad report
[12:19] or some doubt against some promise that
[12:20] we have, we feel the pressure and power
[12:23] behind that thing. But this is what I
[12:26] like how Jesus responded to this in
[12:27] verse 11. It says, "Jesus answered, thou
[12:31] couldest have no power at all against me
[12:35] except it were given thee from above."
[12:39] Right? So he just turned the tables
[12:42] right back on the enemy saying, "Hold on
[12:44] a second, buddy. I don't care how
[12:46] powerful you think you are. That was the
[12:48] great he had Pilate had the greatest
[12:50] army backing him on earth. And Jesus
[12:52] said, I don't care how powerful you are.
[12:54] I don't care how big you are. I don't
[12:56] care how strong you are. Your power, you
[12:59] wouldn't have this power over me unless
[13:01] God said you could do it first.
[13:04] So Jesus knew how to worship God instead
[13:07] of his circumstances in the in the uh in
[13:10] the midst of a a great trial and a great
[13:13] power before him. Right? So, we don't
[13:15] want to worship our circumstances,
[13:17] right? We want to worship God and
[13:19] remember that God is the one that's in
[13:21] control. Right? So, we know that God has
[13:24] given us an overflow in this day. And
[13:26] we've been preaching about it. We've
[13:28] been talking about it. We've been
[13:29] believing it and living it. But do you
[13:31] realize that God has also given the
[13:34] enemy an overflow in this day in this
[13:36] day and age as well? Right. So, and this
[13:39] is overflow is is is not a good
[13:41] overflow. an overflow for uh for doing
[13:44] bad things, right? And we realize that
[13:46] the day and age that we live in today is
[13:48] there's never been a day like today
[13:51] where there's been so much sin in the
[13:53] world. True. The state of the world that
[13:55] we in today, I mean, you've never seen
[13:58] the way people live today. People have
[14:00] never lived like this before. So, I'm in
[14:03] college and we I'm in the I'm in this
[14:06] world history class and there was a
[14:07] picture that I saw back in the 1900s,
[14:10] early 1900s where you would see like
[14:12] police officers or people would go to
[14:14] these girls that were on the beach and
[14:16] they would measure their bathing suits
[14:19] to see if they were in compliance with
[14:22] modesty. Right? And if you take that
[14:24] picture and compare it to what's been
[14:26] worn today, it's completely different.
[14:30] It's what is being accepted in the world
[14:32] today is completely different. Sin is
[14:34] just running a muk uh now in our day.
[14:38] The so the devil indeed has been given
[14:41] power to do whatever he wants to do,
[14:43] right? And the thing about it is it's
[14:45] only going to get worse.
[14:48] It's only going to get worse from what
[14:49] we've seen uh right here. And that's not
[14:52] to discourage us, right? Because we're
[14:54] believers, right? We believe God is in
[14:57] control, right? It just means that it we
[15:00] have to receive an overflow in this day.
[15:04] God has to give us an overflow in this
[15:06] day in order to uh to combat that. It's
[15:08] not a if. It's not a maybe. It's not a
[15:10] you know, well, you know, if the Lord
[15:13] wills to give me an overflow, then you
[15:14] know, it'll be up to him. No, God has to
[15:17] give us an overflow in this day in order
[15:19] for us to not only survive, but to
[15:22] thrive, right? to show that there's a
[15:25] difference between his people and
[15:27] Satan's people. Right? So God has to
[15:30] show us, God has to give us something
[15:32] that can be seen and say, "Hold on.
[15:34] These people are way different than
[15:35] these ones." Right? In the beginning,
[15:37] God said he separated the night from the
[15:39] day. And he's going right back to that
[15:42] scripture. Right? So if the enemy is
[15:44] running a muck and getting richer and
[15:46] all that kind of stuff and with the
[15:48] wrong spirit, that means we got to be
[15:50] getting better with the right spirit.
[15:52] All right. Amen. Right.
[15:56] So, one of the things that we need and
[15:58] that we're praying for is we need a
[16:00] church in a school. Yes, sir. That's one
[16:02] of the things we need. We need a we we
[16:04] need a school. And you know, ever since
[16:06] they've taken prayer out of the school,
[16:09] the devil has been has gotten so
[16:11] comfortable.
[16:13] There used to be there used to be a a
[16:16] term um growing up when I was in high
[16:19] school, they called it hiding in the
[16:20] closet. And that was when all the homo
[16:22] homosexuals and stuff, they were afraid
[16:25] to say what they were.
[16:27] They were they were afraid to come to
[16:29] school and tell them and and say what
[16:31] they were and what their beliefs and and
[16:32] and and their lifestyles because that
[16:35] stuff wasn't accepted. Right? Now you
[16:37] take the prayers out of the school and
[16:40] everyone is a
[16:41] homosexual. Right? It used to be a time
[16:44] where um and I know this is a sensitive
[16:46] topic, but uh mass shootings. I remember
[16:49] I was the first mass shooting that I
[16:51] heard about I was in high school. Well,
[16:54] I experienced in my lifetime. I was in
[16:56] high school and it was at Virginia Tech.
[16:58] It was a mass shooting that happened at
[16:59] Virginia Tech and it was such a uh it it
[17:03] had such an impact on our school that it
[17:05] was just like, you know, everybody was
[17:07] just kind of downing about it. Nowadays,
[17:09] there's a mass shooting every single
[17:11] week, right? So, it's just gotten worse
[17:14] and worse and worse. Um, it used to be
[17:16] in school that if you had your kids
[17:19] would act up, the teachers had paddles.
[17:22] Yeah. They'll bring you to the front of
[17:24] the class and paddle you right in front
[17:26] of everybody. Right. And and then you
[17:29] went home and you got paddled again. But
[17:32] that ensured that when you came back to
[17:33] school, you wasn't acting up no more.
[17:36] You ain't want to get you didn't want to
[17:38] get embarrassed no more. But nowadays if
[17:40] a teacher corrects your kid now the
[17:43] parents coming to the school yelling at
[17:45] the teacher.
[17:47] So we see how God the enemy has just
[17:50] gotten very very comfortable right
[17:53] because now it's becoming common place.
[17:55] Now when you say mass shooting it
[17:57] doesn't hold as much weight as it did
[17:59] back then. Now you have people that are
[18:02] when they say homosexual nowadays it's
[18:04] just it's the norm for everyone. and
[18:07] he's gotten way too comfortable. So
[18:09] that's why we need a school cuz we want
[18:12] to show people that there are children
[18:14] in this generation that won't stand for
[18:17] those kinds of things.
[18:19] Amen. Amen.
[18:22] God has to raise up people to show that
[18:25] in the midst of what's going on and the
[18:28] overflow of the enemy has has uh brought
[18:30] on the nation, there are still people
[18:32] that are worshiping the Lord and living
[18:34] for the Lord and believe the fullness of
[18:37] the Lord. Right? So, we need an overflow
[18:40] to combat the overflow that's happening
[18:42] in the world. Right? It is our promise.
[18:45] This is something that we're not hoping
[18:46] for. It's something that we need and we
[18:49] need today. Um, another thing a lot of
[18:51] you a lot of you have your own
[18:53] businesses and one of the things about
[18:55] businesses especially when you're you're
[18:57] a self entrepreneur is you have the s
[19:00] market saturation that means everybody's
[19:02] hopping into the market right cuz
[19:04] everybody wants that dollar everybody
[19:07] wants some money every and uh the but
[19:09] the difference between you and the
[19:12] people that want to get into the uh the
[19:13] market they're doing it because of
[19:15] greed.
[19:17] They just want to get rich and rich and
[19:18] rich, right? They're not paying their
[19:20] tithes. They're not paying their
[19:22] offering. They don't go to church. They
[19:25] don't worship the Lord. They don't serve
[19:26] the Lord. But you serve the Lord, right?
[19:30] You pay your tithe. You pay your
[19:32] offering, right? And so God has to lift
[19:35] your business higher in order to show
[19:38] that there is a standard out there. He
[19:41] can't let the world and greed overshadow
[19:43] the light. Right? Jesus Christ said the
[19:46] light will shine if uh let your light
[19:49] shine. Right? So it's not even up to uh
[19:52] it's up to us to let it shine. But God
[19:54] has to bring an environment for us to
[19:57] shine the light, right? So the world
[19:59] can't overshadow us, right? So your
[20:03] business has to succeed. And the one of
[20:06] the problems that we see um for why
[20:09] we're dealing with a lot of this stuff
[20:10] that's kind of going on is uh it
[20:13] originates from Lucifer, right? And
[20:16] we're going to get more into that a
[20:17] little bit later. But one of the things
[20:19] that Lucifer had on his mind is he
[20:21] wanted a better kingdom than Michael. He
[20:24] saw that Michael was thriving and
[20:27] flourishing. He said, "Nah, nah, nah. I
[20:29] want some of this, too. Not only do I
[20:31] want it, I want it better than what he
[20:33] has." Right? So when you have a desire
[20:36] for a business, all of a sudden the
[20:38] enemy wants a business too.
[20:42] Right? And not only that, not only does
[20:44] he want a business, he wants his
[20:46] business to be better than your business
[20:48] and bigger than your business. Right?
[20:50] When you want a new church, all of a
[20:51] sudden the enemy wants a new church. And
[20:53] he wants a church bigger than your
[20:55] church, better than your church. And he
[20:57] wants to take the people out of your
[20:58] church and put them into his church.
[21:00] Yeah. When you have a desire to have a
[21:02] home, a godly home with children and
[21:04] stuff, all of a sudden the enemy wants a
[21:06] home. And now he wants your kids to be
[21:08] in his home, right? So every single time
[21:11] you have a desire, the enemy wants to
[21:13] come back combat you against that desire
[21:15] for something bigger and better. Right?
[21:18] No wonder Paul has said in the Bible, he
[21:20] said, "Every time I try to do right,
[21:22] evil is present." So it's a struggle.
[21:25] Every time you're trying to do the right
[21:26] thing, God puts a desire on your heart
[21:28] to start a business. All of a sudden, 10
[21:30] other businesses hop up in the same
[21:31] place. And now you're struggling to
[21:33] fight, right? Because the enemy is
[21:34] trying to take your customers to make a
[21:36] bigger, better, more money-making
[21:38] business than you, right? Your desires
[21:41] based off what the God put on your
[21:43] heart. His desire is based off of greed.
[21:45] So now you got this struggle and this
[21:47] powerpool. But God has to let your
[21:50] business succeed.
[21:52] If God gave you the word, the word can't
[21:54] fail. No matter the circumstance, no
[21:58] matter the market situations, your word
[22:01] has to win.
[22:04] Your word has to win.
[22:07] So, um, the Bible also said that when
[22:10] the enemy comes in like a flood that God
[22:12] would raise a standard and the prophet
[22:15] told us that the standard is the word,
[22:18] but you've become the word. So, you have
[22:20] to be the standard. So, you if you have
[22:23] a business, right? Let's say um because
[22:26] um uh some like uh sole entrepreneurs
[22:29] like a real estate, right? You let's say
[22:31] you have your own real estate business
[22:32] and you want to help people get homes
[22:34] and you want to make some money too cuz
[22:36] God wants to bless you. But then you got
[22:38] people in the real estate market. They
[22:39] don't care nothing about the people.
[22:41] They want to flip the house just like
[22:43] that. Whether the house is ready whether
[22:45] they're 100% good or not. They just
[22:46] trying to get a dollar. So now all of a
[22:48] sudden you got this market saturated
[22:50] with people just greedy for money. But
[22:52] God gave you a desire to sell houses. So
[22:55] God has to make sure that you get
[22:57] business. God makes it sure that you
[22:59] shine above every sing everybody else
[23:02] because God gave you the word. So no
[23:04] matter the market situation, the word
[23:06] has to find a way to you in order for it
[23:08] to grow.
[23:10] That's the God we serve. Cuz God said
[23:12] when the enemy comes in like a flood,
[23:13] he'll raise up a standard. And when you
[23:15] become the word, just as we said, Jesus
[23:18] was the seed word. And the seed word
[23:19] needs a body and it comes inside of you.
[23:22] You become the word. So all of a sudden
[23:24] everything you do has to be blessed.
[23:28] Right? So we want to uh get back to this
[23:31] struggle uh and this uh image that we've
[23:34] um that we have cuz uh one of the
[23:37] reasons for the enemy's overflow in this
[23:39] day and age is he wants to prevent you
[23:42] from recognizing
[23:44] uh the image that God wants you to
[23:47] achieve. That's one of his purposes. He
[23:49] wants to prevent you from the revelation
[23:51] of what this image means to you
[23:54] personally, right? A personal
[23:56] experience, not what you can, not what
[23:58] you can emulate from other Christians,
[24:00] but what God is doing in your life
[24:02] individually, right?
[24:04] So, your spiritual and physical overflow
[24:06] was always trying to be blocked by the
[24:08] enemy because he knows you're going to
[24:11] win. He believes the word, too. And he
[24:13] knows that you have to win. So the only
[24:15] thing he can do is just try to block
[24:17] that which God has given him the
[24:19] strength to do that. So how many knows
[24:21] that Job was predestinated for an
[24:23] overflow?
[24:25] How many know Job was predestinated for
[24:27] an overflow? All right. So let's go read
[24:30] Job the first chapter. Uh we're going to
[24:33] read first chapter verses
[24:36] 6-2. Just kind of kind of see how this
[24:39] thing kind of pans out.
[24:41] And I'm hoping that you're finding
[24:43] yourself in the scriptures as we're as
[24:44] we're kind of going through
[24:46] this. So it reads, "Now there was a day
[24:49] when the sons of God came to present
[24:51] themselves before the Lord, and Satan
[24:53] came along with along uh came also among
[24:56] them. And the Lord said unto Satan,
[24:58] whence thou whence comest thou?" Then
[25:00] Satan answered the Lord and said, "From
[25:02] going to and fro in the earth, and from
[25:04] walking up and down in it?" And the Lord
[25:06] said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered
[25:08] my servant Job, that there is none like
[25:11] him in the earth, a perfect and upright
[25:13] man, one that fearth God and is shoe of
[25:15] evil?"
[25:16] So the enemy wasn't even looking to pick
[25:20] to pick a fight with Job. God was the
[25:23] one that initiated this bet. So you have
[25:26] to look at your circumstances as you
[25:28] know what, this ain't even you.
[25:31] Sometimes God's just like, you know
[25:33] what, I'll let you go and just give him
[25:35] some licks. I'll let you go. I'll let
[25:36] you go. I I'll anoint you to go give
[25:38] them some back pain. I'll go I'll go and
[25:40] anoint you to take out their bank
[25:41] account. Right? I just want to I just I
[25:43] I Satan I'll let you go do all those
[25:45] kind of things. And we're up here just
[25:46] arguing with the devil and you ain't
[25:48] this, you ain't that, but you got to
[25:50] turn your focus right onto the one who
[25:53] created you. Um and Job, even when Job
[25:55] was going through, he said, "Though the
[25:57] Lord, though he slay me, yet I trust
[26:00] him." He wasn't arguing with the He
[26:02] wasn't arguing with the devil. He wasn't
[26:03] arguing with the circumstance. He put it
[26:05] right back on. You know what? God's the
[26:07] one in control having not been in that
[26:09] meeting. And God wants to give you that
[26:11] same revelation.
[26:13] In verse 9, it says, "And Satan answered
[26:15] the Lord and said, Doth Job fear God for
[26:18] not?" Verse 10 says, "Hast not thou made
[26:22] a hedge about him and about his house,
[26:24] and about all that he have on every
[26:26] side? Thou hast blessed the work of his
[26:28] hands, and his substance is increased in
[26:30] the land." And and and you got to know
[26:33] that Satan believes and testifies of
[26:36] your
[26:37] overflow. He believes it. He's
[26:40] testifying of it before God. He knows
[26:43] you're blessed. He knows you're
[26:45] increased. He knows that you're ble
[26:47] you're you're you're highly favored. He
[26:49] knows that overflow is on your way. So
[26:51] if Satan can believe it, you got to
[26:53] believe it, too. For you not to believe
[26:56] that thing, that would look kind of
[26:57] crazy, right?
[27:00] that that that that will look that would
[27:02] look kind of that would look kind of
[27:03] funky, right? So um and then the other
[27:07] thing is
[27:10] um one the Bible verse it says here uh
[27:14] the Satan that testified he said has not
[27:16] not has not not thou made a hedge about
[27:19] him and about his house and about all
[27:22] that he have on every side. So the hedge
[27:26] wasn't just on Job,
[27:29] right? Wasn't just surrounding Job. It
[27:32] was surrounding his wife. It was
[27:34] surrounding his kids. It was surrounding
[27:37] his businesses. It was surrounding
[27:39] everything that he had to the devil was
[27:42] walking around the earth. He said,
[27:43] "Every time I pass this spot, I can't do
[27:45] nothing to nobody inside of there."
[27:48] Right? And this is just to to uh to
[27:51] reiterate what brother Jack had preached
[27:53] about how you know if you're if you're a
[27:57] youth and you're a kid and you're living
[27:59] with parents that have been baptized
[28:01] with the Holy Spirit, Satan can't do
[28:04] nothing with you
[28:07] while you're in that household. Satan
[28:09] can do nothing with you. He cannot touch
[28:11] you. Right? So here we see that the
[28:14] enemy knew he had no right to Job's
[28:18] loved ones. When he when he saw that
[28:20] hedge about him, he knew that he didn't
[28:22] have a right to uh the ones that Job uh
[28:25] uh loved. And this is a uh and this is a
[28:28] recommendation that I would have. It's
[28:29] not doctrine or anything like that. But
[28:31] if you're young, right, this is just
[28:32] something that I would recommend and you
[28:34] don't have the baptism of the Holy
[28:36] Spirit. I would stay with your parents.
[28:38] If you have bibleelving parents, right,
[28:41] stay with your parents until you receive
[28:43] the Holy Ghost. Because if you leave
[28:46] under their hedge of protection, you're
[28:48] going to be in a lot of trouble because
[28:50] you have nothing covering you anymore.
[28:53] All right? Cuz a lot of times the
[28:54] attitude of the world is when I get 18,
[28:57] I'm out of here. Right? It's the wrong
[29:00] attitude if you ain't got no power out
[29:01] there. If you don't know how to arm
[29:04] wrestle with the devil, you're going to
[29:05] be in a lot of trouble. Yeah. If you
[29:08] ain't got no strength, if you don't know
[29:10] how to pray, if you don't know how to
[29:11] read your Bible, if you don't know how
[29:12] to resist the devil, right, you're going
[29:14] to turn into something that you ain't
[29:16] never thought you could be.
[29:18] The the problem is people think that
[29:21] they can fight with their mind. But
[29:23] Satan is a lot more smarter than you.
[29:26] It reminds me of the story of the
[29:28] prodical son, right? And he left the he
[29:31] when he left the house, where he ended
[29:33] up was not how he left. Right. Right.
[29:36] The Bible says he was in a pig pin. You
[29:39] not a pig?
[29:41] How like what what what can happen
[29:44] between there and there to make you
[29:45] think that you're a pig. And when he he
[29:47] even confessed when he went back to the
[29:48] father, he said, "I'm not worthy to be a
[29:50] son. Just take me as a servant." His
[29:52] mind was so warped. So don't think
[29:54] you're just going to come out here and
[29:56] just live o any life. Yes. You have
[30:00] individuals uh women, the transgender
[30:03] people as they they say, you know, women
[30:05] that are turned to a a natural-born
[30:08] woman that are turned into a to a male.
[30:10] They have physical evidence. They are a
[30:14] female.
[30:15] [Music]
[30:16] So, what is the problem?
[30:19] You can't use education to fight Satan.
[30:22] He doesn't care how educated you are.
[30:24] Yeah. He don't care how smart you are,
[30:26] what you can see, what you can taste,
[30:28] what you can feel. The only thing that
[30:30] defeats Satan is faith in the word of
[30:33] God. God made me the way I am. That's
[30:36] the only thing that'll chase the devil
[30:38] away.
[30:39] Not how smart you are, not how much you
[30:42] know, just just quoting the word, God
[30:44] made me a man, and I've been made in the
[30:46] image of a man. God made me a woman.
[30:48] I've been made in the image of a woman.
[30:50] that will chase the devil away every
[30:52] single time. Right? There's not enough
[30:55] medication you can take. He don't care
[30:57] about your medication. He don't care
[31:00] about your therapy. He don't care about
[31:02] your feelings.
[31:04] Give him the word and it'll chase the
[31:05] devil away every single time.
[31:10] Amen.
[31:12] Oh yeah. So, and I want to kind of uh
[31:16] kind of type this thing because um my
[31:19] mom and y'all all know the story about
[31:21] my mom. My mom had me on lockdown. I
[31:24] didn't know that it was a hedge though,
[31:25] right? It was a hedge that she had
[31:27] around me and me and my sister. And this
[31:29] is a story that I told to the young
[31:30] ones. But I remember when I was in sixth
[31:32] grade and I remember I got this
[31:34] girlfriend, her name was Kayla, right?
[31:36] And you know, we were talking and you
[31:39] know, I remember I can't remember if she
[31:41] gave me her phone number or I gave her
[31:42] mine, but she called me one time and I
[31:44] want you guys to know that my my parents
[31:47] raised our parents raised us godly. So,
[31:49] we didn't know a lot about the world. We
[31:51] ain't know about the world's fashions
[31:53] and the what they do and the things that
[31:55] they say. We were innocent because
[31:57] that's how our parents raised us. and
[32:00] she came on the phone and she was saying
[32:01] some stuff, some very explicit things
[32:04] that I can't even tell you today what it
[32:06] was because I didn't know. But we I
[32:09] lived during a time where we didn't have
[32:11] cell phones. We had landlines.
[32:14] And if you was on the phone and someone
[32:17] else in another room picked up the
[32:18] phone, they could hear what you were
[32:20] saying. Right. Yes, sir. And so my mom
[32:24] was on the phone when she said that and
[32:26] she said, "Don't you?" She told the
[32:28] girl, she said, "Don't you never call
[32:30] this house again." Got off the phone,
[32:32] she came to me, she said, "I don't want
[32:33] you ever to talk to that girl again."
[32:35] Right? That's what you call a hedge.
[32:38] Right? You got And so, you need godly
[32:40] parents to be able to kick the devil
[32:43] out.
[32:44] The problem with today is that now we
[32:46] got cell phones, right? And I I know a
[32:49] lot of us have heard of the story of the
[32:50] uh the uh the Trojan horse where you had
[32:53] the story where the city was fortified
[32:55] and there was no way for anyone to get
[32:57] inside the city. So these people that
[32:59] were fighting against them, they got up
[33:01] they uh they decided to do a little
[33:02] trick and they created a gift for them.
[33:04] They said, "Hey, we got a gift for you,
[33:06] you know, and they cleared a Trojan
[33:07] horse and they gave it to them. So then
[33:09] they took the horse and brought it into
[33:10] the city and when everybody was asleep,
[33:13] they came out and killed everybody." And
[33:15] so Satan today, what he's done um is
[33:19] phones. Oh, we love to talk about how
[33:21] good they are, but phones have been of
[33:24] detriment to the family unit
[33:27] cuz the enemy sneaks him inside your
[33:29] house and now you got the young ones on
[33:31] the phone texting, talking to whoever
[33:33] they want to and not telling the
[33:36] parents. So my of course my dad wasn't
[33:38] right there so my mom was in charge but
[33:40] you always have to have a head in the
[33:43] house because you may not understand how
[33:45] the enemy is trying to trick you. But
[33:47] when when when the voice gets to the
[33:49] head the head's going to be like no no
[33:50] no we're not having that. If Eve would
[33:53] have had gone to Adam when the serpent
[33:55] that came to her and said hey Adam the
[33:57] serpent told me this Adam said no no you
[34:00] stay right here don't listen to anything
[34:02] that he says. He would went up to the
[34:03] serpent and said hey don't you talk to
[34:04] her. Right. and the problem would have
[34:07] been solved. But because she decided to
[34:09] do her own thing in Adam's house, it
[34:14] caused problems.
[34:16] All right.
[34:17] Come on, brother. So, we got to make
[34:19] sure that, you know, we have a hedge
[34:21] about our house. Because when you have a
[34:23] hedge, Satan can't do nothing. Can't do
[34:27] nothing to you. Can't do nothing to your
[34:29] kids. Can't do nothing to your business.
[34:31] Can't do nothing to your health. Can't
[34:33] do nothing to your mental health. can't
[34:35] do nothing to your loved ones and in
[34:37] fact anyone else you come in contact to
[34:40] they usually become blessed as well just
[34:42] because of what you have.
[34:45] Amen. That's the truth. So before we get
[34:47] a little bit more deeper uh into um kind
[34:51] of deeper into that concept that we're
[34:53] talking about um we want to ask
[34:55] ourselves you know well why does the
[34:58] enemy hate us so much? Why does he hate
[35:01] us so much? Right. Uh God had we already
[35:04] read that God said he was going to put
[35:05] enmity between us and him but there's a
[35:08] little bit more deeper meaning behind
[35:10] why that happens. I looked up what the
[35:12] word enmity means and that is a
[35:14] deep-seated hatred or ill will right. So
[35:18] if you love the things of the world the
[35:21] Bible says God the love of God is not
[35:23] even in you because God's trying to
[35:25] separate his people from the world.
[35:27] Right? And so in order for him to do
[35:29] that, not only do we have to love God
[35:31] more, but we have to hate the things of
[35:33] the world just as much, right? And so
[35:36] that's what God is trying to do uh to
[35:38] his church. And so this will also show
[35:41] us in regards to uh this will show us to
[35:43] how the enemy is preventing us to to uh
[35:47] from recognizing a revelation of what
[35:48] this image and what this image means to
[35:50] us. Right? So, in order to answer these
[35:54] questions, we have to go back before the
[35:55] earth was the ever ever was created. So,
[35:57] we're going to turn to Ezekiel
[35:59] 28 and read verses uh
[36:06] 13-15 and I'll just start reading now.
[36:09] It says, "Thou has been in Eden, the
[36:11] garden of God. Every precious stone was
[36:13] thy covering. the sardis, topaz, and the
[36:16] diamond, the buril, the onyx and the
[36:18] jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and
[36:20] the carbuncle and gold. The workmanship
[36:22] of thy tabs, and of thy pipes were
[36:26] prepared in thee in the day that thou
[36:27] was created. Thou art the anointed
[36:30] cherub that coverth, and I have set thee
[36:32] so. Thou was upon the holy mountain of
[36:34] God. Thou hast walked up and down in the
[36:36] midst of the stones of fire. Thou was
[36:38] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[36:40] thou was created till iniquity was found
[36:44] in thee. Right? So when the Bible says
[36:48] the word cherub, we know that that means
[36:50] an angel. So Lucifer uh is an angel.
[36:54] He's a fallen angel now, but he was an
[36:57] angel, right? And verse 15 and in verse
[36:59] 13, there's a key word in there that
[37:01] says that he was created. And that's
[37:03] important to understand because it um it
[37:07] signifies that you know there was a
[37:10] beginning to something and the prophet
[37:12] told us that if there's a beginning if
[37:14] something has a beginning then it also
[37:16] has an end right and it says here that
[37:20] iniquity was found in Lucifer. But what
[37:23] was it? What was it that Lucifer was
[37:25] thinking of that caused this uh that
[37:27] caused this thing? Because this is in
[37:29] fact the first sin ever that ever ever
[37:32] happened. right there in heaven. And
[37:34] we're going to read Isaiah 14:12-14 to
[37:37] figure out what Lucifer
[37:40] desired. That was the cause of
[37:44] iniquity. And it reads, "How art thou
[37:47] fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of
[37:49] the morning." So he had a position. "How
[37:52] art thou cut down to the ground which
[37:54] did weaken the nations? For thou hast
[37:57] said in thy heart, I will ascend into
[37:59] heaven. I will exalt my throne above the
[38:01] stars of God. I will sit upon the mount
[38:04] of the congregation in the sides of the
[38:05] north. I will ascend above the heights
[38:08] of the clouds. I will be like the most
[38:12] high. Right? So here his whole desire in
[38:15] his heart was to be like God. Lucifer
[38:18] wanted to be like God and that was the
[38:21] iniquity. Right? So, we're going to turn
[38:23] to God's power to transform preached in
[38:27] 65009 paragraph uh 103 through 5 to see
[38:32] what the prophet said about this. And he
[38:35] says here here notice the two type of
[38:38] Eden so closely typed together
[38:40] till almost deceive the very elected.
[38:43] Matthew 20:24 said that it would be that
[38:45] way. But I want us to stop for a few
[38:47] moments and consider these two Edens and
[38:48] one thing especially how the Bible tells
[38:51] us that God's word did produce that Eden
[38:53] and how God's word warns us that the
[38:55] other Eden would come. Now we also know
[38:59] that there has got to be another Eden.
[39:00] If we are to listen to the prophet Paul
[39:02] in second Thessalonians the second
[39:04] chapter I could read if you want second
[39:06] he he reads here he who exalts himself
[39:09] that day will not come of the Lord until
[39:11] that man of sin be revealed. He who sits
[39:13] in the temple of God exalting himself
[39:15] above all that is called God so that he
[39:17] is worship so that so that he as God is
[39:20] worshiped as God. And this is the the
[39:22] the part we want to uh key in on the
[39:24] prophet says think of that now Isaiah 14
[39:27] the prophet said that he saw Lucifer in
[39:30] his heart through a vision. So this was
[39:32] a major prophet during that day and was
[39:34] and God had given him a vision of what
[39:36] happened before the earth was ever
[39:38] created in heaven. said through a vision
[39:40] under inspiration of God saying he would
[39:43] do that in Isaiah 8 in Isaiah 800 years
[39:46] before Paul or approximately that and
[39:48] what he's saying is that you know of
[39:49] course Satan came into power uh and I
[39:52] and uh and I believe that it's through
[39:54] the Catholic Church where now he's being
[39:56] worshiped as God but it isn't God it's
[39:59] Satan in the Catholic church right so
[40:01] his whole objective uh uh is to be
[40:04] worshiped right that's what his heart is
[40:06] he wants to be worshiped uh as God even
[40:09] No, he is not a god. Right. And we're
[40:11] going to read the seal of the
[40:13] antichrist. Give me one
[40:17] second. Okay, we we'll actually skip
[40:19] that. So, um the prophet says that
[40:23] Lucifer, the biggest thing, the other
[40:25] thing with the uh with Lucifer was that
[40:27] he was jealous of Michael's kingdom,
[40:28] which is why we struggle when we try to
[40:30] succeed in life. When God gives us a
[40:32] vision and God plants something inside
[40:34] of our hearts, you know, Satan is
[40:36] jealous of that, right? Satan is jealous
[40:38] of that blessing that we have that God
[40:40] wants to see in our lives and he'll do
[40:42] whatever he can uh to fight that thing.
[40:45] Right? And we know that the prophet
[40:47] referred to Michael the arch angle arch
[40:50] angel as Christ, right? As Christ. And
[40:54] we also know that messengers uh in this
[40:56] last day uh can be angels and sons of
[41:00] God. So we've had William Brham, we've
[41:02] had uh Wesley, we've had Luther, we've
[41:05] had Paul. were all angels and God's
[41:08] sons. All right? So, let's say we have
[41:12] then two images that we're looking at
[41:13] here, right? You have God's image and
[41:17] then you have an angel's image, right?
[41:20] So, before the foundation of the world,
[41:22] when God uh the prophet said when it was
[41:24] just it was just God in the uh
[41:26] beginning, he was the self-existing one.
[41:29] And so, he came down into a form called
[41:31] God uh in order to be uh worshiped,
[41:35] right? And an image is just attributes
[41:38] that can be expressed. So basically it's
[41:41] telling you what you can do, what you
[41:43] are and what you can do, what you're
[41:44] made of, right? And so we're going to
[41:46] find out a little bit of some of these
[41:48] uh images um where the prophet had
[41:52] mentioned he said that when God w uh God
[41:55] which means an object of worship when
[41:58] God was in the beginning he was a
[41:59] self-existing one and he had attributes
[42:01] in him. He was a savior. He was a
[42:03] healer. He was a a nurturer, right? He
[42:07] was a father, but he didn't have
[42:09] anything there to prove those
[42:10] attributes. So then what he did was he
[42:13] stepped down into a realm, put himself
[42:15] as God, and then he created angels, and
[42:18] now he became God because now the angels
[42:20] came onto the scene, and their sole
[42:22] purpose is to worship God. All right?
[42:25] Their sole purpose is to worship God.
[42:27] That included Lucifer. That was
[42:29] Lucifer's job was to worship and to uh
[42:32] uh and to serve and to serve the Lord.
[42:35] Right? So we begin to see uh the
[42:38] difference between these two images
[42:41] then. Right? One of the things is we
[42:45] were created to worship the Lord, but
[42:47] our worship is different than we're
[42:48] angels. The prophet said that when we
[42:51] get back to heaven that we'll sing songs
[42:54] that angels they don't know nothing
[42:55] about.
[42:57] They won't know nothing. We'll be we'll
[42:59] be singing, having a good time in the
[43:01] Lord, and the prophet said the angels
[43:03] will just stand to the side because they
[43:05] don't know what we're talking about,
[43:07] right? They are made in a different
[43:09] image than what we were uh we were made
[43:12] in, right? So, they can't worship like
[43:14] us. So, Lucifer was an angel, but the
[43:17] problem was his desire was to be a god.
[43:21] His desire was to be a god, but that's
[43:23] not how God created him. God created him
[43:25] to just sing and be quiet. Just sing,
[43:28] serve God, and be quiet. And it's
[43:30] interesting because, you know, even if
[43:33] Lucifer were not to fall, he'd still be
[43:36] your servant, right? He would still
[43:39] serve you, right? So, he hasn't lost his
[43:41] position. So everything he does, even
[43:44] when it's bad, it still serves you,
[43:48] right? It still serves God purpose in
[43:50] your life. He's still just a servant.
[43:54] Amen. He cannot escape his title. Amen.
[43:58] Right. So why does he hate us so much
[44:01] though? That's the question is why does
[44:02] he hate us so much? Right? And uh
[44:05] brother Solomon, one of my favorite
[44:06] verses is uh Philippians 2 uh
[44:11] 5-6, right? And it says this, this is
[44:15] the this is a Bible verse that God has
[44:17] given us men. Let this mind be in you
[44:21] which was also in Christ Jesus who being
[44:24] in the form of God thought it not a
[44:27] robbery to be equal with God. All right.
[44:31] So when Christ comes inside of you, you
[44:33] can have the desire to be like God.
[44:36] Right? Now Lucifer when he had a desire
[44:39] to be like God, it got him kicked out of
[44:41] heaven. But when we have a desire to be
[44:43] like God, it puts us into heaven. Right?
[44:47] So that's why he hates us because we are
[44:51] something that he can't attain even
[44:53] though he wants to be right. And so
[44:56] another thing about this image uh that
[44:59] we love about the image is because
[45:01] because we were made in God's image,
[45:04] there's another attribute that comes
[45:06] with it and that's a theme called
[45:09] redemption. Right? That's that's a theme
[45:11] called redemption. So when a man falls
[45:14] because he's in God's image, God don't
[45:16] want to just put him away, right? God
[45:18] can't put him away because that's um I
[45:21] was I remember I was um a lot of times,
[45:23] you know, we like to make fun of people
[45:26] in their features and stuff like that.
[45:27] We like to joke on people like their
[45:29] height and stuff like that. They say
[45:30] short kings and all that kind of stuff
[45:32] and people like to joke on all that kind
[45:34] of stuff. But uh we you have to remember
[45:37] that that is God's image. when you're
[45:39] looking at someone, that's the that's
[45:41] you're looking at God uh and what he
[45:44] created himself to be. So, one of the
[45:46] one of the um the themes of this image
[45:50] is redemption. And God wants to save
[45:53] man. See, the difference is when an
[45:55] angel falls, there is no redemption.
[45:58] That's it. When an angel fall, he's gone
[46:01] forever. Uh the Bible says that when
[46:04] Lucifer and uh his angels they lost the
[46:07] war, it said God sent them straight to
[46:10] hell. All right? No, no question, no
[46:13] plan, no hey man, you want to try you
[46:16] want to try this thing again? Do you
[46:17] want to try it over? He sent them
[46:18] straight on down to hell. So, and people
[46:21] today, you know, they'll they'll they'll
[46:23] ask you, well, why God is a bad guy? Why
[46:25] does he want to send people to hell? The
[46:28] prophet told us God didn't create hell
[46:30] for men. Amen. Hell was not created for
[46:33] men. It was created for Satan and his
[46:36] angels because God wants to redeem man
[46:40] when they fall. Right? So that's why he
[46:44] hates us because in the garden in the
[46:46] beginning when uh when uh God came to
[46:50] Adam and Eve when they fell he came to
[46:52] the serpent there was no redemption.
[46:54] Right? He look past and there was no
[46:56] redemption. Then he turned to Eve. He
[46:59] turned to Eve. He gave her a little gave
[47:01] her a little spanking. Turned to Adam,
[47:03] gave him a little spanking. The Bible
[47:04] says he killed the lamb, wrapped it
[47:06] around him, and as they walked out the
[47:08] garden, the serpent had to look at Adam
[47:10] and Eve going out in their mistake,
[47:12] knowing that there was hope for them,
[47:14] but none for him.
[47:19] Wow.
[47:21] Oh, he hates us.
[47:24] He hates it. He hates to see man that
[47:29] can be redeemed. And and and I and I
[47:31] love God because he's such a loving God.
[47:34] See, I used to get you you can get
[47:35] caught up in those arguments like, "Oh,
[47:37] God just wants to send people to hell.
[47:38] God just this." No, no, no, no, no, no.
[47:41] The more I read, the more I read the
[47:43] word, the more I realize how much of a
[47:45] loving God he is. In the time of Noah,
[47:49] you know that Noah created a really,
[47:51] really big ark. It was limited space.
[47:54] Not because God didn't want to save
[47:56] anybody, but because God is God and he
[47:58] knows everything. He knows who's going
[48:01] to be saved. He knows who's going to
[48:03] choose to be saved and who's not. Right?
[48:05] But the thing about the love of God was
[48:07] that the door was a big door.
[48:11] Right? It wasn't a hidden door. You
[48:14] didn't have to have a key. Anybody could
[48:16] have walked in and God would have saved
[48:19] him. Right? So God is a loving God and
[48:23] Satan hates that uh uh uh that we have
[48:26] uh that love of God. And the other thing
[48:28] is um God has given us dominion.
[48:33] God has given us power. God has placed
[48:36] us into a position of sunship. God has
[48:39] placed us into a position of glory.
[48:41] Right? The Bible says that creation
[48:44] groans for the
[48:46] manifestations of angels. no of sons and
[48:50] daughters of God. Right? God wants to
[48:52] see us in a position where we can be
[48:54] glorified. Which is why when you look at
[48:56] uh Joseph, Joseph a perfect type of
[48:59] Christ, right? Sold off into slavery,
[49:01] went down into a ditch, brought back up,
[49:04] went to the house, served, was an
[49:06] excellent servant. Everyone respected
[49:08] him. They lied on him, put him right
[49:09] back down into the ground. God rose him
[49:12] back up higher and higher, higher, and
[49:13] everyone had to look to Joseph. the uh
[49:16] God the Pharaoh had placed so much
[49:18] confident in Joseph that he was second
[49:20] in command and that's how God sees us
[49:23] and Satan hates that because it puts him
[49:26] in his place. So that's the reason why
[49:30] we don't have to struggle. You don't
[49:32] have to argue with the devil. You don't
[49:34] have to get upset. All you got to do is
[49:37] stand because you are your victory. May
[49:41] the Lord bless you.
[49:54] Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[49:58] Amen.
[49:59] [Music]
[50:03] Oh, let's uh say a word of prayer before
[50:05] we uh before we close.
[50:08] Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you for the
[50:11] revelation that you gave us in this
[50:12] hour, oh Lord God, that the image we're

[51:34] all they got to do is just speak. Oh
[51:36] Lord God, help them. Oh Lord God, put it
[51:38] in their hearts. Oh Lord God, answer
[51:40] their requests. Oh Lord Jesus Christ,
[51:42] give them the strength, oh Lord God.
[51:44] Give us all the strength, oh Lord God,

[57:16] is. So, I'm going to take this back tire
[57:18] off, and I'm going to see if I can see
[57:20] what's wrong. So, when I went back to

[57:27] the bolts, well, the the the thread that
[57:30] was holding the bolts were just cut and
[57:32] the tire was like that. So I was like,
[57:35] "Oh my god, I've been driving around
[57:37] here and every every boat was loose."
[57:42] I said, "Man, I've been a Raleigh and
[57:44] everywhere driving with this thing like
