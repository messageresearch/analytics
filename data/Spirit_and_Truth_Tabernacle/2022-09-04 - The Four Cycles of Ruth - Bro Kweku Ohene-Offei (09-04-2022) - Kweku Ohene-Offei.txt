presence for thou has maintained my right and my cause thou satteth in the throne judging right thou has rebuked the heathen thou has destroyed the wicked that has put out their name forever and ever o thy enemy destructions are come to a perpetual end thou has destroyed cities their memorial is perished with them but the lord shall endure forever he has prepared his strong for judgment and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall minister judgment to the people and upright uprightness the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in a time of trouble and they that

years ago we did a we did a 4 000 mile trip uh back in the day something that i probably never do we had a we had we had a convoy and uh back in the day we didn't have all of the gps and stuff like we have today we had uh at that time we had uh i can't think of the name of it where you print out you print out mapquest come on help me somebody we had we had map quests and here's the ironic things we we took the time to print up the directions and the weird thing about it is that that folk didn't want to take the information they they wanted to follow but here the objective was if i give you this and you get lost you can still make it to your destination and that's that's like a lot of people you you try to give them the rope but they don't want it they don't want it but just give it to me because amen you might get off going the wrong way but i could make it to the destination y'all all right this morning amen amen i'm gonna change the order i appreciate having my brother uh i cannot remember his name praise the lord everybody pray to the lord everybody it's good to have brother mark amen with us this morning amen we appreciate having him here amen he said he said that with conviction too quick i was like i i didn't know if he got a name changed since the last time i i saw you know amen it's good to know that that we we brothers cause i i remember in sarasota man i called his brother uh curtis with conviction like i knew him that brother name was scott and they they teased me to this day amen but since you let us let us stand amen as we get ready to welcome

but i smiley thank you for that for the worship sister best mr cherise and all our brothers and sisters we give the glory to to the lord the lord bless you amen this morning we want to um oh let's take our seats sorry we want to just to give you a little time to relax we want to look at something from the life form of ruth amen and i don't know if you have the the slides i titled the the the four cycles of ruth the moabites you can call it the four junctions but i just want to make the title shot so we want to look at the life of ruth the moabite and how it applies onto your life and onto my life amen we don't just want to look at the historical perspective but we want to look at how does it practically apply to your life and my life now amen because we are not living uh four thousand years back we are living in the year 2022 a man ruth lived four thousand or somewhere years back he lived in a year where they didn't have microphone they didn't have computers they didn't have an american as a nation the earth existed but the nation of united states didn't exist so we are in a different time and season and the lord is so specific that he gives the word for the right time and the right season so we want to see how ruth that if we are the ruth of this hour and how we manifest the same life form but for this very hour amen the bible said that we were caught from when jesus was born he had to be taken to egypt to hide from as if no pharaoh from a herald the king wanted to kill him now so the prophet pray that we we the lord called us out of egypt but not in the land of egypt and africa no but egypt the condition of the world amen egypt as a sinful nation egypt as the rightness of this world egypt as the old breath that's where we were caught from from the sex birth to the spoken word body a man the new birth so look sorry ruth went through four stages she went through the first stage she has to make decision and decision is tied to your choice the lord has given you the free will to make certain decisions in your life for your life for your family for yourself for church for the people that you influence and that is your personal choice the lord has sovereignly given to you a man so ruth was found in a point where she needed to make a choice and making that choice led to another step she needed to save and to labor and to work and that led to the next step that is resting or waiting for the blessings of the lord upon a life and that led to the ultimate the the perfect the expectation that was being rewarded for the choices or the decisions that she made and decisions your result it could be positive it could be negative based on the decision that you make so let's take a look at um a scripture i want to read the scripture i don't know let's let's like go back go to i don't know which slide but it has this scripture that i want to read um isaiah chapter 62 verse 1 to 4 somewhere praise be to the lord almighty isaiah chapter 62 there you go amen you are the city i want to give the the overview of my of the same one just in case we are not able to touch everything we've got a bunch of scriptures we're not going to read all of them and so we want to give overview nowadays the highlight of of what you want to speak today is that for zion's sick will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem sick i will not rest until the righteousness thereof goes forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that beneath two an agenda shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name and i want you to highlight that new name which the mouth of the lord shall name thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and arroyo dyed him in the hand of thy god thou shall know more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land be any more term desolate but thou shalt be called hefzeba and thyland beulah for the lord delighted in thee and thy land shall be married amen god bless you now back to ruth ruth was a gentile a moabite who didn't know the lord but now there was a time where there was famine in israel so there was a man an israelite husband of naomi took decision to take his wife and two sons to moab to find a greener pastures so they went to the land and his sons got married to two more british women oppa and ruth but in the course of time the man died eliminate passed away and it wasn't probably too long his two sons forgot their name malone and something else they also went to be with the lord so naomi was left uh as a widow without a husband and the two sons were gone and you put yourself in that you can imagine how life would be and so there was a time even when he came out to israel and they said oh naomi he said don't come in on me call me mara because i went with plenty and i came back with nothing so but the lord has something beyond our earthly measurement amen we measure success is based on maybe the how much you have in your bank account uh the job that you do the number of houses and different things like that your business but gas measurement is about redemption and salvation as we read here and before something can be saved and redeemed that thing has to be lost first amen so ruth naomi started with four overflowing blessing husband children and maybe pretty soon he was going to get grandkids but all of a sudden a sudden went blue in her family and all that she had was lost saved with her two daughters-in-law and it wasn't long there was food in israel abundance of food so naomi made a decision to go back to her homeland and so the two daughters in law followed her on the way and she said you know what it's it's it's painful for me for your sick that it's happened to me this way i don't have any more suns in my womb you know to give them if i even marry now and get science you can't wait for them to grow up to marry so go back and i like the way he put his go back to your to your family to your mothers and to the gods in other words the adults that you worship go back so now we gave them a choice to go back to their homeland and they were shaped idols they worship all kinds of things they didn't know the god of jehovah amen and all of them cried and said we go with you but oppa kiss the mother-in-law and return back to the idols but naomi made a statement which is astonishing and i want us to read that is what uh kind of encapsulate a decision to go to to go to israel to go with their mother-in-law to a nation that she didn't know she didn't know their culture so let's go to um let's see to the lord okay let's go to ruth decision the uh ruth chapter 1 verse 11 to 19 of course i'm going to read just a few of them but when you go home you can read rule chapter 1 11 to 19. i read a couple of verses maybe three or four verses root chapter 1 verse i'll read from 16 to 19. that is where her decision or let's say from eleven two he said and naomi said ten again and now he said ten again my daughters why would you go with me and theref and there yet are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands 10 again my daughters go your way for i'm too old to have a husband if i should say so i have hope i have hope i should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them till you groan let's jump to 16 and and 16 and ruth said in treatment not to go to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goes i will go and where thou lodges our lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking with her when 19 so they too went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi amen naomi dak ami had abandoned he came back empty-handed but the lord has something installed so now look let's focus a little on ruth here ruth was determined and the bible said that she was steadfast to go with her mother-in-law who has become her mother a man because she left her mother's mother and father behind her brothers and sisters and kings and kinsmen behind and then clank clung onto naomi her mother-in-law because she saw something in naomi a man she has been with her husband her father-in-law a brother-in-law and a mother-in-law and she's seen not just their culture their culture is one thing maybe their culture might even be superior to the culture of naomi but she saw something about this lady which is jehovah in her and she had a fist and a hunger for her a man and ruth was a woman of compassion she was a virtuous woman because when she realized that her sister-in-law was gone but she decided to go with her mother-in-law one reason we can we can infer was that her mother-in-law was quite old maybe not like 70s but let's assume she was in the sixties and now we know that pretty soon maybe 10 20 30 years down the road the mother-in-law could not fend for herself and she's lost her husband her children had two sons so she determined that i'm not going to let her die in sorrow i'll go with i'll cling steadfast to my mother-in-law with my mother and be a help and now she invoked a word strong decision said let nothing depart i mean separate you and i save death your god will be my god your culture will be my culture your food will be my food your people will be my people and where you die i will die i'll be buried there what a statement amen what a decision this was a decision for by a lady to follow her mother-in-law bring it to her modern terms how many would like to do that amen if a man or a woman can make a decision to help to be with their mother-in-law who is who is going to pass away how much more our decision towards jesus christ be amen your eternal decision not just to serve the lord but to be him amen because when you take that decision let's see how it's going to end for naomi if you take the sin to serve the lord you're gonna be him amen he's gonna put his power in you he's gonna manifest in you and what else do you want beside the almighty god manifesting you amen all the blessing on earth is yours glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord so let's go to the second part let's see uh the next thing that follows decision let's go to a let's read this um quotes before let's transition from brokenness to masterpiece let's read that quotes from the prophet and then go go on with the scriptures just to give a little highlight kingsman's redeemer 1960 october the second paragraph 61. so now i want to liken this morning naomi the elder lady to the orthodox church the jewish orthodox church ruth the moabite agenda being the christian church the new church and i want to approach it i want to approach it from four different faces ruth i got to wrote down here ruth deciding ruth making making her decision ruth 7 ruth reston or waiting ruth rewarded as we come back ruth making decision ruth after she made a decision then ruth is seven then ruth is resting then root is rewarded amen and that is the four faces that route went through and we go through uh similar phases amen and sometimes serving is not just only seven with uh with with joy and with a pleasantness but serving sometimes goes with suffering and pain and sorrow not because you made the wrong decision you made a perfect decision before the almighty god and yes you're gonna suffer for that decision amen that's why if you are not careful your faith will begin to waver and and move right but then be steadfast like ruth and even suffer for the decision that you make look into the rest and the reward that is less ahead of you amen so let's read a rule chapter let's go to rule chapter two now she's made a decision let's go to the next uh slide seven labyrinth and suffering rule chapter 2 verse 1 to 14. let's pick um verse 2. okay let me read one and now and naomi had a kingsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of eliminate and his name was boaz too and rude muabites said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose side i shall find greece and she said unto her go my daughter verse three and she went and came and gleaned in the fold after the rippers and her harp was to light on a part of the field belonging unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimi lake and behold boss came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you the lord be with me shalom and they answered the lord bless thee then said was unto his servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this whose daughter is this who's whose girl is this and the seven that was set over the reapers answering cell said it is the moabitis dam cell that came back with naomi of the country of moab and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the repairs among the ships so she came and had continued even from the morning until now that she's turreted a little in the house verse 8 then said boast unto ruth here is thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here first by my meetings let their eyes be upon the field that thou do reap and go thou after them i have not have i not charged the young men that they should not touch thee and when thou art at first go onto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn then she that was ruth she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in that side that thou should take knowledge of me sin i'm a stranger and boaz said was answered and said unto her it has fully been shown me all that that has done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of the husband and how that has left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and now thou come unto your people doubt no knowest not their their to fall the lord recompense in other words the lord reward thy work a full reward be given unto thee of the lord god of israel on that under whose wings thou had come to trust then she said let me find let me find favor in the aside my lord for that thou has comforted me and for that that i have spoken friendly unto thy handmaid though i be not like unto one of them behind me hand me amen god bless you now that is a time ruth was beginning to save and if you take the right decision even in time of suffering god gives you favor and grace amen root shoot compassion unto naomi to help her to go with her and now the compassion that she sold she's going to reap it in abundance amen she didn't know boaz she wasn't a kids man to boast but by predestination because she took the right decision the lord god of heaven put favor in the heart of boaz for ruth amen and ruth allowed her to glean in on her field amen now let's type in the field is the field of the lord jesus christ the field uh the map i think since that verse was singing the road map that the lord has given to the field is the word of the lord the bible the word of the lord for your hour the message of god for the for your day and your time and season amen so that is the food that you should glean do not go to any other field if you go to any other field you're gonna have thorns and thistles you're gonna have scorpions and spiders biting you because it's not the right for you amen you're going to have suffer unnecessary pain amen let them put in in a simple way young ladies young man amen upcoming young people there's a lot of attraction in the world in school in primary school on the internet on youtube on twitter on what a view that you can go and step you want to just go and veer off and just take a look take a little peep what's going out there the first time you start watching your pornography it's a spirit that's where to move into you and you get hooked to pornography i've seen people oh they want to leave pornography i've got wives they are not abutu i went to preach one time in green a case when i came here first and when i was going i saw this man smoking the church was there and he was smoking in front of the not directly in front on the roadside and i was watching why is he smoking when he's going to church so he threw the smoke and then he came to work out i was just about to enter and he kim said you are the preacher i said yes he said he saw me smoking i said i did he said i've been smoking for years and i have my wife is in the church i have pornography problem and i drink as well i've tried all my best i don't want it so i told the lord that is my last smoke i don't want to smoke again and i want to be delivered from pornography he said i've done all my best i i've not been this man was about 55 to 60 years old she started he started pornography that was first time her first encounter with pornography and it does even rule his life when he's got wife and children he still can i mean can't set himself free from pornography so why do you want to start to begin with amen stay in the path on the field of boaz who is the birth of our day jesus christ where is the field the word of the lord come to church and hear the word of the lord cling with your family amen if you've got a godly father godly mother a godly grandparent a godly uncle brothers aunties cling with them amen even if you don't understand let them lead them coach you you understand someday and you'll be grateful to them for what they did for you amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord and i want to break it down a little bit let's go to um [Music] ruth said said why have i found grace in your sight because she took the right decision on the way coming with an army to take care of naomi and the lord sent a wealthy person to take care of her and i want us to underline certain words here he said you have spoken verse 13. then she said let me find favor on your side for thou has comforted me and thou has spoken friendly unto thy hand man seen that i'm not like one of your people amen now what do we learn from here a man that really loves you is the man that will speak comforting where to you amen if i'm going with a person that hates you that that despise speaks spiteful word to you that is not a relationship you should stay in no matter how handsome or how beautiful it is it's not going to end well because what is in him is what is coming out it is always putting you down always blasting you always being negative to you it's going to be the same thing when you get married to that person so be watchful and be worthful amen before you enter into a relationship amen because the person that can speak comfort and love not not not west by west of men amen men can speak so many things they can give what we call rap sodi but they have no substance in them but brazman is smiling he knows what i'm talking about men can speak they can tell you out i'm going to take you to the moon i'll do i'll do i'll i'll give you whatever you want but the word has got no substance because this man hasn't got a character a dime of creature in him he just wants your flesh and if you let him take your flesh he'll destroy your life the same thing to men young men if you see this entire thing lady enters him beautiful so-called young lady and you get enticed to her she's going to destroy your life she's going to take your virtues from him you are men of you may not be the first person she's met she's going to destroy your life and you'll never be the same she's going to leave marks on your body amen max that even when the lord forgives you you're still going to keep in your mind so don't start to begin with amen stay in the food of ruth as in the photo boast amen stay with the lord jesus christ and it will be well with you god's own time will give you what he has for you and you enjoy the rest of your life amen blessed be the name of the lord glory to the lord let's go to um the next ruth reston after taking decision to go with naomi she had to work if you read the rest she had to go to glean every morning take basket and go and glean corn and rice and wheat and soak them and all the millet and all the other cereals you can think about i mean a modern time you can put potatoes and different things in your place amen it was a hard labor she didn't know the people maybe some of the ladies were like who is this who is this lady you know she's from other western country they might be speaking gospel about her but her heart was focused on her vision same thing as a young lady as a young man not everybody is going to give you a good comment on even how you dress you wear your lungs scared some people will speak spy for what you long wear long skirt are you an old lady that will hurt you you feel like am i why do i why can't i wear pants why can't i be like them why can't i just be a little bit fashionable if your decision is not set steadfast like ruth you're gonna go this way but if your audition is framed with the lord amen it doesn't matter who say this and who say that it's coming from the inside amen is that tcm world coming from babbling from your heart it's jesus christ you are not doing it just the outside but it's something that you've taken decision amen and there are certain times the lord wants you as a human being to take decision it's not everything is going to give you great anointing to do it you want you as a human being sit down as a young lady as a teenager as an adolescent take a decision that i'm not going to let nobody touch me until the day that the almighty give me my husband amen as a young man you're going to take a decision that i'm not going to touch any woman until that woman is my wife that i'm married to so you take your decision and then ask the grace of god to help you and the lord will lead you and help you amen but if you let your friends influence you if you let social media influence you facebook and what have you influenced you you're gonna reap the result because decisions yield result positive or negative you will repeat yourself amen so take the right decision god has placed godly men and women in your lives ministers but a jack but a smiley but a troy but a jerry and eldest in your life to lead you amen people pray and come and sing people pray and come and preach the word to bless you why do you want to leave that food of boaz and go to the enemies field to get bitten by scorpions oh my lord help us amen glory hallelujah one time i was just a couple of weeks ago i used to do online virtual services with a hispanic people and one sister attended she's an african sister and her name happened to be ruth and he said brother i've never heard this before i've been a sunday school girl all my life my my i think my my father is a pastor but i've never had a story of ruth being preached like this he said when we were preaching it was blessing my heart my heart was lifted up and she gave a testimony i think prior to that she said i had it you said it's a different thing when your parents and people talk to you about the message if you want your parents groom you in the message but it's a different thing when you see it for yourself she gave an experience of seeing the message for herself so the lord gave gave a dream and the lord mentioned her name ruth he showed a bible and a message book let this two book never depart from you with my daughter hold on to this book and let it be your road map the bible and the message it will lead you to eternity amen and i believe there are many all of us are ruth amen and let that not book the word of the lord the bible and the message the message is interpretation of the bible to us is the self same thing amen it's just like now we put the new testament together they used to have the old testament in the time of moses and then the lord is always continued the lord is not it doesn't have a stopping place it's just eternity unveiling so the lord started a new testament with a peter and matthew and paul and co so there is no difference is one the message that we read is not william brahm's message he was just a servant of it just like paul amen like moses but the message is the word of the lord jesus christ unto us in this generation glory hallelujah to the lord so ruth now was going to rest let's see let's read rule chapter 3 verse 1 to 18 but i'll skip some of the scriptures verse one so then naomi is then now me mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and i want us to learn a lesson here ruth took a decision to help her mother-in-law in her old age and the mother-in-law who is her mother also triggered this and that you know what sooner than later maybe 10 20 whenever 40 years i may not be here and even if i'm here i might be too old to help naomi sorry help ruth she's a stranger where is she going to find food maybe she has a place to lodge how is life going to be for her so the same god who put in a heart of ruth to help naomi is the same god who could have heard of naomi to help ruth and naomi is the old church not that she said prophetess a man she was a woman with the word of god in her heart she knows the word of god for her day so she said i need to find you rest and let's see the race she was talking about he said it's now it's now is and now it's not boaz verse 2 of our kindred and whose meetings that was and he we know it uh badly tonight in the threshing floor watched myself and anointed myself let me skip all of them you can read it when you go home let's go to verse nine and he said who are the okay let me read some of them to make sense to us let them continue with verse three watch thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy remnant upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lie down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do and she said unto her all that that has said will i do amen all that thou saith unto me i would do versus and she said and she went down onto the floor and did according to all that her mother in law beat her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry and he went out to lie down at the end of the heap of corn she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman laid down at at his feet and he said who are thou and she answered i'm ruth thine handmade spread therefore thy scared over thy hand made for thou art a near kinsman and he said blessed be thou be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou followers not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i'll do to thee all that i requested for all the city of my people don't know that there are a virtuous virtuous women woman and now and now it is true that i am i am the near kinsman how be it there's a kinsmen nearer than i amen now ruth took a decision to be compassionate with naomi and now me being a prophet with the word of the lord by inspiration ordered ruth to do certain things is a cultural thing to do in islam if you do that it could be interpreted differently amen if you go to a man's house and try to pull this uh whatever under you this time it could be as a rip or attempting to rip but that was the culture of that time industry and they were long groups beside what they were they were the inner and outer rope like if you have seen muslims are eastern people how they they dress india and so so they have the inner garment and the long outer garment so ruth did as their mother-in-law better to do and that was a culture signing that she needed redemption and ruth was just a young lady let me just say just make it a story here like let's assume ruth married in those time they didn't go to school they didn't have to go to cali to get a vocation and stuff like that they married maybe at the age of 16 18 20. you know and so ruth married and she didn't even bear children with a husband and husband went on to be with the lord so rude didn't have a child so let's say ruth was around let's give it 20 to 25. and boaz wasn't that young at that time was a man that had married before and his wife had died so he was a widower about let's say 45 to 50 years old and you see the bible said that she referred to her as my daughter she didn't refer to as my sister because they have so white difference in each apart amen but the man of god sometimes is not the way human beings think the word the lord is sovereign and what he does amen he leads people said in this way he lead this one this way he lead this one that way so the ghost on sovereign way he ordained ruth and boaz were very white who could be her daughter amen put on somebody about 45 to 50 marinette 20 25 year old person i mean that age is so different it's so white but it's the predestination of the lord for them amen that's why in life you have to know your personal predestination because your way may not be as this person's way the way the lord has ordained for you may not be how this person get this blessing oh you say oh lord you bless this man this way you bless my sister this way why not me this way you are 70 different purpose on earth your purpose is different from your mother maybe your mother got married at a day of 20 you may marry at the age of 35 it doesn't matter that's what the lord has chosen for you and you have to be steadfast and stay with the lord and when you get 35 the lord will give you the blessing of the blessed of the blessed amen so stay with the lord amen glory hallelujah to the lord so let's move on to see how after ruth reston she got a lot of corn and was blessed bless ruth with a lot of substance glory hallelujah to the lord let's see let me read them okay let me let's move on to the eternal rewards i think i had a scripture eternal rewards begin with sacred decisions okay that is about revelation chapter 61 bram preacher i may say relation chapter five number two 61-0618 103 now there is four stations four junctions in ruth and boaz i put it four cycles because god moves in cycles then you break the cycle or the cycle enter into a cycle and where cycle one in cycle two means is the junction that i'm talking about so the first thing is rude deciding uh how many ever had had me preached a message let's see your hands i know well i guess i've had it here and had it on tips and so the route first she had to decide whether she was going to go with go into this land or not with naomi she had to make decisions then after she got there the next thing is she had to do the next thing she had to do was to save in the field of boaz out there and barefooted gleaning uh gleaning behind the reapers seven and then after she had found grace in boa's side then she had to wait to boast done the kinsmen's kinsman redempt redemption to take back all naomi laws lost in order to bring in ruth the moabite and then the next stage is ruth is rewarded amen that's the ultimate reward amen we can type it to ruth losing a husband we can tap into the new breath when we when we were born on earth we had a husband not an external husband the husband that was sitting on the inside of you through the sex bed was what satan that was lucifer tree of knowledge of good and bad every human being knows how to do good and do some bad even out of hitler he wasn't bad all around him after all he was fighting for germany so he was good to the germans but it was bad to other people other races so everybody has a tree of knowledge of good and bad that's not what god requires that husband has to die satan has to die if you have a child when they are children they are angelic they are beautiful sweet and lovely when they get to certain age certainty begin to show up where is this tree coming from they begin to say certain things they begin to give you certain looks where is this coming from she was supposed to be an angel now the angelic is now transitioned to the real who she or he is and then they begin to be angry with you they won't respond when they call them they want to do do their own thing oh but i thought my daughter is an angel my grandbaby's an angel she's done with the angelic age now she's translating to somebody else something else that's when she needed the holy ghost baptism that's where that person in her or in him has to die by the gospel of jesus christ and then jesus shall be born in hell which is the type of boaz an army amen the old husband dies and the new husband the older husband in moab has to die and then go to the new field which is israel judah bethlehem go to the foot of david and then be rewarded by the holy ghost baptism amen and the ultimate is the holy ghost baptism it doesn't matter how long you've been in the message how long you've read bible how long you've been a christian if you don't have the holy ghost baptism you are not there yet you don't have your reward amen the holy ghost button is what will bring you your reward that you're looking for because when you get the holy ghost baptism you become what christ and the words that you speak is not just your word is the word of the inner man the lord jesus christ speaking through your heart amen just like naomi naomi had a word in her so she could sit down and order her daughter that you go to the foot of boaz how did you know boy's mind that a man will not rest until she redeems you how did she know she hadn't had conversation prior to that but there's something in here that speaks to her that is jehovah of the old testament and there must be something in you that speaks to you that is the same jehovah of old testament becoming jesus christ of this day speaking to your heart in terms of distresses in terms of necessities there should be an inner man or the inner woman whatever you call it to speak to your heart that all as well amen no matter how things seem to be falling apart like in the life of naomi and ruth all is well and even in boaz amen because he lost his wife amen the lord is bringing another story love story in your life so you need the redemption which is the holy ghost baptism and i believe as the body of christ if it's something that we need to emphasize is the new breath the holy ghost baptism the self same thing amen is not the baptism that anoints your flesh to dance and to be happy and to sing and to rejoice then when you come back go back home then the old person that lives in you read its ugly head and begin to live another life so you come to church you are one person you are one quick when you go to work or you go to you go to the house you are another person you go smoking you can preach there are preachers that smoke they can preach with someone you rejoice you take you to the seventh dimension but they smoke cigarette they drink whatever they drink they drink johnny walker they do whatever they do and they are wonderful preachers you they are out there and they have got big congregation and they love money they love money that they like their own lives they want a flight what a jet flight they want private whatever they are popular and they compete among themselves for money they have money they are very influential even in government and they're all over the globe where do you want to be amen you have to make your choice amen but god is god of humility he's almighty god created all the universe but it's very simple and he does things in simplicity amen we don't have too many people here even when we have many maybe 180 60 but the word is what matters it's not a big tell evangelist it's not a big name it's not the fame it's not the money but the life amen the food of boaz that's where life comes to come from amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord let's go to root chapter four now be ruth being rewarded glory to the lord when you take a step for the lord you go through your decision your choice you have to suffer for the decision you made for the lord you'll be ridiculed you'll be disappointed certain times in your life not because you took your baptism but you took a right decision and the time of your disappointment the lord is happy because you are standing for him amen remember job job didn't know that there was the lord was doing a bet on him gambling on him knowing that he'll win when he gamble with job amen could it be that that's the only time maybe the only time i can see the lord gambled maybe a lot of time but like the lord gambled with satan and said okay let's go to let's take this bet amen said like look lord i can let i can let your job case you to your face you bless this man on all the earth he's the most blessed man he's got a wonderful wife a godly wife with wonderful children seven sons and three daughters you know got sheep and and uh foul and goats and servants and filled he's a prosperous man he's a blessed man who wouldn't save you if you give me that but let me touch me and see what is going to he's going to save you he's going to bless you and the lord had a challenge i bet we sit and say go do whatever you want only his life you can't take his take away his life and job went through all that the time he was crying and even casting the day was born the lord he didn't know the lord has laid a bet on him in heaven that he was the most righteous man he was the heart of the lord himself amen so even in the time that we are broken to pieces when we are crying when you are in pain the lord is receiving glory in your life and that pain will not last it's not everlasting it's a temporary pain to bring growth in your life to show you more of his love to bring more of the attribute more of christ in you amen because there's more of him in you that he wanted to come out so he can allow the enemy do whatever he wants for a short time the enemy serve his purpose and he does it excellently amen that's what the bible said the devil came to what to bless you to love you and to be your friend is that what the bible said what does bible say still destroy and destroy right and he does it awesome he does his duty so the devil does it when it's time to afflict you with afflictions oh yeah you know it we all go through you slap you with this affliction here you slum you with this one so you wish like oh lord i want to come to glory why don't i end this way why don't i end my life why don't you call me to call me home but the lord is blooding you amen glory hallelujah so let's read a rule chapter 4 9-26 let's see let's grab a couple of them let's read verse nine start with verse nine and boaz said unto the eldest nowadays the time ruth was going to get married to the wealthiest person in in the land not because of money but the man was a noble man with character amen ruth was wasn't a gold digger no she was a predestinated daughter of god amen she didn't go and grab boaz because boss was rich but she was had a character when they met he said you speak comforting ways unto my heart a man that you want to be with is a man that's be comfort that is a christ unto you amen the professor that when a woman is married and she wants to say the lord the best way to say the lord is do what to serve your husband and that man should be a noble godly person if you serve a husband who is an evil person he doesn't even appreciate what you are doing for him because he doesn't have the heart of appreciation he doesn't have compassion he doesn't have comfort but a godly man with christ on the inside he's a man that fears the lord that this lady is part of me is christ and i treat her as a treated daughter of god she's my wife but she's my sister she's a ghost apple and i will never do anything ever again say amen that is a man that would be a good husband to you so he said moreover the root rule the moabites see okay boys and what said unto the eldest and unto the people yeah witnesses this day that i bought all that was eliminated and all that was chileans and malones and of the hand of of the hand of naomi verse 10 and moreover ruth the muabites the wife of malone have i pitches to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place yeah witnesses this day and all the people that were at the gates and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into the into that house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and thou and do thou weatherly in ephrata and be famous in bethlehem and let thy house be that and let the house be like the house of fares whom tama bear unto judah of the sea with the lord shall give thee of this young woman so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when she went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bears son and the woman said unto noah me blessed be thou blessed be the lord which had not let thee with not which had not left thee this day without a kinsmen that his name may be famous in israel 15 and it shall be unto thee a restoration of of their life and nourisher of an old age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons has borne him verse 16 an army to the child and lay lay it in her bosom became a nurse unto it 17 and the woman her neighbors gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi and they call his name obed he is the father of jesse the father of david now these are the generations of fairies faris because hezron has run ram rambi cat amina dab jesse and jesse begat david and david begat who jesus christ amen look at the story how it started it started in brokenness it started in destruction just like the ego story you know the ego story how the ego trained the children the eaglets they live in the nest for some time and then there's a time for them to try them on solo flight because it's not going to feed them all their lives amen so what the ego does is it goes through a certain far distance and the velocity of the ego are forgotten they can move very swift and fast at a terrific velocity and the ego comes and hit the nest let's say this is the nest come with that speed and hit the nest and all the nest is broken and however how many children are in four or five whatever now they begin to scream they are forced because the next is not there to hold them they are forced to spread spread their wings and fly and that's where they go through that what pain of growth amen there's a song that goes like that i think you can sing it better life is so easy when you're up on the mountain you've got a peace of mind when life's at his best but when things change and you are down in the valley there don't you lose faith for you never alone god in the good time is the god in the bar time god of the day god of the days to god in the night god in the night god on the mountain is the god in the valley god of the day is the god in the night amen so in that time you might think that the devil you know the devil no is the lord amen is god of light and darkness isaiah is his seven somewhere five he said i bring light i bring war i the lord do all these things the devil is just the instrument in the hand of the lord and you cut the revelation that is not the devil is the lord allowing the devil to do it you have overcome the problem because the lord is not destroying you but it's bringing attribute out of you just like the old time when they used to go they don't have the chemicals that we have to prefer they go they use a fire they use a blacksmith they use hammer and fire and hit it get all the the the the sand and the dead out of the goat so they could see their reflection in the gold the same thing god wanted to receive his reflection you and i so sometimes he let us go through the fire go to the water go to the storm to bring the attribute that you are not eaglet you can fly amen flap your wings of faith and fly your problem is not everlasting amen you've got that faith whatever you have in you whatever you need to overcome a situation whatever your blessing the blessing was planted in you before the foundation of the world it doesn't matter where it's going to come from it's from you amen that that's god blesses a brown glory hallelujah oh my oh my blessed be the lord amen the blessing is in you and as you believe and water it with faith it comes out of you it doesn't matter it could be 10 million you need for something you don't have you might not ever get a million that amount of money in your life even if you work from age 18 to age 60 or 65 but the lord can't put that money the money the faith in you that i need 65 million dollars the lord can put in somebody to bring a check to you but i might take 65 million dollars because it was the fitness in you and the lord move on somebody to bring it to you you might not be able to build a house but the lord can let somebody give you a house free of charge sunday this is for you amen the lord that's all this blessing is for you glory hallelujah there's nothing that is impossible to the lord i want to read one little quote here i think it's about glory hallelujah to the lord find our purpose on earth amen thanks be to god it's about um let's see walking in god giving path brings victory working in our god-given part brings victory 5707 20 a life story paragraph four and we and we each one has okay and we each one have a life that god has given us and we must leave it and to my humble opinion if you get this i think the most best life in the world no matter whether it's up or down if you find gas path and walk in it where god has ordained for us to walk if you always we find victory no matter no matter what and i'll go over again and we each one have a life that god has given has given us and we must live it not the life somebody give it to you not the life your your friend handed over to you not the life your boyfriend hand over to you or your girlfriend not the life that government give it to you not allowed that gifts unless your society give it to you but the life of jesus christ for you amen the life of jesus christ said it's it doesn't matter it could be up it could be down but leave that life in other words don't worry about the earthly you're human whether you have money would i have the best job whether you live in a mansion or living a little hood it doesn't matter what matters is what live the life the lord has given to you and when you live that life god has redeemed for you no matter what we always we find victory amen and that's what bring blessing in your life when you walk in victorious in christ amen and you have to find the purpose for your life it doesn't matter whether you're a child you're an adult it's not truly to find god's giving peoples there was a man who never saved the lord until he was 72 he lived all kind of life and at that age he still had a young child to raise and then he found the lord thankfully and the man said that i never saved the lord until i'm already old so he stopped in that church it was a young lady that used to clean the church so he stopped the young ladies that you and i was supposed to do this work this work is mine and he took it upon himself to clean the church he literally bought the young ladies from cleaning the church he will go early morning clean the arranged chairs and clean the place because he said i didn't find the lord early and i don't know how much longer i have to leave but the little time that i have i want to say the lord and so it doesn't matter when you find your purpose fulfill it amen if you find it when you are young live by the jew fulfill it if you find when you are as old as amin methuselah fulfill it amen even if you have two days on earth fulfill it that was a thief at the cross he didn't find his purpose early but on the cross he found his purpose he saw a dying lamp the lord jesus christ and he saw this he saw that this man has got eternal life and there was a face in his heart all along even in the midst of being a criminal being a thief being a robber being a gangster being whatever he was there was something calling out for something but he didn't find it early in life but right on the cross when he had just about maybe a few minutes hour to pass on slip on to to the other side he said lord remember me when you get to glory and the lord said that today you'll be with me in glory amen if you can find your purpose today you have to pray you have to fast you have to consecrate yourself to the lord and the lord will show you what your purpose is amen your purpose is tied to certain things in your life and i'll give a little example when i was a kid i used to get sick sometimes guess what my mom didn't know what to do with me but when i grew up when i found this message i mean the sickness left me later on when i became a teenager and i found this message i said oh thank god so there's a way that can heal me without even taking medicine glory hallelujah i cling to it just like that i wouldn't even like medicine when i was sick there was one time my mom had to call i used to i was a young preacher young pastor called my deacon that he go talk to he's sick he doesn't like to take medicine you know my mother's heart as a mother my mother you told me when we were younger when we were pregnant you just pray over water and drink and it worked for you do you know what i have i have the almighty god so when i'm sick i need my bible and a message book that's it it doesn't matter how the sickness the lord will heal me and when i was thinking for the holy ghost but the lord tied something to my life i used to take breakfast like a normal person everybody take breakfast but there was some sometime in my life that deserve left me don't worry all is well blessed be the name of the lord amen it's just a computer the word of the lord is more important so don't worry about computer the word will continue amen so i begin to pray and seeking for the holy ghost and the lord did it intentionally i was praying and said when will i ever get the holy ghost was it for me or it's not for me i've been praying and fasting and my pastor was the strictest of the streets it's about rapture the holy ghost eternal life you don't mess with him so so when you prayed and you think oh like i'm anointed you go to church and you fire message do you have the holy ghost i don't care whether you are my wife or you are my whatever when the rapture comes it's your holy ghost in you it's not my holy ghost and if you don't have the holy ghost the catholic church will come and find you and you know what will happen to you so lord when will i get the holy ghost so for a span of like a year one day the lord showed me a vision and i saw the lord jesus christ himself in a in a vision in a night vision and the lord begged me to come up higher he didn't come to the earth and i went all the way but i didn't get to where he was like three times he just beckoned me with his hands say lord i don't have it and i prayed and fasted all the more and there's another time i had the same dream and i was just caught up where he was say glory hallelujah and she became part of my life breakfast was sleep of my life maybe a year i might take breakfast let's say three times maybe 10 times it's just not part of me if i take breakfast it messes me it messes me up one time i was going to preach in mexico and the family they wanted to you know find out what you eat and get you the best breakfast to make you comfortable so they asked me brother what do you what what should we prepare for amen so brother what do you want for breakfast i said well i don't really eat breakfast i'm not a breakfast person but if you want to make me want warm water and they put a live just lemon or lime in it is it what like you mean like tea would you make tea or coffee i said no no just warm water and a lemon or lime in it that's it and they laugh and laugh and say brother is that your breakfast as if you want to make me when that's my breakfast and i came to find out that the lord buys grace a little grace to pray for the sick so it makes me more sensitive when i don't have nothing here and i can go to four six so now when i'm not working i'm not schooling at my home i can just like go to eight o'clock and i have to just push myself to eat something break it up when you find your purpose on earth and the lord has done very tremendous tremendous things through the little ministry the lord has done a lot of things i'm not here to give testimony today just to show you when you find your purpose in life so that people i never know they call me brother pray for us from some country i've never even been there and i pray and they will send me a report i said how did you get to know oh i know this person and this person and this person we found the lord my son is healed the one sister she's a believer she asked from mexico say pray for a little girl a friend of mine her daughter is sick and uh is is dangerous so pray for her it's between life and death i pray when to pray and i forgot about it she sent me a message in bold letters patricia well i forgot the name the girl patricia something is healed i said praise be to the lord so you find the purpose
