[46:15] card when she was here she had me a
[46:17] start coming over there in Ministry
[46:18] where she was living near Pinnacle palms
[46:21] and the Lord called her home and and we
[46:23] were still going for a number of years
[46:27] came to kind of shut things down so we
[46:29] began to pray and ask God where is the
[46:31] next door
[46:32] [Music]
[46:35] to force Ministry to those in our
[46:37] community and the Lord opened up the
[46:39] door for us to have this pantry and so I
[46:43] have to say this there's multiple ways
[46:45] that this this Pantry
[46:48] serves uh one I'll tell you the system I
[46:52] always had my heart
[46:55] go to some of the parks where all these
[46:59] people should take food from school

[47:23] when we first got the picture that we
[47:25] would do we had these little cars with
[47:28] little inspirational messages that we
[47:30] stick in in the boxes all that was
[47:33] coming from sister alone
[47:35] that was that's ugly the street she had
[47:38] the heart to want to witness the people
[47:40] and she designed this little card so I'm
[47:42] gonna go ahead and place an order I'm
[47:45] gonna place an order for some more cars
[47:46] I'm a leader for next year amen because
[47:48] we wanna we wanna just keep that going

[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:06:07] foreign
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:34] Jesus Christ
[1:06:38] each
[1:06:40] it's been a long time since I was here
[1:06:42] right it feels like a long time
[1:06:47] you can turn to Genesis 47 while I talk
[1:06:52] it's Genesis chapter 47.
[1:06:55] um
[1:06:56] I I usually try not to say too many
[1:07:00] things before I preach but I need to say
[1:07:01] at least two things
[1:07:04] first off is um
[1:07:06] I bring greetings from my church and
[1:07:09] brother Nathan and everybody over there
[1:07:11] says hello
[1:07:14] and everything's going well over there
[1:07:16] it's good to see that the spirit's still
[1:07:18] with us over here too we're all part of
[1:07:20] the same body
[1:07:22] that's right
[1:07:22] um
[1:07:23] and the second thing is uh recently I'm
[1:07:27] sure a lot of you know my mother passed
[1:07:29] away and
[1:07:31] uh we went to the funeral in Kenya and
[1:07:33] it was a difficult time but it was great
[1:07:37] to see how the children of God pulled
[1:07:39] together
[1:07:39] and support of us and not only with
[1:07:43] prayers and you know thoughts but also
[1:07:45] some people contributed money to help us
[1:07:47] to travel and run back and forth I just
[1:07:49] wanted to say thank you because it meant
[1:07:52] a lot to me and also my wife and my
[1:07:54] family anybody who was texting us their
[1:07:57] their prayers and everything I was
[1:07:58] showing my siblings and their minds were
[1:08:00] blown away they didn't know how many
[1:08:02] people I knew over here I didn't know
[1:08:04] how many people love me like that so it
[1:08:06] was great to see that
[1:08:08] um
[1:08:09] but yeah those are the two things
[1:08:11] um can not only this church but just
[1:08:15] Believers all over the place in
[1:08:16] different countries were helping us so I
[1:08:18] just wanted to say thank you all right
[1:08:21] so we're going to Genesis 47 verse 13.
[1:08:28] um we're going to read up to verse 17
[1:08:30] then you can sit down
[1:08:32] um so actually to preface this it's
[1:08:34] actually right after the children of
[1:08:38] Israel that is Jacob's other Sons
[1:08:42] followed Joseph into Egypt so the
[1:08:45] Pharaoh had just settled them into the
[1:08:47] land of Egypt he gave him the best land
[1:08:49] that he had and he told them to watch
[1:08:50] over their livestock
[1:08:52] so um while this is going on with the
[1:08:55] Israelites there's something going on
[1:08:56] with the Egyptians which is what we're
[1:08:57] going to look at here
[1:08:59] that's verse 13.
[1:09:01] and there was no bread in all the land
[1:09:03] but the famine was very sore so that the
[1:09:06] land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan
[1:09:09] fainted by reason of the famine
[1:09:12] and Joseph gathered up all the money
[1:09:14] that was found in the land of Egypt and
[1:09:16] in the land of Canaan for the corn which
[1:09:18] they bought
[1:09:19] and Joseph brought the money into the
[1:09:21] fair's house
[1:09:23] and when money failed in the land of
[1:09:24] Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the
[1:09:27] Egyptians came unto Joseph and said give
[1:09:29] a spread for why should we die in thy
[1:09:31] presence for the money faileth
[1:09:34] and Joseph said give your cattle and I
[1:09:36] will give you for your cattle if money
[1:09:37] fail
[1:09:39] and they brought their cattle into
[1:09:40] Joseph and Joseph gave them bread in
[1:09:42] exchange for horses and for the flocks
[1:09:43] and for the cattle of the herds and for
[1:09:45] the asses and he fed them with bread for
[1:09:47] all their cattle for that year all right
[1:09:49] you may be seated
[1:09:51] thank you
[1:09:55] foreign
[1:10:07] in this scripture you see the Egyptians
[1:10:09] were actually put in a very tight
[1:10:11] position
[1:10:13] and they
[1:10:16] they were already housing the people of
[1:10:19] the people of God's promise you know the
[1:10:22] ones that God had called and called out
[1:10:24] and given them a promise that he would
[1:10:25] give them some land
[1:10:27] and they're housing these people and
[1:10:29] they're not on their land
[1:10:31] and
[1:10:36] and while they're housing them uh the
[1:10:39] Egyptians themselves are starting to
[1:10:41] starve
[1:10:42] and they come to this desperate
[1:10:44] situation
[1:10:46] and they start trying to feed their kids
[1:10:48] they're trying to feed themselves and
[1:10:51] while they're trying to do this they
[1:10:53] realize that they're the the money that
[1:10:55] they actually hold in their hands that
[1:10:56] they held at Value before it actually
[1:10:59] becomes no more value
[1:11:01] and they come to Joseph and to Pharaoh
[1:11:05] because they're the rulers and they say
[1:11:07] hey we will give you everything we have
[1:11:08] just to have food so they're willing
[1:11:11] they're at a position where they're
[1:11:12] lacking something in their lives and
[1:11:14] they're willing to give up something
[1:11:16] that is their own property just to get
[1:11:18] that thing
[1:11:19] and they they already determined what
[1:11:21] the value of that thing was by offering
[1:11:24] that up in the first place
[1:11:26] so they were really desperate in this
[1:11:28] situation so uh Joseph he's just doing
[1:11:31] his best to please the Pharaoh and he
[1:11:33] says all right give me the cattle I take
[1:11:35] it and you know uh and then you will
[1:11:39] have food I'll give you some of the food
[1:11:40] that we stored up if you go on it
[1:11:43] doesn't stop there it goes to Genesis 47
[1:11:45] still the same chapter verse 18. when
[1:11:48] the year when the year was ended they
[1:11:50] came unto him the second year and said
[1:11:52] unto him we will not hide it from my
[1:11:54] Lord how that our money is spent so this
[1:11:56] is one year later
[1:11:58] my Lord also half our herds of cattle
[1:12:01] keep in mind the children of Israel are
[1:12:03] now hurting the cattle because their job
[1:12:04] was to watch the livestock so the
[1:12:07] children of Israel now have all the
[1:12:08] cattle of all the Egyptians and they
[1:12:10] just got there
[1:12:11] and they're watching them
[1:12:13] you can understand how they became
[1:12:15] slaves later
[1:12:17] my Lord also hath our herds of cattle
[1:12:20] there is not all left in the sight of my
[1:12:23] Lord but our bodies and our lands
[1:12:25] wherefore shall we die before Thine Eyes
[1:12:28] both we in our land buy us in our land
[1:12:31] for bread and we in our land will be
[1:12:33] servants unto pharaoh and give a seed
[1:12:36] that we may live and not die that the
[1:12:38] land be made desolate
[1:12:40] and Joseph bought all the land Affairs
[1:12:43] Egypt for Pharaoh for the Egyptians sold
[1:12:45] every man his field because the famine
[1:12:47] prevailed over them so the land became
[1:12:49] Pharaoh see if you read in those verses
[1:12:52] you might miss the fact that they not
[1:12:53] only did they give up the land that was
[1:12:55] theirs they gave up their own bodies
[1:12:58] over time they actually gave everything
[1:13:00] they had even their right to just be
[1:13:03] alive see after a while Joseph actually
[1:13:06] starts telling the Egyptians hey you're
[1:13:07] gonna go live over there and you're
[1:13:09] gonna go live over there and they didn't
[1:13:10] have a choice because they'd sold their
[1:13:12] bodies for some food giving up their
[1:13:15] rights that they were supposed to have
[1:13:16] as Egyptians you would think as
[1:13:19] Egyptians that they're going to demand
[1:13:22] more rights from their Pharaoh but they
[1:13:23] are not instead they're letting the the
[1:13:26] Israelites live above them even though
[1:13:29] um they're the ones who were born
[1:13:30] Egyptians that's not actually where I
[1:13:33] was headed but you can see how they
[1:13:34] became slaves wow you see how
[1:13:36] Generations later you're just looking
[1:13:38] out there and you see wow these people
[1:13:40] are eating from the pharaoh's table for
[1:13:43] free watching our livestock and they're
[1:13:46] free they can come and go as they like
[1:13:48] but we're over here starving
[1:13:51] and giving up everything that we have
[1:13:53] just for our own rights that we have a
[1:13:55] right to wow
[1:13:57] if you go into Genesis 47 27. and Israel
[1:14:01] dwelt in the land of Egypt in the
[1:14:02] country of Goshen and they had
[1:14:03] possessions therein and grew and
[1:14:06] multiplied exceedingly so God is still
[1:14:08] blessing his children because he gave
[1:14:10] him that promise they are actually in
[1:14:12] the land of the Gentiles and God is
[1:14:15] continuing to bless them in that place
[1:14:16] he's actually taking something from the
[1:14:19] Gentiles to give to them because he gave
[1:14:21] them a promise that that's theirs see
[1:14:24] we're living in a time of all sorts of
[1:14:26] crises is going on it could be
[1:14:28] economical it could be spiritual it
[1:14:30] could be just a lack of morality but God
[1:14:32] will make sure you have an abundance in
[1:14:34] your life if you just cling to that
[1:14:36] promise that he gave you so right there
[1:14:39] it doesn't matter what situation you're
[1:14:41] in he's going to take care of you amen
[1:14:44] amen so right now uh that back then you
[1:14:47] can see how the children of Israel being
[1:14:49] treated as a nation
[1:14:50] and uh God gave them a promise as a
[1:14:52] nation but we are actually individuals
[1:14:54] and God deals with us deals with us that
[1:14:57] way so
[1:14:59] um brother Branham actually said that
[1:15:00] nowadays God is dealing with you in your
[1:15:03] spirit as an individual so he'll take
[1:15:05] one from one house one from one family
[1:15:08] take home and it doesn't matter who you
[1:15:10] were born to he's going to pick you out
[1:15:12] and he'll deal with you as an individual
[1:15:16] so uh Israel actually whenever uh Jesus
[1:15:20] came in the New Testament he was trying
[1:15:22] to speak of them on these things and
[1:15:23] they had no concept of that because they
[1:15:26] weren't looking at the world with
[1:15:27] spiritual eyes see the law that they
[1:15:29] were given by Moses was a physical law
[1:15:31] that they had to do with their hands and
[1:15:34] the promises they were given were as a
[1:15:36] nation so they could look around and
[1:15:38] they're looking for the promises from
[1:15:39] God with their eyes they're looking for
[1:15:41] a spiritual they're looking for sorry
[1:15:45] um economic wealth they're looking for
[1:15:48] things in their hands that God is
[1:15:49] blessing them with that they can hold
[1:15:51] and tangibly see with their eyes but
[1:15:53] they completely forgot that there's a
[1:15:55] spiritual thing inside of you that God
[1:15:58] can bless God can bless your spirit he
[1:16:00] can bless your soul he can give you so
[1:16:02] many different fruits of the spirit and
[1:16:04] things like that but they didn't
[1:16:06] understand that they didn't have that
[1:16:08] concept so when Jesus comes he's
[1:16:10] actually speaking to them in Matthew 21
[1:16:12] verse 43 it says therefore I say unto
[1:16:15] you the kingdom of God shall be taken
[1:16:17] from you and given to a nation bringing
[1:16:19] forth the fruits thereof
[1:16:21] so the kingdom of God was actually taken
[1:16:24] from the Israelites and given to someone
[1:16:26] else
[1:16:28] so
[1:16:29] if we continue in Peter uh first Peter 2
[1:16:33] 9
[1:16:34] this is after Jesus is already
[1:16:36] resurrected so Peter has this Revelation
[1:16:38] and he's speaking to us as as the as the
[1:16:43] Gentiles now and he's saying he
[1:16:45] understands that Jesus was talking about
[1:16:48] a turning point where the the kingdom of
[1:16:51] God was handing was getting handed over
[1:16:52] from the Israelites to us
[1:16:55] so he says but you are a chosen
[1:16:57] generation a royal priesthood and the
[1:17:00] part I want to underline here is a holy
[1:17:02] nation A peculiar people that you should
[1:17:04] show forth the Praises of him who have
[1:17:06] called you out of Darkness Into His
[1:17:08] Marvelous Light so a holy nation here
[1:17:11] it's not
[1:17:13] it's not something you can see keep in
[1:17:15] mind it's the we are Gentiles so we
[1:17:18] should look for things that we can't see
[1:17:19] and see what Jesus is talking about to
[1:17:22] see what the word's talking about I want
[1:17:24] to hear what he's speaking to me about
[1:17:26] as an individual so if he's calling me a
[1:17:28] holy nation it's not like in the concept
[1:17:31] of the a lot of people in the Middle
[1:17:33] East like Pakistan and India and you
[1:17:36] know Israel itself they still think of
[1:17:39] them as a nation and they think of their
[1:17:41] religion as a religion for the whole
[1:17:43] nation so they start waging what they
[1:17:45] call a holy war against each other you
[1:17:47] might have heard something or a
[1:17:48] religious War it's saying hey the
[1:17:50] Muslims need to live over there and the
[1:17:52] Jews are going to live over here or the
[1:17:54] Hindus are going to live over there and
[1:17:55] they're going to be in their country
[1:17:57] we're going to be over here that's not
[1:17:58] what God is talking about right here
[1:18:00] he's saying it's a holy nation in this
[1:18:03] holy nation like I said it's that
[1:18:04] Holiness that comes from Christ and it's
[1:18:06] inside of you that's the holy nation
[1:18:09] he's talking about so all those fruits
[1:18:11] of the spirit are his holiness inside of
[1:18:14] you his Holiness inside of us as his
[1:18:17] children right we we just have to take
[1:18:19] on his Holiness and allow it to affect
[1:18:22] our lives not only that but it also
[1:18:24] needs to affect those people around us
[1:18:25] see there are people
[1:18:28] like me who are immigrants does anybody
[1:18:30] here descended from them
[1:18:33] right now independence I mean everybody
[1:18:35] is right come on hands higher come on
[1:18:37] please I only see two okay well you see
[1:18:41] I I'm pretty sure there are more of us
[1:18:43] but all of us were not born in America
[1:18:46] and came from Americans the only people
[1:18:48] who were are technically I think Native
[1:18:50] Americans so everybody should have
[1:18:52] raised their hand right there whether
[1:18:54] you wanted to or not and you have to
[1:18:56] realize that your people that you're
[1:18:58] descended from came from another place
[1:19:00] out there this is not where you're
[1:19:03] supposed to be from and I'm not just
[1:19:05] saying that because we're all black I
[1:19:06] mean it's obvious I mean most of us are
[1:19:09] um but you know it's if you have to
[1:19:12] honestly see it on your face you look at
[1:19:14] you look a certain way
[1:19:16] anybody can tell like hey going back to
[1:19:19] the beginning of time you're not from
[1:19:20] here and the Bible tells us that we're
[1:19:23] all children of Abraham
[1:19:25] right you got to realize spiritually
[1:19:28] speaking you are from somewhere else so
[1:19:31] whenever people look at you different
[1:19:33] because you look different or act
[1:19:35] different it's not because oh I'm just
[1:19:37] from another country where my my
[1:19:39] descendants is not from another country
[1:19:40] they're going to look at you weird
[1:19:42] because we're Christians amen we come
[1:19:45] from our Heavenly fathers somewhere else
[1:19:47] we're born to look like we're from
[1:19:49] somewhere else see I was raised in a
[1:19:52] certain way
[1:19:53] whenever I was actually whenever my
[1:19:56] first memories are from being here in
[1:19:57] the United States my parents are Kenyan
[1:20:00] so
[1:20:01] um
[1:20:02] looking like I am you think I get along
[1:20:04] with black Americans but I don't
[1:20:07] know you know I'm probably one of the
[1:20:09] whitest black Americans I know I guess
[1:20:12] and I'm not just saying it for a joke
[1:20:14] it's a fact and growing up that's one of
[1:20:17] the first things I remember we're just
[1:20:19] weird and then we'd bring friends home
[1:20:21] and then they meet our appearances like
[1:20:22] why do they talk like that they're
[1:20:24] they're African I'm sorry and then after
[1:20:27] a while when I'm seven years old eight
[1:20:29] we go to the Kenya and we start living
[1:20:32] there and I start growing up and then
[1:20:33] it's like whoa you guys you are in
[1:20:36] Kenyan you sound weird because I sounded
[1:20:38] like this and I didn't know how to fake
[1:20:40] a Kenyan accent and I couldn't speak
[1:20:41] Swahili I didn't know any of those
[1:20:43] things and they're still looking at me
[1:20:45] like oh you're weird not just me my
[1:20:47] siblings too all of us were like that we
[1:20:49] couldn't get along with everybody
[1:20:50] anybody so we look different
[1:20:54] and then
[1:20:56] eventually I get older and I'm 19 years
[1:20:58] old I'm like wow I'm gonna go back to
[1:21:00] America everybody's gonna sound like me
[1:21:03] and I come over here and I had an
[1:21:05] interesting little weird Kenyan accent
[1:21:07] you guys never met me in those years but
[1:21:09] it was awkward and I was 19 years old
[1:21:11] and I still felt weird because the
[1:21:14] people I talked to they don't understand
[1:21:16] where I came from had grown up in Kenya
[1:21:18] and whenever I was here I I my parents
[1:21:22] were Kenyan right and I didn't
[1:21:24] understand the same things they
[1:21:25] understood and then here now that I've
[1:21:27] been here long enough I go back to Kenya
[1:21:29] and asked Becca I wasn't on point last
[1:21:32] week the last couple weeks I didn't
[1:21:34] understand everything I would go back
[1:21:36] home and complain to her like oh my
[1:21:37] goodness these Kenyans are weird because
[1:21:40] that's just not what I'm like and I
[1:21:42] don't know why I'm like this I know that
[1:21:45] I have somebody I can lean to because
[1:21:47] because those people who I met they were
[1:21:51] telling me hey you're not you're not
[1:21:52] black American enough or you're not
[1:21:55] American enough or when I go over there
[1:21:57] you're not Kenyan enough and then I come
[1:21:58] back over here I'm too American for them
[1:22:01] over there and it's back and forth and
[1:22:02] it's never enough for people but if you
[1:22:05] realize you go to the word and you
[1:22:06] actually come to God
[1:22:08] you're enough for him no matter where
[1:22:10] you're from you don't it doesn't matter
[1:22:12] what your history is it doesn't matter
[1:22:14] what sins you committed in the past or
[1:22:16] what your what your family did in the
[1:22:18] past you are from somewhere
[1:22:20] and you realize your heavenly kingdom is
[1:22:23] where you're from right now you can
[1:22:25] claim that right now you have
[1:22:27] representation because Christ's spirit
[1:22:29] is inside of you you recognize that that
[1:22:31] is your new history you open the Bible
[1:22:34] and you see what Moses and did what
[1:22:36] Moses did and what Elijah did that's
[1:22:38] your history those are your people right
[1:22:41] there anybody who accepts the word of
[1:22:43] God is your people I'm surrounded by my
[1:22:45] brothers and sisters they might not
[1:22:47] understand all my National History but
[1:22:50] they understand that there's a seed
[1:22:51] inside of me that's inside of them too
[1:22:53] and we're related whether we look like
[1:22:56] it or not it doesn't matter what people
[1:22:58] tell me finally the word of God tells me
[1:23:00] that I'm enough exactly how I've come to
[1:23:03] him I'm enough exactly the way I am not
[1:23:06] only that but he's gonna make me better
[1:23:08] he's gonna make me more like him amen
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:18] now brother Branham actually felt the
[1:23:20] same thing and I had some quotes along
[1:23:21] those lines
[1:23:23] um 1964 the unveiling of God
[1:23:26] says now notice
[1:23:27] how many American citizens is here raise
[1:23:30] up your hands
[1:23:31] I tried that a minute ago it didn't work
[1:23:32] all right you are an American citizen
[1:23:36] then you are identified with this nation
[1:23:38] whatever this nation is you must be
[1:23:42] is that right you are all of her glory
[1:23:44] and you are all of her shame you're
[1:23:46] identified with her you are an American
[1:23:49] so you take on America
[1:23:52] when I was I was with George Washington
[1:23:54] when he crossed the Delaware I'm
[1:23:56] identified with him that's right I was
[1:23:58] with Abraham Lincoln at the Gettysburg
[1:24:00] Address I was standing there I was with
[1:24:02] the soldiers in Guam you boys when you
[1:24:04] hosted the flag I was there I'm an
[1:24:06] American I'm identified with it now to
[1:24:09] be an American whatever her shame is in
[1:24:11] the red in the Revolutionary I bear it
[1:24:14] because I'm an American right there he's
[1:24:16] talking about Americans having shame in
[1:24:18] their history see a lot of us were born
[1:24:21] here you know
[1:24:22] and you can't help the fact that this is
[1:24:25] where you're born you can't help the
[1:24:27] fact that that is your history now he's
[1:24:29] talking about Americans having shame
[1:24:31] because America does have a shameful
[1:24:33] history there are a lot of things back
[1:24:35] there that they should not have done and
[1:24:37] things that they should have done they
[1:24:40] started well as a Godly country and then
[1:24:42] they changed a whole bunch of things in
[1:24:43] a different way so he's talking about
[1:24:45] there being shame in there but if you
[1:24:47] realize if you actually if you're really
[1:24:49] centered in the word and you recognize
[1:24:51] that's your new history then his shame
[1:24:54] is my shame
[1:24:56] you got to realize the reproach for his
[1:24:59] name comes on me
[1:25:01] and the shame that the shame that
[1:25:02] Americans go through is a different kind
[1:25:04] of Shame entirely they just did
[1:25:05] something wrong in their history God
[1:25:07] never did anything wrong but if I stand
[1:25:09] for his word well enough eventually
[1:25:11] reproach will come on me that's that
[1:25:14] chain that's gonna hit you
[1:25:19] and as a Christian I'm identified with
[1:25:21] him amen I was with Noah when he went in
[1:25:23] the ark I was with Moses when he came
[1:25:25] out of Egypt I was with Elijah and Mark
[1:25:27] Caldwell glory to God I was with him
[1:25:31] when he did that I was truly with him I
[1:25:32] identified myself in his death there on
[1:25:35] Calvary when I died to the things of the
[1:25:37] world you see that that death he's
[1:25:39] talking about Christ does it so I do it
[1:25:42] it's in Christ's spirit so it's in my
[1:25:45] spirit I have to die out to what my
[1:25:48] history is I have to die out to what my
[1:25:49] nationality is what my race or whatever
[1:25:52] Creed is that I was raised under I have
[1:25:54] to die out to that and then I take on
[1:25:56] his Spirit praise God
[1:26:00] I was identified with him I was
[1:26:02] identified with him on Easter morning
[1:26:04] when he rose from the dead I was
[1:26:05] identified with him on the day of
[1:26:07] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down
[1:26:09] like a rushing Mighty Wind I was
[1:26:11] identified with him
[1:26:13] all that he was I am all that I am he
[1:26:17] was
[1:26:18] like amen being dead in him we are
[1:26:20] identified with him what he is I am amen
[1:26:23] what this nation is I am I'm proud to be
[1:26:26] that I'm ready to Bear her shame I'm
[1:26:28] ready to Bear her approach to be
[1:26:29] American that's right and I'm double
[1:26:31] that to Jesus Christ amen can we all say
[1:26:34] the same thing this morning whatever he
[1:26:36] has for me and whatever people do to me
[1:26:37] for serving him I'm just gonna take it
[1:26:39] that's okay because I'm in the King's
[1:26:41] Highway right there all that he ever was
[1:26:44] I am I like to be identified with him
[1:26:49] also what was the Holy Ghost given for
[1:26:50] 1959 but you got the nature of the place
[1:26:53] you're from
[1:26:55] see he's not denying that we have a
[1:26:57] nature of where we're from Americans act
[1:27:00] a certain way
[1:27:01] you know Europeans act a certain way you
[1:27:05] know it doesn't even have to go that far
[1:27:07] Floridians act a certain way from other
[1:27:09] people people from Georgia act a
[1:27:11] different way
[1:27:12] people in different cities act a
[1:27:14] different way from somebody else in the
[1:27:16] city next door and you can't change that
[1:27:18] people from different families act a
[1:27:21] different way sometimes you look at a
[1:27:22] family like I don't know how you guys
[1:27:24] function you know and it it's just like
[1:27:27] that and you can't change that that's
[1:27:29] their nature and their kids are going to
[1:27:32] have the same thing I think there's this
[1:27:34] story uh brother Branham told about
[1:27:36] talking about a German boy and German
[1:27:37] parents it's in there you can't get it
[1:27:41] out God can see he can he can sand off
[1:27:44] those rough edges right there and he can
[1:27:47] take care of those things and replace it
[1:27:49] with things that that are his attributes
[1:27:51] he can give you his attributes
[1:27:55] that's what I'm trying to say a Roman
[1:27:57] comes over here he scratches his head
[1:27:58] and a German comes over here American
[1:28:01] goes over there why you got the spirits
[1:28:03] of them countries you're from and that's
[1:28:04] what makes it so much different to the
[1:28:06] world you're from above you are born
[1:28:09] you're a citizen of another kingdom you
[1:28:12] believe it that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:13] is to make you a citizen of another
[1:28:15] kingdom then if you are a citizen of the
[1:28:18] kingdom of God how does it make you act
[1:28:20] like God does in his kingdom
[1:28:23] see it's God's kingdom he's acting in a
[1:28:27] certain way because it's his kingdom you
[1:28:29] ever hear something that should give you
[1:28:30] a pep in your step yeah
[1:28:32] it's my kingdom all that's around me
[1:28:35] it's my father's and it's coming to me
[1:28:37] so that should give me a little pep in
[1:28:40] my step not to be proud but to realize
[1:28:43] where you're standing and where you're
[1:28:44] walking you're going to inherit
[1:28:46] everything around you God's Gonna burn
[1:28:48] away this whole world system and he's
[1:28:50] gonna leave what is his and you're going
[1:28:53] to be able to inherit that that's all
[1:28:55] yours whatever you see around you
[1:28:57] now what does God do in his kingdom it's
[1:28:59] Holiness righteousness
[1:29:01] purity of thought purity of mind power
[1:29:03] and love going to the Lost Healing The
[1:29:05] Sick performing Miracles doing great
[1:29:07] things then to the world you look crazy
[1:29:10] and they say them guys are off their
[1:29:12] head
[1:29:13] but you're a citizen of the Kingdom
[1:29:17] uh Israel in the church 1953 he says God
[1:29:21] don't respect me because I'm American he
[1:29:22] doesn't respect a German because he's
[1:29:24] German or a Poland because he's from
[1:29:25] Poland
[1:29:26] he doesn't respect the African because
[1:29:28] he's from Africa God's not interested in
[1:29:30] Africa neither is he interested in
[1:29:32] Germany nor neither is he interested in
[1:29:34] the United States God's interested in
[1:29:37] one Kingdom and that's the kingdom and
[1:29:39] that's a
[1:29:41] kingdom of God and man from All Nations
[1:29:43] come into it and they're born into it
[1:29:46] through the Seed of Abraham which was
[1:29:47] Jesus Christ in their heirs according to
[1:29:49] the promise every nation under the
[1:29:51] heaven is dominated by Satan you got to
[1:29:54] realize not only every nation but any
[1:29:57] culture that you're from dominated by
[1:30:00] Satan it didn't come from God so it has
[1:30:02] to come from somewhere
[1:30:04] any family that you're from and family
[1:30:07] attributes that's dominated by Satan see
[1:30:11] there are good things that come from our
[1:30:12] cultures there are excellent things good
[1:30:15] values great things that are taught from
[1:30:16] most cultures you'll find good qualities
[1:30:19] but if they don't line up with God's
[1:30:21] word are they good where'd they come
[1:30:23] from
[1:30:24] that means they came from down there
[1:30:30] every nation under the heaven is
[1:30:32] dominated by Satan that includes any
[1:30:35] political system dominated by Satan some
[1:30:38] people seem to think that whoever they
[1:30:40] vote for is gonna save them from
[1:30:42] something that they made up in their
[1:30:44] mind
[1:30:45] you got to realize anything that's on
[1:30:47] this Earth that can harm you
[1:30:49] God will take you through
[1:30:51] there is nobody you can vote for
[1:30:54] that will save you
[1:30:56] there's nobody that gets in the office
[1:30:58] that God doesn't put there in the first
[1:31:00] place I'm not saying don't vote I mean
[1:31:03] by all means I don't but I don't think
[1:31:06] it's that Christians shouldn't vote I'm
[1:31:07] just saying what's the point
[1:31:11] but every nation under the heaven is
[1:31:15] dominated by Satan like what is there
[1:31:18] that I'm gonna do with my little vote
[1:31:20] I'm just gonna pray that's how I cast my
[1:31:23] vote
[1:31:24] you know uh even if you see that the
[1:31:27] word that the land you're in is
[1:31:28] dominated by Satan you know uh the
[1:31:30] Hebrews
[1:31:31] um
[1:31:33] I think it was probably Daniel I can't
[1:31:36] remember which no Jeremiah I remember it
[1:31:38] was Jeremiah Jeremiah he prophesied
[1:31:41] about Israel being taken captive by
[1:31:44] Babylon a long time before it happened
[1:31:46] and his prophecies were very people call
[1:31:49] him the weeping prophet because here
[1:31:51] we've got these prophecies and they'd go
[1:31:54] against what anybody who had to hear
[1:31:55] he'd talk about the Doom of Israel and
[1:31:57] how they become captives and nobody
[1:32:00] wanted to hear that but one thing he
[1:32:02] said was whenever your captors take you
[1:32:05] to Babylon
[1:32:07] because he knew it was going to happen
[1:32:09] he said when they take you pray for your
[1:32:12] rulers we're talking about
[1:32:14] Nebuchadnezzar he came in and crushed
[1:32:17] Israel he crushed them he killed all of
[1:32:20] their princes in front of their families
[1:32:22] killed their families in front of them
[1:32:24] completely burned down took down
[1:32:26] sections of Israel and when they got
[1:32:28] taken captive he says pray for him
[1:32:32] I believe we should pray for our leaders
[1:32:35] I pray for I pray I mean I don't do it
[1:32:38] often enough but I believe we should I
[1:32:40] believe we should pray for our leaders
[1:32:41] because even though we're here in
[1:32:43] Babylon right now
[1:32:44] God would like to bless us where we are
[1:32:47] not only that but he can bless your
[1:32:49] nation and bless you by proxy if you
[1:32:52] just pray for your leadership I still
[1:32:55] don't vote though
[1:32:56] I don't care
[1:33:00] 1959 what was the Holy Ghost given for
[1:33:03] you're an alien and you're a stranger
[1:33:05] you do strange things different what you
[1:33:07] used to do you don't act like you used
[1:33:10] to the people the Holy Ghost when it
[1:33:12] comes upon you and you become filled
[1:33:13] with the Holy Ghost you ignore the
[1:33:15] things of the world you ignore the
[1:33:16] things that would beset you
[1:33:18] you ignore it then you become an odd
[1:33:20] looking odd acting creature the ugly
[1:33:23] ducking duckling to them the little
[1:33:24] Eagle that was hatched under the Hen's
[1:33:26] Nest that I preached and when the eagle
[1:33:28] Stars its nest you're a funny looking
[1:33:30] creature to them
[1:33:34] if God is the God of War oh this is a
[1:33:36] Havana if God is a god of one God he's
[1:33:39] God of all all his creation yes sir and
[1:33:41] so she looked you know
[1:33:43] race and tribe and color had nothing to
[1:33:45] do with it God made them all God of one
[1:33:48] man made all nations out of Adam there
[1:33:50] we find out that the color of the skin
[1:33:52] in their tradition and church membership
[1:33:54] had nothing to do with it it's an honest
[1:33:56] heart he's looking for so actually I
[1:33:59] want to turn the corner right here
[1:34:01] I think we belong to a nation and
[1:34:04] actually worldwide it's an interesting
[1:34:07] thing that everybody's talking about
[1:34:10] um
[1:34:12] what their rights are that's a big
[1:34:14] political issue you know and they just
[1:34:17] want to fight over who I want a
[1:34:19] transgender rights or gay rights or you
[1:34:21] know second amendment rights or First
[1:34:23] Amendment rights Free Speech right to
[1:34:25] carry weapons everybody wants to talk
[1:34:27] about that in the news and you know it
[1:34:31] only takes you looking in the word to
[1:34:32] realize where that's coming from first
[1:34:34] of all it's their father the devil yes
[1:34:38] um it's a spirit of the age
[1:34:40] but second I actually noticed in the uh
[1:34:42] churches book uh chapter nine when he's
[1:34:45] talking about laodicea
[1:34:46] uh it's describing the city first it
[1:34:49] says notice the name I'm pretty sure you
[1:34:51] guys have gone over this a few times
[1:34:52] because brother Jack's a great teacher I
[1:34:54] think you've gone over that church age
[1:34:56] book a few times it says notice the name
[1:34:59] laodicea the people's rights or Justice
[1:35:02] of the peoples was there ever an age
[1:35:05] like the 20th century Church age or 21st
[1:35:08] now that we're here that has seen all
[1:35:10] nations rising up and demanding equality
[1:35:12] socially and financially this is the age
[1:35:15] of the Communists where all men are
[1:35:17] supposedly equal though it is only so in
[1:35:20] theory this is the age of political
[1:35:22] parties who call themselves Christian
[1:35:24] democrats Christian socialists Christian
[1:35:26] Commonwealth Federation Etc
[1:35:28] according to our liberal theologians
[1:35:30] Jesus was a socialist and and the early
[1:35:33] church under the guidance of the spirit
[1:35:35] practiced socialism and thus we ought to
[1:35:37] do so today
[1:35:39] when the Ancients called laodicea the
[1:35:41] Metropolis it was looking forward to the
[1:35:43] One World Government that we are now
[1:35:44] setting up and as we think of that City
[1:35:47] being the location of a great church
[1:35:48] Council we see foreshadow The ecumenical
[1:35:50] move taking place today wherein very
[1:35:53] soon we will see all the so-called
[1:35:56] Christians come together
[1:35:58] indeed the church and state religion and
[1:36:01] politics are coming together the tares
[1:36:03] are being bound the wheat will soon be
[1:36:05] ready for the Garner
[1:36:08] so I started looking at that and I was
[1:36:11] actually thinking
[1:36:13] um
[1:36:14] they uh
[1:36:16] every country has a list of Rights of
[1:36:18] its citizens and according to the modern
[1:36:21] idea of what a country is and how it
[1:36:23] should work uh the Egyptians back there
[1:36:26] were actually giving up their rights
[1:36:28] that they should just have they should
[1:36:29] have had rights to their land right to
[1:36:31] their own property they should have had
[1:36:33] the right not to starve because any
[1:36:34] leader nowadays should be keeping their
[1:36:37] feet people from dying from starvation
[1:36:39] you know you would think even the right
[1:36:42] to their lives
[1:36:44] and I just started thinking you know
[1:36:46] every nation has rights like that and
[1:36:48] I've already talked to you about how
[1:36:50] we're a spiritual nation of Christians
[1:36:51] but I started looking in the word and
[1:36:54] trying to find the rights of Christians
[1:36:57] and how that works uh
[1:37:01] the first one I had was right to pray
[1:37:03] for the sick
[1:37:06] and this is interesting because at first
[1:37:09] growing up I used to think you know you
[1:37:11] go to church and at the end of the
[1:37:12] service somebody walks up here and gets
[1:37:14] prayed for they lay hands on her you
[1:37:16] know everybody makes a sad face and pray
[1:37:18] for her and then they go or him and I
[1:37:20] was just like wait a second you know
[1:37:22] when I actually started thinking about
[1:37:24] this I was like I didn't
[1:37:25] you don't have to walk up here first off
[1:37:28] and it doesn't have to be a minister to
[1:37:30] lay hands on that although that is part
[1:37:32] of ministry
[1:37:33] it doesn't have to be a minister to do
[1:37:35] that see us as Christians sitting in the
[1:37:37] Pew even before I got ordained to preach
[1:37:40] I could have prayed for anybody not only
[1:37:42] that but I didn't have to touch them
[1:37:45] I could have just prayed for my house I
[1:37:48] could have prayed lying down God never
[1:37:50] said you couldn't pray lying down
[1:37:51] sometimes I'm in bed and I pray
[1:37:53] sometimes I'm driving and I pray you
[1:37:56] know you don't have to close your eyes
[1:37:57] you know just talk to him that's what he
[1:38:00] wants that's what he did this for you
[1:38:02] know
[1:38:03] so the first one right to pray for the
[1:38:06] sick make sure to take your rights first
[1:38:08] one uh the trial 1964 it says every
[1:38:11] person that believes has a right to lay
[1:38:13] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:38:17] next one healing what sicknesses Divine
[1:38:20] healings in reach of every person
[1:38:23] and every person that is a Christian has
[1:38:25] a right to pray for the sick Divine
[1:38:27] Healing it doesn't have to be some great
[1:38:30] thing that somebody has that gift for
[1:38:32] you to pray for them I think probably
[1:38:34] the majority of healings that happen in
[1:38:36] church is just because people were
[1:38:37] praying for them it wasn't because some
[1:38:40] Divine healer came and prayed it's like
[1:38:41] oh I have the gift of praying for this
[1:38:42] thing otherwise you don't get don't get
[1:38:44] healed I don't believe that I really
[1:38:46] don't believe that
[1:38:50] the authority of the word 1953 and not
[1:38:52] only the pastor but every member of the
[1:38:54] church has a right to pray for the sick
[1:38:56] the gift of healing works in the church
[1:38:58] the entire church not only in the pastor
[1:39:00] all right much as your pastor may have
[1:39:03] the gift of healing and you may want to
[1:39:05] go to him to have your him lay your
[1:39:08] hands on lay his hands on you and do all
[1:39:10] that stuff it's okay it's okay if you
[1:39:13] call somebody up because they have the
[1:39:14] gift because God put that gift in the
[1:39:16] church in the first place
[1:39:18] but it's not only on that person
[1:39:23] each one of you at the future home each
[1:39:25] one of you has the right to heal the
[1:39:27] sick lay your hands upon the sick every
[1:39:29] one of you has the right to baptize
[1:39:32] that's another one right in there you
[1:39:34] just slid it in there right to be healed
[1:39:36] that's the next one
[1:39:39] as I was with Moses every called child
[1:39:41] of God every Minister that's ordained of
[1:39:43] God has a right for a healing campaign
[1:39:45] if he wants it
[1:39:47] go on brother I don't blame you
[1:39:50] I was looking and seeing little little
[1:39:52] groups here in there that say well
[1:39:54] there's too many of them no there's not
[1:39:55] every one of them is having success in
[1:39:57] some way
[1:39:58] you see that actually he he does talk
[1:40:01] about I think his brother Tommy Osborne
[1:40:03] who did not have a gift of healing and
[1:40:05] he came to brother Brandon he was like
[1:40:07] asking what he should do for his
[1:40:08] ministry and eventually Tommy Osborne
[1:40:11] what he does is he just sets the
[1:40:13] atmosphere in the congregation where
[1:40:15] he's preaching and then he goes over the
[1:40:18] scriptures and by the end of that people
[1:40:21] just started getting healed amen he
[1:40:23] didn't operate the way brother Branham
[1:40:25] did he recognized he didn't have that
[1:40:27] gift of healing but he did have the gift
[1:40:28] of ministering he could preach and
[1:40:30] apparently he could teach because they
[1:40:32] learned that their healing was there in
[1:40:34] the word
[1:40:35] next slide and every person can be
[1:40:38] healed glory to God for it that's right
[1:40:40] everyone it's a good thing
[1:40:44] another one Psalm 103 2-3 bless the Lord
[1:40:47] O my soul and forget not all his
[1:40:50] benefits who forgiveth all thine
[1:40:52] iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
[1:40:54] see there's nothing that's not captured
[1:40:57] up in there all your all your injuries
[1:40:59] he will also heal there's nothing
[1:41:01] that'll hurt nothing that'll get you
[1:41:03] that the devil can throw at you that's a
[1:41:05] right right there to your healing amen
[1:41:07] Faith 1953 you've seen the old hymn God
[1:41:10] has promised it it's ours every man and
[1:41:13] woman here has a right right now to
[1:41:15] claim your healing amen I don't know who
[1:41:18] who brother Mike lesson sister Candace I
[1:41:21] think also
[1:41:23] she needs healing right now
[1:41:25] he could be listening to this right now
[1:41:27] we have the right we exercise the right
[1:41:29] right now to pray for her everybody who
[1:41:31] was in your seat praying for her
[1:41:33] exercised their rights it didn't take
[1:41:35] the person over here behind the mic
[1:41:36] brother Jack it didn't take him
[1:41:38] and she has the right to receive it if
[1:41:40] she'll just understand and believe it
[1:41:43] she has that right to receive that there
[1:41:46] are other people who are asking for
[1:41:47] things right now all right God will give
[1:41:50] you what he promised you it's not even
[1:41:52] that hard to comprehend it's super easy
[1:41:56] right to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:41:58] now I know a lot of people who don't
[1:42:00] have it they just sit there quietly
[1:42:03] but this is for you
[1:42:05] not only is it for you it's for it's for
[1:42:07] those people praying for others to
[1:42:09] receive the Holy Ghost is praying for
[1:42:11] your family who's out there lost in the
[1:42:13] world
[1:42:14] because you know I think it's uh Paul
[1:42:17] whenever he was talking to a Roman
[1:42:18] soldier he said something about uh if
[1:42:22] you believe you and your house will be
[1:42:24] saved you see that's promised right
[1:42:26] there it says you and your house there
[1:42:28] are a lot of us right now who are
[1:42:30] praying for people who are out in the
[1:42:32] world who are in your house
[1:42:34] parents praying for children children
[1:42:37] God forbid praying for parents it's like
[1:42:39] God help them God go after them
[1:42:42] and I said uh last time I preached this
[1:42:44] I said
[1:42:45] um
[1:42:46] I don't know who was talking and they
[1:42:48] said
[1:42:48] that prayer not might not be answered
[1:42:50] while you're alive as some parents are
[1:42:53] just praying for their kids and it's
[1:42:54] like oh no I'm gonna pass and who's
[1:42:56] gonna pray for them now it's like
[1:42:57] sometimes God will answer your prayer
[1:43:00] after you pass sometimes it'll take your
[1:43:02] passing to turn things around for them
[1:43:05] you know
[1:43:06] a lot of things change in my family when
[1:43:08] my mom passed because I'm a preacher and
[1:43:12] she was the most spiritual person in our
[1:43:13] house she got me beat ten times over she
[1:43:17] prayed for us so much her kids by name a
[1:43:20] year to the date before she passed my
[1:43:23] grandma passed she used to pray for all
[1:43:24] of her grandchildren by name she wasn't
[1:43:27] even a message believer she was a
[1:43:28] Seventh-Day Adventist and she prayed for
[1:43:30] each one of them
[1:43:32] that's that's something to live up to
[1:43:34] right there I don't even know how to
[1:43:36] follow that act
[1:43:39] but they believed in the promise right
[1:43:41] there
[1:43:47] all right right to receive the Holy
[1:43:49] Ghost so uh Believe In Style this 1951
[1:43:52] for every believer that'll break behind
[1:43:54] the curtain Yonder and enter into this
[1:43:56] priesthood has a right to eat of the
[1:43:58] original Mana that fell on the day of
[1:44:00] Pentecost a real old-fashioned Holy
[1:44:03] Ghost blessing Hallelujah all right also
[1:44:06] I am the resurrection and the life 1952.
[1:44:09] then today if God's still calling every
[1:44:12] man or woman that comes to the Fountain
[1:44:14] blood uh fountain filled with blood from
[1:44:17] drawn from Emmanuel's veins and becomes
[1:44:19] a priest or a child a born-again a born
[1:44:22] child of God in the kingdom of God has a
[1:44:24] right to the original baptism of the
[1:44:25] Holy Ghost not a mouthful but a whole
[1:44:28] soul full of the same power that fell on
[1:44:31] the day of Pentecost
[1:44:32] so I'm just going through these rights
[1:44:34] because
[1:44:36] a lot of people don't know their rights
[1:44:37] like I don't I don't know all the rights
[1:44:39] in the Bill of Rights I don't I only
[1:44:41] know the first two because everybody
[1:44:42] fights about them and
[1:44:45] when I went to Kenya actually I I grew
[1:44:49] up in the Kenyan school system
[1:44:51] and I went to Kenya and I was actually
[1:44:53] reading them uh a list of their rights
[1:44:56] Kenyan rights from the Kenyan
[1:44:58] Constitution because I had to look that
[1:44:59] up over there and
[1:45:01] they didn't even know that they didn't
[1:45:03] know their own rights as Kenyans and I
[1:45:06] realized that a lot of people come into
[1:45:08] Christianity and they don't recognize
[1:45:10] that they have rights you know being a
[1:45:13] child of God should give you rights
[1:45:15] disprofessing his name gives you rights
[1:45:17] doing that some things come after you
[1:45:20] get the Holy Ghost some things come
[1:45:21] after you get baptized just profess his
[1:45:23] name and start walking on the journey
[1:45:25] you know
[1:45:26] speak to the Rock 1953 brother every man
[1:45:30] or woman that comes into this Divine
[1:45:31] Holy Ghost priesthood has a right to get
[1:45:33] a genuine heart full of the original
[1:45:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on
[1:45:38] the day of Pentecost the same signs the
[1:45:40] same power the same demonstration same
[1:45:42] feeling same action not something that
[1:45:45] looks like it the original that's right
[1:45:47] Church eight book uh actually back in
[1:45:50] Ephesus what the church had at Pentecost
[1:45:52] is her inalienable right
[1:45:54] originally she had the pure word of God
[1:45:56] she had the power of the spirit
[1:45:58] manifested in diver signs and wonders
[1:46:00] and Gifts of the Holy Ghost so
[1:46:03] the church being an alien inalienable to
[1:46:06] those rights you gotta you gotta realize
[1:46:08] inalienable actually I had a definition
[1:46:10] of that it says unable to be taken away
[1:46:13] from or given away by the processor so
[1:46:16] you have it and whether you know it or
[1:46:18] not it's sticking with you and it's
[1:46:20] never going anywhere whether you know it
[1:46:22] or not and I love the example they have
[1:46:24] there freedom of religion the most
[1:46:26] inalienable right of all human rights
[1:46:28] the most inalienable
[1:46:31] beautiful
[1:46:33] the next one
[1:46:35] it's a right to choose a spouse
[1:46:40] the choosing of a bride 1965 there's
[1:46:43] another choice that we have in life
[1:46:44] that's a life's companion a young man or
[1:46:47] a young woman stepping out on life has
[1:46:49] been given a right to make a choice the
[1:46:51] young man chooses the young woman has a
[1:46:54] right to accept or reject it but it's
[1:46:56] still a choice on both sides
[1:46:59] both man and woman they have a right to
[1:47:01] Choice see I understand that you read
[1:47:04] that and you might think oh it's just
[1:47:05] people doing arranged marriages that's
[1:47:07] what but there's people who do that now
[1:47:10] in church
[1:47:11] who they may not say that it's arranged
[1:47:16] that's all right but they may narrow
[1:47:18] down the options significantly
[1:47:20] for who their child dates
[1:47:22] and that's not something you should do
[1:47:24] be on a certain point your child is 25
[1:47:26] 30 years old and you're like oh you
[1:47:29] can't date them what is that about
[1:47:32] and not only that but young people you
[1:47:34] should recognize you have a choice
[1:47:37] I'm not saying liberate yourself from
[1:47:39] your parents because your parents advice
[1:47:40] is a good thing but
[1:47:43] you have a choice it doesn't mean that
[1:47:45] you go out looking with the eyes of your
[1:47:48] parents on who they would date that's
[1:47:51] how people marry their parents basically
[1:47:53] you know you just find somebody who's
[1:47:55] exactly like your dad or exactly like
[1:47:57] your mom and you just go marry them
[1:47:58] because you looked with eyes of your
[1:48:00] parents look with eyes of you you know
[1:48:03] God Gave You spiritual eyes you should
[1:48:05] think and look exercise your right
[1:48:08] that's something you got to do exercise
[1:48:10] your right your parents aren't going to
[1:48:12] live with them
[1:48:13] in fact they're going to pass eventually
[1:48:15] and you're gonna be right there living
[1:48:18] with them
[1:48:19] you exercise your right poorly
[1:48:21] so
[1:48:25] that works for no matter what country
[1:48:27] you're from Brother Jack it doesn't
[1:48:29] matter
[1:48:30] right to approach the father
[1:48:33] that's to pray
[1:48:36] uh this is the right to pray right here
[1:48:40] Hebrews chapter 4 6 14-16 seeing then
[1:48:43] that we have a great high priest that
[1:48:44] has passed into the heavens Jesus the
[1:48:46] son of God let us hold fast our
[1:48:49] profession for we have not a high priest
[1:48:51] which cannot be touched with a feeling
[1:48:52] of our infirmities but was in all points
[1:48:54] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:48:56] let us therefore come bold me boldly
[1:48:59] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:49:00] obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
[1:49:03] time of need you can boldly come to the
[1:49:05] throne of grace
[1:49:08] why are toss people tossed about in 1956
[1:49:10] when Jesus died at Calvary he ripped the
[1:49:14] veil from top to bottom to give not only
[1:49:16] high priest but to everyone that comes
[1:49:19] approaching God has a right to the
[1:49:20] holiest of holies
[1:49:22] wait I probably skipped some a word
[1:49:24] there or something she has a right the
[1:49:27] lady there dying has a right they I
[1:49:29] could have cut out those last two
[1:49:31] sentences but
[1:49:33] I left them in there because it doesn't
[1:49:35] matter how bad your situation is you
[1:49:38] could be lying there dying and you have
[1:49:40] a right
[1:49:41] a right to pray the devil can't take
[1:49:44] that away from you he could lock you in
[1:49:46] prison and keep you from moving he could
[1:49:48] keep you in a solitary confinement
[1:49:51] spiritually or physically speaking
[1:49:54] keep you from talking to people
[1:49:56] trying to stop you from praying solitary
[1:49:59] confinement doesn't keep you from
[1:50:00] praying talk to God you could be mute
[1:50:03] and you can still talk to God he can
[1:50:05] hear your thoughts
[1:50:12] right to communion
[1:50:15] the communion 1957 we have an open
[1:50:17] communion for all for we believe that
[1:50:19] every believer has a right to the table
[1:50:21] of the Lord and to Fellowship around the
[1:50:24] good things of God with every believer
[1:50:27] regardless of creed color or whatever he
[1:50:29] may be or she that all have been made to
[1:50:32] drink of the self-same blessing Christ
[1:50:35] right to Salvation
[1:50:41] Jehovah Jireh 1955 he can't every Mortal
[1:50:45] being has a right and has a right to
[1:50:47] accept their salvation until they die
[1:50:49] and go beyond the blood
[1:50:51] they don't have to stand in judgment
[1:50:53] they're already judged the day you eat
[1:50:55] thereof that day you die but as long as
[1:50:57] you're here you got a right to the tree
[1:50:59] of life if you'll accept it
[1:51:03] amen
[1:51:05] I think
[1:51:06] foreign
[1:51:08] just a moment
[1:51:13] oh yeah this is on the same lines in
[1:51:15] John chapter 11. uh Caiaphas is uh
[1:51:21] is actually prophesying about Jesus
[1:51:24] because the spirit of God since he was a
[1:51:26] high priest that year he was prophesying
[1:51:28] because God was using him to speak to
[1:51:30] the people
[1:51:31] and uh it says in verse 49 and one of
[1:51:35] them named caiaph is being the high
[1:51:36] priest that same year said unto them ye
[1:51:38] know nothing at all nor consider that is
[1:51:40] it exp that it is expedient of for us
[1:51:43] that one man should die for the people
[1:51:45] and that the whole nation perished not
[1:51:48] you realize that's what gave you that
[1:51:50] right was Christ dying for us in the
[1:51:52] first place
[1:51:53] another one uh in slide 115 actually
[1:51:56] right to all Redemptive blessings
[1:52:00] the principles of Divine Healing now
[1:52:02] when then he put on Calvary those great
[1:52:05] things in every and here it is I hope
[1:52:08] you see it look every Christian believer
[1:52:10] has a right to any of those Redemptive
[1:52:13] blessings that Christ Jesus died for
[1:52:15] amen amen there you go but it's out of
[1:52:17] practice
[1:52:18] people's afraid to take God at his word
[1:52:21] do not be afraid God's under obligation
[1:52:23] to make it so
[1:52:25] see the only person you can fault for
[1:52:28] not exercising your rights is actually
[1:52:30] yourself
[1:52:31] because he gave you a book full of them
[1:52:33] and he he told you in his word through
[1:52:36] his Prophet repeatedly most of what I'm
[1:52:38] reading right here is just quotes like
[1:52:40] it's not just in the scripture it's
[1:52:42] actually quotes he's told you in
[1:52:44] multiple ways and he's telling you right
[1:52:46] now he's telling me if we don't exercise
[1:52:49] these rights hey exactly it's our own
[1:52:51] fault we're making life harder on
[1:52:53] ourselves not recognizing where we're
[1:52:55] from
[1:52:57] so actually I was looking at this and I
[1:53:00] was recognizing okay we're all Americans
[1:53:01] here and uh
[1:53:03] most of us are and
[1:53:06] um
[1:53:07] if you're in America you get you you you
[1:53:09] might have heard some American history
[1:53:12] and like I said they started as a
[1:53:14] Christian Nation and um
[1:53:17] they had a tyrant who was ruling them
[1:53:19] and I don't remember what his name like
[1:53:21] King George yeah King George III thank
[1:53:24] you and um he was ruling them and he was
[1:53:28] taxing them
[1:53:30] and they didn't even have a
[1:53:31] representation he was taking a lot from
[1:53:34] them they had no rights compared to
[1:53:37] actually actual English citizens in
[1:53:39] England but at that point everybody was
[1:53:42] part of England at least in the colonies
[1:53:44] here
[1:53:45] so they recognized that they're in a bad
[1:53:47] position and they recognize that there's
[1:53:49] a tyrant that's trying to oppress them
[1:53:51] and what they do is they write a
[1:53:54] declaration of independence and I went
[1:53:57] and read the Declaration of Independence
[1:53:59] and I started to notice that there's a
[1:54:01] lot of similarity there for what we do
[1:54:04] to get rid of Satan that's tricks amen
[1:54:07] so I started trying to paraphrase a few
[1:54:09] things
[1:54:10] and
[1:54:13] actually the musicians can come back
[1:54:14] while I read this you can all stand
[1:54:16] um
[1:54:18] the Declaration of Independence
[1:54:20] the Christian version amen
[1:54:24] it says we hold these truths to be
[1:54:26] self-evident
[1:54:27] that all men are created equal that they
[1:54:30] are endowed by their creator were
[1:54:32] certain unalienable
[1:54:34] rights that among these are life liberty
[1:54:37] and the pursuit of happiness I haven't
[1:54:38] changed anything yet
[1:54:40] that to secure these rights governments
[1:54:42] are instituted among men deriving their
[1:54:45] just powers from the consent of the
[1:54:47] government
[1:54:48] yet to consent for God to govern you
[1:54:50] for him to change your life
[1:54:52] that whenever any form of government I
[1:54:55] still haven't paraphrased anything uh
[1:54:58] this is all verbatim as far as I know
[1:55:00] that whenever any form of government
[1:55:02] becomes destructive of these ends it is
[1:55:04] the right of the people to alter or
[1:55:06] abolish it and to Institute new
[1:55:08] government
[1:55:11] here is totally paraphrased I'm going to
[1:55:14] say what the devil has done because they
[1:55:15] said what King George did back to them
[1:55:17] that caused them to write a declaration
[1:55:18] of independence they knew the second
[1:55:20] they made that declaration it was going
[1:55:22] to be War it wasn't War before it was
[1:55:26] war right when they made that
[1:55:27] declaration this is not going to be easy
[1:55:29] but you got to make it for yourself
[1:55:32] whether you've accepted it or not you
[1:55:33] need to take that step
[1:55:35] recognize the war is coming
[1:55:38] he has deceived the children of God into
[1:55:39] believing Jesus Christ is not the same
[1:55:41] today as yesterday
[1:55:43] he has imposed diseases and afflictions
[1:55:45] on the people and caused them to doubt
[1:55:47] their healing he has tempted us with
[1:55:49] many Temptations He has used his power
[1:55:52] to block stop or challenge any move of
[1:55:54] God Among Us he has increased his armies
[1:55:57] and minions against us he has failed to
[1:56:00] date to show any remorse for any of the
[1:56:03] stated actions nor expressed any desire
[1:56:05] to change
[1:56:07] I think that one was verbatim
[1:56:09] that wasn't me
[1:56:12] in every stage of these oppressions we
[1:56:14] have petitioned for deliverance in the
[1:56:17] most humble terms that's a mistake right
[1:56:19] there
[1:56:20] are repeated petitions have been
[1:56:22] answered only by repeated injury injury
[1:56:24] you see
[1:56:26] the problem with some people is they try
[1:56:27] to
[1:56:28] debate with the devil you know they see
[1:56:31] where they're born and they see that the
[1:56:33] world's messed up and their lives are
[1:56:35] messed up and they try to reason with it
[1:56:38] and try to use that world system to
[1:56:40] change their own lives but see we
[1:56:43] already talked about it the the devil
[1:56:45] Satan dominates the entire uh all
[1:56:48] nations are dominated by the devil you
[1:56:50] know and they're his systems in the
[1:56:52] first place so instead of bargaining
[1:56:54] with them back here our repeated
[1:56:56] petitions have been answered only by
[1:56:58] repeated injury why are you trying to
[1:57:01] bargain with him he's not going to help
[1:57:03] you he's not going to let you go he
[1:57:06] won't even give you an inch
[1:57:08] a prince whose character is thus marked
[1:57:10] by Every Act which may Define a tyrant
[1:57:12] is unfit to be the ruler of a free
[1:57:14] people that those two slides were
[1:57:17] verbatim wow that wasn't me wow but it
[1:57:21] did put me in mind of the scripture John
[1:57:23] 12 31 now is the Judgment of this world
[1:57:25] now shall the prince of this world be
[1:57:27] cast out
[1:57:28] and I make that declaration today this
[1:57:30] morning he's gonna be cast out
[1:57:34] if you want him to be if you want to
[1:57:36] exercise your rights
[1:57:38] let's cast him out yeah
[1:57:41] back to the Declaration
[1:57:43] we therefore the assembled brothers and
[1:57:45] sisters in Fellowship appealing to the
[1:57:47] Supreme judge of the world for the
[1:57:49] rectitude of our intentions due in the
[1:57:51] name and by the authority of the blood
[1:57:53] Jesus the blood of Jesus Christ solemnly
[1:57:55] publish and declare that our bodies and
[1:57:57] souls and Spirits ought to be free in
[1:58:00] independent states that they are
[1:58:02] absolved from all allegiance to Satan
[1:58:05] that all connections between us in the
[1:58:07] adversary are totally dissolved and that
[1:58:09] is free and independent Christians they
[1:58:11] have full power to baptize
[1:58:13] pray for the sick approach the father
[1:58:16] obtain healing commune with the Brethren
[1:58:19] choose a spouse receive the Holy Ghost
[1:58:21] and to do all other acts and things
[1:58:23] which children of God might rightfully
[1:58:25] do
[1:58:26] and for the support of this declaration
[1:58:28] with a firm Reliance on the protection
[1:58:30] of Divine Providence we mutually pledge
[1:58:33] to Jesus Christ Our lives our fortunes
[1:58:36] and our secret honor

[1:59:26] Abraham Lincoln and emancipated all the
[1:59:28] slaves but a lot of the slaves did not
[1:59:31] know
[1:59:33] and I think it was like two years later
[1:59:35] in Galveston Texas he had to send a
[1:59:39] Union Army to afford to go and declare
[1:59:43] to those leaves
[1:59:45] thank you
