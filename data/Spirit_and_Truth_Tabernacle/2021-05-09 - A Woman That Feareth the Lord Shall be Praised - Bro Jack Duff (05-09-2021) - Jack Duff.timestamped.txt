[49:44] [Applause]
[49:46] that was i believe hold fast
[49:50] what was what hold fast and don't let go
[49:55] you know and and see you know it was
[49:59] it uh it kind of uh um
[50:03] i'm i'm gonna come there in a second but
[50:05] y'all try to try to hear me not hear
[50:07] them if y'all can
[50:08] i'm just some of y'all ready to move
[50:11] right now
[50:12] i feel it
[50:14] [Music]
[50:16] it's all right it's all right but but we
[50:19] were there in north carolina and um
[50:21] and you know we were my wife and i we
[50:24] were just kind of talking we went to
[50:26] jamestown and yorktown and you know some
[50:28] of these historic sites and
[50:30] and we looked at you know just just some
[50:32] of the ships and everything that come
[50:34] here to just you know just the faith
[50:37] that the people
[50:38] it took for them to get on a boat and go
[50:40] to a place they never
[50:41] heard of before and uh and they came
[50:45] here and they they did all the things
[50:46] and you know we bring up a lot of
[50:48] you know history some some part of
[50:49] history is we don't enjoy
[50:51] talking about i get that i understand
[50:53] that but it had to happen
[50:55] and partially it had to happen because
[50:58] uh there was prophecy in revelation 13
[51:02] that had to be fulfilled and i and i
[51:03] guarantee when people left england they
[51:05] didn't realize they was fulfilling
[51:07] prophecy but they didn't know the seas
[51:09] they didn't know the weather patterns
[51:10] they didn't know any of that but somehow
[51:12] they pressed through and persevered by
[51:14] faith to come here to the u.s
[51:17] right they did this by faith and i
[51:19] wonder how many storms
[51:21] they might have faced and maybe the
[51:24] captain of the ship was just yelling at
[51:26] hole fast hold fast don't let go my
[51:30] brother just
[51:31] drop your anchor come on somebody
[51:36] and just hold steady and don't let go
[51:39] good god almighty i don't know what
[51:41] you're going through this morning but if
[51:42] you just hold fast
[51:44] and don't let go gotta bring you through
[51:46] your storm
[51:50] but i i was just as i was listening to
[51:53] brother troy on on wednesday night all
[51:55] that start going through my mind and
[51:57] then i start thinking about you know uh
[52:00] one time paul was on the ship
[52:07] [Music]
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:09] paul was on the ship and they were going
[52:10] through this great storm called euro
[52:12] clayton
[52:14] it was a hurricane that they were facing
[52:16] and as they went through this the ship
[52:17] they were holding fast they were doing
[52:19] everything they could just to hold on
[52:21] but the ship still became shipwrecked
[52:24] they lost some boards they lost this
[52:26] they lost that and they they didn't know
[52:28] what to do but
[52:28] paul just gave them a little advice
[52:32] he said now anybody if you can't swim
[52:35] and we got to get onto the shore just
[52:37] grab a little piece of pork
[52:40] and just float on up to the shore
[52:42] hallelujah sometimes you can't be on the
[52:44] whole ship but you can
[52:46] just get a little piece of board and
[52:48] it'll still float you to safety
[52:51] [Music]
[52:52] [Applause]
[52:54] one scripture can carry you through one
[52:57] song can carry you through
[52:59] just a little bit from god
[53:05] hold fast and don't let go
[53:16] my god
[53:17] [Music]
[53:20] [Applause]

[57:35] amen get our our bible
[57:38] amen and we our bibles will read the
[57:42] scripture this morning
[57:44] so good to see everybody in the house of
[57:46] god just
[57:47] amen nothing like the presence
[57:51] of the lord amen nothing like the
[57:54] presence of the lord
[57:56] um it's mother's day
[58:00] and um i am going to
[58:03] have a mother's day sermon uh for the
[58:06] mamas
[58:08] um i've been in a series
[58:12] but i'm breaking amen my
[58:15] uh my stride and i want to
[58:19] just try to be a blessing to mamas
[58:23] amen uh we'll read a few quotes from the
[58:26] prophet prophet
[58:27] one statement says that it's a shame
[58:30] that they only get one day
[58:31] [Music]
[58:32] that we only pay attention like this so
[58:34] one day they commercialized it
[58:37] and it shouldn't be that way but uh but
[58:39] nonetheless we want to take time
[58:41] we want to take time and uh and honor
[58:44] the mothers amen and and our midst
[58:48] amen on today so uh i want to read from
[58:51] proverbs 31 i don't think i've ever
[58:53] preached from
[58:54] here before i'm not sure it could be a
[58:57] long time ago but
[58:58] uh i will read from proverbs 31 and
[59:02] um i will just so that you're not
[59:06] standing too long i'll just
[59:07] use one verse but i do want to come back
[59:10] to this chapter and try to break down
[59:14] just a couple of things if we can so
[59:16] just give me verse 30.
[59:18] at this moment we'll pray
[59:21] over the scripture after we've read it
[59:24] and uh we'll just share a little thought
[59:26] here today the bible says
[59:28] favor is deceitful
[59:33] and beauty is vain
[59:37] but a woman that feareth
[59:40] the lord she shall be
[59:43] praised the lord had a blessing to the
[59:46] reading of his work let's pray father we
[59:48] thank you for
[59:50] uh what solomon has written here in
[59:52] scripture
[59:53] to us and uh certainly he
[59:56] is a man that's capable of writing such
[1:00:01] he had the experience
[1:00:04] when he asked you for wisdom the first
[1:00:07] thing that came
[1:00:08] before his presence was two mothers
[1:00:13] got one line and one telling the truth
[1:00:16] and um
[1:00:16] god he could tell through his uh through
[1:00:19] the way you gave him to discern the
[1:00:21] situation through the judgment
[1:00:23] who the true mother of the living baby
[1:00:26] was you can tell by the actions you
[1:00:29] could tell by the reactions he could
[1:00:30] tell who the true mother was
[1:00:32] and father he could take situations like
[1:00:35] that turn and
[1:00:36] write to us that favors deceitful and
[1:00:38] beauty is vain but a woman that feareth
[1:00:41] the lord shall be praised i pray god
[1:00:44] that you bless
[1:00:44] each and every mother here on this
[1:00:47] mother's day
[1:00:48] i pray that you give stream to those
[1:00:50] that have lost
[1:00:51] their mother god and uh we're
[1:00:55] believers know that mama is waiting on
[1:00:57] the other side
[1:00:59] just a few days from now we'll be all
[1:01:01] together again
[1:01:02] and father we're looking forward to that
[1:01:04] we're expecting that
[1:01:05] and just trusting that you lord jesus
[1:01:08] would continue to carry us through the
[1:01:09] great
[1:01:10] storms of life amen the trials and
[1:01:12] tribulations that we face
[1:01:14] may you be glorified and magnified in
[1:01:16] our midst on today it's in jesus name we
[1:01:18] pray
[1:01:19] amen amen god bless you you can be
[1:01:22] seated
[1:01:22] in the presence of the lord we want to
[1:01:25] just draw our thought right
[1:01:29] from the scripture amen here
[1:01:32] it says a woman that feareth the lord
[1:01:36] she shall be praised amen a woman that
[1:01:40] feareth the lord
[1:01:41] she shall be praised um
[1:01:44] let's just start by reading a man a
[1:01:47] little
[1:01:48] quote here from the message teaching on
[1:01:51] amen and our brother mike
[1:01:55] mondelis so good to have brother mike in
[1:01:58] the house
[1:01:58] amen this precious wife and and
[1:02:02] the kids man the kids the family
[1:02:06] but mike you look different brother but
[1:02:09] you look good
[1:02:10] amen glory to god glory to god amen so
[1:02:14] um um here in this sermon teaching of
[1:02:17] moses
[1:02:19] uh brother branham makes a statement
[1:02:23] and just says now
[1:02:26] to mother's day
[1:02:30] says i want to express myself real good
[1:02:34] says i got an old grey-headed mother
[1:02:36] setting there myself
[1:02:39] and i think a day all right but every
[1:02:41] day
[1:02:42] every day should be a mother's day
[1:02:45] just not once a year says the reason
[1:02:48] these mother's day things are going on
[1:02:50] now
[1:02:51] and i see we just got a handful and we
[1:02:53] all know one another we're home folks
[1:02:55] that's the reason we're gonna
[1:02:56] talk this way so i think that a mother
[1:02:59] should be respected
[1:03:02] uh every day the same
[1:03:05] see don't don't just respect on mother's
[1:03:06] day she should be respected every day
[1:03:09] the same amen might you don't talk to
[1:03:12] any kind of way
[1:03:13] on the other days that it's not mother's
[1:03:14] day and then all of a sudden on mother's
[1:03:16] day you start being nice
[1:03:17] no no no she should be respected
[1:03:20] every day the same praise the lord
[1:03:23] somebody
[1:03:24] amen and let me let me go a little
[1:03:26] further for you brothers that got wives
[1:03:29] that bore your kids
[1:03:30] that's the that's the mama respect they
[1:03:33] mama
[1:03:34] all right come on now amen i think that
[1:03:37] the mother should be respected every day
[1:03:38] the same that's right a real mother
[1:03:40] but this day they call mothers there's
[1:03:43] nothing in the world but a big
[1:03:44] commercial nonsense says just
[1:03:47] just to drain people for money amen
[1:03:51] and it's a disgrace to mother now don't
[1:03:53] use that quote the wrong way
[1:03:58] because somebody said yo you heard what
[1:03:59] brother jack say we ain't going not to
[1:04:01] eat because they
[1:04:02] out he's just trying to drain us money
[1:04:04] if you're not gonna take out the day
[1:04:05] because it's too busy
[1:04:07] i know you take it out tomorrow come on
[1:04:10] somebody you're going to make it up some
[1:04:13] kind of way you ain't just going to use
[1:04:14] the quote to your advantage
[1:04:17] all right church right all right he said
[1:04:20] he says um
[1:04:21] just to drain the people money but we'll
[1:04:23] send her a little bunch of flowers and
[1:04:25] that'll settle
[1:04:26] it that's not mother it says my goodness
[1:04:29] a real mother is a woman that
[1:04:31] one that raised you and you love her and
[1:04:34] you
[1:04:34] see her and you talk to her all the time
[1:04:38] express your love to her all the time
[1:04:40] not just
[1:04:41] one day in a year
[1:04:44] i say amen to that we want to say happy
[1:04:48] mother's day to all these mothers and
[1:04:50] and i can say i want to take
[1:04:51] time today just to encourage you amen
[1:04:55] you're doing a fine job you're doing a
[1:04:57] great job
[1:04:58] amen and we appreciate you uh we
[1:05:01] appreciate you all
[1:05:02] uh i want to just hit this scripture in
[1:05:06] proverbs 31 and 10
[1:05:09] and um just going back to their
[1:05:12] this this this this this whole uh
[1:05:16] portion of scripture is talking about
[1:05:19] you know just a good wife right a good
[1:05:22] wife
[1:05:22] and here in verse 10 it makes this
[1:05:24] statement says who can find
[1:05:26] a virtuous woman if a price is far
[1:05:31] above rubies and uh
[1:05:34] you know so i you know as i started just
[1:05:36] kind of processing some of this i
[1:05:37] thought about
[1:05:38] this uh this word virtuous
[1:05:41] just got a little note here in my bible
[1:05:43] this work virtuous who can find a
[1:05:45] virtuous woman
[1:05:45] that word is a woman of valor
[1:05:49] right or a uh and when you when you look
[1:05:52] at the word
[1:05:53] valor it means that she's she's marked
[1:05:56] with
[1:05:56] courage praise the lord uh
[1:06:00] and and we could also the other
[1:06:01] definition they got here is
[1:06:03] personal heroism your mama's a hero
[1:06:08] your mama's actually your superhero
[1:06:10] glory to god your mama rescued you from
[1:06:12] a lot of stuff
[1:06:14] come on somebody right but but we got to
[1:06:17] learn how to stop and appreciate our
[1:06:19] mothers
[1:06:20] some of the decisions that you would
[1:06:22] have made had you not talked to mama
[1:06:24] you would have made the bad a bad
[1:06:26] decision so we thank god so
[1:06:28] so so a woman that's a virtuous woman is
[1:06:30] one that's marked with courage and
[1:06:32] and i found it i found it also in my
[1:06:34] life that my mama was one
[1:06:36] uh was marked with courage because she
[1:06:37] had the ability to speak truth to me
[1:06:40] even when i didn't want to hear it
[1:06:44] come on somebody she spoke truth even
[1:06:46] when i didn't want to hear
[1:06:48] i mean other people wouldn't approach me
[1:06:49] but my mama
[1:06:51] she knew she she knew she had that she
[1:06:54] had the
[1:06:55] right to be able to say the things that
[1:06:57] she wanted to say
[1:06:59] and i thank god that she had the courage
[1:07:01] enough to say it
[1:07:04] it changed my life when i i could think
[1:07:06] about this you know this this this woman
[1:07:08] that's smart with courage
[1:07:10] recently uh as we were you know just
[1:07:12] getting away last last
[1:07:14] week for our anniversary the lord has
[1:07:15] blessed me and my wife to see 28 years
[1:07:17] of marriage and
[1:07:19] i'm very grateful you know for for that
[1:07:22] amen we're approaching 30
[1:07:24] and uh and and my just where did the
[1:07:26] time go
[1:07:28] we used to be the young people now we
[1:07:30] the number one choir
[1:07:32] right and uh and i thank god you know
[1:07:34] for it but uh but you know i
[1:07:36] we were we were just talking as we were
[1:07:38] driving up there to
[1:07:39] uh north carolina on last week and and
[1:07:42] we got into
[1:07:42] a discussion about you know what's your
[1:07:44] favorite scripture
[1:07:46] and she was asking him to say what was
[1:07:47] your favorite script i'd say now that's
[1:07:49] a hard question to answer
[1:07:51] that's a very i mean it's so many
[1:07:53] favorites she said i say but if i have
[1:07:55] to choose one
[1:07:56] i'm gonna go with romans chapter eight
[1:07:59] i'm gonna just go with that one you know
[1:08:01] because
[1:08:01] uh it seemed like that seemed to apply
[1:08:03] to every area of my life
[1:08:05] i i know that all things are gonna work
[1:08:07] together for good because i
[1:08:09] love god and i'm called according to his
[1:08:11] purpose hallelujah
[1:08:13] amen every time i walk into my office i
[1:08:16] see my little bucket
[1:08:18] inside my office and i get inspiration
[1:08:21] from that because
[1:08:21] you know as i walk into the office
[1:08:23] sometimes i'm walking in with a new
[1:08:24] problem
[1:08:25] sometimes i'm walking in with a new
[1:08:27] situation but i can just take whatever
[1:08:29] the situation is and i can
[1:08:31] put it on a sheet of paper and i can
[1:08:33] just throw it inside my romans 8 28
[1:08:35] bucket
[1:08:36] and no matter what i'm going through the
[1:08:38] bible say that all things will work
[1:08:40] together
[1:08:41] for good because i love god and i'm
[1:08:43] called according to his purpose
[1:08:45] amen also in romans 8 amen and say if
[1:08:48] god
[1:08:48] be for me good god almighty
[1:08:52] who can be against me i get strength i
[1:08:55] get encouragement when i read that
[1:08:57] chapter
[1:08:58] hey i i love paul he says he said he
[1:09:00] said say i i'm persuaded that
[1:09:02] things present glory to god things
[1:09:06] that's going to come he said height nor
[1:09:08] death nor any other creature
[1:09:10] he say nothing will separate me
[1:09:13] from the love of god which is in christ
[1:09:16] jesus
[1:09:17] my lord i love romans 8.
[1:09:21] hey man i i didn't i didn't catch the
[1:09:23] beginning i was saying because because
[1:09:24] sometimes the devil like to accuse you
[1:09:28] but when you just get to the beginning
[1:09:29] of it you know
[1:09:31] i got to read it now cause i can't i
[1:09:32] can't even remember romans 8 uh
[1:09:35] i mean it was there there's now
[1:09:37] therefore no
[1:09:40] condemnation to them who are
[1:09:43] in christ jesus who
[1:09:46] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:09:49] spirit so
[1:09:49] so when you realize that you are in
[1:09:51] christ and you ain't got to sit and
[1:09:53] listen
[1:09:54] to nothing the devil got to say
[1:09:58] somebody recently how you know when the
[1:10:00] devil lying every time he opens his
[1:10:03] mouth
[1:10:04] especially when he talking about me
[1:10:07] there is no condemnation
[1:10:09] i refuse to wear the badge of
[1:10:14] condemnation
[1:10:16] because i mean i'm walking and in the
[1:10:18] spirit after christ
[1:10:20] hallelujah hallelujah so you know i was
[1:10:22] saying that that's
[1:10:23] that one of my favorite passages you
[1:10:25] know just just
[1:10:26] um romans 8 and and and my wife took
[1:10:30] me and said she'd say you know one of my
[1:10:32] favorite passages i'd have to
[1:10:34] say it's a little different from the
[1:10:36] norm
[1:10:37] say but it would be judges for
[1:10:42] she didn't use judges for you just say
[1:10:43] the story of jail
[1:10:45] george judges four i said wow
[1:10:48] that that would be one of your favorites
[1:10:50] to say yes i say and i just had to kind
[1:10:52] of ask like you know why
[1:10:53] why would that be one of your favorite
[1:10:55] and should say because
[1:10:56] um you know sisters don't really
[1:11:03] you know they can't preach they can't
[1:11:04] this they can't that they can't this
[1:11:06] so they're not really talked about much
[1:11:09] y'all get what i'm saying she said she
[1:11:11] said but but this
[1:11:12] woman was a woman of courage
[1:11:17] oh glory to god somebody and and as
[1:11:20] i thought about that in process that you
[1:11:23] know i'ma just take a little time and
[1:11:24] just share with you all a little
[1:11:26] about a little bit about jail you can
[1:11:28] find a story in judges for i won't read
[1:11:30] it all right now
[1:11:31] but but what was going on is that the
[1:11:32] children of israel uh
[1:11:34] found themselves in a situation this
[1:11:36] this i didn't realize it till right now
[1:11:38] but it connects with what brother troy
[1:11:40] was talking about
[1:11:41] you know he said he said say you know
[1:11:42] the children of israel found themselves
[1:11:44] in a situation where they get free
[1:11:46] for a season then they bound for the
[1:11:48] next season
[1:11:49] and then they start praying and asking
[1:11:51] god to send him a delivery and god will
[1:11:53] raise up in the liver and then they go
[1:11:54] free again for
[1:11:55] maybe another 30 years or 40 years then
[1:11:57] all of a sudden they go right
[1:11:59] back into bondage they could not break
[1:12:01] that
[1:12:02] cycle my god
[1:12:05] and in the days of judges you know here
[1:12:08] uh there come a time where they they
[1:12:10] they wanted to be free from the
[1:12:12] oppression that they were under
[1:12:14] and uh and and and unfortunately if i
[1:12:17] could put it that way because
[1:12:18] i don't think it should be this way
[1:12:20] unfortunately god had to use
[1:12:22] a man a couple women to kind of help get
[1:12:24] the people to freedom
[1:12:28] i don't think that's the perfect will of
[1:12:29] god they had a prophetess that had to
[1:12:31] lead the nation by the name of deborah
[1:12:33] at that time the men in the army were
[1:12:36] afraid to go to battle
[1:12:38] oh good god almighty the man was
[1:12:41] demanding i'm deborah prophesied and
[1:12:43] told him
[1:12:44] god gonna give you caesar god's gonna
[1:12:46] deliver y'all from the enemy
[1:12:48] get up and get ready to fight and and
[1:12:50] and barack was the leader at that time
[1:12:52] his name was barack and i and barack
[1:12:54] said you know what
[1:12:55] i'm not even gonna go to battle unless
[1:12:58] you go with me now i think that's sad
[1:13:01] that a man won't even go out to battle
[1:13:04] unless this woman is with him what about
[1:13:07] what about i won't go to battle unless
[1:13:09] god is with me
[1:13:14] that's where he should have been that's
[1:13:16] where his faith should have been but his
[1:13:18] faith was so much in deborah you know
[1:13:20] what deborah said to ever say i'm going
[1:13:22] to go with you
[1:13:24] a woman of valor a woman of course a
[1:13:26] virtuous woman right
[1:13:27] i'll go with you say but i want to tell
[1:13:29] you something because you didn't just
[1:13:31] move out by faith based on the prophecy
[1:13:34] god ain't gonna even allow you to get
[1:13:35] glory in the victory
[1:13:37] the victory gonna be given to a woman
[1:13:46] the victory gonna be given to one and
[1:13:48] see if i see if i was a sister right now
[1:13:49] i would have grabbed that
[1:13:50] i say the victory gonna be given to a
[1:13:53] woman
[1:13:56] i'm gonna say i'm claiming the victory
[1:13:58] right now i'm claiming it for myself
[1:13:59] whatever situation
[1:14:00] i'm claiming victory you know you can
[1:14:03] claim victory before your battle gets
[1:14:05] started
[1:14:06] oh y'all ain't with me
[1:14:09] you can claim victory before your battle
[1:14:12] gets started
[1:14:15] you already know the outcome gonna be i
[1:14:18] the outcome is i cannot lose will not
[1:14:21] lose
[1:14:23] refuse to lose no matter what it looks
[1:14:26] like i'm not gonna lose
[1:14:29] oh my god but but he said she said she
[1:14:31] said look you ain't gonna be able to
[1:14:33] enjoy the rewards of victory because
[1:14:34] it's gonna be given to a woman
[1:14:35] now they didn't know what was gonna
[1:14:37] happen but here in the battle
[1:14:39] you know they're sitting there waiting
[1:14:41] for the battle to kind of get started
[1:14:42] and when everybody got positioned to a
[1:14:44] certain place deborah's saying now rise
[1:14:46] barack
[1:14:47] get up now it's time to go fight and god
[1:14:49] gonna give you the victory in this get
[1:14:51] ready barack i don't care how many
[1:14:52] soldiers he got
[1:14:54] don't look at the numbers god if god is
[1:14:57] for you then who can be against you
[1:15:00] she said she said she said rise barack
[1:15:02] barack got up and they went down
[1:15:04] and started battling and the king cisera
[1:15:07] the leader of the other army that had
[1:15:09] them under oppression
[1:15:10] he took off running when he saw that his
[1:15:12] army was defeated
[1:15:13] and as he took off running he ran into
[1:15:15] this little city and uh
[1:15:17] and here this woman amen jael was there
[1:15:20] and she recognized who he was she said
[1:15:23] now why don't you come on into my tent
[1:15:25] everything's gonna be all right just
[1:15:26] come on into my tent
[1:15:28] and he said he say no not now well when
[1:15:31] i come in if anybody come
[1:15:32] ask if a man in here just tell him no
[1:15:35] just lie to him and tell him no
[1:15:37] she said yeah oh don't worry you're
[1:15:38] going to be safe right here
[1:15:44] and jail yeah uh
[1:15:48] i mean so seriously i'm a little thirsty
[1:15:50] could you give me something to drink
[1:15:52] say i want some water he said yeah i got
[1:15:54] something for you she went and got some
[1:15:55] milk
[1:15:58] you thirsty here drink this milk and
[1:16:01] somehow the milk just put em
[1:16:06] put this fella to sleep and he didn't
[1:16:09] realize what was going on but there he
[1:16:11] was sleeping in this latest tent
[1:16:13] and i don't know i didn't recognize but
[1:16:15] the way that she killed him is while he
[1:16:17] was sleeping
[1:16:18] she took a hammer with a nail you talk
[1:16:21] about a virtuous woman you
[1:16:23] you talk about a a woman marked with
[1:16:25] valor
[1:16:26] this woman would kill a king for the
[1:16:29] sake of her people
[1:16:30] and i'm gonna tell you there's some
[1:16:32] mothers that are standing in the gap
[1:16:34] for the sake of their children
[1:16:37] they'll go through great extremes
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:45] she took a ham and a nail and went
[1:16:48] through that man's temple
[1:16:50] and when they went looking for cesaris
[1:16:52] to say i got him right here
[1:16:55] in my tent what was your battle strategy
[1:17:00] milk
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:06] no sword no shield
[1:17:14] milk
[1:17:19] sometimes we're looking for all these
[1:17:20] great things but if you just do what god
[1:17:22] has called you to do with the little
[1:17:24] that you got
[1:17:25] it'll get the job done
[1:17:31] i was thinking on this
[1:17:36] this woman jael showed that she was a
[1:17:38] virtuous woman she was marked with
[1:17:40] courage
[1:17:41] she had personal heroism she was a woman
[1:17:44] of valor
[1:17:46] and i thought about my wife actually
[1:17:48] saying that this was one of her favorite
[1:17:49] scriptures and
[1:17:51] the thought came to me that when you are
[1:17:54] a virtuous woman then you will identify
[1:17:58] with other virtuous women
[1:18:01] so i'm calling my wife a virtuous woman
[1:18:03] this morning
[1:18:04] when you are a virtuous woman then you
[1:18:07] will identify
[1:18:08] with other virtuous women and that's why
[1:18:11] when i was going through that story a
[1:18:12] lot of sisters said amen amen that's
[1:18:14] right
[1:18:15] they virtuous women
[1:18:19] hallelujah all right
[1:18:23] we were thinking jaye was a woman that
[1:18:26] had purpose
[1:18:28] let's put it this way if jail was a
[1:18:29] housewife she wasn't out at the battle
[1:18:32] she was at home taking care of the tent
[1:18:35] but she had purpose
[1:18:37] had she not been home
[1:18:41] so sarah would have never came to her
[1:18:43] house had she been out gossiping
[1:18:46] she would have missed her opportunity to
[1:18:48] deliver oh come on somebody
[1:18:52] but because she was a virtuous woman
[1:18:54] because she did what she needed to do
[1:18:56] at home she was able to be a part of a
[1:18:59] prophecy
[1:19:03] y'all preaching to me now y'all
[1:19:04] preaching to me yeah i'm preaching
[1:19:06] i like it i like it let me keep going
[1:19:09] [Applause]
[1:19:11] cause i ain't gonna stop it jail that's
[1:19:14] just part of the sermon
[1:19:16] but what i want you to understand is
[1:19:18] that she had purpose
[1:19:20] and i want you sisters to realize here
[1:19:23] today that
[1:19:24] no matter what what you do in life you
[1:19:26] have purpose
[1:19:30] god god has established you god has
[1:19:31] placed you here with purpose you didn't
[1:19:34] come by a mistake you're not an accident
[1:19:38] now you came because god had a plan for
[1:19:40] you
[1:19:42] i want to read just a little statement
[1:19:44] here from the message influence
[1:19:46] we this is just part of our discussion
[1:19:48] amen and
[1:19:49] and and and we were just kind of talking
[1:19:52] and my wife found this quote i said send
[1:19:53] me the quote send me the quote send me
[1:19:55] the quote
[1:19:55] so i want to read it to you say we must
[1:19:57] we mustn't try to impersonate
[1:19:59] anyone uh
[1:20:02] just be what you are yeah
[1:20:05] oh i got a lot i can say right there
[1:20:08] just be what you
[1:20:09] are be what god made you right right
[1:20:12] and that's the way god made you you you
[1:20:15] never
[1:20:16] fashion yourself and remember as much as
[1:20:19] we ministers would like to take billy
[1:20:21] graham's place
[1:20:22] we cannot do it neither can billy graham
[1:20:25] take our place
[1:20:26] right he says uh see we we each one has
[1:20:30] something to do the common little fella
[1:20:32] here
[1:20:33] that may be a janitor the little woman
[1:20:35] that may be a housewife
[1:20:37] the greatest minister on the face of the
[1:20:38] earth today cannot
[1:20:40] take your place listen
[1:20:43] god had a purpose in making you what you
[1:20:47] are
[1:20:50] i'm gonna just leave that just just for
[1:20:52] a second i have to just
[1:20:54] touch on that a little bit god had a
[1:20:57] purpose
[1:20:58] for making you what you are
[1:21:02] oftentimes we see certain
[1:21:03] characteristics in certain people and we
[1:21:05] want to try to help them get rid of
[1:21:07] those characteristics
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:12] a wife might see something her husband
[1:21:14] and she don't like she you can take
[1:21:15] you can take it down sis uh a wife might
[1:21:17] see something the husband has seen him
[1:21:18] like she's gonna try to help him get rid
[1:21:20] of that characteristic
[1:21:21] a husband gonna see some of his wife
[1:21:23] that he don't like he gonna try to help
[1:21:24] her get rid of that characteristic no
[1:21:26] you
[1:21:26] married that characteristic
[1:21:31] and let me just help you understand you
[1:21:32] are not god
[1:21:35] praise the lord it's not your job to get
[1:21:37] rid of the characteristic
[1:21:38] god gave that person that characteristic
[1:21:41] for a reason
[1:21:46] all right i'm gonna go a little further
[1:21:49] i'm gonna use just my own my own house
[1:21:50] is that all right
[1:21:51] yeah but but my wife all her life
[1:21:54] as a young young young young young girl
[1:21:57] she was always told
[1:22:03] she's always told what to do and she
[1:22:06] didn't
[1:22:07] i mean she just told him that's just the
[1:22:09] way she talked she wasn't
[1:22:11] she wasn't trying to say nothing to be
[1:22:13] nothing that's just the way she is
[1:22:15] but it just seemed to rub people the
[1:22:16] wrong way sometimes sometimes
[1:22:18] what i found in my own life is that when
[1:22:21] i had somebody calling
[1:22:22] asking for something maybe a bill
[1:22:25] collecting i don't tell you that this is
[1:22:26] when i'm gonna do it
[1:22:28] now i don't need you still bothering me
[1:22:30] cause i told you when you're gonna do it
[1:22:32] i got a weapon in my house come on
[1:22:36] somebody
[1:22:37] you want i'ma let you talk to my wife
[1:22:40] she got a way of saying things to
[1:22:43] keep you from calling him
[1:22:47] [Music]
[1:22:48] see god gave her certain characteristics
[1:22:51] and they can be
[1:22:52] used at certain times
[1:22:55] to be a blessing to you
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:23:00] here's the other side of that
[1:23:03] because that characteristic is there
[1:23:06] sometimes i got to just live with it
[1:23:11] you can't just use it when you want to
[1:23:12] use it
[1:23:16] [Music]
[1:23:19] but you begin to thank god for how he
[1:23:21] made a person how he designed the person
[1:23:24] he gave them that because it was for his
[1:23:26] glory
[1:23:29] let me go a little further in the quote
[1:23:31] is that all right
[1:23:33] so um he says here you god had a purpose
[1:23:36] in making you what you are
[1:23:38] and you just serve god in
[1:23:41] that way that he made you
[1:23:44] serve god in the way that he made you
[1:23:49] now that some people say this just the
[1:23:51] way god made me now you know some stuff
[1:23:53] you need to get rid of
[1:23:56] and the other part of the bible say lay
[1:23:58] aside every sin
[1:23:59] and every weight that's so easily beset
[1:24:02] you
[1:24:05] hallelujah don't you just got to get you
[1:24:07] just got to accept me for who i am
[1:24:08] because this is what god made
[1:24:09] that's why you can't you can't have that
[1:24:13] type of attitude
[1:24:14] praise the lord but there's a time where
[1:24:16] you got to realize cause sometimes the
[1:24:18] devil will beat you up so bad
[1:24:20] about who you are and who god made you
[1:24:22] that you got to know god you
[1:24:23] i know you made me this way for a reason
[1:24:25] i don't know why it just keep rubbing
[1:24:26] everybody the wrong way
[1:24:27] but help me lord
[1:24:32] god help me sometimes i just say things
[1:24:35] i don't know why i got to be the one to
[1:24:37] always say things
[1:24:39] but i just happen to be that person god
[1:24:42] some folk just don't say nothing this
[1:24:43] said but i'm not that one
[1:24:53] but it's okay i'm trying i'm trying to
[1:24:54] find a balance here for you
[1:24:56] hey man i i mean the word we're going to
[1:24:58] take care of all of us
[1:25:00] and my purpose is not to try to bring
[1:25:01] the word to try to shave this off you
[1:25:03] know the word will take care of you god
[1:25:04] will take care of you
[1:25:05] amen amen all right look let me go a
[1:25:08] little further
[1:25:09] uh it says uh god had a purpose to make
[1:25:11] you what you are and you just serve god
[1:25:13] in that way that he made you and i think
[1:25:15] if we would just do that
[1:25:17] the wheels would roll a lot easier
[1:25:20] yes it would if we would do that not get
[1:25:23] lifted
[1:25:24] up we find out instead of you know going
[1:25:28] that route getting lifted up
[1:25:30] amen then uh the you know just just stay
[1:25:32] humble before god
[1:25:33] and everything around just just a lot
[1:25:36] smoother
[1:25:37] now can i just go uh
[1:25:40] to proverbs 31 and 30.
[1:25:50] the bible declares favor
[1:25:55] is deceitful
[1:25:58] how many of us just love to hear us hear
[1:26:01] people talk about
[1:26:08] preaching to me already everybody like
[1:26:10] to tell everybody that
[1:26:12] i got favor and faith ain't fair like
[1:26:16] sister nelly said fame ain't fair
[1:26:18] you know what it just means that you got
[1:26:19] the blessings of god flowing in your
[1:26:21] life
[1:26:22] but that's not what this scripture is
[1:26:23] talking about
[1:26:26] because this scripture say favor is
[1:26:29] deceitful
[1:26:31] and then it put in beauty is vain now it
[1:26:34] connects these two things
[1:26:36] favor is defeatful and beauty is
[1:26:39] vain
[1:26:42] well what is solomon trying to tell us
[1:26:46] in this favor
[1:26:51] means charm
[1:26:56] and what i've come to realize is that
[1:26:59] there's some women that will try to get
[1:27:01] by
[1:27:03] in life through charm
[1:27:07] and through beauty
[1:27:10] but the the other part to it is that
[1:27:12] they don't fear the lord which means
[1:27:14] they don't have
[1:27:15] character you can take that scripture
[1:27:18] down
[1:27:20] see favor is fable is deceitful that
[1:27:22] means
[1:27:23] child right amen charm or deceit and
[1:27:27] and also they try to use them the the
[1:27:29] beauty fluttering the eyes a little bit
[1:27:31] and you know
[1:27:32] come on you know you know you know you
[1:27:33] know you know how women try to work at
[1:27:35] some time
[1:27:37] but but i'm gonna tell you like this
[1:27:39] that that type of stuff don't last
[1:27:43] glory to god i'm just looking at a
[1:27:45] little note here from a man by the name
[1:27:47] of h
[1:27:48] uh h a ironsides a man he wrote this
[1:27:51] commentary on the proverbs on a book
[1:27:54] wrote commentary in a book called
[1:27:56] proverbs and song of solomon
[1:27:57] and as he looked at that scripture amen
[1:28:00] he made the statement says
[1:28:01] others may pride themselves on their
[1:28:03] beauty
[1:28:05] or endeavor to obtain favor by
[1:28:08] winning words and pleasing manners
[1:28:13] hallelujah but if there be no true
[1:28:16] character
[1:28:17] behind such charms the day will soon
[1:28:20] come when praise will give place to
[1:28:23] contempt
[1:28:26] i want to read that again all right if
[1:28:28] there be
[1:28:29] no true character behind such
[1:28:32] charms you got to watch when women are
[1:28:35] always trying to
[1:28:36] push you up a little bit as a man
[1:28:39] she got a reason for keep saying them
[1:28:41] things
[1:28:43] oh yeah y'all ain't gonna talk to me in
[1:28:45] here she got a reason for saying that
[1:28:48] young man you watch a woman that's
[1:28:50] always laughing at all your jokes
[1:28:51] you know you ain't that funny
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:03] fable is deceitful
[1:29:10] all right says but if there be no true
[1:29:12] character behind such charms
[1:29:14] the day will soon come where praise will
[1:29:16] give place to contempt
[1:29:19] while she who fears jehovah
[1:29:23] will be honored by all who appreciate
[1:29:25] virtue and
[1:29:26] excellence of spirit her beneficent
[1:29:30] laborers too will receive their public
[1:29:32] and well-merited
[1:29:34] recognition sometimes you do things in
[1:29:36] secret it seems like nobody
[1:29:38] see what you do mama but there comes a
[1:29:40] time where god rewards you
[1:29:41] openly for the things that you've done
[1:29:44] in secret
[1:29:46] the stand that you had to take in secret
[1:29:48] i thought about this i thought about
[1:29:50] this
[1:29:50] and you know i won't have time to read
[1:29:52] it but you know there was time brother
[1:29:53] brennaman come here to
[1:29:55] um to florida and he ran into a woman
[1:29:59] uh down in miami he was having meetings
[1:30:02] and uh when he ran it you know he was
[1:30:04] there
[1:30:04] and and one of the brothers say uh
[1:30:06] brother you know this ground that we
[1:30:07] have
[1:30:07] uh the duchess is the one that made a a
[1:30:10] way for you to get this girl who's
[1:30:11] saying the the
[1:30:11] the who the duchess the dudgey say he
[1:30:15] say is she saved is she filled with the
[1:30:16] holy ghost
[1:30:17] he said i don't know about that you can
[1:30:18] talk to about that but he said well
[1:30:20] what's what
[1:30:20] what what make up better than everybody
[1:30:22] else he said he said just say hi to the
[1:30:25] woman if you don't mind brother
[1:30:26] he said okay i say hi to and say he
[1:30:28] walked around the corner
[1:30:30] and i i it says

[1:30:36] said he said she had
[1:30:37] glasses on and there's kind of way out
[1:30:40] here

[1:30:43] how to see through no glasses way out
[1:30:44] there
[1:30:45] he said she had jewelry all over her
[1:30:47] hands and all over her neck saying she
[1:30:49] was just
[1:30:49] she just just full of charm and she said
[1:30:51] she said she says are you
[1:30:52] dr branham he say uh doctor brandon i'm
[1:30:56] saying no i'm not dr brandon i'm brother

[1:31:18] so bring it down here so i can shake
[1:31:20] your hand

[1:31:24] all this that she's trying to
[1:31:26] you know persuade somebody say i can see
[1:31:28] right through that that is deceitful
[1:31:30] woman
[1:31:32] don't use that you just need good godly
[1:31:34] character
[1:31:35] if you're gonna make a difference in
[1:31:36] somebody's life
[1:31:42] i thought about this because you know
[1:31:45] favor
[1:31:45] favor favor where where's another woman
[1:31:48] in scripture
[1:31:49] that we can look at that probably
[1:31:51] thought that she had
[1:31:52] favor i i think i want to read this and
[1:31:56] i didn't write this down but
[1:31:57] i think it's in matthew let me just take
[1:31:59] a quick look here real quick
[1:32:01] matthew chapter
[1:32:11] um oh
[1:32:14] lord um
[1:32:18] this i want to read about herodias y'all
[1:32:21] help me find that
[1:32:23] uh in scripture i know it's early part
[1:32:25] of matthew
[1:32:26] and what i thought was matthew two or
[1:32:28] three but let me just see something here
[1:32:30] you know it's not two
[1:32:34] oh god help us here y'all just do a
[1:32:38] quick search on your phone
[1:32:39] for herodius and i didn't write it down
[1:32:43] but i know it's in matthew and um
[1:32:46] and i just want to i want to take time
[1:32:48] to read about her because she is she is
[1:32:49] a woman that would have
[1:32:53] just find herodias
[1:32:57] matthew matthew what now
[1:33:06] it's about when she came to church
[1:33:09] matthew 14.
[1:33:11] all right thank you very much thank you
[1:33:13] all very much i appreciate it so let's
[1:33:15] let's get this matthew 14
[1:33:17] and uh yes there it is matthew 14
[1:33:20] and verse one let's let's pick this up
[1:33:22] this is a woman to me
[1:33:24] that is trying to use her charm
[1:33:29] trying to use a charm and look at this
[1:33:30] because you know the scripture clearly
[1:33:32] tells us that
[1:33:34] uh favor deceitful and beauty is vain
[1:33:37] hallelujah but look at look at look at
[1:33:39] look look look at herodias
[1:33:41] bob says at at that time herod
[1:33:44] the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus
[1:33:47] and said unto his servants
[1:33:49] this is john the baptist he has risen
[1:33:51] from the dead
[1:33:52] and therefore mighty works do show forth
[1:33:54] themselves
[1:33:55] in him for herod had laid hold on john
[1:33:59] and bound him and put him in prison
[1:34:02] for sake his brother
[1:34:05] philip's wife for john said
[1:34:08] unto him it is not lawful for thee to
[1:34:11] have her now
[1:34:13] you know when we read the scripture it's
[1:34:15] very uh
[1:34:16] easy for us to just kind of say okay
[1:34:17] that's all happy just you know it's not
[1:34:19] a lot for that it wasn't it was
[1:34:20] it's more it's more to it than that what
[1:34:23] this
[1:34:24] is is amen they were having church like
[1:34:26] we have in church today
[1:34:28] and uh um you know herod was the type of
[1:34:32] man that he
[1:34:33] he actually enjoyed being in church come
[1:34:36] on somebody
[1:34:37] he enjoyed hearing the word of god and
[1:34:39] there was a time that he met jesus said
[1:34:41] he wanted to see a miracle
[1:34:43] this man this man that really enjoyed
[1:34:45] the supernatural
[1:34:46] but he had a lust problem that he
[1:34:49] couldn't get delivered from
[1:34:51] hallelujah with that lust problem he
[1:34:53] ended up marrying his brother's wife
[1:34:56] her name was herodias hallelujah amen
[1:35:00] not only i mean married to brother's
[1:35:01] wife and and now he's taking care of
[1:35:03] brother's child and he should have never
[1:35:05] had this woman as wife
[1:35:07] he knew he shouldn't have did that right
[1:35:09] but he didn't know he broke
[1:35:10] all the laws of the word in order to
[1:35:12] have this woman
[1:35:14] and one day they were in church like we
[1:35:16] are right now and
[1:35:17] and and herodias decides i want to make
[1:35:20] a grand entrance
[1:35:21] i don't want to get that 30 minutes
[1:35:23] early and pray
[1:35:25] y'all ain't talking to me yet i don't
[1:35:27] want to get there i mean
[1:35:29] the way i'm dressed today i need
[1:35:32] everybody to see how i'm dressed
[1:35:36] hallelujah somebody so i'm going to walk
[1:35:38] into the church a little bit late
[1:35:41] because i want to make sure people see
[1:35:43] me and as she was coming through the
[1:35:45] church
[1:35:46] with her husband with her child the
[1:35:49] sermon was
[1:35:50] already being preached
[1:35:54] so so now you know when when everybody's
[1:35:56] attention i turn to them and watching
[1:35:58] them come in with all the pump
[1:36:00] and circumstance and as they're getting
[1:36:02] to their seats
[1:36:03] still standing up john yells out
[1:36:07] it's not lawful for you to have her
[1:36:17] and i can just imagine herodias
[1:36:22] she say is he talking to
[1:36:26] to me
[1:36:30] john i can see john cause he was born i
[1:36:32] said it i'ma say it again
[1:36:34] it's not lawful for you to have her
[1:36:39] you done broke the law
[1:36:42] the laws of god you then broke the laws
[1:36:46] of god to take her
[1:36:48] marriage and divorce is god's laws not
[1:36:50] man's laws
[1:36:52] i want to say that again marriage and
[1:36:54] divorce is god's laws not
[1:36:56] man's laws we're not gonna let the the
[1:36:59] world
[1:37:00] redefine what marriage is
[1:37:03] marriage is still between a man and a
[1:37:06] woman god established that
[1:37:10] not man oh they just love each other no
[1:37:13] they don't love each other they got a
[1:37:14] spirit
[1:37:17] a man want a married man that's a spirit
[1:37:19] a woman want to marry a woman that's a
[1:37:21] spirit
[1:37:23] i told y'all i'm gonna stay over there i
[1:37:25] told y'all i was coming
[1:37:27] it's spirits and people still need to be
[1:37:30] delivered
[1:37:33] i'm gonna tell you because john priest
[1:37:36] like what i'm just preaching
[1:37:37] john had his last sermon that day well i
[1:37:39] wouldn't say that day
[1:37:40] he preached some more but but what
[1:37:42] happened is that there was a sea
[1:37:43] planet and herodias mind she said i'ma
[1:37:46] get
[1:37:47] him i don't know how long it took
[1:37:52] but she i mean she left she couldn't
[1:37:53] hear nothing else in the sermon
[1:37:56] all she heard was it's not lawful and
[1:37:59] that thing just kept ringing out
[1:38:02] but one day herod decides
[1:38:06] man it's my birthday i'm gonna throw
[1:38:09] myself a
[1:38:10] nice party and i want some dancers
[1:38:14] now y'all got to be with me on the scene
[1:38:16] why we never talk about nobody just
[1:38:18] coming in and
[1:38:19] break dancing no this man wanted dancers
[1:38:23] what we call provocative dancers he had
[1:38:26] a love spirit
[1:38:28] all that time in church he still had a
[1:38:30] love spirit
[1:38:34] he still had a love spirit hallelujah
[1:38:37] but here he here you know here he was
[1:38:39] and you know he said i want some
[1:38:40] provocative dances
[1:38:42] and and and he's so so
[1:38:45] messed up that that they sent out a
[1:38:48] dancer before
[1:38:50] and you know who was dancing his own
[1:38:53] daughter
[1:38:54] not the one not the one he had by by by
[1:38:57] giving birth to himself he took
[1:38:58] his brother's wife and now let's say his
[1:39:01] niece but because he's married to the
[1:39:05] mama he be
[1:39:06] it becomes his daughter and she then so

[1:43:42] let him take care from now i'm but this
[1:43:44] this this this woman
[1:43:46] and i want to read a little bit about
[1:43:48] her if i can
[1:43:50] just give me an invasion of the united
[1:43:52] states and give me
[1:43:54] uh i'm a skip down give me paragraph 251
[1:44:02] this woman had her daughter danced
[1:44:05] before
[1:44:06] her husband in such a provocative manner
[1:44:10] that it
[1:44:11] brought death to a prophet of god
[1:44:18] now she might have thought she got away
[1:44:19] with it oh yeah i i
[1:44:22] i guarantee he won't preach no more
[1:44:23] sermons like that
[1:44:25] not not long as i'm living
[1:44:28] she thought she got away with it
[1:44:32] well we're going to see something here
[1:44:33] in scripture i'm sorry in this quote
[1:44:35] that she didn't get away with it
[1:44:37] look at what happened the seed that she
[1:44:39] planted see
[1:44:40] see see favor is deceitful
[1:44:44] beauty is vain but a woman that feareth
[1:44:46] the lord
[1:44:48] shall be praised here now let me tell
[1:44:51] you
[1:44:52] let me just tell you another mother
[1:44:53] right quick in the bible before we close
[1:44:55] there was a mother called herodia she
[1:44:57] taught her daughter to tap dance
[1:45:00] she wanted her to be popular and she
[1:45:02] danced before the king and required the
[1:45:04] head of john the baptist
[1:45:06] we have a record of 70 of her offspring
[1:45:08] this damn so that dance
[1:45:10] herodias daughter danced before herod
[1:45:14] 70. of her offspring
[1:45:17] they either died prostitutes or on
[1:45:20] gallows
[1:45:22] see what she did actually affected
[1:45:25] generations
[1:45:27] and i need you to understand something
[1:45:28] today mama
[1:45:30] what you are doing is impacting
[1:45:34] generations
[1:45:37] you bring them to the house of the lord
[1:45:38] you see the next generation come to the
[1:45:40] house of the lord
[1:45:41] and i'm gonna tell you when you have
[1:45:42] trained up your child the way that they
[1:45:44] supposed to go
[1:45:46] the bible say they're not going to
[1:45:47] depart now here's the other thing the
[1:45:48] good thing about this
[1:45:49] uh brother branham says say now they
[1:45:51] might depart but it will never depart
[1:45:53] from them
[1:45:55] how do you know that because when y'all
[1:45:56] get around at the at the table at the
[1:45:58] house
[1:45:59] the things that they start talking
[1:46:00] remember we was in this church service
[1:46:03] and then that
[1:46:04] that's all that's in them that's all
[1:46:06] that they remember because you brought
[1:46:08] them up in the ways of god
[1:46:12] and if that's all that's in them that's
[1:46:14] what's going to bring them back
[1:46:22] it goes on in this he says one mother
[1:46:24] taught hers the things of the world the
[1:46:25] other mother
[1:46:26] taught her hers the things of god one
[1:46:28] became a great leader to conquer
[1:46:29] immortal among men today and the other
[1:46:31] is
[1:46:31] botched and inhaled and taken thousands
[1:46:34] times thousands with her see what i mean
[1:46:36] bring up a child in the way it should go
[1:46:37] now when he's when he's talking about
[1:46:38] the other mother he's talking about
[1:46:40] moses mother because mother moses mother
[1:46:43] what a blessing that was this
[1:46:46] is a woman that feareth the lord
[1:46:52] the time they were in such bondage and
[1:46:54] they knew that the delivery was supposed
[1:46:56] to be coming but she didn't know what to
[1:46:57] do and
[1:46:58] and here you know um as this um
[1:47:01] uh she's in this pregnancy and maybe uh
[1:47:04] the law
[1:47:04] changes real quick kill all the babies
[1:47:08] under two years old so she realized that
[1:47:10] you know what i got a baby that's gonna
[1:47:12] fit that category
[1:47:14] and my baby gonna get killed soon as i
[1:47:15] give birth to it
[1:47:17] so here you know she's wondering and
[1:47:19] praying and lord what should i do
[1:47:21] god gives amram you know a uh a vision
[1:47:24] of make a little ark and do this and do
[1:47:25] that and just put the baby inside the
[1:47:27] ark glory to god
[1:47:28] and and and as they get the vision they
[1:47:31] give birth to the baby and
[1:47:32] you say she said now i'm gonna have to
[1:47:34] give this baby up to god a little baby
[1:47:37] i'ma have to give this baby up to god
[1:47:39] send it down the nile river and i don't
[1:47:41] know what's gonna happen with my baby
[1:47:43] but lord i trust what you said i'm just
[1:47:46] gonna give my baby to you and let you
[1:47:48] take care of it
[1:47:48] sometimes mamas you get yourself in a
[1:47:50] situation the only person you can give
[1:47:52] that baby to
[1:47:53] is the god god gonna take care of it
[1:48:01] by faith she pushed the baby out the
[1:48:03] nile river down the nile river
[1:48:05] crocodiles there snakes there all kind
[1:48:07] of trouble that's waiting for moses but
[1:48:09] but moses had a purpose so here
[1:48:13] moses in the nile river and and not one
[1:48:15] crocodile come nears it not
[1:48:17] one one one snake come near nothing
[1:48:19] bothers a baby and here comes mother's
[1:48:21] sister just walking down
[1:48:22] watching where the baby goes
[1:48:25] and by the grace of god the baby
[1:48:28] ends up in pharaoh's court
[1:48:32] with pharaoh's daughter and here she's
[1:48:34] you know she said she looked at the baby
[1:48:36] and
[1:48:36] and and the bible say how how how she
[1:48:38] just began to have compassion on the
[1:48:40] baby
[1:48:41] a little baby look she said a hebrew
[1:48:43] baby now she should have killed her but
[1:48:45] she had compassion on the baby
[1:48:47] and they're here moses sisters say now
[1:48:49] you know uh they're kind of trying to
[1:48:51] figure out so this this baby we want to
[1:48:53] take care of the baby but none of us
[1:48:54] been pregnant and um so milk not really
[1:48:57] flowing through our veins we don't know
[1:48:58] how we're going to feed this baby we'll
[1:48:59] know
[1:49:00] what we're going to do and bonuses to
[1:49:01] say would you like me to find one of the
[1:49:03] hebrew mothers
[1:49:05] to come and take care of the child she
[1:49:07] said go
[1:49:09] you know where miriam went home
[1:49:12] she would knock it on the front to mama
[1:49:14] mama i got something i got something
[1:49:15] you're gonna have to sit down
[1:49:17] and let me tell you what happened you
[1:49:19] know that baby you released
[1:49:20] uh my little brother so he ended up in
[1:49:22] pharaoh's court and pharaoh's daughter
[1:49:24] has it and she's looking for
[1:49:26] a hebrew mother that would come and take
[1:49:29] nurse to baby for
[1:49:30] and train the baby and teach the baby
[1:49:33] she's looking for a hebrew mother and
[1:49:34] mama i can think of nobody else to do
[1:49:36] this
[1:49:39] but you when you release things to god
[1:49:41] god got a way of doing things
[1:49:43] because god allowed moses mama
[1:49:46] to raise him in pharaoh's house
[1:49:49] teach him the things of god and while
[1:49:52] she did all that
[1:49:53] the the good news the the
[1:49:56] the the cream i mean on top of this
[1:49:59] the cherry on the top is that she got
[1:50:02] paid
[1:50:03] for taking care of her own baby
[1:50:13] what a god we serve
[1:50:16] but she raised moses and told him that
[1:50:18] he was going to be the deliverer she she
[1:50:20] sold
[1:50:20] positive things into moses and moses
[1:50:22] grew up in that
[1:50:24] with that in his mind and mama's i'm
[1:50:26] going to tell you what are you sort of
[1:50:27] in your children's mind right now what
[1:50:28] are you telling what do you say
[1:50:29] don't tell them things that you ain't
[1:50:31] gonna never be nothing
[1:50:32] you're gonna be just like your daddy
[1:50:34] don't tell them things like that unless
[1:50:36] they daddy positive
[1:50:39] you're gonna be a doctor you're gonna be
[1:50:40] a lawyer you you got brains you you are
[1:50:43] a smart child
[1:50:45] you awesome child find out what their
[1:50:47] gifts are and encourage them in their
[1:50:50] gifts
[1:50:54] but because she did the right thing with
[1:50:56] her son she feared the lord
[1:50:59] later on she was praised because her son
[1:51:02] like brother brother branham said
[1:51:03] uh is he stands i mean her son's
[1:51:07] uh we quote him still today when we read
[1:51:09] the scripture
[1:51:10] moses did this moses did that moses
[1:51:12] great prophet of god
[1:51:13] because he was under the right care of a
[1:51:15] mother notice the father wasn't able to
[1:51:16] go to the
[1:51:18] the palace to train them mama did
[1:51:26] i want to go back to the scripture let's
[1:51:28] go back to proverbs 31.
[1:51:33] uh and just we i i i i am going to take
[1:51:36] time and read it i am because i am going
[1:51:38] to skip it
[1:51:39] but i want i want to i was looking here
[1:51:41] in my bible and they they
[1:51:43] they said this is 22 points
[1:51:46] about an excellent wife 22 points
[1:51:51] we hear in proverbs 31 verse 10 let's
[1:51:53] start there
[1:51:55] and verse 10 is just tell us that if you
[1:51:57] got a good wife or you got a good mother
[1:52:00] the first thing you need to know she's
[1:52:02] rare
[1:52:04] you don't find that many of them round
[1:52:06] she's red so appreciate what you got
[1:52:08] the bible says who can find a virtuous
[1:52:10] woman but her price is far above
[1:52:13] rubies she's rare uh verse 11
[1:52:17] uh we find that she's trustworthy

[2:00:53] now i'm coming down to the close of my
[2:00:55] sermon here and i
[2:00:58] i want to take some time to do something
[2:01:00] that i don't think i've ever done
[2:01:02] and i'm gonna take time to do it today
[2:01:06] first of all i i'm grateful
[2:01:11] um that the lord has
[2:01:16] blessed me with a mom wonderful mom
[2:01:20] god fearing woman of god i recently
[2:01:24] had to go through a little surgery there
[2:01:26] and the doctor that was performing the
[2:01:27] surgery
[2:01:28] asked her in the office are you a woman
[2:01:30] of god she said yes
[2:01:31] i am and you know and she ain't got to
[2:01:35] you know kind of say that and be like um
[2:01:38] no she can say that with confidence yes
[2:01:41] yes i am a woman of god
[2:01:44] he said well i'm a man of god and i just
[2:01:45] want to pray with you before we do
[2:01:47] we go through this procedure and it just
[2:01:49] brought a comfort and god brought her
[2:01:50] peace and everything and she went
[2:01:52] through the procedure we thank god for
[2:01:53] that but
[2:01:54] i want to just take time to give credit
[2:01:55] to my mother who taught me the things of
[2:01:57] god
[2:01:59] she was a real example to me and she
[2:02:00] taught me the things of god
[2:02:02] a couple of things i wrote down here she
[2:02:04] encouraged me to read the book of
[2:02:06] proverbs
[2:02:07] as a young man and much of what i read
[2:02:10] helped
[2:02:10] to shape the decisions that i made in my
[2:02:12] life and i didn't want to read proverbs
[2:02:14] but my mama was the one that said
[2:02:15] jack just read proverbs just read
[2:02:17] proverbs and i remember you know there
[2:02:19] was a particular situation in proverbs
[2:02:21] where
[2:02:21] uh it warned a young man about going
[2:02:23] down a certain street
[2:02:25] because there'd be a lady there waiting
[2:02:26] for him lurking just waiting for him
[2:02:28] and uh and and he don't realize this
[2:02:30] lady got she gonna be trying to use some
[2:02:32] charm
[2:02:33] she's gonna be trying to use some some
[2:02:35] other things and she got a trap set for
[2:02:36] him
[2:02:37] and my mama would just kind of tell me
[2:02:38] just read that and i remember you know
[2:02:40] being at work and it got me a good job
[2:02:42] but uh but she knew i was surrounded on
[2:02:44] that job by a lot of ladies that didn't
[2:02:45] mean
[2:02:46] no good and just say jack be careful
[2:02:49] jack watch this jack watch that now i'm
[2:02:51] a grown man i'm thinking i ain't mommy
[2:02:53] you'll need to tell me that but when
[2:02:54] mama say that i know she's trying to
[2:02:55] tell me something without telling me
[2:02:57] something
[2:02:57] maybe she heard something that i heard
[2:02:59] because women talk amongst women
[2:03:02] praise the lord so jack be careful so i
[2:03:04] learned just be careful
[2:03:05] and one of the things that i always do
[2:03:07] when i go to work i'm going to give
[2:03:08] y'all brothers
[2:03:08] just a piece of advice when you go to
[2:03:10] work in your mayor always talk about
[2:03:11] your wife
[2:03:13] in front of other women i mean always my
[2:03:16] wife said this and my wife did that
[2:03:18] and what happens they begin to pick up
[2:03:20] on the subtle hints
[2:03:22] that this man is not just married this
[2:03:25] man is happily
[2:03:27] married all right
[2:03:31] i thank god for her corrections and
[2:03:32] teaching me
[2:03:34] even when i didn't want to be corrected
[2:03:37] but her correction and her teaching me
[2:03:38] kept me out of jail and kept me off the
[2:03:40] streets
[2:03:42] i thank god for my mother i remember
[2:03:45] my mother was the one that discouraged
[2:03:47] me from going to the military
[2:03:49] i had in my mind that i was going to go
[2:03:50] to the air force and and mama told me
[2:03:53] that that wasn't a place for a man like
[2:03:55] me
[2:03:57] mama went to the marines and she knew
[2:03:58] what the military life was all about
[2:04:01] and so she said military is not uh not
[2:04:03] for a young man like you mama knew that
[2:04:05] there were certain qualities in me
[2:04:06] that had not come to fruition even at
[2:04:08] that time but her
[2:04:09] wisdom even though i didn't want to hear
[2:04:11] it
[2:04:14] is what brought me to the place that i
[2:04:15] am today i thank god
[2:04:19] for my mother
[2:04:23] my mom remained committed to praying for
[2:04:25] her family
[2:04:27] even when we were all walking contrary
[2:04:29] to the word of god
[2:04:31] i appreciate her prayers because his
[2:04:33] prayers has brought me to where i am
[2:04:35] today i thank god for my mother
[2:04:41] one of the things that happened in my
[2:04:42] mama's life
[2:04:44] is that she got to a spot where she
[2:04:46] really began to search for truth
[2:04:50] she we had gone to the baptist church
[2:04:52] and we had gone to the pentecostal
[2:04:53] church we had done a lot of things but
[2:04:55] she wanted
[2:04:56] truth
[2:05:00] and my mom was the only one to find out
[2:05:02] that knew where her pastor and the
[2:05:03] pastor's wife was
[2:05:05] at the time the church was going through
[2:05:07] a lot of things we didn't know what was
[2:05:08] going on but my mom was the only one in
[2:05:09] the church knew where the pastor was he
[2:05:10] was gone for two weeks
[2:05:12] pastor went to find truth and pastor
[2:05:15] esco came and brought truth back here
[2:05:18] and that truth changed my life mama
[2:05:20] didn't realize as she was searching for
[2:05:22] truth that one day she would worship
[2:05:25] in spirit and in truth
[2:05:32] i thank god for my mother
[2:05:39] it's a little statement that is made
[2:05:46] that brother branham says here let me
[2:05:49] just give this
[2:05:50] jehovah jairus is the messenger i want
[2:05:51] to read from and then i'm going to bring
[2:05:53] this to a close
[2:05:55] jehovah jireh and so
[2:05:58] actually you know what let me do let me
[2:06:00] do uh
[2:06:02] no that's fine that's right it says and
[2:06:04] it says
[2:06:06] and so but if there is any credit to be
[2:06:08] given to the branham family
[2:06:10] and can i put the duff family let it go
[2:06:13] to her
[2:06:14] she's the one who deserves it who's he
[2:06:16] talking to now talking about his wife
[2:06:19] she stands between me and the public
[2:06:22] 37 years almost 37 years old almost
[2:06:26] completely white-headed and a real
[2:06:27] mother sweetheart a wife and look

[2:07:02] family
[2:07:04] uh when we come to church here praying

[2:07:29] help to this church
[2:07:31] i thank god for her sacrifice i thank
[2:07:33] god for her desire to want to do that

[2:09:34] how she
[2:09:37] um let me put it this way when when she
[2:09:40] is cooking
[2:09:41] there's a tremendous sacrifice that she
[2:09:43] makes because everybody got different

[2:09:54] mothers but but but
[2:09:56] but she realized that everybody got
[2:09:57] something a little look look that

[2:10:02] take that in
[2:10:04] it don't process it right right so i
[2:10:06] just can't do it but she realizes the
[2:10:08] likes and dislikes and sometimes she's

[2:10:11] multiple meals

[2:11:57] [Applause]
[2:12:02] i want to tell you today your sacrifice
[2:12:04] might not have been noticed by others
[2:12:06] but it was certainly noticed by god
[2:12:10] i watched my wife delay school and her
[2:12:14] career in order to take care
[2:12:16] of our family when i met her and we were
[2:12:18] recording one of her desires was to grow
[2:12:20] up and be a nurse that's what she wanted
[2:12:22] to follow the
[2:12:23] footsteps of a relative she wanted to
[2:12:25] grow up and be a nurse
[2:12:26] and uh to those that might be nurses
[2:12:28] here happy nurses week last week i
[2:12:31] believe
[2:12:32] yeah happy nurses week but uh but uh she
[2:12:34] wanted to
[2:12:35] be a nurse but actually if you ever sit
[2:12:38] down and really talk to my wife you
[2:12:39] realize that she could be also a lawyer
[2:12:45] but she gave all that up in order to be
[2:12:48] a mother
[2:12:51] and i appreciate that um i really
[2:12:54] appreciate that and and not only that
[2:12:56] i look at look at you know these things
[2:12:57] where she could have been a nurse she
[2:12:58] could have been a lawyer it could have
[2:12:59] been this could have been that
[2:13:01] but god chose for her to be the first
[2:13:02] lady at spirit of truth tabernacle
[2:13:07] and also blessed her to co-lead
[2:13:11] a home health business she wanted to be
[2:13:13] a nurse but now she's the
[2:13:15] co-owner of a home health business
[2:13:18] god knows how to turn things around
[2:13:22] he's always mindful of our desires and i
[2:13:25] just want to say
[2:13:26] she truly is a virtuous woman she's
[2:13:28] marked with courage
[2:13:31] and she's my personal hero
[2:13:41] to your mothers i just want to read a
[2:13:43] little poem here for it for you and i'm
[2:13:44] going to close this is that this is
[2:13:46] mysteries of motherhood by
[2:13:49] rhett bradley says mother's hearing
[2:13:53] she does not hear the car alarm the
[2:13:55] neighbor's music or the noise of playing
[2:13:56] children
[2:13:57] but from the other end of the house in
[2:13:59] the middle of the night she will hear a
[2:14:00] child's slightest
[2:14:02] whimper mother's mind
[2:14:06] she may not comprehend comprehend on how
[2:14:08] to use the latest technology
[2:14:10] but she understands a child's heart what
[2:14:13] whenever
[2:14:14] it hurts mother strength
[2:14:18] she may she may be too weak and
[2:14:19] exhausted to carry groceries in from the
[2:14:21] car how many out on
[2:14:22] her mama said come and get help me get
[2:14:24] these groceries she might be too weak or
[2:14:26] too exhausted to get
[2:14:28] the groceries from the car but she's
[2:14:29] strong enough to intimidate any who
[2:14:31] threatens her children
[2:14:37] mother's memory she may not remember
[2:14:39] where she put her keys
[2:14:41] or even the reason why she walked into
[2:14:43] the room
[2:14:45] but she never forgets the wonderful
[2:14:46] things her children do
[2:14:48] and say mother's clothes
[2:14:52] her clothes aren't so perfect they're
[2:14:54] stained by babies burps and last month's
[2:14:57] lasagna
[2:14:58] but each stain is a badge of love and
[2:15:00] service equal
[2:15:01] to anyone by a soldier
[2:15:05] mother's hands all she sees are the
[2:15:07] lines and wrinkles in her hands
[2:15:09] and longs for their youthful appearance
[2:15:10] but she forgets their weak
[2:15:12] she forgets their she forgets their wear
[2:15:15] speaks of love
[2:15:16] devotion and sacrifice
[2:15:21] mother's shape
[2:15:24] she sighs and moans when she cannot fit
[2:15:28] into the clothes of her youth
[2:15:31] but her shape and stretch marks are like
[2:15:33] battle scars which say kids
[2:15:36] you're worth it
[2:15:40] mother's eyes the mirror tells her that
[2:15:43] her eyes lack
[2:15:44] sparkle but the bags and fatigue betray
[2:15:47] love
[2:15:48] and burns bright all night long
[2:15:52] mother's career she is haunted sometimes
[2:15:55] by what she could have been
[2:15:59] but she equips generations and shapes
[2:16:03] the world's
[2:16:04] future
[2:16:07] mother's trust she doesn't trust enough
[2:16:09] to let you near the strange dog
[2:16:12] or to climb to the tip top branch but
[2:16:15] she believes in you when you're
[2:16:16] discouraged
[2:16:17] and full of self-doubt
[2:16:22] mother's significance she regrets
[2:16:26] her failures mourns her anger
[2:16:30] and she drink dread she is warping her
[2:16:32] children's
[2:16:33] psyches but she so tightly bonds her
[2:16:37] children to her heart
[2:16:39] that they will grow up
[2:16:43] but not away
[2:16:49] happy mother's day to all of our mothers
[2:16:59] let's pray
[2:17:02] father
[2:17:07] we want to take the moment we want to
[2:17:09] take the time
[2:17:10] we need to take more time but we want to
[2:17:12] take this moment this time
[2:17:16] to first thank you for the mothers that
[2:17:18] you've given us
[2:17:22] we wouldn't be the people that we are
[2:17:24] today i believe every child in here
[2:17:25] could say that we wouldn't be the people
[2:17:27] we are today if we didn't have the
[2:17:28] mother
[2:17:29] that you gave us
[2:17:32] thank you for shaping her and thank you
[2:17:34] for making her thank you for molding her
[2:17:36] thank you for keeping her thank you for
[2:17:39] revealing yourself to her
[2:17:41] because she could pass that down to us
[2:17:45] god we're we're we're truly grateful
[2:17:48] for what you've done and for the father
[2:17:50] we realize that we are
[2:17:52] next generation we're raising kids and
[2:17:54] grandkids and father we have to uh
[2:17:56] kind of take the same examples that our
[2:17:58] mothers taught us and
[2:17:59] lord do the the very best that we can
[2:18:04] father we know that if you're leading us
[2:18:05] we'll make it we'll be just fine
[2:18:09] i'm reminded of this quote lord that the
[2:18:11] prophet taught and maybe some mothers
[2:18:12] look around here today and they don't
[2:18:14] see all their children gathered around
[2:18:16] but the prophet told us that
[2:18:20] when mother sees the kid is gathered at
[2:18:22] the table at home and they're
[2:18:24] she's just so happy to see everybody
[2:18:27] there and dad there just
[2:18:28] everybody in their proper places it just
[2:18:30] does it just gives such
[2:18:32] joy to a mother it also says that if if
[2:18:36] it does it that way on earth
[2:18:38] then god you won't let it be lacking in
[2:18:41] heaven
[2:18:43] that somehow majestic fingers
[2:18:46] will unravel and untie the knots that
[2:18:49] are in
[2:18:50] a man the minds of our children
[2:18:53] and god somehow you'll bring them and
[2:18:54] set them free that they will be able to
[2:18:56] gather at the table
[2:18:58] on the other side we long for that we
[2:19:00] look for that
[2:19:03] i pray o god that you would bless each
[2:19:05] and every mother
[2:19:07] that has walked through this church
[2:19:08] today lord to hear the word of god bless
