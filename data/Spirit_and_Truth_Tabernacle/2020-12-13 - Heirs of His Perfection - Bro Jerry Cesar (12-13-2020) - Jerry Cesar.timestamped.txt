[45:58] i am very excited to be here with you
[46:00] this morning
[46:02] um i can't thank god enough for this
[46:05] year
[46:06] despite of everything the spite of the
[46:09] major trials this world
[46:11] has undergone god has been faithful to
[46:13] his word to his bride
[46:15] and we're so grateful to be here this
[46:17] morning uh we're going to
[46:19] turn into a scripture this morning we're
[46:22] going to start in the
[46:23] book of romans chapter 8.
[46:36] and i just as we turn into that
[46:39] scripture
[46:40] romans chapter 8 verse 12. this is where
[46:42] we begin
[46:44] i just want to remind everyone that uh
[46:47] you know just before um
[46:50] we were faced with such a battle when we
[46:53] had to
[46:54] revert to streaming our services
[46:57] primarily
[46:58] we had such a mighty time in the
[47:00] presence of the lord god did some mighty
[47:02] things here
[47:03] and the enemy didn't like that and and
[47:06] i'm i'm under expectation when we
[47:08] uh when we all can assemble the bible
[47:10] says forsake not the assembling of the
[47:12] saints
[47:13] when we can gather together uh everyone
[47:16] bringing their fire i'm just under
[47:18] expectation
[47:19] uh that we're gonna see a mighty move of
[47:21] god
[47:22] and and even now we can expect that to
[47:25] be taking place so we thank the lord and
[47:27] and may everyone come with their
[47:28] shouting voice may everyone come with
[47:31] their praise
[47:32] so we'll read at the 12th verse of
[47:35] romans so it
[47:36] it starts by saying therefore brethren
[47:41] we are debtors not to the flesh
[47:45] to live after the flesh for if
[47:48] ye after the flesh ye if ye live
[47:52] after the flesh ye shall die but if you
[47:55] through the spirit do mortify
[47:57] the deeds of the body ye shall live
[48:00] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[48:02] god they are the sons of god
[48:05] for ye have not received the spirit of
[48:08] bondage again
[48:09] to fear but ye have received the spirit
[48:11] of adoption
[48:13] whereby we cry abba father
[48:16] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[48:18] our spirit
[48:19] that we are the children of god and if
[48:22] children
[48:23] then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs
[48:26] with christ
[48:27] if so be that we suffer with him
[48:30] that we might may be also glorified
[48:33] together
[48:35] and i'm also going to turn to another
[48:36] scripture matthew chapter 5
[48:38] verse 48 a short
[48:42] verse there and it reads
[48:45] be ye therefore perfect
[48:48] even as your father which is in heaven
[48:51] is perfect
[48:53] you may have your seats i trust you are
[48:55] standing for the reading of the lord
[48:58] god bless you
[49:07] so if i could use as a title this
[49:09] morning it would be
[49:11] heirs of his perfection
[49:14] and the scripture says jesus now is
[49:18] speaking to us telling us
[49:19] uh as a commandment be therefore perfect
[49:24] even as your father which is in heaven
[49:26] is perfect
[49:27] right now god requires perfection
[49:31] that's the only thing and only way a
[49:34] believer today is going to be found
[49:36] before god it's by perfection
[49:39] uh but before i go any further i want to
[49:41] go back to romans chapter 8
[49:44] and i want to read that verse again i
[49:47] want to go back to
[49:49] i want to go back to verse 13 right it
[49:51] says for if ye
[49:52] live after the flesh ye shall die
[49:56] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[49:59] the deeds of the body ye shall live and
[50:02] that word mortify i want to stress on
[50:04] that a little bit
[50:05] because that word mortified means to
[50:08] subdue
[50:09] it means to suppress to control
[50:12] to a punish and is saying if we can
[50:16] mortify the deeds of the body he shall
[50:18] live
[50:19] so whatever you're going through this
[50:20] morning whatever the your body is
[50:23] is is manifesting if you through the
[50:26] spirit
[50:26] mortified the deeds of that body you
[50:30] shall live
[50:31] right and to mortified through the
[50:34] spirit is the possession of man
[50:36] it's the possession of the believer
[50:38] right
[50:39] now if we keep going it says for as many
[50:42] as are led by the spirit of god
[50:44] they are the sons of god and i like this
[50:47] here
[50:48] for ye have not received the spirit of
[50:50] bondage
[50:51] again to fear now we're gonna hold on
[50:54] there
[50:55] whatever you're going through this
[50:56] morning
[50:58] for ye have not received a bonded the
[51:00] spirit of bondage again to fear that
[51:02] means there was a time you were in
[51:03] bondage
[51:05] there was a time where your situation
[51:07] had dominion over you
[51:09] there was a time where bondage was
[51:12] had rulership over you but now
[51:15] it's saying ye have not received the
[51:17] spirit of bondage
[51:19] again to fear but you have received a
[51:22] spirit of adoption
[51:23] right and that spirit of adoption
[51:25] whereby we cry
[51:27] our father now sometimes the lord is
[51:30] going to place you in situations
[51:31] for you to cry out to god and if we
[51:34] could just go
[51:35] to the story of samson very quickly
[51:38] sampson was put into
[51:39] a situation that he should have never
[51:42] been a part of
[51:44] but in the midst of it he was put in a
[51:47] place where he had to cry out to god
[51:49] and in judges chapter 16 will turn there
[51:52] very quickly
[52:02] judges chapter 16 we'll start at the um
[52:08] we'll start at the 26th verse
[52:12] now it says and simpson said
[52:15] unto the lad that held him by the hand
[52:18] suffer me that i may feel the pillars
[52:21] whereupon the house standeth that i may
[52:23] lean upon them
[52:24] now the house was full of man and woman
[52:27] and all the lords of the philistines
[52:29] were there
[52:30] and there were upon the roof about 3 000
[52:32] men and women
[52:33] that beheld while samson made sport now
[52:36] they were taking pleasure
[52:38] in samson's bondage they were taking
[52:41] a joy and seeing samson in the condition
[52:45] he was in
[52:46] but samson called unto the lord
[52:49] samson made the lord his pursuit
[52:53] and it goes on to say oh lord
[52:56] remember me i pray thee and strengthen
[52:59] me i pray thee
[53:00] only this once oh god that i may be
[53:03] at once avenge of the philistines for my
[53:06] two eyes
[53:08] and the story goes on and saying samson
[53:10] took hold of the two middle pillars upon
[53:12] which the house stood
[53:14] in which it was born born up of the one
[53:18] with his right hand in the other with
[53:19] his left hand and samson said let me
[53:22] die with the philistines and he bound
[53:24] himself
[53:25] with all his might in the house of uh
[53:27] fell upon the lord's
[53:28] and upon the people that were therein so
[53:32] the dead which he slew at his death were
[53:34] more
[53:35] than they which he slew in his life and
[53:38] and you see
[53:40] when you're going through something and
[53:41] you can make the lord your pursuit
[53:44] god will allow you to have victory over
[53:46] your trials
[53:47] and when the scripture goes to say
[53:51] you have not received the spirit of
[53:52] bondage again to fear
[53:54] but you have received the spirit of
[53:56] adoption
[53:58] god wants you to be elevated god wants
[54:01] you
[54:01] to be higher god wants you to be more
[54:04] than you were yesterday
[54:05] that's the god that we serve and i want
[54:08] to take another example
[54:11] first samuel chapter 30.
[54:21] and i like this here because we see
[54:24] david
[54:27] he left his camp he left his place
[54:32] and he he journeyed elsewhere and he
[54:34] missed while he was gone the enemy
[54:36] came in and devoured his place
[54:39] the enemy came and and and
[54:43] complete the destruction and not only
[54:46] that but the
[54:46] enemy took captive of what david
[54:49] possessed
[54:50] but we'll start at the ver this is first
[54:54] samuel chapter 30.
[55:04] and we'll start at the first verse now
[55:07] it says
[55:08] and it came to pass when david and his
[55:11] men
[55:11] were come to ziklag on the third day
[55:14] that the amalekites had invaded the
[55:17] south and ziklag
[55:18] and smit and ziklag and burned it with
[55:20] fire
[55:21] and had and had taken the woman captives
[55:24] that there that were therein
[55:26] they slew not any either great or small
[55:29] but carried them away and went on their
[55:31] way
[55:32] now it goes on and we'll jump to verse
[55:36] um six it says and david was greatly
[55:39] distressed
[55:41] for the people's sake for the speak
[55:43] people spake of stoning him
[55:45] because the soul of the people were
[55:46] grieved every man for his sons and for
[55:48] his daughters
[55:50] but david encouraged himself in the lord
[55:52] his god
[55:54] and whatever you're going through
[55:55] sometimes you're going to have to
[55:56] encourage yourself in the lord
[55:58] and encouraging yourself in the lord is
[56:02] bowing down on your knees praying to god
[56:05] and god himself will remind you of the
[56:08] things
[56:08] he's already promised now
[56:13] and what david was going through
[56:16] in verse 8 the scripture says in david
[56:19] inquired of the lord
[56:20] saying shall i pursue after hit this
[56:24] troop
[56:25] shall i overtake them and he answered
[56:28] him
[56:29] pursue for thou shalt surely overtake
[56:32] them
[56:32] and without fail recover all
[56:36] and i like this because god
[56:39] already knows the end of your enemies
[56:42] and and not only does he know the end of
[56:44] your enemies but god is also at your
[56:46] finish line
[56:47] and because god is at your finish line
[56:50] god is waiting for you to get there
[56:52] god is waiting for you to get to where
[56:54] he is because
[56:56] the only way you're going gonna get to
[56:57] where god is is
[56:59] by the word through the word right by
[57:02] pursuing and crying of the lord
[57:04] so when you find yourself in a trial in
[57:06] a situation
[57:08] and your body is not coming to the uh
[57:11] your confession inquire of the lord
[57:13] because the lord has already made a way
[57:16] and this thought came to me god
[57:19] typically when you go when you're racing
[57:21] and running a course
[57:23] you're running to the finish line but as
[57:25] a believer you're not running to the
[57:27] finish line
[57:28] you're running back to the finish line
[57:30] because you already made it
[57:32] right and god the finish line
[57:36] represents the seed the seed of god
[57:40] the seed meaning the beginning and
[57:44] the scripture says the sea will
[57:45] reproduce after its own kind
[57:48] and if you are of the seed of god
[57:51] you will whip that seed from the very
[57:53] beginning
[57:55] and we'll jump towards we'll jump to the
[57:58] same chapter
[58:00] and because david inquired of the lord
[58:04] verse 17 it says
[58:08] and david smote them from the twilight
[58:12] even unto the evening of the next day
[58:15] and their escape not a man of them
[58:18] save 400 young man which wrote upon
[58:21] camels and fled
[58:23] and david recovered all that the
[58:26] amalekites had carried away and david
[58:28] rescued his two daughters
[58:30] and there was nothing lacking to them
[58:33] neither small
[58:34] nor great neither sons nor daughters
[58:36] neither spoiled
[58:38] nor anything that had taken to them
[58:40] david
[58:41] recovered all and if you want to make
[58:45] this personal
[58:46] you can put your name there and say
[58:48] brother jack recovered all
[58:50] brother troy recovered all brother simba
[58:53] recovered all
[58:54] sister rachel recovered all right and
[58:57] that's the report that we can expect of
[59:01] god when we pursue him and we're in the
[59:04] choir of the lord
[59:06] and i'm going to continue here and
[59:10] now the scripture says to be therefore
[59:14] perfect
[59:14] even as your father in heaven which
[59:16] which is in heaven is perfect
[59:19] now the prophet says here in the message
[59:22] speak to this mountain
[59:24] now it says i want to now i want to get
[59:27] just for a moment
[59:29] the infallibility of the word see
[59:33] to you first i want you to know that god
[59:36] is infinite
[59:37] he's so perfect that he knew everything
[59:39] that ever would be
[59:41] you believe that he knew that before the
[59:44] world was ever created
[59:46] that we'd be sitting here tonight if
[59:47] he's infinite if he isn't infinite then
[59:50] he isn't god so he is finite
[59:52] he's like we are but infinite there's no
[59:54] way to explain it and
[59:56] whatever god says is perfect he cannot
[59:59] improve it or take it back
[1:00:00] it's perfect because god is perfect
[1:00:03] and his words are perfect his promises
[1:00:06] can never fail
[1:00:07] now you must have that kind of faith in
[1:00:10] god when you read the bible to believe
[1:00:11] his promises
[1:00:13] the reason why we must have that kind of
[1:00:16] faith today
[1:00:17] is because we don't live by trials we
[1:00:21] live by god's promises
[1:00:23] and it goes on the prophet goes on to
[1:00:26] say
[1:00:26] you must remember he's perfect his words
[1:00:29] are perfect they can never fail
[1:00:31] they can never be improved they are
[1:00:33] perfect to start with
[1:00:35] now god is perfect which is why god
[1:00:39] requires perfection
[1:00:42] and god's perfection
[1:00:46] is what what is god's perfection how can
[1:00:49] a man be perfect
[1:00:51] we are a million miles away from perfect
[1:00:54] our nature is imperfect and if it's up
[1:00:57] to us
[1:00:58] we'll never be able to fulfill that
[1:01:01] expectation that god wants us to be
[1:01:03] perfect
[1:01:05] but there's a reason why god
[1:01:08] jesus can say to be perfect even as my
[1:01:11] father in heaven is perfect
[1:01:13] now if we go to the beginning in genesis
[1:01:16] chapter one
[1:01:18] we'll start at the 27th verse it says so
[1:01:22] god
[1:01:22] created man in his own image
[1:01:25] in the image of god created he him
[1:01:29] and female created he them and god
[1:01:32] blessed them and god said be fruitful
[1:01:35] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[1:01:37] subdue it
[1:01:38] and have dominion over the fish of the
[1:01:40] sea and over the fowl of the air
[1:01:42] and over every living thing that moveth
[1:01:45] upon
[1:01:45] the earth and man's purpose from the
[1:01:49] beginning
[1:01:50] was to be the very image of god
[1:01:55] but because of there was a separation
[1:02:00] from man and god god was
[1:02:03] a man when man was created man was
[1:02:07] in the image of god and what's god
[1:02:09] what's the image of god the image of god
[1:02:12] god is is certainly a spirit but the
[1:02:15] attributes of god
[1:02:17] is his father is power
[1:02:20] the attributes of god is redemption
[1:02:23] restoration
[1:02:24] and man was in the image and had
[1:02:26] dominion over everything
[1:02:28] now dominion means
[1:02:32] sovereignty over something stewardship
[1:02:35] supremacy while
[1:02:37] authority is the power to enforce rules
[1:02:40] or given orders
[1:02:42] and that's the position that man was in
[1:02:44] the beginning
[1:02:46] however man was given strict
[1:02:50] commandment to not eat of the tree of
[1:02:53] good and evil
[1:02:56] in the genesis chapter 2
[1:02:59] verse 8 it says in the lord god planted
[1:03:01] a garden eastward in eden
[1:03:03] and there he put man whom he had formed
[1:03:07] and out of the ground made the lord god
[1:03:09] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[1:03:11] the sight
[1:03:11] and good for food the tree of life also
[1:03:15] in the midst of the garden
[1:03:16] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:03:20] also in the garden now
[1:03:25] the tree there was a tree of life and
[1:03:28] there was a tree of good and evil
[1:03:31] and because men
[1:03:34] ate of the tree they were not supposed
[1:03:36] to eat from
[1:03:37] came separation and because of that
[1:03:40] separation
[1:03:41] god if man if adam
[1:03:45] had eaten of the tree of life
[1:03:48] to begin with there would have never
[1:03:51] been a fall
[1:03:52] if if if adam and eve
[1:03:55] ate to the in a tree of life to begin
[1:03:57] with the tree of life what is it what's
[1:04:00] tree of life
[1:04:02] the spoken word the spoken word
[1:04:05] was what was the god's intention
[1:04:09] and plan for the
[1:04:12] for adam and eve and
[1:04:16] if we can go on here i want to read a
[1:04:18] quick quote
[1:04:21] now this is the message earnestly
[1:04:24] contending for the faith that was once
[1:04:25] delivered to the saint
[1:04:27] the prophet says
[1:04:30] now in that day god guarded the tree to
[1:04:34] keep them from getting it
[1:04:35] and now the swords turn right back the
[1:04:38] other way now
[1:04:39] running them right into the tree so they
[1:04:41] will receive life
[1:04:43] driving people herding them up to the
[1:04:46] tree
[1:04:46] of life and that day in the garden of
[1:04:49] eden
[1:04:50] the tree of life was salvation the tree
[1:04:53] of life
[1:04:54] was eternal life but when they ate of
[1:04:58] the tree of good and knowledge of evil
[1:04:59] it came separation
[1:05:01] it came this distress it came
[1:05:04] death complete separation from god
[1:05:08] but god the
[1:05:12] tree of life had to be the way
[1:05:15] the tree of life is god's perfection
[1:05:18] perfected way and through the tree
[1:05:22] of life is how fellowship can be
[1:05:25] restored
[1:05:27] and
[1:05:32] in the message the spoken word is the
[1:05:34] original seed
[1:05:37] the prophet said in
[1:05:40] jesus this is paragraph 145 he said in
[1:05:44] jesus had to be broken
[1:05:47] open there in order for that seed to let
[1:05:49] forth its life
[1:05:51] to water other seeds that was coming
[1:05:54] do you see that's not even this fold
[1:05:57] i have they're going to see it they're
[1:06:00] they're going to get that word and stay
[1:06:02] right with it i'm sending forth the
[1:06:04] spirit to water it
[1:06:06] and it'll produce it just exactly it'll
[1:06:08] produce miracles
[1:06:10] it'll produce the power of god it'll
[1:06:12] produce
[1:06:13] and it will not it will not deny
[1:06:15] anything because it's a kindred seed
[1:06:18] with the seed and that was god's
[1:06:21] planning that's god's plan even now
[1:06:24] is to be restored back to the tree of
[1:06:26] life
[1:06:27] the tree of life is christ and the only
[1:06:30] way
[1:06:30] a believer can come into the tree of
[1:06:33] life today
[1:06:34] is by a born-again experience in john 3
[1:06:39] jesus goes to speak with nicodemus comes
[1:06:43] to jesus by night
[1:06:44] right and the reason nicodemus came to
[1:06:48] jesus
[1:06:48] was because he saw the miracles jesus
[1:06:50] was doing he wanted to
[1:06:52] understand miracles that was his
[1:06:54] question
[1:06:55] no man can do these miracles except god
[1:06:58] be with him
[1:06:59] now in this the way that jesus answered
[1:07:03] nicodemus
[1:07:05] nicodemus wanted to know about miracles
[1:07:08] but the only way he would understand
[1:07:10] what jesus was saying
[1:07:11] was if he became a miracle right jesus
[1:07:15] says
[1:07:15] except a man be born again of water
[1:07:19] he cannot see the kingdom of god except
[1:07:21] the man be born of water in the spirit
[1:07:23] he cannot see or enter into the kingdom
[1:07:27] of god
[1:07:28] and now nicodemus had to go through a
[1:07:31] miracle himself
[1:07:32] and a believer today through the
[1:07:35] born-again experience
[1:07:36] you're going through a miracle yourself
[1:07:39] because it's the word seed
[1:07:41] reproducing itself now
[1:07:45] being born again is a change in your
[1:07:48] nature
[1:07:49] your nature is not perfect and when
[1:07:52] you're born again through the spirit of
[1:07:54] god
[1:07:56] the nature of god himself can dwell in
[1:07:58] you
[1:07:59] and when his nature is dwelling in you
[1:08:01] you have the same authority that he has
[1:08:04] you have the same power that he has
[1:08:06] right and it's the power of the spoken
[1:08:08] word
[1:08:10] now
[1:08:14] you can be sanctified you can be
[1:08:17] given power to
[1:08:21] do such things receive that with the
[1:08:23] disciples
[1:08:24] when they went to when they were
[1:08:27] sanctified they went to go
[1:08:30] catch demons and do these different
[1:08:32] things and they came back
[1:08:33] rejoicing jesus says rejoice not because
[1:08:36] the the satan
[1:08:38] demons are subject unto you but rejoice
[1:08:40] because your
[1:08:41] your names are written in the lamb's
[1:08:43] book of life right
[1:08:45] and in matthew chapter 16
[1:08:54] i believe that's luke 22.
[1:08:57] luke chapter 22 when it's see
[1:09:07] luke chapter 22
[1:09:14] and the lord it's verse 31 and it says
[1:09:20] and the lord said simon simon
[1:09:23] behold satan hath desired to have you
[1:09:27] that he may sift you as wheat
[1:09:30] but i have prayed for thee that thy
[1:09:33] faith
[1:09:34] fell not and when thou art converted
[1:09:37] strengthen your brethren right peter had
[1:09:41] not been converted yet he was
[1:09:43] manifesting
[1:09:44] the miracles of god he had not been
[1:09:48] converted yet he was taking part in what
[1:09:51] the the things that god was doing
[1:09:54] right but we thank god because jesus
[1:09:57] himself prayed for peter
[1:09:59] and i can tell you today that jesus has
[1:10:01] already prayed for you
[1:10:03] whatever situation you're going through
[1:10:05] it's been prayed for
[1:10:06] you just need to believe and jesus told
[1:10:09] peter
[1:10:10] after when he's thou art converted
[1:10:13] strengthen your brethren and
[1:10:16] the important the importance of being
[1:10:20] born again
[1:10:21] is only through the word and it can't be
[1:10:25] mixed with anything else
[1:10:28] when a believer has accepted the lord
[1:10:31] jesus christ
[1:10:33] and you've been promised the baptism of
[1:10:36] the holy spirit
[1:10:38] but it has to be through the word now
[1:10:42] we he we hear many times the dispute
[1:10:45] about baptism now if a man is baptized
[1:10:49] in the father the son and the holy
[1:10:52] spirit
[1:10:52] he will not receive the baptism of the
[1:10:54] holy ghost
[1:10:56] only through the baptism of the lord
[1:10:57] jesus christ
[1:10:59] right paul
[1:11:02] he had an encounter with god
[1:11:05] and he had by revelation knew that
[1:11:08] baptism had to be through the lord jesus
[1:11:10] christ in
[1:11:12] acts chapter
[1:11:18] in next chapter 13.
[1:11:34] i'm going with paul toes tells the
[1:11:38] disciple
[1:11:39] in what manner were you baptized
[1:11:42] and what manner were you baptized
[1:11:44] because
[1:11:46] the disciples answered paul and said i
[1:11:48] was baptized unto john's rep
[1:11:51] with james brought john's baptism unto
[1:11:53] repentance
[1:11:54] but the lord but peter paul said that
[1:11:58] well you have to be baptized again in
[1:11:59] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:12:02] and only in the name of the lord jesus
[1:12:04] christ will you receive
[1:12:05] power by the holy spirit
[1:12:09] and that power is what man
[1:12:12] what the believers are needing today
[1:12:15] to have the spoken word authority
[1:12:20] now prophet says here
[1:12:23] in a spoken word is the original see it
[1:12:25] says all
[1:12:27] this is paragraph 161 all of god's sons
[1:12:31] must be the same yes sir to be
[1:12:34] born of the word and spirit brings us
[1:12:38] back to the spoken word again like in
[1:12:41] john 3
[1:12:41] see to be born of the water and the
[1:12:44] spirit
[1:12:45] what does it do then it brings you right
[1:12:48] back
[1:12:48] again to the place of where ye should
[1:12:51] have been
[1:12:52] at the beginning see that's the reason
[1:12:55] of christ's death
[1:12:57] bring us right back again to where
[1:13:00] sons of god and sons of god today
[1:13:06] is the the time is working towards it
[1:13:10] everything that's going on is working
[1:13:12] towards it so the sons of god can
[1:13:14] manifest
[1:13:15] what god was and who god is today is to
[1:13:18] bring us back
[1:13:19] into the perfection so we can be
[1:13:22] heirs of what christ possess
[1:13:30] now
[1:13:34] i'm going to go to genesis 17 here
[1:13:41] it says and when abram was 19
[1:13:44] 90 years old and nine the lord appeared
[1:13:47] to abram and said unto him
[1:13:49] i am the almighty god walk before me
[1:13:53] and be thou perfect and i will make my
[1:13:56] covenant between
[1:13:57] me and thee and will multiply thee
[1:14:00] exceedingly
[1:14:01] and abram fell on his face and god
[1:14:03] talked with him saying
[1:14:04] as for me behold my covenant is
[1:14:08] with thee and thou shalt be a father
[1:14:11] of many nations neither shall thy name
[1:14:13] be any more called
[1:14:14] abram but thy name shall be called for
[1:14:18] father abraham thy name shall be called
[1:14:20] abraham for father of many nations
[1:14:22] have i made thee and in romans chapter
[1:14:26] four
[1:14:29] verse 16
[1:14:32] verse 13 will start there it says for
[1:14:34] the promise
[1:14:35] that he should be the heir of the world
[1:14:39] was not to abram abraham or
[1:14:42] to his seed through the law but through
[1:14:44] the righteousness
[1:14:46] of faith for if they which
[1:14:49] are of the law be heirs faith is made
[1:14:52] void
[1:14:53] and the promise made none of none of
[1:14:54] fact but the law
[1:14:56] worketh wrath for where no law is there
[1:14:59] is no transgression
[1:15:00] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[1:15:04] by grace
[1:15:05] to the end of the promise might be sure
[1:15:07] to all
[1:15:08] his seed not to that only which is of
[1:15:11] the law
[1:15:12] but to that also which is of the faith
[1:15:15] of abraham
[1:15:16] who is the father of us unto all
[1:15:19] and that's the heirs of
[1:15:22] of perfection through faith
[1:15:25] and our faith today needs to be
[1:15:29] renewed only in the word because faith
[1:15:32] only recognizes the word
[1:15:34] faith only recognizes what god has
[1:15:37] already done
[1:15:38] and that's what we're restored to it's
[1:15:41] that
[1:15:42] faith right and
[1:15:58] i had a quote i wanted to read here but
[1:16:00] i can't find it
[1:16:02] but we're gonna we're gonna continue
[1:16:08] now abraham and all that he was going
[1:16:12] through
[1:16:12] uh um as god gave him promise
[1:16:16] and created a had a covenant with him
[1:16:20] now abraham we we
[1:16:23] understand that he wasn't a perfect man
[1:16:26] he was not a perfect man abraham lied
[1:16:29] about sarah being his wife
[1:16:32] but god didn't look at abraham at
[1:16:35] all based on what he did but who he was
[1:16:40] because god knew abraham was his seed
[1:16:44] and this is why in romans uh chapter 4
[1:16:48] it could say in verse 20 he staggered
[1:16:51] not
[1:16:51] at the promised of god through unbelief
[1:16:53] but was strong through faith
[1:16:56] giving glory to god and being fully
[1:16:59] persuaded
[1:17:00] that what he had promised he was able to
[1:17:02] perform
[1:17:04] and that's what god recognizes
[1:17:08] and that's what god recognizes in a
[1:17:10] believer today
[1:17:11] god recognizes his faith
[1:17:15] because it's his faith that god has
[1:17:18] given his believer to believe the word
[1:17:20] only the believer and
[1:17:27] i wish to also read
[1:17:35] hebrews chapter 2
[1:17:38] verse 14
[1:17:43] for as much then as the children of our
[1:17:46] partakers of flesh and blood
[1:17:48] he also himself likewise took part of
[1:17:51] the same
[1:17:52] that through death he might destroy the
[1:17:54] work the power
[1:17:56] of death that is the devil and deliver
[1:17:59] them who through fear of death were all
[1:18:03] their lifetime subject to bondage for
[1:18:06] verily he took not of him the nature of
[1:18:08] angels
[1:18:09] but he took of him the seed of abraham
[1:18:12] wherefore in
[1:18:13] all things it behooved him to be made
[1:18:16] like unto his brethren
[1:18:17] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[1:18:20] high priest and things pertaining to god
[1:18:23] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[1:18:25] the people
[1:18:26] for in that he himself has suffered
[1:18:28] being tempted
[1:18:29] he is able to secure them that are
[1:18:31] tempted
[1:18:32] right so in a situation where a believer
[1:18:35] goes through
[1:18:37] trial after trial after trial the reason
[1:18:40] why
[1:18:41] god can identify with a believer
[1:18:44] is because he's been tempted above all
[1:18:46] measure he's gone through
[1:18:49] the greatest trial that we can
[1:18:52] ever imagine and the same way that
[1:18:56] we can can't imagine his glory is the
[1:18:59] same way that we can't imagine his
[1:19:01] suffering
[1:19:02] but no way a believer can reign with
[1:19:04] christ today
[1:19:05] is by suffering with christ right
[1:19:09] and considering a rejoice a joy to be
[1:19:12] counted a a a partaker with christ
[1:19:15] in his sufferings
[1:19:19] but branham says here in the message
[1:19:25] god perfecting his church he says
[1:19:28] brothers
[1:19:29] and sisters we have it abstract
[1:19:32] this is paragraph 22 brothers and
[1:19:35] sisters we have
[1:19:36] an abstract written d tonight to
[1:19:38] salvation and divine healing
[1:19:40] and the devil has no rights trust god in
[1:19:43] the holy ghost to put him out
[1:19:45] that's all amen say i feel religious
[1:19:48] somehow i really do now notice god
[1:19:51] promised it
[1:19:52] god's obligated to take care of it and
[1:19:55] this blood cell
[1:19:56] where he formed moved into the womb
[1:19:59] covered himself
[1:20:01] over with his own creative blood bought
[1:20:04] brought forth the sun christ jesus
[1:20:06] the blood cell was broken at calvary
[1:20:10] the blood run out of his body in order
[1:20:13] that he could bring
[1:20:14] back into himself fellowship and
[1:20:18] i like what it says here the blood cell
[1:20:21] was broken
[1:20:22] at calvary and this is just the thought
[1:20:25] but
[1:20:25] the reason why the blood cell had to be
[1:20:28] broken is because it had to be
[1:20:29] distributed to the believers the blood
[1:20:32] cell
[1:20:33] broken at calvary i was able to
[1:20:36] identify what every brokenness of a
[1:20:38] believer goes through today
[1:20:40] and through our brokenness as brother
[1:20:43] quaku says
[1:20:44] we can be made a masterpiece because the
[1:20:46] blood was perfect
[1:20:48] the life laid in the blood and
[1:20:51] the blood is that spirit that spirit
[1:20:54] today that can give the believer the
[1:20:56] source of life in the restoration to be
[1:20:58] back
[1:20:59] to god's perfect fellowship
[1:21:03] the spoken word was so that it might
[1:21:07] bring fulfillment of scripture
[1:21:09] the spoken word is now that it would be
[1:21:12] fulfilled in you
[1:21:15] now
[1:21:19] the prophet says here
[1:21:23] the law having a shadow
[1:21:27] the law having a shadow of things not
[1:21:29] even the real things to come
[1:21:32] with them sacrifices can never make the
[1:21:34] believer
[1:21:35] perfect but a believer once coming into
[1:21:37] christ
[1:21:38] and by one spirit baptized into that
[1:21:41] body
[1:21:42] he has perfected forever those
[1:21:45] that are in christ jesus then the things
[1:21:48] of the world
[1:21:49] any the worshiper once purged
[1:21:52] has no more conscience or the right
[1:21:54] interpretation of that has no
[1:21:56] more desire of sin for the worshipper
[1:21:58] once purge has no more desire or
[1:22:00] conscience of sin
[1:22:01] he doesn't even want to sin he will do
[1:22:04] things wrong as soon as he doesn't he
[1:22:07] will confess his sins
[1:22:09] right there and say god forgive me i
[1:22:11] mean i didn't mean to do that you know
[1:22:14] you know it father god never sees it but
[1:22:16] he has an advocate
[1:22:18] he has a confession and makes it makes
[1:22:20] it right
[1:22:22] and the god's requirement
[1:22:25] is perfection and the perfected way
[1:22:29] a believer can get in christ is it today
[1:22:33] is through the spirit the spirit is what
[1:22:35] gives life
[1:22:36] right the word is a seed but without
[1:22:40] the spirit the seed has no life the seed
[1:22:42] won't be able to grow
[1:22:45] it's like a a a egg
[1:22:48] as long as the egg is in the is in the
[1:22:51] nest
[1:22:52] but without the male the it's only eggs
[1:22:56] and it won't hatch
[1:22:58] and i wish to read something here
[1:23:13] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:23:18] now program 25
[1:23:21] prophet says i believe that it is near
[1:23:24] the harvest time the seeds have been
[1:23:27] planted
[1:23:28] denominations denominational seed of the
[1:23:31] churches
[1:23:32] such as the evangel evangelicals
[1:23:35] evangelicals the the baptist and
[1:23:36] presbyterian and lutheran
[1:23:38] and pentecostal seeds has been planted
[1:23:41] into the pentecostal organization
[1:23:44] by great men like oral roberts tommy
[1:23:46] hicks and tommy osborne
[1:23:48] great men of god see and i believe that
[1:23:51] the word of god has been planted
[1:23:53] unadulterated away from any of those
[1:23:57] organizations that's what's the matter
[1:23:59] see the seed must have
[1:24:01] the seed the seed plant must have seed
[1:24:05] water before it can grow
[1:24:07] it must have water to fall before the
[1:24:10] seed that's been planted can grow
[1:24:12] and it's that's it's the spirit of god
[1:24:15] the spirit that
[1:24:17] that rays of jesus from the dead that's
[1:24:20] the spirit that's going to cause that
[1:24:22] seed to grow
[1:24:24] if it dwells in you it shall quicken
[1:24:26] your mortal bodies
[1:24:27] and that spirit and the prophet goes on
[1:24:31] to say in paragraph 295
[1:24:35] now what's the matter now she is now
[1:24:38] waiting for the latter rain that's when
[1:24:42] she produces her fruits
[1:24:45] oh hum i hope you get her then
[1:24:48] the kind of seed you have planted in
[1:24:50] your field
[1:24:52] will be the kind of crop you will reap
[1:24:54] if the denominations wants more members
[1:24:57] that's what they're going to get that's
[1:25:00] what they have gotten the pentecostals
[1:25:02] wants more pentecostals
[1:25:03] that's what they're going to get right
[1:25:05] but the word
[1:25:07] is going to produce sons and daughters
[1:25:09] of god
[1:25:11] that's right that's coming to watch look
[1:25:13] at that great latter rain supposed to be
[1:25:16] done
[1:25:17] how they would run over the wall leap
[1:25:19] over and how they would be in the army
[1:25:21] coming
[1:25:22] just wait a minute the kind of prop
[1:25:24] you'll get is the kind of seed
[1:25:26] you put in your field all right now
[1:25:33] it's planting time and the word being a
[1:25:37] seed
[1:25:37] is what the believer needs to plant
[1:25:41] daily because the harvest
[1:25:44] is ahead the harvest is before us and
[1:25:47] when that harvest comes
[1:25:50] every word we just shredded every word
[1:25:52] that's been planted will
[1:25:54] come to pass healing in your body it
[1:25:57] will come to pass
[1:25:58] deliverance it will come to pass
[1:26:01] whatever the situation is
[1:26:03] through the spoken word it will come to
[1:26:05] pass
[1:26:06] we will be put in the position where the
[1:26:09] spoken word
[1:26:10] won't just be the original seed but our
[1:26:13] reality
[1:26:14] the spoken word will produce
[1:26:18] on what it's been already at the
[1:26:20] beginning that's what we need today
[1:26:22] that's the
[1:26:23] condition of the believer is to
[1:26:27] is to know that we have the covenant of
[1:26:30] the spoken word
[1:26:31] and it's planting time
[1:26:35] and as we plant the word will be
[1:26:37] restored
[1:26:38] back to the tree of life
[1:26:41] and i wish to read in revelation chapter
[1:26:43] 2
[1:26:46] verse 7.
[1:26:56] now it says he that hath an ear
[1:27:00] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:27:03] the
[1:27:04] churches to him that overcometh will i
[1:27:07] give to eat of the tree of life
[1:27:10] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[1:27:13] god
[1:27:14] which means every believer today will be
[1:27:17] in overcoming
[1:27:19] that is not an option or a dispute you
[1:27:22] will be an overcomer
[1:27:24] and as you overcome you'll only be able
[1:27:26] to overcome
[1:27:27] by the word of god your word as a
[1:27:30] defense
[1:27:31] your word as an anchor and
[1:27:34] you through overcoming what god
[1:27:38] gives you the right to eat of the tree
[1:27:40] of life
[1:27:41] where once the tree of life was guarded
[1:27:44] by cherubims guarded by angels that now
[1:27:47] the tree of life is given freely to he
[1:27:50] that will accept i also wish to turn in
[1:28:01] revelation chapter 22 verse 14
[1:28:06] and it reads
[1:28:16] it says blessed are they that do his
[1:28:19] commandments
[1:28:21] that they may have right to the tree of
[1:28:24] life
[1:28:25] and may enter in through the gates of
[1:28:28] the city
[1:28:30] blessed are they that do his
[1:28:32] commandments
[1:28:34] that they may have right to the tree of
[1:28:36] life
[1:28:37] and may enter through the gates of the
[1:28:38] city now
[1:28:41] god expects you to keep his commandments
[1:28:46] and his commandments
[1:28:49] are not grievous as the scripture says
[1:28:53] and when you turn away from god's
[1:28:56] commandments that's when separation
[1:28:58] comes forth
[1:29:00] that's when bondage happens and when
[1:29:03] bondage takes place
[1:29:05] it occurs in your mind and it takes over
[1:29:07] everything else
[1:29:08] it starts to eat up like a termite and
[1:29:12] now bondage is not the place of the
[1:29:16] believer
[1:29:17] bondage is not the believer's heritage
[1:29:20] the believer's heritage is dominion
[1:29:24] the believer's heritage is power and
[1:29:27] authority
[1:29:30] now i wish to read
[1:29:34] philippians chapter four
[1:29:41] first eight and this is why it's so
[1:29:45] important
[1:29:46] that you stay connected to the tree of
[1:29:49] life
[1:29:50] because when you stay connected of the
[1:29:51] tree of life
[1:29:54] you're not allowing room for separation
[1:29:58] because bondage comes in the mind verse
[1:30:01] first 8 chapter 4 philippians it says
[1:30:04] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[1:30:08] true
[1:30:09] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:30:11] things are just
[1:30:13] whatsoever things are pure once over
[1:30:15] things are lovely
[1:30:17] whatsoever things are of good report
[1:30:20] if there being virtue and
[1:30:23] if there be any praise think on these
[1:30:26] things
[1:30:27] think on these things but the mind of
[1:30:30] the believer
[1:30:32] is the battleground for satan and god
[1:30:35] but god wants to occupy your mind and
[1:30:38] through the womb with your mind
[1:30:39] god can dwell in your heart god wants to
[1:30:42] occupy
[1:30:43] every speck of your being but it takes
[1:30:46] the baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:30:48] baptism of the holy ghost is the spirit
[1:30:50] of god dwelling in you
[1:30:52] and god will restore you back to the
[1:30:56] tree of life
[1:30:57] the tree of life is our source and
[1:31:00] being that that's our source that's
[1:31:02] what's going to allow us to live under
[1:31:05] the conditions of this world
[1:31:06] uh this world is for moving further away
[1:31:10] from the word but the believer now is
[1:31:13] supposed to move
[1:31:14] closer to god and we read it
[1:31:18] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:31:20] the spirit says to the churches because
[1:31:22] he that overcomes
[1:31:24] has god given the right to eat of the
[1:31:27] tree of life
[1:31:29] so
[1:31:32] i want to tell you the tree of life
[1:31:35] is christ and if any man is going to
[1:31:39] find
[1:31:40] anything today it's only going to be in
[1:31:42] christ
[1:31:44] matthew 11 chapter
[1:31:51] chapter 28
[1:31:56] verse 28 i'm sorry
[1:31:59] matthew 11 verse 28
[1:32:03] it says come unto me all ye that labor
[1:32:06] in our heavy laden
[1:32:07] and i will give you rest take my yoke
[1:32:10] upon you
[1:32:11] and learn of me for i am meek and lowly
[1:32:14] in heart and ye shall find rest unto
[1:32:17] your souls
[1:32:18] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:32:21] light
[1:32:23] christ is the only thing that can give
[1:32:25] the believer
[1:32:26] rest today and if anybody
[1:32:30] needs that rest you must come god's
[1:32:32] provided away
[1:32:34] god provided way is perfection
[1:32:37] and perfection is the tree of life it's
[1:32:40] being restored
[1:32:41] to what god had designed in the
[1:32:44] beginning
[1:32:44] the man being in his own image in christ
[1:32:48] at calvary
[1:32:51] when he shed his blood he undid
[1:32:55] everything the enemy did
[1:32:56] in the beginning and even now if the
[1:32:58] enemy has done anything
[1:33:00] to the believer when we look back
[1:33:04] and can reconnect ourselves to the tree
[1:33:06] of life it'll undo
[1:33:08] everything that the enemy is doing god
[1:33:10] bless you
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:17] let us bound a word of prayer
[1:33:21] heavenly father we thank you lord god
[1:33:26] for the tree of life lord god we thank
[1:33:30] you for the salvation that you've given

[1:35:12] commit
[1:35:13] every heart before you we commit every
[1:35:15] situation
[1:35:17] with every work of bondage father lord
[1:35:20] god
[1:35:20] may we all recognize father
[1:35:24] that we have not been given the spirit
[1:35:25] of bondage but the spirit of adoption
