him and I thank God for the specials and everything for this morning as well we just uh [Music] good to see everybody in the house of God today the musicians thank you all so much I'm gonna let y'all go and we'll get that Mike don't worry about it you're in a message Church say that's what happened in the message churches but I found it happening just about in every Church uh you have to be just kind of switching One mic to the next of the settings are completely different and we're amen by the grace of God I promised y'all last week a man that we were going to be moving into just something different I had a little bit more to our series on the blood I just really really enjoyed that but maybe the Lord will bring it back amen or maybe I preach it somewhere else and preach a little different and then you won't know what I'm talking about so you have to still be under expectation amen but we uh we we want to just move into something this morning that I felt would be beneficial for us I believe God allowed things to happen the way that he did because he wanted this day to happen amen and I got complete confidence in the god that we serve so let's just turn our Bibles really quickly to Ephesians chapter five amen Ephesians 5. and um I mentioned them last week that we have we actually been coming through this chapter on Wednesday nights we are doing our teaching on in Ephesians 5 and um I knew just by reading ahead I knew that we would hit this point and uh always a really really uh good spot to be reminded and uh you know just refreshed but I was I was grateful but the night that I got to this really really important verse it was I had a couple brothers that were here but you know not married and all the Merit Brothers just was missing that man I said well praise the Lord so I I got I got practice and teaching amen I got some practice of teaching it so I I just felt to bring it back around on the date amen amen amen let's turn Ephesians 5. uh verse 25 just one verse that we want to read here husbands love your wives even as Christ also love the church and gave himself for it amen the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word can we just have a word of Prayer [Music] father God we thank you for um this opportunity we have to come and to study the word of God together and we trust Lord that you would just take control over this portion of service May the anointing of the Holy Ghost that's been here in thus far just take amen the word and drive it into our hearts God we lead it Paul wrote about it have purpose you have you have purpose for causing the first Messenger to First Church aids to address this so God we thank you for that and God we can use him even today we can use it Lord you are so concerned about even families our marriages that is that is that's important to you see here it's in your heart so I trust oh God because see you you you wanted to have a family uh that's why we're here because you wanted to have a family he wanted to be a father you also wanted to be a husband uh Lord you you you you became a son you wanted to be your family you wanted you're concerned about family so father we pray that you would help us to hear what the spirit is speaking to us God is in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated uh in the presence of the Lord um I would just title this uh Family series amen it's a family series uh when we kind of started the year off I was mentioning to you all that uh one of the things that was in my spirit you know was the Practical teachings and then the other thing that was in my spirit was uh yielding to the perfect will of God all right uh there is a permissive will of God and there is a perfect will of God and uh oftentimes what happens is we find ourselves walking in the permissive will more than we find ourselves walking in the perfect will of God a man church right and uh but I was just having a little conversation with uh uh a young one of my nephews just the other day and I was telling them say even when you find yourself in the permissive will of God God has a way of making it work out to his perfect will and uh you know so I I I know that the scripture tells us that all things work together for good because we love God and we are called according to his purpose can I tell you something this morning whatever you're going through right now is working for your good on your job whatever you're going through right now is working for your goods and your family whatever you're going through right now is working for your good and your body whatever you're going through right now is working for your goods in the church whatever you're going through right now is working for your good amen I I'm confident of that right so um you know we we uh with that in mind just you know these two thoughts that I had I knew that as we were coming through the book of Ephesians we were going to get into some very practical teaching and uh and I think it's very important that we we do that you can live up here on a spiritual level I mean revelation after Revelation just kind of coming to you uh but if your home life is way down here we got a big problem in our hands we got to get them both at the same level praise the Lord somebody all right so sometimes we have to take time and and and go through some of these things so let's let's dig in Amen on today uh and uh just see what the the Lord has for us you can just do next there for me um we just read description husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for the next one says uh Colossians 3 19 husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them a Paul writes this be not bitter against them things happen uh in families and it's very easy for the husband to get bitter let me tell you something when the husband get bitter he begins to pull away but as a as a man you can't pull away you have to stay engaged your family needs you your wife needs you your children need you you can't pull away you got to stay engaged hello somebody their things happen in life where they're gonna need you and they can't get uh that word of a strength that word of encouragement that word of Correction they can't get it from nobody else but you the word of encouragement hallelujah amen they needed to come from from Daddy it's got to come from Daddy got to come from got to come from husband it's got to come that's got to be the source God Made You The Source to be able to give that whatever that is you have to give back to your family husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them this next statement here brother Branham says a husband a true husband would give his life for his wife why because Christ gave his life for the church his wife hello somebody amen you pushing her out there to get struck by the bullet or something no you give your life for your wife all right all right a true husband would do that for his wife all right uh this next statement here uh I I I've kind of you're going to see that I've kind of put together a simulation of quotes and and some other things uh brother Harold Beckett in South Africa he has a Ministry a wonderful Ministry but he's done a lot of family series and and even uh he put out a little booklets of what the husbands role in in the family with the wife's role in the family Children's role he did he did that years ago with a few quotes that he just kind of put together and this one little head here says the head of every man is Christ and he's using the scripture for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body and gave himself for it this statement says out of Jehovah Jireh now as he went up as he went on up the hill little Isaac wondering where is that lamb coming from Papa ain't got no lamb there's no lamb up here he got up there and he built the altar laid the wood claved it and laid it across got the fires are burning went back and got his own son and look at this statement he loved God better than he loved his own son now this is very important as a daddy now the first year first love has to be a love for God and it has to be reflected in everything else you do in life but he loved God better than his that that then he loved his own son he says brother if you ever amount to anything you're you've got to love God better than your wife amen your husband your children your pastor amen yeah everything that there is you got to love God first God gets first place amen it just reminds me of the story that brother Gene would tell how a husband and wife would get into an argument on their way to church y'all know the devil do that all the time only way to church and then somebody in the house in the car ready to turn back around and go back home amen but uh but but you know when they get to the church and uh the husband come in and he just praising God and and the wife sitting there just with a a lips all Poke down and she like how in the world can you be in here praising God you know what just happened in the car amen or you know just what what just happened at the house you know these things how you gonna come to church and praise God like that well the husband had a really good answer for the wife when he got back in the car he said look uh uh God didn't do nothing to me I wasn't mad at God I was mad at you and what you gotta understand that that that your wife can't become come between your relationship with God your children can't come between your relationship with God you gotta love God more then you love your wife you got to love God more than you love your husband you got to love God more than you love your children and children you gotta love God more than you love your parents your parents can't take your praise because your parents didn't die for you your parents didn't rise for you you gotta love God more Hallelujah so that that's one of those things to say when something come up in the house that don't mean you stay home from church just because something came up in the house well I don't want to go in there and hinder the service my spirit ain't right get that ain't nothing but the devil talking to you it like saying I know I'm hurt I'm sick I got body pain but I don't want to go to the hospital and hinder the atmosphere in the heart the people are there at the hospital to help you and when you come to the house of God the word of God is here to help you sometimes the songs of Zion will change your spirit [Applause] so so so so put that devil to rest don't let him keep you home because y'all had a disagreement I love God more all right this uh statement here brother random says the message absolute by the word absolute is an ultimate and therefore I think that everybody should have an ultimate it says in every great achievement that's ever been achieved there has been an absolute behind it so no matter what it was it's it's had an absolute behind it and every person in order to achieve something as the first half the absolute and that's the final wine back through this uh that back through the other till you come to that absolute or the a man or the ultimate of what you're uh you got something you have to tie to in other words It's the final tying post to every achievement it's somewhere it might wind through many different things till uh till it gets to that top post but they're they're there is the amen to all of it there must be such a thing you cannot go on through life without having one and it goes on he says um when you get married uh they there had to wind back through your mind something till you hit that top post amen and it should have been love for your wife so in a marriage a man the typos has got to be loved come on somebody if your typos is not based on love yo sometimes somebody might get married because they think somebody got money yeah well he load it that's nine amen I I had a very promising career but one day I lost my job and and I I thank God I had a wife that would stand by me when I had no money coming in hello somebody went through it twice with her and she could even say what in the world is wrong with you every job you go to you losing it you realize what that's doing to our family right she could have acted but my wife didn't do that she got on her knees and began to pray for me and pray with me right hello somebody you got to have a tide post when it comes to your relationship and that typos has got to be loved it can be your career it can be your job it can't be your money it can't be your your personality it can't be none of that it's got to be love D hello when the kids are gone you got to have some love marriages fall apart as soon as the kids leave the house because that family did not have a typos no love between the husband and the wife you know they was married because of a job the job was to raise the children and when their job was over their marriage was over when you got married they had to wind back through your mind something till you hit the top post and it should have been love for your wife or your husband but maybe she isn't as pretty as John's wife or she's not this that but there's something about her it strikes you you say she might not be as pretty as the other or he might not be as handsome as the other but there has to be an absolute there that the person's different and and I think that's that's very very important amen it can't be based on looks uh brother random says got to be based on a character uh but but here you know he says um and there's where you hold on to and if that isn't there you better not get married that that that tie post that absolute you don't have that there then you better not get married hello somebody you better not get married you better make sure you got a good top host amen amen and it takes time to figure out what your typos is glory to God all right but here you know let's move on uh the prophet says this and I want to just bring this in this is a little separate but I need to inject this just for a second it says this in the message why he says now you say you believe in taking medicine uh I believe in anything that helps the human race is Godly now now this I'm bringing this in from a meta system because you have some people saying I'm going to take no medicine at all I just believe God and that's fine I'm not gonna put no straw in your path but if I take medicine don't you put no straw in my path but the prophet makes a very very a good statement couple statements here that I have underlined I believe anything that helps the human race is Godly it goes on to say certainly it is exactly this tell me what would we do today without these clinics in the hospitals and so forth certainly I know there's some shut behind the door when I first start off but where did it all go go to says see you got to look at anything sensible I see that I have to underline you got to look at anything sensible all right a medicine if medicine hospitals are not of God they're Antichrist burn them down get them out the country sure but it's something to help you so he tells us that anything we look at we got to look at it sensible oh help me Lord right here anything we look at we got to look at sensible can I tell you that amen I feel like over the years we have not looked at some things accessible anything that helps the human race is Godly uh I was thinking on this this statement and I just wanted to just drop this people throughout the years uh have been afraid of using material that wasn't in the message they wouldn't read books if it wasn't in the message is that all right I'm putting quotes around it that's what I'm it had to be in the message right it had to be what the prophet said and if it wasn't the prophet said they would go just push it to the side anything that can help the human race is Godly that's what the prophet said you know um I want to say this real really really uh carefully because I know that uh when I make a statement like that I I our sermons go many places yeah but I I I need to just put some some some some uh what you call these things uh disclaimers first disclaimer is I am preaching to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle first disclaimer second disclaimer I am preaching from my experience hello somebody and uh in my experience uh when I lost my jobs one of the jobs I lost a good County Job and then I end up going into a job working for a mega church as the uh I.T manager and you know you everyone behind I didn't even I never even applied a head hunter came and got me for that job and uh told me that somebody looked they looking for somebody with the same skills that you got to say who says a church in the area what church I don't even know no church to look at me look me nobody like that and they told me the name of the church I said oh yeah they might be needing somebody like that and here I'm coming in from the outside I don't even attend the church but I'm coming in from the outside and I'm going there to that environment and um and not knowing that God wanted to expose me to certain things oh come on somebody you got I mean their Ministry was built in certain areas and they didn't have all the words that we had but they did have some things right well one of the things that I learned as a minister is that I need to I need to build in rest into my schedule I need to build in vacations into my schedule and not just be running hard all the time I need to make sure that I I honor my family sometimes they taught me that type of stuff [Applause] hello somebody they taught me things about marriage that I didn't know things that I could apply to my own marriage and now I can also give that to the people but I preach from my experience and what I learned and my brother Brandon told us some say you know when you when you run into uh a situation like that and you eating chicken you don't have to eat the bone right you don't have to either just throw the bones to the side but keep eating chicken hello somebody I mean the prophetology things but we we didn't do it the way the prophet taught us to do it so I learned that you can you don't you don't have to necessarily put everything to the side everything that anything that helps the human race is Godly now I think you also got to be careful about just going out there reading anything and everything so let me let me also put this disclaimer when you uh reading something secular filter it filter it through the message and see when you can filter it through the message then you know you're standing on something and some of the things I'm going to share with you today we're going to filter it I'm gonna give you uh I'm gonna I'm gonna give you two things secular and nominal Christian views but I'ma also give you the message so you can filter the secular nominal Christian view cause anything that helps the human race is Godly and what I mean by that is from God it can help you all right we ready early this year I was asked next uh I was asked to come to a I was in in Arizona I was asked to speak on this topic of happiness for marriage and um so as I meditated on this in the scripture that they were using was there the one on screen it's Proverbs 17 22 it says a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken Spirit Drive the bones and from here the merry heart is where they got the happiness from and and the past asked me just to kind of speak of happiness you know for the marriage and that was just the topic so I said okay Lord You're gonna have to help me with this I've never really actually my first time ever really speaking for uh a couple's thing outside of our church it was the first time I've ever done anything like that so I said um Lord you got to help me so God gave me a little quote here that I got here on the screen uh it says out of the message why now sometimes in taking medicine sometimes the medicine medicine he says it's good the Bible says a mere heart does good like medicine notice but sometimes medicine won't always work the same on the person medicine is good but medicine won't always work the same on the person you have to take a chance on that now um what what I want you to get just leave that there for a second what I want you to get from this is that um you got to learn how people think how people feel you got to learn how to communicate in relationships right because what may work best for you may not work best for your spouse all right and and what may work best for you and your spouse may not work for your children and you got to learn how to communicate what we call love languages right and and I learned this just just in my own work um experience I had two employees that I was managing and uh and and the one guy man he came to me and he says uh Jack you're just not concerned about nothing I do I just feel so undervalued here you never say anything about what I do and I didn't know what the guy was doing honestly I mean I see some of the big things but he really wanted me to to focus on the small things that he was doing because it was little small things that he was doing in order to get himself prepared for the big things so you know big things I was always celebrating with him but he's like you just you just don't know what I'm doing you have no idea what I'm doing I said okay this guy's right so I said you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna have a meeting with you every week at such and such a time we're gonna call that time on schedule we're going to meet every week and and I'm gonna let you sit down and just share with me some of the projects that you're working on and he was so happy that he can come to my my desk uh every Tuesday at whatever time 10 o'clock in the morning he just shared all his heart with me for an hour and I just sit there and just absorb it good job good job great job man that's awesome man I really appreciate you I'm glad to have you on the team just going on and so I said you know this working very well for him so I went to the other guy my team said hey man you know what uh I'm gonna meet with you every Tuesday at at 12 o'clock or at two o'clock it says okay he come to our office and he ain't got nothing to say and he just sitting there looking at me and I'm looking at him and then he finally say Jack I I don't do I don't work like that and and it's really hard for me to meet with you every week like this I said you know what I can't treat him the same way I'm treating this guy I got to realize they they do things differently and I got to find something that works for him so his I get I mean with this Gary but this guy say I meet with you once a month and you know what that was very effective for him this other guy needed weekly attention and you got to be able to understand what people's different needs are in your family there's gonna be different needs all your children are different even twins [Applause] are different [Applause] so you have to understand if sometimes you see a breakdown of communication in the family is because we don't understand these differences you see medicine won't always work the same on the person so you got to be able to kind of figure out what you're working with figure out their personalities and then try to minister on that personality on that level that personality amen let me just before I go further since I was giving this job at this mega church and see everybody ain't got that same testimony everybody worked there to make a church but I did I did I needed to pay bills I needed a job God gave me a job at a mega church I worked there and there are tools that I learned just because they focused on on Ministry and marriage and stuff like that there were tools that I that I gained from there that uh I still apply today one of them a man if if you were in a and a husband and wife going through a difficult time maybe they arguing and fussing about something before you say the wrong thing because because uh oftentimes when your your emotions get so high you end up letting them out of your mouth and let me tell you something when you let it out your mouth sorry is not good enough sorry is accepted but it don't change anything you a lot of a lot of times we feel if I say sorry you ought to just drop it you don't understand what you just did to me you don't understand how that impacted me so I mean you want to get to the point where you don't have to say sorry your actions were different you you you control yourself you didn't say something so so often you know off the chain you're gonna say something so bad that you had to go back and say sorry you didn't act in a way when you had to apologize so you got to get control of yourself you know the story the story the story is told of the little boy that couldn't get control of his temper and his daddy tells his son he said he said Dad I know I got a bad tip I need to work on this Dad he said okay son I'll tell you what you do every time your temper gets out of control I want you to take a nail go to the backyard to the fence and take a nail and drive it through the fence every time you attempt to get out your driving nail through the fence son he that boy was going day after day sometimes multiple times a day driving nails in the fence they say now he's saying my son when you get control of your temper I want you to go and take that nail art defense that boy was getting control of his temper like boy pulling the nails out you're like oh I responded better Daddy Daddy I really got the hang of this he got every nail out the fence and he was so happy to tell his daddy dad I got the last man alive defense I got control over these things hey son I'm so happy I'm so happy for you but son do me a favor look at the fence the damage that's been done I cannot fix it so you want to get to the point where you're not driving nails into a fix I learned that before you get that far maybe what you need to do is Park some conversations let's put that conversation in the parking lot and when you put in a parking lot now it can't stay in the parking lot you have to establish a time that you're going to go get that situation out the parking lot we're going to meet at this time on this day and we're going to talk about this we're going to get it out in the parking lot sometimes we got a lot of stuff in the parking lot but you need to go establish a day to get that you can't get them all out the parking lot in the same day but go get this one out the parking lot today I learned that I learned about the five love languages I learned to subscribe to daily devotions on marriage see now in the in the message we get quotes for the day we do hello but we don't get things that focus on our marriage amen my wife and I and I fell off the wagon list but my wife and I used to do daily devotions together and I fell off the way I gotta get back on the wagon but we would do that together these are things that help build our communication in our marriage I told you I want to use some material because anything that can help the human race is Godly this next thing I went and just found this on the internet 10 things Christian wives want from their husbands 10 things Christian wives want from their husbands the first one is a wife wants love sacrificial unconditional love is what a wife looks for from her husband the next thing that a wife wants from her husband is attention she wants to be listened to to know that what she has to say is important to you and also they say a wife wants conversation from their spouse and I used to use this one all the time I was wrong but I used to use it this is a way for me not to have to have those conversations with my wife but I would tell her you know they say that a uh a man has 5 000 words in this vocabulary every day and a woman has ten thousand words in other vocabulary a day and uh when I go to work and I'm talking to this guy that want to talk to him about all his projects and then I'm talking to this person I'm talking when I come home my words are limited and I used to hide behind that my words are limited so that's why you only get yep that is not conversation let me tell you something when you were courting you weren't on the phone talking though when you record you had a lot to say yeah you was wooing asking about a day and asking about all kinds of things all of a sudden you got married and lost all your words you're gonna have to get them back some kind of way a woman needs attention that's how you want them because you gave her attention a woman needs protection amen they they want the husband to be the defender of the family a woman needs security and commitment all right now I'm going to let you know that I told you I'm going to pass some of this through a filter I wasn't I didn't do all of them because of the time constraints but uh this is still a work in progress but some of these I'm gonna show you quotes that actually go right along with what these people are saying all right here come a filter just wait another thing that a woman needs is appreciation and value amen wives want to know that they are beautiful in their husband's eyes oh she get compliments from everybody but you wives want to know that they're beautiful in their husband's eyes so if appreciation value another thing uh wives want respect amen all right um wives want partnership domestic support and partnership not just leave it all up to me I learned that when we did we're starting to do homeschooling I went to Homeschool Convention say look look look look your wife trying to do all this homeschooling you need to find a subject that you good at and you need to become a teacher and I know you working all day amen but you're gonna have to come home and give some time to your family did you have this family is it your family were you involved in creating this group of people were you involved where if you were involved in creating them you have to stay involved in making sure that they get what they need and it's not just the money y'all ain't talking to me yet it's okay because all the men think all we got to do is provide money no no this list go beyond your money you have to give your time you have to give your energy you're going to give your effort you have to give your money you gotta give your prayers you have to give your support you got to give everything you got this is your family your wife needs affection that's when they they just use the term treat it tenderly and cuddled yeah and I'm gonna just you know some of these things I can go deeper in in a husband and wife just session when we do those things but I just want to drop it off because somebody not even just in this church we all need this in the church but somebody even online need this just affection and just cuddling just just holding her sometimes older House of time when you walk into public walking without holding hands with them not you them you you five ten steps ahead she back here what is this grab a hand and hold it and let it walk by your side let the world know that this is my queen hello somebody since she needs your affection she got kids on the shoulder trying to push a a a a a stroller as well as a suitcase and everything else and you just got one little thing in your hand or you talking on the phone while your wife you know and everybody around you see her struggling you the only one on see your wife struggling you're the only one and it's your wife you can't see us struggling and she just be sitting there just with that and left that look on her face you don't you don't see it but everybody else did I can't believe this man doing me like this and she don't say nothing but she'll be in her mind and then you want what's what's wrong fine coming all out of here just what's wrong you mean you can see that it's she needs your affection my brother I thought for sure sister Melissa say preach Atlanta herself Romance you stopped buying flowers a long time ago when y'all was courting you was buying them like crazy oh you're just thinking of you you ain't thinking of a no more she wants to be wooed she wants to be pursued she wants to be dated Romance they said this this next man said your wife still wants chocolate and I put candy remember I put candy there for a reason because I'm gonna give you a quote brother Brandon talk about bringing home some candy to your wife what's going on this love brother random says this and the cancer of Redeemer says yesterday morning we got we were lying in the bed a little late children didn't have to go to school and we got to spending we got to speaking about different things and how what was hatred I said hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin and it never will end see it's eternal it says that When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty there will be an end to that amen amen and your wife them had these kids your kids and now you tell them how she don't look like when we got married right you don't either and I had children what's your excuse me When a Man Loves a Woman a man and marries her because she just she's just pretty they're being into that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds the man that she loved no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity and they step out into a space of time and we return back to Eternity eternity has dropped down in a body called time then it goes right back up into eternity again it cannot perish what Miranda tells us about that love this other statement that he gives us a man in looking at this uh security and commitment that a wife needs brother random says this of faith in the Son of God it says oh perhaps I don't say I have it I have its cause but maybe there might have been one more girl in the world that I could have married but you know I found the lady that I really love and I asked her if she thought that much of me amen she said yes so we got married and I told her now look all my love I give to you no matter what other women are and uh that woman has my that woman has my love perhaps I go down the street and here comes a more attractive girl than my wife and she says Oh Billy I really love you with all my heart now the first place if she has a love for me is bound to be false I was just there she just said so no no no you that's a lie from hell that's the devil anointing that lady if she has the love for me it's bound to be false because my first Duty is to what I pledge to my wife that's her first I've got to think of her first she's my first I told her I'd give her all my love and then my first duty is to my wife I said now look sister you're just infatuated and this is the problem people don't know what an infatuation is and what love is they actually thinking infatuation is love no you living in a fairy tale but when real life strike you'll see what really love is right amen it says later you're just infatuated or something because you're not in love seeing I'm not in love with you because I love one woman and that's the mother of my children see that's my first Duty your wife needs that secure that commitment for you to be able to stand up and tell a woman you infatuated you got a spirit on you because my first Duty I made a pledge I ran into this lady years ago I ran into her and I could I couldn't live without him that's my first Duty and I still can't live without it all right your wife needs appreciation and value now this this this the scripture that says who's so fond of the wife findeth a good thing and obtain a favor from the Lord so when you get away I actually I ask this question in the men's meeting how many brothers want some favor from God single Brothers single Brothers how many single Brothers want baby from a guy I ain't no single Brothers in here all right I got one over here you want favor from God favor favor from God I want God's faith favor ain't Fair you want favor get yourself together and get yourself a wife because you can't bring the wife into the place where you need to get yourself together so get yourself together and get yourself a whack you got you'll get favor from God this quote says in Jehovah Jireh part three Brotherhood says I hope that every young man here when he gets married he'll get a wife and you look as happy together as wife and I have as I have these 22 years that I that we've been married he he who has found a wife found a good thing and Solomon and Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown and unrighteous one is water in his blood and his blood streams his life so an unrighteous one and is the worst thing he can get a hold of you better make sure you're married Christian Somebody Loved God and love this message amen amen because if you get on you get a hold of one that ain't there you go you just married trouble and I'm talking about years of trouble years you can't see no end to the trouble but you know what that's a that's that's a mistake you made because you you stepped into it the wrong way amen well I think I can win her over you know what she thinking she's thinking the same thing you thinking you think you can win whole but she thinking she can win you over all right amen wait till they already established before you go start trying to test out or figure out what's you know if there's anything there wait till they established in Christ amen best thing you can have as a mate that's established in Christ because trouble coming and you gotta have a typos and that typos they got you got to know that they love God and so if they got the Holy Ghost when they hear the word the the word has a way of melting their heart amen but if they don't have the Holy Ghost you can say whatever you want to say they ain't changing and you're going to be married to that problem all right a good woman's a jewel in a man's crown and unrighteous one is warden's blood and his bloodstream is his life so an unrighteous one is the worst thing that he can get a hold of and a righteous one is the best thing he can get a hold of outside of Salvation if God could have given man a better thing than a wife he would have given to him my God what a statement because God just gives his children good things and he gave him a wife and I'm thankful for it brother random through this statement is showing his appreciation and his value for his wife won't respect Ephesians 5 28 29 says so all men that love their wives that's their own bodies he that love with his wife loves himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourish and cherish it even as the Lord the church in this message my life story brother Branham says so but now a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown she should be honored a a good woman should be honored my mother's a woman my wife is and their lovely and I've got thousands of Christian sisters who I highly respect he says if they can respect what God made them a motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man was a wife besides salvation a wife is the best thing if she's a good wife but if she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown but an ornery one a good one is watering his blood and that's right it's the it's the worst he says it's the worst thing can happen so a good woman if you got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest if you got a good wife you ought to respect her with the highest that's right you should do that a real woman and a child if you got a real mother that stays home and tries to take care of you keeping your clothes clean send you to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you you should respect that woman yes sir because she's a real mother mama need to be respected and as wives she need to be respected and the kids need to see you respect the name Mama you calling your wife all kind of names outside of who she really is in front of your kids you disrespecting her oh no you didn't use the word stupid you didn't use that word you didn't call your wife stupid Joe in the Book of Job when he when he when his wife came to him and said you ought to curse God and die job said this he says not you you you talking like the foolish women you know we man you don't have this conversation you know we don't talk about how foolish women talk you talking like the foolish women now he didn't say you're a fool that's not what he said he said you talking like a foolish woman it's a big difference in being you are a foolish woman then you talking like one of the foolish women respect your wife with what you say out your mouth and why is you respect your husbands too but what you say at your mouth what you mean by you're going to be just like your daddy what you mean by that what you're saying really about them now I move on I got it got quiet I know pause for a fact I heard a preacher say brother smile said I ain't scared I ain't either and I know what I'm standing on your wife needs affection affection series affection brother Branham said in the message time tested memories of God and I was talking about men losing their affection for their wife and don't love them as they did when they were sweethearts look at what the prophet says shame on you it says you ought to do it she's always your sweetheart absolutely that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that little honeymoon cease because it isn't going to in heaven it's going to be just perfectly one there that's right so don't let the honeymoon cease your wife needs your affection amen amen and that affection again is just being cuddled sometimes and just uh treat it tenderly my wife told me she said sometimes I just want you to just come into the house and just give me a kiss just you can kiss female head just give me a kiss let me know I'm here is that hard is it hard to hold your wife's hand because it wasn't when you was courting but I'm telling nah that you've been married all day is it hard to hold her hand is it hard just to kiss on the cheek or just give a little kiss she needs your affection and then if she will she be pushing away from me she doing that because she want to be chased she want to be pursued and you so frustrated she don't wanna I just and that's why you're having the problem that you're having you have to if you want to see something different you're gonna have to do something then I put that she wanted what they said that your wife still want chocolate and candy I put candy because look at what brother random say here and what what um it makes a statement that wasn't so from the beginning it says not long ago we were going together across the country and he said he said brother Brandon you know my wife don't believe in this the message pretty much right so and every night when I go to church and come home I said oh she just starts bawling me out when I hit the door and saying I get hurt by the end she's little and and hold her and I try to cast that devil out as hard as I can remind me of your message this morning says said I try to cast The Devil out I said devil you come out of my way whatever you come out of my way honey you possessed with the devil come out of that devil and look at what a prophet tell this man it's although I said that's fine brother fandler but you go at it the wrong way he said well how do you do it brother man says when you come home buy her a box of candy give it a hug when you come home uh and at the door next thing he says put your arms around her so that's the way you cast out a devil love cast out love cast out doesn't love and he's saying say buy her some candy because brother Brandon you know you know we know that the holy spirit is is is is is is is is uh Discerning kind of what this latest needs are you know what her needs were you know how this man could get his wife to go to church oh Lord have mercy Jesus you want to know how the man could get his wife to go to church a box of candy and a hug not not deep revelation a box of candy and a hug brought his wife to church oh Lord have mercy you see the Bob actually tells us it's the small foxes that that spoil the vine right it's little things that we're missing that actually cause all the big problems that we have but if we just get back to doing the little things we can fix the big things a box of candy and a hug let me go back to this again I just need to remind you all of this anything that helps the human race is Godly the other thing is you need to look at anything sensibly we read the scripture in Ephesians 5 it says so make yourselves one to another in the fear of God and I say how we do this how do we do this you know what does this really look like when you look at the scripture and I brought in um this uh the five love languages I brought that in to us and and this is what the five love languages are Gary Chapman Dr Gary Chapman is a man that actually came up with these five love languages and many books have been written about it many people there's there's things all over they have conferences all over about these five love languages I was exposed to this and I tell you I believe I believe it actually it does make a difference in marriages uh husbands when you submit yourself to your wife your wife is submitting submitting herself to the husband this is one easy way to find how to submit it's not just a man bearing rule with an iron fist it's not that when we're submitting ourselves one another we're doing things for each other it's acts of service it's receiving gifts it's quality time it's words of affirmation it's physical touch you need to understand what your mates love language is they usually have one dominant sometimes it might be too dominant you need to understand what their love language is and you got to talk to them their love language amen all right don't worry about it y'all know me already if you if you ain't never heard this before I'm gonna filter it I'm a filter you ain't got to worry about it but if you've never heard of it I I'm telling you this is one of those things that I for marriages I think it's a very it's very very helpful all right uh understanding what acts of service is understand what receiving gifts and and everybody's love language is different everybody's medicine is different amen even when it comes to your children it's good to know what they love language is everybody medicine is different amen amen right but understanding like like for me I I learned this about my wife because I thought every woman wanted wanted flowers all the time just bring flowers and I go try to get some real flowers 60 70 80 you know roses I'm hey my wife one day told me to say um if you guys I think she asked me how much you spent on that about 65 70 dollars um you know she didn't want to hurt my hurt my feelings but she's like you know I'ma just tell you the rose is gonna die so if you're willing to spin 70 dollars just give it to me [Applause] and so I had to learn it wasn't the flowers that was impressive huh just give me the money she she ain't going to buy my roses man she gonna be at some store over there somewhere You're Gonna Make That 70 work she know what days to go to Belle's Outlet on all kind of stuff you know but but she you know that that's the way she do things but I learned that it was that wasn't for her but what my wife is quality time quality of time is what she needed so I found ways to spend quality of time with her and look let me tell you something I I could have used every excuse look I'm going to school uh we raising the family we got church this many times a week and look I just don't have no time let me tell you something you always make time for the things that you really want to do so you need to get rid of your excuses you need to find a way to actually do these things for your spouse and your spouse is also finding a way to do those things for you he don't need no more of this because he got so much no no no no if that's his love language against you need to buy some gifts you can't tell nobody what their love language is you'd inform them you didn't make them God did that amen let me see what I got here okay now brother Branham actually um gives us advice even in the message he's not using the same terms that Gary Chapman used but you will see that the same principles are applying in the quote watch this quote I have a message why are people so tossed about a young fella came to me not long ago he was a Pentecostal he's seen too many of these meetings and he goes in his wife is a staunch loser and he said well I guess you all went down and shouted last night so I guess you're all speaking in tongues and doing all this last night he got he got out on the fourth got cast I cast The Devil out of her I cast The Devil out of her since almost a divorce case man a fine man uh he come to me and he said brother Brandon we're going to have a divorce I guess he said I just can't get that devil out of her I said brother you're going at it the wrong way I said when she starts like that all when she starts out like that say all right dear bless your heart honey he submitted himself to his wife all right dear bless your heart honey and be real kind to her and just see how much you can do for her I mean you realize when that man is uh doing for her he's actually doing an act of service and it's through the active service that he's gonna win his wife oh y'all I know and that that ain't deep through the act of service this man is going to win his wife you said brother Branham well how will I ever get that devil out of her I said you do as I say just keep praying in your heart not with your mouth wide open sometimes you got to learn how to pray in silence keep praying in your heart see I said God will take care of the rest of it he called me up about two or three weeks later said my home is revolutionized he said my wife is a different person how did he get his wife to change through casting Devil's art no no by following directions anytime she get up like that anytime she do that just all right dear it's okay dear I I no and not you know the Bible say because that's so you know that's why you're acting like this she knows Cedar we the best you ain't got to remind her of that well all right dear okay honey all right what can I do for you how was your day today you want to go out to eat can I get you some flowers fresh cut from the garden acts of service can I oh what about this one can I help you with the laundry you [Applause] know can I help you fold a clothes and put them away don't hit me don't throw now well that's a woman's job oh is it you live in a neighborhood where you ain't got to cut your grass no more somebody else cutting your grass you can come in and help your wife I know that ain't popular Lord I know it ain't popping how can I help you dear this man won his wife through an act of service my wife is a different person I said which is the most powerful screaming and kicking and stomping or feel your heart full of love God is love God so love the world now before I go to this next quote um I told you you know there are anything anything that can help the human race is Godly and what I found here with just Dr Chapman's he's just trying to help marriages that's that's really all the man trying to do and I find that uh what he did was something that can help a lot of people and here's the other thing I found when I felt it through the message it's in it's in the message now I'm gonna read this quote for you and this is a this is a famous quote popular quote everybody always loved this quote when it comes to marriages but when I went out to Arizona this quote is the one that settled me I said you know what this quote shows how brother Branham used all five love languages in one situation somebody to say prove that brother Jack I got it here it is when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes its place look at what the prophet said I'm coming home right here in our own home and it says try this at your home if there was if if there was if there ever was a home that's confused and torn up much as ours people from everywhere all over the world coming all the time in and out day and night all hours and I have noticed here some time ago my lovely little wife of 37 years old and completely great she stood between me and the public look at this if there's any praises to be given to the Branham family give it to her that's a word of affirmation the telephone run you run your wild day and night and so the house had been full um uh a day and I went out and my little children little Sarah and Rebecca were fighting over some play blocks little Joseph the baby sitting in the floor screaming to the top of his voice wife in the kitchen with her face buried in her hands weeping when I finally got the house emptied some in this room some in that room some in the basement and I walked in and I thought oh what a confusion look at what she does she put her arms around me see she needs to be held she put her arms around me she said Billy I'm going crazy she said I haven't been able to get the

everybody out here now uh you can uh you can go ahead and start cooking that ain't what the prophet did he heard what his wife was going through at the moment and he responded next quote he says and and sometimes raging maniacs and saying is and saying it really a bunch of sometimes uh sometimes Fanatics running back and forth through the house saying the Lord said this and the Lord said if if if I ain't your manager the Lord said this now if the Lord wouldn't talk to me about that if he had something to say but you can't help it it's just in the human line she said the children haven't had
