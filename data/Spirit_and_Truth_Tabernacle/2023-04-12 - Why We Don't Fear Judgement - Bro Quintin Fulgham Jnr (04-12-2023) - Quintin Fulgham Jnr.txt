even have to say a word O Lord because but that people will know there's something different of being in our and being in our presence O Lord God with your presence inside of us O Lord bless each every every one of them oh Lord God answer their needs O Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen so uh we'll get right into it I don't have any slides or anything um but um the title of the message is why we don't fear judgment uh so it's a it's a it's a good message it's actually I kind of got I got some inspiration from Brother Jack um when he uh preached the resurrection a message on Sunday so we're going to start our journey here in Matthew chapter 7. and then verses uh one through five so I'll wait for everyone to get there all right so here it says judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment you judge ye shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again and why behold this thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but considers not the being that is in thine own eye or how will thy say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thy own eye thou hypocrite First cast out the beam of thine own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye all right this is a beautiful beautiful verse where Jesus is teaching us uh um not to judge but at the same time we're still required to help our brother right which means we still got to judge situations right we still got to judge the situations right and the key a key word in this last verse verse 5 it says and then Thou shalt see clearly we know see from the prophet means to understand clearly right so you got to understand the situation before you can provide help to your brother right a lot of times we like to uh send people to Hell on little things and stuff and it's it's and most of the time when you're trying to help someone they know they're wrong which is why people go to the hospital they know they sick they know something's not right right so it's our job to give him a word of encouragement to get them back on path right but you got to understand how to do it so why don't we fear judgment oh yes y'all can be seated yes sorry yeah Why Don't We Fear judgment there's a couple questions that we have to ask for that right so one we have to establish uh where is Judgment today right so judgment lies in the body of the Saints right judgment lies in God and this is where I kind of got inspiration from Brother Jack about um how the old Saints had the power to stay in the grave he was he was touching on that point because the resurrection was in them and they could leave anytime they wanted to but they had the power to stay in the grave right and so you see judgment lies in the Saints just as much as the resurrection does and God has a plan with all of that so when you've received the message of your day judgment lies inside of you Resurrection is in the message judgment is in the message and it all lies inside of you it is in us to judge right it is in us to judge a lot of times people say um and we'll get to this saying again only God can judge me God is using people to judge you all right when he places his message inside of people he's using them to judge your situation right so uh as brother Jack was preaching about you know those things have the power to stay down in there and there was a reason why they got to stay down there there's a reason why we don't want them to come out there just yet right there's also a reason why we have to die to ourselves as well when uh uh when we are dealing with situations right we have to die to what we want to say about things right because the fact of us saying something could bring judgment so we want to be careful about exactly what we say and kind of let God lead lead the direction of what we're saying right so that is where where the Judgment lies today it is in his Saints uh the next question to ask is what exactly is Judgment right and you can read throughout the Bible everywhere you'll see judgment on all over the place but there are different kinds of judgment right and the time you receive it or when you receive it shows which one you're dealing with so we're going to go over to a James chapter 2. and verses uh 10 through 13. all right amen glory and it reads here for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all for he said that do not commit adultery said also do not kill so he's saying this is God saying don't commit adultery and don't kill right we know the Commandments now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill Thou Art become a transgressor of the law so here he's saying you can't just pick and choose what you want to do right you gotta you have to eat the whole book you have to follow the whole book and here comes the key verse here in verse 12. so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of Liberty that's very very important we want we want the law of Liberty to be we want to be in Judgment of the law of Liberty right as we read the next verse of verse 13 it says for he shall have judgment without Mercy that have show no mercy so see we here we see two judgments one is being judged by the law of liberty another one is being judged without Mercy because they didn't show any Mercy all right and then the most beautiful thing in this verse 13 is Mercy rejoices against judgment that's the kind of judgment I would want to be in something that you there's still a rejoicing in right something where they're still a praising right that's the kind of judgment that uh that I would want to receive uh and that's the kind of judgment that we want to give to people that they can leave with joy right and hope in their heart knowing that hey there's hope for me right I can I can make it out of the situation and you know they're not there's no condemnation where you kind of what kind of what brother Branham says you're kicking them down the ditch instead of trying to help them up right so that's the kind of judgment that we want to give because judgment lies in us so it's important the kind of judgment we give to people and that's what God is concerned about for us so we're going to read some stories where God gives this judgment within the law of Liberty right these ones haven't received Mercy uh this is the kind of judgment Where Mercy always follows right and there can be a rejoicing in that judgment so we're going to go to Second Samuels going to go to second Samuel um and it's going to be verses five through seven I'll give a um uh chapter 12. so second Samuel chapter 12 verses 5 through 7. and just to kind of give um a summary you know David had committed a sin he had committed adultery then committed a murder and so Nathan is now Nathan the prophet God sent Nathan a prophet to come talk to David and he he gives a story about a rich man and a poor man and a rich man uh you know taken from the poor man right he's telling the story he ain't mentioned that as David and that and that's and that's and that's the beautiful thing I like about it God didn't just come down there and say David you're wrong he wanted to know where David Hart was amen he wants to know where his David Hart was uh he wanted to check the maturity of David right so we're going to read what David's reaction was when uh Nathan had given the story from starting from verse five and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that have done this thing shall surely die he no mercy he's going to die right and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he hath no pity uh verse 7 right uh and Nathan said to David Thou Art the man right so now Dave is like oh hold on a second wait hold on let me kind of backtrack right but one of the beautiful things in this verse 7 is the next part even though they even though Nathan had said David you're that man the next part is thus saith the Lord so now God is speaking whenever there's a thus say Lord he said thus saith the Lord of Israel I anointed thee King over over Israel right and that's the most important part God is confessing David I made you a king and the king is also a judge all right God had told David uh uh God has said David you was a man after his own heart so right away God is saying David I just can't cut you off I told you you would be king I anointed you King I called you to this position and remember he received the anointing by accepting the message of a prophet a prophet had come into town was looking to anoint someone King God said hey God told me to anoint David David accepted the anointing of uh of of that Prophet right so God couldn't just cut him off right I believe God was upset though with David's reaction and hearing how he judged a man and there was no mercy after God had called him to judge so we're going to keep reading and we're going to go to uh versus second Samuel 12 verses 11 through 13. all right so now here's just here's just um here's just God giving some judgment God giving some judgment to David David right he says thus save the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wise before thy eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall align with our wives in the side of the son for thou dids it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun and that's that's that's a beautiful verse right there because uh I love the laws of contrast that you see in the Bible how which makes God just right because the Bible says uh which When you pray in secret Jesus instructed them to pray in secret so that your father heavenly father would reward you openly and so here we see David doing something secretly and God's saying all right you did it in secret but I'm gonna expose this thing to everybody so it's beautiful to see the laws of contrast and the right and and the righteous judgment how God gives you what you ask for all right and we're going to keep reading and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord that's the beautiful thing he recognized he was wrong and he said God your judgment is right I did wrong right and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin thou shall not die David had done confessed that this man should die and God gave him his judgment told him this is all you're going to suffer and at the end of all of it God said I've put your sin away you're not going to die and I'm thankful that God doesn't give us what we deserve sometimes right and we're going to sit on this for a little bit because it's not just in judging a lot of times we think about judging right from wrong but it's a lot of times it's in the situations you know it's uh you could be sick right I mean on the death bed stage four cancer and you don't judge the situation I'm about to die but what does God say about it right what does God say about it you know you may have you know Wayward kids kids out there I mean they're just saturated in sin you're like man there's no hope in that but what does God say about that right so it's important to get the mind to Christ inside of you so you can judge situations rightly right or else man we just be like David it's just dead it's dead situation dead situation dead but then God's got to come back to the prophet and say no there's still life amen right there's still life right so we see the law of judgment we see the Judgment here within the law of Liberty how there's always Mercy at the end of it and all that and all that God had told David all that judgment he said you're going to deal with this the sword is not going to leave your house but you ain't gonna die so the Judgment had come but there was Mercy at the end I believe that's something David could be happy about to hear that that no matter what the sword is not going to leave my house I'm going to suffer with all these things but I ain't gonna die he has something to Rejoice about that God wasn't going to leave him right so we love this kind of we love this kind of judgment where people can leave with some relief right you done made the mistake you got to go through it right but there's Mercy at the end of it right there's Mercy at the end of it uh it's the reason why David could write the book of Psalms why he was going through that situation he still had a praise he still had a praise to God he could still reach out to God he could still talk to God even though he know he did wrong he was going through his family situations uh the like his the household situation with the wives and he still had a praise on the inside amidst all the Judgment that God had given all right amen so now we're going to go to a uh we're going to go to another story of somebody else and this is going to be in Joshua Joshua chapter 6. and we're going to start from the verse 17. I'm going to start from verse 17. right and this is Sister rehab all right and the city and this is Joshua and this is uh this is I believe God speaking uh and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are there into the Lord only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid The Messengers that we sent right this is a lot to unpack uh and it's one of the reasons why we really really love the story of Rahab uh so we notice in verse 17 God had come down and judged this city right he said it's accursed and he's going to destroy it right judgment come down God said I've cursed it I'm going to destroy it now we have to come back to that train of thought of um The Only God Can Judge Me thought right because I hear that a lot I see that a lot I hear a lot on social media from a lot of people that you know profess Christianity all right and it's a funny thought because it's the thought that says uh Only God can judge me I can keep living and doing what I want to do and God is still before me right but let's look at the attitude of Rahab during this ordeal because God done cursed her city right God done cursed it and we can translate to we could translate that to saying God is saying I don't like culture I don't like what you guys talk about I don't like what you guys think about I Don't Like Your Entertainment I don't like your music I don't like the parties I don't like the clothes I don't like the businesses I don't like the government I don't like the lifestyle I don't like your ideas right and Rahab had to withstand this judgment against her culture or her way of life and say Lord you're right amen you're right amen right that's opposite from how these other people think uh this Only God can judge me I can still do what I want and God still be Rahab hath a total opposite mindset and she said you know what Lord you're right it's horrible the city that I live in is horrible the things that I've been doing in life is horrible right and we're going to go to this uh message why why Christ speak 59 um laundry and we're going to see what the prophet uh had to say about uh this situation situation with Rahab right um so it is while she's pulling up I'll start reading so it is today nothing less I think today I'd make a mention of one woman that I think of in the Bible and she was bad to begin with rotten to the core a young beautiful woman by the name of Rahab she was a heathen to start with and she was a prostitute on can you imagine like we haven't even gotten to anything yet only good thing I heard was just a young beautiful woman but outside of that bad to begin with rotten to the core Heathen to start with she was a prostitute on the street but she heard there was a God not an idol that set dumb or Declaration of Creeds but a God who lived among his people anointed them and signs and wonders was following them she heard about it one day two Representatives came to Jericho those The Messengers and quickly on her street as a prostitute she called them took them into the house and said they're after you and she hit them right and I like that because these Messengers were carrying a message and I like when the prophet says and the Bible says that she hid them in her house right she took the message right which was a message of judgment that hey your city's coming down and she took that hit it inside of her own household right so uh uh it's a good indication of taking the message and hiding it in your heart right and I like her attitude she never said I'll believe it when I see the great anointed Joshua do some sign if I could have seen Moses do the science I would have believed it but she said I've heard Faith come by hearing hearing of the word of God right so it and it just kind of amazed me how he was just talking I mean he just rotten to the core he then he said but it was true she knew it was true and her attitude was Lord help me um uh down uh down here in uh in uh the paragraph and now you have to pull it up she said I've heard that the god of Heaven who was a real God with you all and he's done great signs and wonders he dried up the Red Sea he brought plagues upon Egypt we see how he turned the enemy over to your hands and our whole country's trembling so she knew judgment was coming and this is what she said I'm asking Mercy I'm asking Mercy right so not only did Rahab have to withstand that attack by God on her culture and her way of life but all the ones that wanted to follow Rahab into the house had to have the same mindset right by agreeing to the destruction of the city they approved that the Judgment of God was right they said Lord you're right meaning they wasn't going to fight for the city they wasn't going to defend it it wasn't going to offend their way of life right they said no it needs to be destroyed the Bible said he told the um he told the army of Israel to kill the man the woman young old animals I mean old people I mean it's everything wipe it all out right and they was agreeing with it they probably knew some of the people they probably have friendships with so many people they probably had their favorite stores their favorite restaurants God will said no I'm taking it all out wow so it showed if it will show with inside of their heart that they were totally sold out on this message that they weren't willing to take anything with them right now um now even in that decision and this is the other part even in that decision God didn't take them out of the city during the time of his destruction right they were instructed to put a Scarlet thread on the outside of their house right and that's God's way of saying now you guys y'all sinned in the city so you got to stay right you got to stay judgment's coming you got to stay but because you receive the messengers there was a red Scarlet as instructed that they could put over their door of the house which signified God wasn't going to touch it the prophet said that when they came inside and destroyed the city Only rehab sections stood up right right only Rahab sections stood up she still went through the Judgment right but there was Mercy at the end meaning that I imagine inside that house while they hear and everything that's going on on the outside they could shout they could praise they could sing they could enjoy the food they were eating knowing that it wasn't going to touch them not one one sword with not one sort of Destruction was going to touch them right amen so this is so it's a rep this is a representation of of as we were preaching before of Mercy rejoicing against judgment right this is a type of judgment that God has given uh given to the to Rahab in them but he made a way of Escape inside of there and we want to read uh verses 22 uh Joshua 6 22 22 23 and 25. all right [Music] all right so it says but Joshua has said unto the two men that had spied out the country going to the harlot's house and bring out fence the woman and all that she hath as ye swear unto her and the young men that were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her Brethren and all that she had and he brought her out to out of the Kendrick and left them without the camp of Israel right so the same Messengers that came to give her the message of Grace were the same Messengers that came and brought her out into the camp of Israel so uh it's the message that's going to take you places right it's not how good you are it's not what you think of the thing right it's it's it's your reaction to the message and then the message does everything else it did it didn't say they had to get up and go to the camp themselves no they said Joshua said no go and get them and bring them right into the camp and of course the camp of Israel representing spirituals are representing eternity right we want to go back to uh Israel that's the true nation that'll survive everything right uh and and it's it's funny because I was experiencing a moment of this on uh I remember it was Monday I just come back from doing take doing some business uh and um I was sitting in Wawas and I was on my phone because sometimes I like to go to Wawas and just eat and just sit in my car and I was on my phone and I read this story about a woman who had this guy had done this guy was accused of doing something to this woman which was proven to be false and the man had to spend 16 years in jail right 16 years in jail for something he did not do and man it just like I just got angry I just got upset when I heard the response of the woman it kind of sounded like there was no remorse in it all right and I just got the man she deserves this this this and that I'm thankful for the spirit of God that can come on you and tell you to stop thinking certain things stop thinking certain things because then it started coming to my mind do you know her end wow do you know her end right [Music] because this is the funny thing well not the funny thing of the matter but this is the this is the thing of the matter if within her last breaths of life if she asks God for mercy and God grants that Mercy with her her sins are gone Amen on the flip side if this young man this guy that was done wrong if within his last breaths he doesn't ask God for Mercy his sins will still be there I don't care how wrong he was right so in that moment I believe it was God teaching me you got to judge rightly right you can't judge people by their circumstances by the by what they're going through right it's always the ending of it you never know what a situation someone is going in it's one of the reasons why we can see in the Bible Paul has such a good work Paul God used Paul to write so many books in the Bible right so many books in the Bible but if you look at how he started it kind of would it kind of would have thrown you off when God was trying to begin God's when God was trying to begin the work of God inside of Paul all right dealing with his Brethren they didn't even want to talk to him they said what this guy is against you God said no go and baptize him I've chosen them I've ordained them for work right people he ordained him for work so it's never we you got to judge situations rightly and it's never by how you think the situation should go that's one of the reasons why in the Bible when God anointed Solomon King he asked the right thing as being the king he said Lord give me the wisdom in order for him to judge situations rightly and it pleased God when he asked that thing because he didn't want his opinion on the matter he wanted what God saw uh in the situation of of the matter so it's and and that's how God wants us to be because the Judgment lies inside of us which is why we don't we we're not afraid of it we're not afraid of judgment because God is using us to judge right God is using us to judge but the kind of judgment we need to use has to be right has to be righteous right and that kind of judgment always comes with Mercy at the end right always comes with Mercy at the end right so um and we get that judgment and and a lot we don't just get that judgment by God just coming in and just giving us and giving us judgment and we're just going out there and just judging people no in our mistakes right and our mistakes uh in our sins and we are and we and we when we sin every day the Bible says the righteous fall seven times one day but we get back up eight and our sins right in our mistakes and the things that we do uh when we come back to God and ask God for forgiveness and ask God for Mercy right we're proving his judgment's right which then gives us not only judgment on a situation but compassion right which is what a lot of people lack when they try to judge is they try to judge a situation with no compassion right no compassion no no no care it's just you did wrong people know they're wrong but now they want to know what can I do to get back and a lot of times it's not what you say but it's what they see is what they see in your life when I see you make mistakes right when you admit that you've made mistakes it gives people confidence that's why the prophet one time the prophet was um the tax collector was calling him and the prophet ain't going to deal with that situation and he just walked away and told his wife to tell him he wasn't there when he was there he told a lie try to go pray for a baby and the same Jesus here called him a hypocrite praying for that kid go make that thing right brother Brandon went back told the man hey I was there I did it wrong and what and this guy I don't know if he was a Christian or not but the the response from the guy was brother Branham I now have more confidence in you I have more confidence in you that you've done the right thing so even in even in um making your risk making your your mistakes wrong right it's a life that's being proven that gives confidence to people no judgment was given but the fact that brother Brandon was living a life that was according to the gospel brought confidence in a man that we don't even know was a Christian that's right it brought confidence inside of him right without having to say one word of Judgment of your wrong not one Judgment of your own right so when we prove that the uh the the judgments of of God as true uh it builds our ability to judge righteously right it builds our ability to judge righteously right uh and one of the things is because the way we judge people it shows which judgment we will receive right the Bible clearly said in James second it says you know those that judge without uh those that receive judgment without Mercy because they showed no mercy right so I'm so I'm thankful for the spirit of God that can come into our lives when we want to judge situations you know wayward children friends uh what we think about the politics and all that kind of stuff right God can come and say hold on a second I need I I see what you're doing I I know they're wrong but I need you to end it with some mercy right I need you to end that judgment with some mercy right well and uh because it shows with judgment will receive God doesn't want us to receive judgment with no mercy so we can't give it without any Mercy right we cannot give you without any Mercy right uh it's a hypocrisy uh and uh one of the stories um the prophet um had actually went through where he kind of had a little hypocrisy well now yeah it's a little hypocrisy moment for him uh is he went into this establishment one time and I think it was like drinking and people were just in there sinning and the prophet said Lord burn it all down thought he was doing something thought he was doing God of work thought he was doing God of service he said just burn it right down to the ground right no compassion No Love the Prophet this is one of the things like we ain't following a man we're not following a man men will the Flesh of a man I don't care how righteous it looks won't lead you to Christ amen so you got to be careful and I was thinking to myself I was you know imagine if we would have had people in that establishment with brother Branham and he would have said that words how would they have reacted if you were following a man oh man the prophet is right he's true wow but if you got God's spirit I that Spirit got to say hold on a second hold on a second I don't know if that sounds just right Glory and that's what we're looking for we're not pushing down the man that was God's chosen man God's chosen vessel but Paul said follow me as I follow Christ right so here we have the prophet in this establishment and he's wanting God to burn the place down right and so God said hold on a second took him to a little corner I love those little corner moments where God can get a hold of you and say hold on a second God showed him a vision and his sins were going as they were going to God there was I think there was like a red streak a bumper right so they wouldn't get to the throne of God and God and brother Brandon asked God for forgiveness and God had wrote forgiven right and that changed his whole that changed his whole mind that one little moment changed his whole mind and he was able to go inside of that establishment and there was a there was a lady sitting down there had all kinds of makeup on and she was talking to guys and he came down there and just started talking to her and catching her spirit to come to find out it was a sheep hidden what in Wolf's clothes and he was ready to burn the place down you see it's the bride don't persecute bride so that's why God has to give us those Corner moments to uh to uh first realize that we ain't what we are right by ourselves we didn't get to the position that we are by ourselves we don't deserve and it's just like David we don't get what we deserve right David was ready to cast this person die him out and God said no David I ain't gonna kill you that's not what I think about you right and so uh he found this little lady started talking to her and then she gave recommitted her life to Christ come to find out she was always a sheep she had just gotten astray a little bit so God has sent him to this place not to judge it right to get the one right to get the one leave the 99 to get the one amen amen right so um in closing in a little bit um brother Jack talked about the the staying power of the Saints and the grave we love that staying power that shows that there's still a work to be done right A lot of times you know you have some people that say you know oh man I just I miss I miss I miss my loved ones I miss my uncle you know he was a saint he's passed on I miss Grandma miss Mama and all my brother and everything like that they were Saints and they moved on and they're in the grave and I want to I want to see him again if your life ain't right you don't want them to raise up yet you don't want them to raise up yet all right because that judgment is lying inside of them right right the judgment is lying inside of them that's right so that's why it's it's a beautiful thing when brother Jack was was preaching about that thing uh uh that staying power right to stay down in the grave and not resurrect so that we could get our last loved ones in right so we could get someone in in the body because as soon as they raise up it's finished they have a purpose of holding back the wrath of God while they're staying in the grave so that's why God's like nope y'all can't come up yet it means god not only is God working on our loved ones but God's working on us right Lord is there an area in my life where I have been totally surrendered to you that means I still need work I'm not ready for them to come up amen amen so when we receive uh uh uh when we receive the Judgment of God now right uh in our life it's only to perfect us that's why there isn't any fear in it right the only way you can fear judgment is if you haven't accepted the antidote for it that's the only way that you could fear it because judgment Jesus said to himself he says I come not into the world to condemn it right but through me that uh people would receive life that's what Jesus said he said I ain't coming here to judge which is why my people that have my spirit they ain't judging either right which is why we need a little correction moments uh my dad actually uh had him um showed a message to me from the uh the lifeline app and this was this was something that uh kind of hit me before I received this message he says here uh you don't have to pull up I'll just I'll just read it and if there's anything that we ought to be is kind to one another when you see a brother or sister and fault don't never don't never breathe it to nobody keep it to yourself and pray for that person be kind to them and if the spirit of God is in you then you will be kind to one another Jesus said I come to do thy will father we are about the Master's business and he was about the father's business and the same spirit that he had to begin the works of the father and to finish the atonement to make a way that we could carry the message if that spirit is in you you'll have that attitude towards people trying to do what you can to help them no matter where no matter who they are and where they are you'll try to help people amen that's it's kind of strong but it's the truth right so it's that spirit that God has blessed us with is always looking to show Mercy to show Grace to help people in their situations right and yes there is a judgment that comes with situations it's like a doctor you and if if you ain't if you ain't eating what you're supposed to eat right and you come up in the doctor's office or you got to be honest with you right right but they they try to be kind you know they don't they don't just they don't just you know if he's a good doctor right if it's a if it's a good doctor they hang on just they ain't gonna just say anything right because they don't want to hurt you they don't want to hurt you but at the same time at the same time you're wrong but I'm still trying to help you all right and that's how God wants us to be right we see you don't you don't help people by getting down on a level that's not how you want people to Christ you don't want people to Christ by uh um living the lifestyle that they have no we are against the lifestyle right Jesus when when God came to uh uh Rahab in them he said I'm destroying the city it's Starbucks everything is going it's gone right he wasn't going in there trying to sit and talk it out he was going to destroy it but for those that could receive the message he was willing to uh uh give that offer Mercy right give that an offer Mercy right so um yeah there's nothing we should fear in judgment right uh God sends his word to us in order to perfect us to make us more perfect David said uh you know if there be anything inside Lord that is not of You O Lord search me search my heart right God David was asking for judgment he wasn't asking for that the bad judgment but he was asking for the good judgment right because God is going to be honest about your situation right that and that's one that's one of the things the prophet will say before you come up to this prayer line if you want nothing exposed don't come up that's right all right because God's going to look at your heart he's not going to uh uh what's the word he's not gonna uh reason with you he's going to tell it like it is this is wrong that's wrong this is wrong and that's one of the reasons why you know you know the children of Israel when they want it when Moses was coming and talking to him he's like no we want to talk to God directly you know they thought that God was going to be like hey what's going on kids how y'all doing today but it's it was a terrible voice from Heaven because it was a righteous God looking into their hearts and exposing uh the things that they had hidden in there they said no we don't want to hear no Moses Moses talked to us Moses you got more grace which was a beautiful thing because Moses was a Christ to the people when God was looking to destroy them now Moses he had gone through so many so much stuff with the People Israel they had got on this nerves so much right but when God was looking to destroy them Moses stood in the Gap said Lord don't do it amen Lord don't do it and I could see God I could see God looking at Moses and seeing himself so then he said you know what I can't I can't do it because I see myself in you making an atonement for my people right and that's how God wants us to be in our situations when we're judging things right I tell you uh uh um there's a um there's a Bible verse where it says that there will be days where there would be no no compassion no forgiveness I go online and I see a lot of these videos of you know people talk about murderers and abusers and stuff like that and you read the comments and people just lock them up put them under the sale right no mercy no forgiveness right um just hey they did wrong judge them they did wrong judge them right and it's sad because it shows what's in their hearts right they want to be judged with no mercy right and so I'm thankful that haven't received that we can receive a message from a prophet and not only just see the prophet just talk about it but even being in a situation where he was just like that and God had to pull him back there and say hold on a second you're not right and for him to be able to give us that experience to know that it ain't nobody holy and we all need God we all need God to give compassion on each other and there's a reason for it and when we see the mind of Christ and we see that there's a lost sheep Jesus said I'll leave the 99 which is which is a it's a beautiful thing right 99 righteous living right they doing everything right they're doing exactly what you want all right but God said I'll leave every single one of them just to get one right so when we receive judgment now uh God is trying to judge us righteously uh not only for ourselves so that we won't receive the Judgment without Mercy but to also look for someone else that may need Mercy right so I ended with fat if God before us who can be against us amen amen so we praise the Lord for the word of the Lord on tonight amen this is a wonderful wonderful thought there from brother Quentin I don't think I've ever looked at that scripture in all my years I don't think I never looked at that scripture but why not to just look at it but to take us through the Bible and show us examples of uh of what James was telling us there I thought that was just a very very uh remarkable thought you know at James 2 10-13 I have to go back and look at that but the one statement Mercy rejoices against judgment and the I think the heart of the thought is just get us to realize that even as we have to you know we have to we have to judge situations you know sometimes things get out of hand and you know in a household sometimes the parents have to say something to the kids you know they have to get them back in line and uh but the the fact of the matter is that we're also looking to try to bring Mercy into whatever we're doing and I think it just really really just helps us so praise the Lord God bless you brother Quentin we really really appreciate you Amen on tonight let me just have the announcements and I will make mention of that and um so um our Sunday morning prayer from nine to ten and uh Sunday

okay all right we'll remember both of those families in prayer it meant anybody else okay um this gentleman Bob that brother Quentin is referring to he um he was a staple here in our community and one of the restaurants that I frequent a lot is um Pete's Place right right here on Okeechobee and and and and Jog and um oftentimes I go in there and I see Bob sitting in there just eating his meal and they always had that world World War II veteran hat on and I would just get whoever his waitress was just bring me his check because I just like to you know pay respect to a veteran you know like that and I used to do that you know quite often he would never know that I was doing it you know I just they're just tell them Bob it's it's on the house and Bob is taking care of you don't have to work and I would you know never made any any issue out of it but coming to find out um they had the Honda Classic here just recently and um my cousin um is over kind of bringing all the veterans there to the golf event and Bob was calling my cousin you know all the time like hey you got me tickets you got me tickets like yeah yeah I got you I'll take care of you so they um they were um just working with Bob and making sure that he was taking care of and he would go to his little special section there at the Honda Classic and he was he was like the chief of the area you know everybody knew Bob in his 90s and um so my cousin you know was getting ready to the the class was coming to a close and and uh his son uh told him since Bob Brett is ready to go he's like okay take him on to the car he says no dad I think this time you need to take Bob to the car I think you need to take him and he say um so he said yeah Dad I think you need to take him so my cousin put him in the in the in the uh in the the little golf cart and he uh and he told he said he told his son Chris I said Chris when I put him in the golf cart I want you to have everybody in that section just uh just salute Bob as he leaves here and uh so as as Bob would they got him in the golf cart everybody was upstairs they turned around and said Bob is leaving they all saluted Bob and just a special moment my cousin took him on a special ride through the Honda Classic places that most people couldn't get into but he took Bob through all of this to let him see everything and uh and Bob Summit told my cousin says I think he was just living just to be able to come one more time to this classic event and my my cousin just treated him with just utmost respect you know as a soldier and uh not sure not not knowing if he would make it you know another year uh but I tell you what they they uh for the best of his ability they send them home you know uh you know just as an honored Soldier and uh we certainly want to just pray for his family that God would just help them during this time but this man certainly was an icon here in in the community uh just well respected well known and I know many people are going to miss uh Bob they'll miss him a lot but let's just keep that family in prayer say Amen let's pray father we first want to say thank you for the word of God that has been given to us tonight um thank you for just using Brother Quentin to just share these things how we need to be so careful and judging or misjudging situations of being too quick to judge what we want to be we want to be righteous and what we're doing like you and we want to share your heart in the midst of every situation that we encounter Lord we want to remember a couple uh people Lord Bob and his family you've called him from this Earth and Lord his family now has to pick up all the pieces so we pray that you will undergird them that you would strengthen them that you would help them during this time it's not easy to lose a loved one and a man that has had a tremendous impact on a lot of people and uh Lord just been a staple here just you know everybody knew him wherever he went uh thank you for his service to our country and uh Lord we just asked that you would just undergird them and strengthen them Lord and help them during this moment we also want to remember this couple that lost their baby today God it's not easy going through anything like that we pray that you would give this couple strength that you would help them Lord during this time that you would touch them that you would just minister to their hearts Lord and only way that you can we actually we act so God that you would just minister to the Saints Lord as they leave this place but not your presence may they go Lord um and uh this Lord just encourage with the word of God tonight those that watched online may they be encouraged as well through what they heard here tonight we give you all the glory all the honor and all the Praises in Jesus name we pray amen amen another thing I just want to make mention of real quick uh keep brother Troy in prayer on on Sunday he'll be actually going to minister at a church there in Port St Lucie it's a pastor actually some of you all know brother Roosevelt that was there in in Okeechobee for a little bit he started a work there in Port St Lucie and brother Roosevelt has I think recently lost his daughter uh she had a baby and something you know after giving birth to the baby uh something happened I think he ended up losing her and then after he got through that then the enemy started attacking his body and uh and one thing I thought I heard that they were trying to take a footer or a part of the leg or something like that so he's really going through some things and they they called and asked brother true if he would come and and just help him you know so I'm happy that uh we got you know people that we can send from a church to help and uh so just keep him and pray that God would use them there just to be a help to the Saints in the in the church there in Port St Lucie on Sunday amen praise the Lord we'll have the the brothers come at this time to dismiss
