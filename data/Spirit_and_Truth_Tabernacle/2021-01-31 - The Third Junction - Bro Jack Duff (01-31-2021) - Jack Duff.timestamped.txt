[54:17] will pour out in those days
[54:19] of my spirit and they shall prophesy
[54:23] and i will show wonders in heaven above
[54:25] and signs in the earth beneath blood

[56:12] praise the lord just let me uh begin
[56:16] our journey here today with a quote out
[56:18] of the message the deity
[56:20] of jesus christ amen the deity of jesus
[56:23] christ
[56:25] um the prophet
[56:28] makes this statement uh he says
[56:33] and and now notice a little while
[56:37] and the world seeth me no more yet
[56:39] you'll see me
[56:40] for i'll be with you even in you uh
[56:44] even to the end of the world that's
[56:46] right
[56:47] he's here now amen
[56:50] he's here now i remember sister uh dixon
[56:54] telling me a testimony and uh you know
[56:57] she was talking about how she was just
[56:58] kind of going through some things in her
[57:00] body
[57:01] and uh and she was you know listening to
[57:04] the tapes of the prophet
[57:05] you know you hear him in the prayer line
[57:07] and praying for different people just
[57:09] just you know just
[57:10] my just the power of god you know moving
[57:13] on those tapes and
[57:14] and uh you know you know she and she was
[57:17] just saying how she would just feel in
[57:18] the presence of god come down
[57:20] and and and she said lord if we could
[57:23] just have that prophet here
[57:26] if we could just have that property here
[57:27] be able to get into one of them services
[57:29] and
[57:29] and um and just enjoy the presence of
[57:32] the lord if that prophet was here
[57:34] you know and then uh she said she heard
[57:36] the voice of the lord say
[57:38] he is here now you got to catch who he
[57:41] is right when
[57:44] when when the lord say he is here what
[57:46] the lord was actually telling her
[57:48] is that the presence that came with the
[57:51] prophet never left
[57:53] come on somebody amen it wasn't brother
[57:56] branham that did those things
[57:58] it was just god vindicating him but that
[58:01] presence
[58:01] is still here that anointing is still
[58:04] here and if you have a need this morning
[58:07] whatever you need god's got it

[1:00:08] hallelujah glory to god i rebuke you
[1:00:11] satan in the name of jesus loose my
[1:00:14] brother in the name of jesus
[1:00:16] lose my sister in the name of jesus
[1:00:19] glory to god and i'm expecting the devil
[1:00:23] to let him go too
[1:00:25] amen church glory to god he goes on and
[1:00:28] says an
[1:00:29] hour has come now that when the great
[1:00:31] drama
[1:00:32] picture of god set forth of the latter
[1:00:35] rain
[1:00:36] joel said in the last days it shall come
[1:00:39] to pass that i'll pour out my spirit
[1:00:41] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[1:00:43] daughters shall prophesy
[1:00:44] upon my handmaids and maidservants will
[1:00:47] i pour out of my spirit
[1:00:48] and i'll show signs in the heaven above
[1:00:51] and signs in the earth below now you all
[1:00:53] um realize that we just had a a couple
[1:00:56] signs just show up in the heavens
[1:00:59] recently they had what they call the
[1:01:01] christmas star now that's what they
[1:01:03] named it i'm just telling you what they
[1:01:04] named it
[1:01:05] but it was uh multiple planets that
[1:01:07] aligned amen and it looked like one i
[1:01:10] forget that
[1:01:10] the three planets it was but you know
[1:01:12] they all align they say now
[1:01:14] they were saying that when when that
[1:01:16] happens typically
[1:01:17] it signals that a change is getting
[1:01:19] ready to happen
[1:01:20] also if i can just put its way it
[1:01:22] signals that we're at a junction
[1:01:24] right when that when that occurs in the
[1:01:27] heavens there's a junction that is
[1:01:28] taking place
[1:01:29] right and and they even tried to try to
[1:01:31] say now maybe this is what happened when
[1:01:33] jesus was born now we know jesus did was
[1:01:35] not born in
[1:01:36] december we realized that amen so when
[1:01:39] they call it the christmas style
[1:01:40] that's all they know but we know as
[1:01:43] believers that's not the time that jesus
[1:01:44] was born
[1:01:45] but maybe yes the stars did align
[1:01:47] because the wise men followed the star
[1:01:50] hallelujah and i'm going to tell you
[1:01:52] them wise men as they follow the star
[1:01:54] and led them right to the presence of
[1:01:56] the lord jesus
[1:01:57] and i'm going to tell you if you want to
[1:01:58] find christ today you're going to have
[1:02:00] to follow his star
[1:02:04] glory to god and the star's job is to
[1:02:06] lead you to the presence of the lord
[1:02:09] jesus
[1:02:10] what star am i talking about one of them
[1:02:11] seven stars that was in the hand
[1:02:14] of the lord jesus according to the book
[1:02:16] of revelation
[1:02:18] hallelujah glory to god we're following
[1:02:21] that star
[1:02:22] and that starts bringing us into the
[1:02:24] presence of the lord jesus
[1:02:25] all right he goes on and says this amen
[1:02:28] uh it says i'll pour out my spirit
[1:02:30] and i'll show signs in the heavens of
[1:02:32] heaven above and signs in the earth
[1:02:34] below
[1:02:34] and pillars of fire and vapor smoke it
[1:02:36] shall come to pass
[1:02:38] before the great and terrible day of the
[1:02:39] lord shall come that whosoever shall
[1:02:41] call upon the name of lord
[1:02:42] shall be saved jesus said in there
[1:02:46] these things that i do you
[1:02:49] shall do and greater than this
[1:02:52] for i go unto my father so there's some
[1:02:55] work
[1:02:56] left on this earth for us to do amen
[1:02:59] glory to god he says hallelujah
[1:03:00] hallelujah here's what it said
[1:03:02] and the word back there said he said if
[1:03:05] ye abide in me
[1:03:07] and my word abide in you ask what you
[1:03:10] will
[1:03:10] and it shall be given unto you so we're
[1:03:13] just kind of laying this this this this
[1:03:15] platform
[1:03:16] this foundation uh we're under
[1:03:18] expectation
[1:03:20] you know somebody had uh uh called me
[1:03:23] and
[1:03:23] you know they're not members of the
[1:03:26] church or anything but they call me and
[1:03:28] just a family member and said you know i
[1:03:29] had a dream that somebody in your family
[1:03:31] was pregnant i say
[1:03:32] my family i say well you know okay we'll
[1:03:36] see about that
[1:03:37] say i i only know one person in my
[1:03:39] family
[1:03:40] that is uh in the category
[1:03:44] you know of of of that happening you
[1:03:46] know and that'll be just fine if it
[1:03:48] happened that way that's fine
[1:03:50] praise the lord but uh but you know i
[1:03:52] began to think about that
[1:03:53] you know because uh spiritually you
[1:03:55] gotta watch things
[1:03:57] right and i said the lord just began to
[1:03:59] deal with me say now you know when a
[1:04:01] woman
[1:04:01] is pregnant uh and she's expecting
[1:04:05] right uh there's a certain time limit
[1:04:09] that is set by nature
[1:04:12] you understand nature sets a time limit
[1:04:15] that
[1:04:15] i don't care how much you say you expect
[1:04:17] it
[1:04:18] amen people want to see what you
[1:04:21] expected
[1:04:22] you understand and nature has a way of
[1:04:25] saying hey
[1:04:26] in nine months we're gonna deliver to
[1:04:28] the world
[1:04:29] what you were expecting a little boy a
[1:04:32] little girl is getting ready to come
[1:04:33] forth hallelujah
[1:04:35] and i say if i'm expecting amen that i'm
[1:04:38] looking for god to manifest certain
[1:04:40] things
[1:04:41] in our midst i said i'm expecting
[1:04:44] restoration
[1:04:45] i'm expecting deliverance i'm expecting
[1:04:50] praise god a new church in a new school
[1:04:52] i'm expecting to see my family saved
[1:04:55] glory to god i'm expecting for to get

[1:05:15] business to be blessed
[1:05:17] somebody ought to be under expectation
[1:05:20] for god to move on your behalf
[1:05:23] glory to god we don't want to just carry
[1:05:25] the baby
[1:05:26] and never deliver i believe the season
[1:05:29] has come
[1:05:31] and the time is here for the church to
[1:05:34] deliver
[1:05:35] what has been expecting
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:40] glory to god
[1:05:43] hallelujah amen
[1:05:47] glory to god i'm i'm under we're we're
[1:05:50] ready to see great things happen
[1:05:52] so just land these things here and you
[1:05:54] know so
[1:05:55] uh when we talk about junctions uh
[1:05:58] remember the prophet tells us very
[1:06:00] clearly
[1:06:01] that we're supposed to expect a
[1:06:03] miraculous right
[1:06:05] it says it always takes the miraculous
[1:06:07] to speak of omnipotence
[1:06:09] says omnipotence is y'all powerful and
[1:06:11] it takes the miraculous to vindicate
[1:06:13] omnipotence so
[1:06:14] when we're at junctions we expect
[1:06:16] miracles to occur
[1:06:18] oh god we're gonna go back and just look
[1:06:20] at some of the things you know we talked
[1:06:22] about the first junction it was the days
[1:06:24] of noah
[1:06:25] brother branham gave us seven different
[1:06:26] junctions and the first was knowing the
[1:06:28] ark
[1:06:29] then the second was moses and the
[1:06:31] children of israel the third
[1:06:33] is abraham and lot glory the fourth will
[1:06:36] be elijah the 450 prophets of baal
[1:06:39] the fifth is jesus coming at the fifth
[1:06:42] junction
[1:06:43] uh the sixth was martin luther and john
[1:06:46] wesley
[1:06:46] and then the seventh would be the second
[1:06:48] coming of christ now
[1:06:50] as i mentioned there's you know i won't
[1:06:51] read all these quotes i just mentioned
[1:06:53] them in the past and i'm just hitting
[1:06:54] them again
[1:06:55] every junction god sends a prophet
[1:06:58] at every junction god sends a prophet at
[1:07:00] every junction there's
[1:07:01] the miraculous that's gonna happen and
[1:07:04] let me just kind of back up
[1:07:05] uh and just say now when a junction can
[1:07:07] be uh
[1:07:08] seen when you when you leave the parking
[1:07:11] lot
[1:07:12] today you're going to hit a junction
[1:07:15] before you actually get out the parking
[1:07:17] lot
[1:07:20] i mean before you get out the parking
[1:07:21] lot you got to hit a junction
[1:07:23] now the junction is a stop sign
[1:07:26] right and everybody no matter which
[1:07:28] direction you're going
[1:07:30] you have to stop and then you have to
[1:07:32] kind of make some judgments
[1:07:34] as to you know is it time for me to make
[1:07:36] a right turn or
[1:07:37] can i make that left turn because that
[1:07:39] traffic coming from both ways
[1:07:41] you got to make decisions at a junction
[1:07:44] hallelujah and if you fail to make the
[1:07:47] right decision
[1:07:48] it'll be an accident out there
[1:07:52] come on somebody and i don't care if you
[1:07:55] want to go left
[1:07:57] i don't care how fast you pull out that
[1:07:59] parking lot
[1:08:00] you're going to hit another truck
[1:08:04] you're going to hit the stoplight and if
[1:08:06] you fail to make the right decision at
[1:08:08] the stoplight
[1:08:10] you can create a mess so we're all at
[1:08:13] junction spiritual junctions and we must
[1:08:16] make the right decision
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:19] amen now here you know the prophet tells
[1:08:21] us that noah
[1:08:23] and the ark was the first junction and
[1:08:25] we know noah was the prophet that was
[1:08:27] sent
[1:08:27] at that first junction but when we
[1:08:29] talked about some of the miracles that
[1:08:31] happened
[1:08:32] amen in that day one of the miracles to
[1:08:33] me is just seeing the animals come
[1:08:36] i mean animals had enough sense
[1:08:39] they can't even hear the gospel preach
[1:08:43] they understand they can't even make a
[1:08:45] uh if they can't they can't hear noah
[1:08:47] talk about it's gonna rain
[1:08:48] they don't even care what noah's saying
[1:08:51] but that's
[1:08:52] instinct come on somebody god
[1:08:55] gave them supernatural instinct to
[1:08:57] recognize something getting ready to
[1:08:58] happen
[1:09:00] and i don't know where they came from
[1:09:01] but they begin to walk two by two
[1:09:04] maybe by vision god showed him a big
[1:09:07] boat somewhere
[1:09:08] and they knew even the giraffes knew
[1:09:10] that the boat was big enough for them
[1:09:12] even the elephants knew that the boat
[1:09:14] was big enough for them
[1:09:16] praise god and the lions had no
[1:09:18] appetites
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:24] right everybody was going in for
[1:09:26] protection
[1:09:27] everybody was going in for security amen
[1:09:31] by
[1:09:31] by supernatural instinct they're being
[1:09:34] drawn to what noah had built
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:37] glory to god that was a miracle all in
[1:09:39] itself just to see the animals come
[1:09:42] you would think the people once they saw
[1:09:44] these animals coming to know us both
[1:09:46] they would have thought man
[1:09:47] maybe something's going on maybe i
[1:09:49] should repent
[1:09:51] hallelujah glory to god but
[1:09:54] as i said before one of the problems in
[1:09:56] noah's death that nobody would come to
[1:09:58] repentance
[1:09:59] god could get nobody to repent the man
[1:10:01] preached for 120 years and nobody came
[1:10:04] to the altar
[1:10:06] i'm gonna read a quote on this in a
[1:10:08] little bit but the miracles the animals
[1:10:10] coming the miracle is the door being
[1:10:12] closed by almighty god
[1:10:15] amen the miracle was the rain actually
[1:10:18] falling because it had never rained
[1:10:20] before those were miracles
[1:10:22] and uh and brother branham said one of
[1:10:23] the other great miracles that happened
[1:10:25] it was the miracle was how god had his
[1:10:28] believing children
[1:10:30] chuck tucked away in the ark of safety
[1:10:33] so that's a miracle that god can get
[1:10:35] somebody to believe
[1:10:36] and will come into this arc of safety
[1:10:38] what is the ark of safety today
[1:10:40] it is being it's being tucked into
[1:10:43] christ the word
[1:10:45] outside of that there is no safety
[1:10:49] let me put it this way outside of the
[1:10:50] reveal word for your day
[1:10:52] there is no safety
[1:10:56] oh i know sometimes that is very hard
[1:10:59] for people to take
[1:11:01] very hard but let's just give some
[1:11:03] examples if you didn't follow noah's
[1:11:06] message
[1:11:07] what happened death right
[1:11:10] now i'm talking about i'm talking about
[1:11:12] uh thousands of years ago
[1:11:14] if you didn't follow noah's message
[1:11:16] death
[1:11:17] if you didn't follow moses message
[1:11:21] death praise the lord i mean this is
[1:11:24] just how god
[1:11:25] operates look we're not going to come
[1:11:27] down to land to see and change the way
[1:11:29] god operates
[1:11:31] all we got to do is follow the patterns
[1:11:33] and if we can't come in line
[1:11:34] with the revealed word for our day it
[1:11:37] will be
[1:11:38] death spiritual death now i'm going to
[1:11:40] tell you something
[1:11:41] i'm going to shock you right now the
[1:11:44] problem is in this day is that people
[1:11:46] actually
[1:11:46] think they're alive
[1:11:49] when you read revelation 3 they actually
[1:11:51] think they're alive
[1:11:52] they actually think they got it going on
[1:11:55] and god said that's the spirit that's
[1:11:57] going to be in the land to actually
[1:11:58] deceive the people
[1:11:59] to think that they're doing right but if
[1:12:02] you're not
[1:12:02] following the reveal word for your day
[1:12:05] you're not doing right
[1:12:08] all right church the miracle is that god
[1:12:11] can get some people into the ark into
[1:12:13] the word
[1:12:14] into christ and they be tucked away
[1:12:17] while all the other stuff is going on
[1:12:18] out there
[1:12:19] look at this i want to read this out of
[1:12:22] resume of the ages
[1:12:24] the prophet says this harvest time
[1:12:28] it says have you noticed that in the
[1:12:30] harvest time
[1:12:31] though there is a real acceleration in
[1:12:34] the ripening
[1:12:35] it says there is consequently a slowing
[1:12:39] of growth
[1:12:40] until there is no growth right
[1:12:43] he says is that not exactly what we are
[1:12:45] seeing now
[1:12:46] it says the false vine is losing
[1:12:49] multitudes to the communists
[1:12:51] and various other types of belief her
[1:12:53] numbers are not increasing as she would
[1:12:55] like
[1:12:56] us to think right her hold on to people
[1:12:59] and i was just sharing this this morning
[1:13:01] with a few brothers
[1:13:02] when it comes to the false vine versus
[1:13:03] the true vine the false vine gonna
[1:13:05] always have more members
[1:13:07] than a true vine you know the bible say
[1:13:10] more
[1:13:10] amen uh uh are the children of the
[1:13:13] desolate
[1:13:14] wife right the deadliest desolate one
[1:13:16] than the married wife
[1:13:18] right so it's always going to look like
[1:13:20] they doing much more because
[1:13:21] all these great numbers but that's not
[1:13:23] the answer to god
[1:13:24] that's not the end just because you see
[1:13:26] a lot of numbers that don't it's not
[1:13:31] it's quantity q word quality
[1:13:35] glory to god all right let's go on he
[1:13:37] says
[1:13:38] her numbers are not increasing she would
[1:13:39] like us to think her hold on to people's
[1:13:41] not what it used to be
[1:13:42] and in so many cases going to church is
[1:13:45] just a show
[1:13:48] y'all y'all know the prophet just nailed
[1:13:50] that thing speaking this 60 years ago
[1:13:53] going to church is just a show
[1:13:57] glory to god and the true vine what
[1:13:59] about her is she growing
[1:14:02] i'm gonna just i'm gonna have to just
[1:14:03] make these comments here y'all just bear
[1:14:04] with me
[1:14:05] you know back in my day going to uh i
[1:14:07] grew up baptist and back in my day
[1:14:09] it was a show it's just people want to
[1:14:11] show they they hat
[1:14:13] they wanted to show they they knew suit
[1:14:16] right you know it was all about that now
[1:14:17] the day when you go
[1:14:18] uh it's it's the musicians want to put
[1:14:20] on the show
[1:14:22] it's the singers that want to put on the
[1:14:24] show it's the preachers even want to put
[1:14:26] on a show
[1:14:27] right everybody got to be entertained
[1:14:29] we're not here to entertain nobody
[1:14:31] i thank god when i heard this message i
[1:14:34] want to listen to a prophet grab his ear
[1:14:36] and hum and do nothing like that man you
[1:14:39] had to be able to identify with the
[1:14:41] words
[1:14:43] glory to god this was not gonna move
[1:14:45] your flesh
[1:14:46] actually this was gonna shake some
[1:14:48] things down off your flesh
[1:14:50] hallelujah somebody it was gonna cause
[1:14:53] you to live holy
[1:14:56] praise god amen and i appreciate being
[1:15:00] able to hear the voice of a prophet like
[1:15:02] that
[1:15:02] tell me the truth i told i
[1:15:06] remember brother mike told me one time
[1:15:07] when he first came to church and said
[1:15:08] brother jack don't tell me how to sin i
[1:15:10] already know how to do that
[1:15:12] say speak to me the truth so i can make
[1:15:15] it to heaven i said brother you got the
[1:15:17] right church here
[1:15:18] if that's what you want truth you came
[1:15:20] to the right place spirit and
[1:15:22] all right glory to god let me keep
[1:15:25] reading
[1:15:26] amen so the true vine what about her is
[1:15:28] she growing
[1:15:29] what where are all those vast numbers
[1:15:31] that keep coming to revivals and answer
[1:15:33] all the calls
[1:15:34] are not most of them merely emotional in
[1:15:37] their approach
[1:15:38] or desires of something physical rather
[1:15:41] than design
[1:15:42] that which is truly spiritual see
[1:15:45] is this age not like the day which noah
[1:15:49] entered the ark and the door was shut
[1:15:52] but yet god terry's judgment tearing the
[1:15:55] judgment
[1:15:56] seven days no one
[1:15:59] was literally turned to god in those
[1:16:02] silent days

[1:18:02] this this first junction one of the
[1:18:05] problems they had is people would not

[1:18:08] days of noah
[1:18:10] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:18:12] of man we see the same spirits have
[1:18:14] entered into the land
[1:18:15] uh even today i mean i think about this
[1:18:17] pandemic and
[1:18:18] man when the pandemic first first hit
[1:18:20] you talk about people calling me and
[1:18:22] wanting to be baptized and you know want
[1:18:25] to get back to service as soon as the
[1:18:26] church door is open

[1:18:44] you're waiting too late and look i mean
[1:18:46] you thought covet 19 with something
[1:18:49] wait till the next thing come yeah all
[1:18:51] right hallelujah
[1:18:52] and i'm gonna tell you something this
[1:18:53] not surprising because the prophet said
[1:18:55] it was going to happen
[1:18:57] the prophet actually said it said
[1:18:59] plagues would strike now what happened
[1:19:01] in uh in the second exodus i mean the
[1:19:03] second junction
[1:19:05] plagues plagues
[1:19:08] in the second junction moses and the
[1:19:11] children of israel it was 10 plagues
[1:19:13] that struck
[1:19:14] things that they i mean lord let me just
[1:19:16] go through this
[1:19:17] you know but but but you know it things
[1:19:19] that that the magicians have never seen
[1:19:21] right
[1:19:23] can i put it this way things the doctors
[1:19:26] have not studied glory to god things
[1:19:30] that they
[1:19:30] wait a minute i mean even the scientists
[1:19:33] are trying to figure it out
[1:19:36] they don't know where this thing comes
[1:19:37] from hallelujah it's a it's a
[1:19:40] invisible enemy amen yeah
[1:19:45] you know he and the the sad part is that
[1:19:47] the invisible
[1:19:48] enemy is moving right here right now
[1:19:52] but i'ma tell you in that in that that
[1:19:54] second junction
[1:19:56] glory to god there was an invisible
[1:19:58] enemy that began to move
[1:20:00] it was the plague of death glory to god
[1:20:03] somebody
[1:20:04] and that plague of death was striking
[1:20:05] whoever did not have blood applied
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:09] you had to have it on the top of the
[1:20:11] door and on the sides of the door
[1:20:13] you had to have it applied it must be
[1:20:16] seen
[1:20:19] glory to god that token had to be
[1:20:23] seen by the death angel and today when
[1:20:26] this virus is spreading here the token
[1:20:28] is on display
[1:20:31] praise god
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:34] the token the token must be on display
[1:20:36] the the life of christ
[1:20:38] must be on display we got to have the
[1:20:41] holy ghost the baptism
[1:20:43] of the holy ghost it must be on display
[1:20:47] let me just make it plain this morning
[1:20:49] you know when a person is baptized
[1:20:52] it's a stark difference in the person
[1:20:55] that's been baptized into others that's
[1:20:57] just watching the baptism
[1:21:00] the one that's been baptized comes up
[1:21:02] wet
[1:21:04] why everybody else is dry you can see
[1:21:07] the difference that something has
[1:21:08] happened to this person
[1:21:10] but what you think gonna happen when
[1:21:12] when a person is baptized with the holy
[1:21:14] ghost
[1:21:15] there should be a stark difference in
[1:21:17] the way that that person lives versus a
[1:21:19] person that has not been baptized
[1:21:21] with the holy ghost it's got to be
[1:21:25] changed it's got to be
[1:21:26] changed glory to god
[1:21:30] all right the second junction moses and
[1:21:33] the children of israel
[1:21:35] some of the moses was the prophet to
[1:21:37] that junction
[1:21:38] amen and uh some of the miracles that
[1:21:41] happened during that junction was
[1:21:43] uh throwing down a snake his stick
[1:21:46] and it turned to a snake and when he
[1:21:48] threw down that stick and it turned to a
[1:21:50] snake
[1:21:51] another america's watching his snake eat
[1:21:53] up the other snakes
[1:21:56] because you had some folk at the
[1:21:57] junction that was going to challenge
[1:21:59] this prophet
[1:22:01] some of them say there's nothing but a a
[1:22:03] cheap magician trick
[1:22:05] and laura said that ain't supernatural
[1:22:08] that's a cheap magician trick
[1:22:10] glory to god moses thought it was
[1:22:12] supernatural
[1:22:13] but here the magicians say now you got
[1:22:15] them you got to think to yourself
[1:22:16] what were these people practicing in
[1:22:20] egypt that they could throw down they
[1:22:22] sticks and they become snakes
[1:22:24] and they they actually look at moses say
[1:22:26] ain't nothing to that
[1:22:30] think about what were they practicing
[1:22:32] glory to god
[1:22:33] right uh uh one of the other miracles
[1:22:35] that happened when when moses spoke out
[1:22:37] of his
[1:22:38] mouth by inspiration egyptians you've
[1:22:39] seen today you'll see them no more
[1:22:41] forever
[1:22:42] that was the spoken word that occurred
[1:22:45] in that junction hallelujah another
[1:22:49] was uh when i when i look at uh uh moses
[1:22:52] and these templates
[1:22:53] brother branham makes a statement he
[1:22:55] said the creator
[1:22:57] characteristic of god was in moses
[1:23:01] i'm gonna say that again the creator
[1:23:04] characteristic of god was in
[1:23:08] moses i'm saying that to say this the
[1:23:10] creator
[1:23:12] characteristic of god is now in his
[1:23:15] plight
[1:23:16] amen amen glory to god
[1:23:20] moses called for the ten plagues water
[1:23:22] uh
[1:23:23] turned the blood frogs lights flies
[1:23:25] livestock boils
[1:23:26] uh a hell mingle with fire locust
[1:23:29] darkness death of the firstborn he
[1:23:31] called for these plagues
[1:23:32] glory to god now i want to just kind of
[1:23:34] drop this i left this from
[1:23:36] from last week but i was just reading a
[1:23:38] little something out of a note from one
[1:23:39] of my bibles
[1:23:40] and it just says um as each plague
[1:23:44] descended
[1:23:44] upon the land the egyptian people
[1:23:47] realize
[1:23:48] how powerless their own gods were to
[1:23:51] stop it
[1:23:53] when the third plague of lice was
[1:23:55] released
[1:23:56] the magicians confessed to to pharaoh
[1:24:00] this is the finger of god they realize
[1:24:02] they can stop it
[1:24:04] every every time the devil do something
[1:24:05] god will one up the devil
[1:24:08] i'm gonna say it again every time the
[1:24:10] devil do something
[1:24:12] god will one up the devil and i want you
[1:24:15] to know this morning every time the
[1:24:16] devil do something in your life
[1:24:19] if he pulls one out he gonna bring one
[1:24:21] in
[1:24:22] and not only that if he pulls one out he
[1:24:24] gonna bring the same one back
[1:24:26] and he gonna give him a testimony that
[1:24:28] will shake hell
[1:24:33] glory to god amen so uh uh
[1:24:36] they they had a god that they served in
[1:24:38] uh
[1:24:39] in egypt and i believe his name was was
[1:24:43] either
[1:24:43] hoppy or happy i don't know it's hapi
[1:24:47] happy or happy right uh it was the god
[1:24:50] of the nile river
[1:24:52] uh but that god could not stop the
[1:24:54] waters from being turned into blood
[1:24:58] hallelujah they had another guy by the
[1:25:00] name of hathor
[1:25:02] he was the crafty cow goddess and uh
[1:25:05] and when moses spoke against the
[1:25:07] livestock that
[1:25:08] god of egypt could not stop the spoken
[1:25:11] word
[1:25:12] of god from being manifested against the
[1:25:14] livestock
[1:25:15] hallelujah amen there was another god
[1:25:18] that they served because remember
[1:25:19] uh uh pharaoh wanted to know who is the
[1:25:22] lord
[1:25:24] who is the lord well every time moses
[1:25:27] called the plague
[1:25:28] pharaoh got to know who the lord was not
[1:25:31] only who the lord was
[1:25:33] he also got to know where
[1:25:36] the lord was the lord was veiled
[1:25:40] inside of moses
[1:25:45] where they had another god that they
[1:25:46] served his name was a monray
[1:25:48] right now it was egyptian sun god
[1:25:52] and chief of the egyptian gods but when
[1:25:54] when moses spoke for darkness
[1:25:57] that god could not stop the eerie
[1:25:59] darkness from coming to land for three
[1:26:01] full days
[1:26:04] i love this because israel while egypt
[1:26:06] was walking in darkness
[1:26:08] israel was walking in light see god
[1:26:11] caused a separation of light and
[1:26:13] darkness
[1:26:14] amen at that time when that plague was
[1:26:17] what was to come
[1:26:18] but you know god also caused another
[1:26:20] separation of light and darkness in the
[1:26:22] midst of
[1:26:22] uh as a miracle there when they got to
[1:26:25] the red sea
[1:26:26] glory to god when they got to the red
[1:26:28] sea uh here
[1:26:29] moses is sticking his rod out and god is
[1:26:31] making a way for the people to go
[1:26:33] pharaoh's army is behind him and
[1:26:35] pharaoh's army is in darkness
[1:26:37] while the children of israel walking in
[1:26:38] the light
[1:26:40] church i want to say that's where we are
[1:26:42] today there's many walking in darkness
[1:26:44] but yet we are walking in the light the
[1:26:47] reveal word
[1:26:49] for our day now let me move forward
[1:26:52] to this third junction i want to look at
[1:26:55] a couple quotes out of the message the
[1:26:57] junction of time
[1:26:59] starting at paragraph e25
[1:27:02] glory this third junction abraham and
[1:27:06] lot
[1:27:08] when lot and abraham another time when
[1:27:11] abraham was to be the ruler of the world
[1:27:14] it says and his seed was to scatter over
[1:27:16] the earth he had a lot his nephew with
[1:27:18] him
[1:27:19] which was a relative glory to god
[1:27:23] and what a beautiful picture today of
[1:27:24] the cold formal
[1:27:26] indifferent church to the spirit born
[1:27:28] elected called out
[1:27:29] separated church of the living god
[1:27:33] they dwelled together on the same plane
[1:27:37] but it finally come to a time to where
[1:27:40] lot
[1:27:40] took his great group and went down into
[1:27:43] sodom
[1:27:44] and gomorrah where they'd be popular
[1:27:49] so the purpose of lot going down is
[1:27:51] because he wanted to be popular
[1:27:53] and another thing amen when you go back
[1:27:55] and read the scripture
[1:27:56] you'll understand that that that lot
[1:27:59] didn't want to dwell
[1:28:00] in the planes come on somebody
[1:28:04] he didn't want to dwell in the plans he
[1:28:05] wanted to go to the city that was
[1:28:06] established and become popular and he
[1:28:09] did just that
[1:28:10] right he i mean he he was there one of
[1:28:12] the rulers down there in the city
[1:28:14] glory to god but but but uh and and i
[1:28:17] can tell you this
[1:28:18] amen i might as well say just hold that
[1:28:20] uh for me just for a second i'll get
[1:28:22] back to it
[1:28:23] uh sarah also didn't want to be down
[1:28:26] there in the plains
[1:28:28] sarah didn't want to be in the plains
[1:28:30] brother branham gave us
[1:28:32] you know uh something that happened uh
[1:28:34] when abraham and sarah
[1:28:37] received their visitation from almighty
[1:28:40] god and the two angels that
[1:28:42] came with him god stepped in flesh and
[1:28:44] came down to visit
[1:28:45] abraham and sarah he said now the
[1:28:48] problem was is that
[1:28:50] sarah was a little a man she had an
[1:28:53] attitude problem
[1:28:54] before the angel visited sarah was
[1:28:57] upset with abraham sarah was actually
[1:29:00] thinking about
[1:29:01] how mislot had it going on down in sodom
[1:29:06] glory to god somebody sarah was like i
[1:29:09] mean i mean
[1:29:10] they're not dwelling in the planes like
[1:29:12] we are i mean
[1:29:13] what am i saying about dwelling in the
[1:29:15] planks we gotta wear these dresses
[1:29:17] we gotta wear these skirts uh we can't
[1:29:21] put on this fingernail polish and
[1:29:22] we can't put on this you know we got to
[1:29:24] be so plain
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:28] all right amen that did i'm gonna tell
[1:29:30] you the seeds of
[1:29:31] abraham don't mind dwelling in the
[1:29:34] plains
[1:29:37] come on somebody but sarah was a little
[1:29:40] disappointed that she had to be so plain
[1:29:43] look at miss lot and look at her but see
[1:29:45] what saturday realized is that
[1:29:47] what had overtaken miss lot caused her
[1:29:50] to turn to stone
[1:29:54] right she she loved the the the style
[1:29:58] and
[1:29:58] sodom so much she loved her position
[1:30:03] in sodom summit even when god was
[1:30:05] destroying the place
[1:30:07] she loved it so much that she had to
[1:30:09] turn in her heart and look back to it
[1:30:12] desiring and wishing that she could go
[1:30:14] back to some of them fun times
[1:30:16] let me tell you some of them fun times
[1:30:18] are over here
[1:30:23] amen but here miss lot just you know she
[1:30:26] uh
[1:30:27] she down there and joining so even when
[1:30:29] it's time to leave and
[1:30:30] can you imagine angels coming to your
[1:30:33] house this is some of the supernatural
[1:30:35] some of the miraculous that happened in
[1:30:37] the days of abraham like
[1:30:38] angels coming to your house glory to god
[1:30:42] these same angels came to sarah's house
[1:30:45] and sarah prepared a meal for hallelujah
[1:30:48] god
[1:30:49] and and as they're there preparing the
[1:30:50] meal oh she hears
[1:30:52] uh god speak to abraham say where's

[1:31:06] good bible reader you know
[1:31:08] abraham laughed as well but sarah was
[1:31:11] laughing
[1:31:12] with an attitude
[1:31:16] she was already under the wrong spirits
[1:31:19] uh i could just imagine like me and my
[1:31:22] me and my
[1:31:23] lord have pleasure again right
[1:31:28] she didn't know who was sitting at the
[1:31:29] tent

[1:31:33] we as the bride of christ we
[1:31:35] laugh at the promises but it's time to
[1:31:37] stop laughing i'm gonna tell you
[1:31:39] something else
[1:31:39] you're laughing ain't gonna stop god
[1:31:44] your unbelief won't stop god your
[1:31:47] doubt won't stop god if god has made a
[1:31:50] promise it's gonna be made manifest
[1:31:55] glory to god sarah sat there laughing
[1:31:57] and saying now watch sarah laughs she
[1:31:58] said oh i went laughing see now you're

[1:32:03] bad spirit on you

[1:32:08] heard you but that's okay you still
[1:32:10] gonna have a child according to the time
[1:32:11] of life i will visit you
[1:32:13] amen so one of the great things that
[1:32:15] happened
[1:32:16] amen one of the great great great great
[1:32:18] great things was the changing of the
[1:32:20] body
[1:32:21] let me uh let me get back to my quote
[1:32:23] i'm always already way ahead of myself
[1:32:26] glory to god let me get back to this
[1:32:28] quote
[1:32:30] they dwell together on the same plane
[1:32:32] but it finally
[1:32:34] came come to a time where lot
[1:32:37] took his great group and went down into
[1:32:39] sodom and gomorrah where they'd be
[1:32:40] popular
[1:32:41] where they would take the choice of the
[1:32:43] land and abraham state
[1:32:46] i like this abraham stayed in the will
[1:32:49] of god
[1:32:50] and took the poor of the land and now
[1:32:53] you know
[1:32:54] by abraham taking the poor he just by
[1:32:56] abraham being a part of it it made it
[1:32:57] blessed
[1:32:59] right abraham uh took the portal and he
[1:33:01] let he let lot make his choice
[1:33:03] you know we got this we got this
[1:33:05] division that come among us
[1:33:07] now you make the choice which way you
[1:33:08] want to go a lot and whatever you take
[1:33:10] i'll take the less
[1:33:11] now most of us got to be we got to be
[1:33:13] able to have that same type of attitude
[1:33:15] if there's a time to make a choice
[1:33:17] always prefer your brother before you
[1:33:19] prefer your sister before you
[1:33:22] amen well you know this all well if this
[1:33:24] is what we got
[1:33:25] i'ma take this don't be like that
[1:33:29] amen watch this it says uh
[1:33:32] uh but if i he says uh let me let me i
[1:33:36] got ahead of myself somewhere abraham
[1:33:39] stayed in the will of god and took the
[1:33:40] point of the land sarah his beautiful
[1:33:42] wife and abraham stayed on the poor of
[1:33:43] the ground
[1:33:44] in order that they could serve the lord
[1:33:48] god don't promise a flowery bed of
[1:33:50] eating
[1:33:52] don't falsify a christian
[1:33:55] and don't falsify the message by telling
[1:33:59] that
[1:33:59] everything's gonna be all right if
[1:34:02] you're going to church and then i'll
[1:34:03] tell you you're going to have some
[1:34:04] trials they lying to you
[1:34:07] right don't falsify the message by
[1:34:09] telling that everything's going to be
[1:34:11] all right
[1:34:11] there's nothing going to harm you
[1:34:13] there's nothing ain't no trials or
[1:34:15] nothing that's wrong
[1:34:17] he said as a poet said must i be carried
[1:34:20] home
[1:34:20] to heaven on a flower bed of ease while
[1:34:22] others fought to win the prize
[1:34:24] and sail through the bloody seas no sir
[1:34:26] god doesn't promise
[1:34:28] ease and prosperity but he promises
[1:34:31] grace
[1:34:32] to endure in every trial it's the grace
[1:34:36] that we look to
[1:34:39] man they used to sing a song in the old
[1:34:41] church say lord don't move the mountain
[1:34:44] but give me strength to climb
[1:34:47] hallelujah lysis goes on and says
[1:34:49] abraham chose the way of god
[1:34:52] he stayed on the mountaintop though
[1:34:54] there wasn't
[1:34:55] much grass for his cattle but a lot a
[1:34:58] type of the backslidden world
[1:35:00] the church who doesn't believe in the
[1:35:02] miraculous then it finally come to those
[1:35:04] things
[1:35:05] round around into god until there had to
[1:35:08] come a junction
[1:35:10] there had to be a time for abraham was
[1:35:13] the heir of the land
[1:35:14] oh god what can't christians see blessed
[1:35:17] are the pure in the heart
[1:35:18] they shall see god blessed are the meek
[1:35:21] they shall inherit the earth
[1:35:22] the junction time is at hand for father
[1:35:25] to show that we're at the
[1:35:26] end time see now there's uh
[1:35:30] a lot of things that happened in
[1:35:32] abraham's life you know and i'm just
[1:35:34] kind of picking up some of the
[1:35:35] some of the highlights just to bring
[1:35:36] them to you today and and um
[1:35:39] you know as we we just we just look at
[1:35:41] him so many
[1:35:42] uh uh times where he hit a junction
[1:35:46] you know first time it is leaving his
[1:35:48] his homeland
[1:35:49] leaving the people that he he knew
[1:35:51] everything about leaving him and going
[1:35:52] to search for a city whose building
[1:35:54] maker was god that was a junction
[1:35:56] that was a junction and uh when god
[1:35:58] called lot he didn't
[1:35:59] i mean when god called abraham he did
[1:36:01] not call lot
[1:36:03] abraham brought lot along with him and
[1:36:05] it created problems for him
[1:36:08] abraham hit another junction he had to
[1:36:11] separate from lot
[1:36:12] and when you read the bible you'll
[1:36:14] realize that abraham was finally
[1:36:16] shown by god this is what i brought you
[1:36:19] into
[1:36:20] once he's separated from lot then he
[1:36:23] could see the blessings that god had for
[1:36:25] him
[1:36:25] and i'm gonna tell you you're not gonna
[1:36:26] see all the blessing of god till you
[1:36:28] separate from some things
[1:36:32] amen it's a whole lot of stuff that we
[1:36:34] need to separate from
[1:36:36] but you're not gonna see the full
[1:36:37] blessing of god until you separate
[1:36:40] until you come into full obedience with
[1:36:42] the word of god you will not see the
[1:36:44] full blessings
[1:36:47] abraham come to the spot say okay lot
[1:36:49] look we can't this land ain't big enough
[1:36:51] for me and you
[1:36:52] we keep fighting over everything yo yo
[1:36:54] you know y'all fighting
[1:36:55] over this well and we can't we can't
[1:36:57] keep going through this
[1:36:58] so you want you just make a choice
[1:37:00] you'll be the one to choose which point
[1:37:01] where you want to go lot look down and
[1:37:03] saw sodom and
[1:37:04] gomorrah an established city maybe he
[1:37:07] can see the likes of the city at night
[1:37:08] like yeah i think i want to go there
[1:37:10] because if i stay here in the plains i'm
[1:37:12] gonna have to build my own city
[1:37:13] i don't want to build nothing it's
[1:37:15] already established i'm gonna go down
[1:37:16] there and become somebody great
[1:37:18] and lot did exactly what he set out to
[1:37:20] do the problem is when lot went down
[1:37:23] there
[1:37:23] see he made the wrong decision at the
[1:37:25] junction because when he went down there
[1:37:27] he didn't realize the spirits
[1:37:30] that would overtake his family come on
[1:37:33] somebody
[1:37:35] amen there was some spirits down in
[1:37:37] sodom
[1:37:38] now he saw the lights but didn't see the
[1:37:41] spirits
[1:37:43] and when he got down there and maybe a
[1:37:45] lot thinking everything
[1:37:46] is good maybe he see a little family
[1:37:49] down here and say you know what i want
[1:37:51] my girls to get married i see these
[1:37:52] young boys and i'ma
[1:37:53] push my daughters off on these boys you
[1:37:56] shoulda did a background check
[1:37:58] lot you didn't know who you was pushing
[1:38:02] your girls off on the bible say these
[1:38:05] girls was married
[1:38:06] but they never got to know their
[1:38:08] husbands
[1:38:10] amen he didn't realize in that city the
[1:38:12] hus the men were getting to know the men
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:15] come on church that's the spirit that
[1:38:18] was in that city but now he's so
[1:38:19] established in it
[1:38:21] he can't get out so you got to watch
[1:38:24] what you get yourself
[1:38:25] involved in you got to watch what you
[1:38:28] commit yourself to
[1:38:29] because you can go so far in that you
[1:38:31] don't know how to get out
[1:38:33] [Applause]
[1:38:36] that's true but thank god while a lot
[1:38:37] was down there and all wrapped up
[1:38:39] god had come down to visit abraham this
[1:38:41] was a miracle
[1:38:42] right god come down in the flesh of man
[1:38:46] him and two angels come to sit at
[1:38:47] abraham's tit and and as they're sitting
[1:38:49] there at abraham's tent
[1:38:51] glory revealing some of the secrets to
[1:38:53] abraham i i love that i just love that
[1:38:56] you know i mean just having a
[1:38:57] conversation say abraham now you know
[1:38:59] uh i promised you a son you've been
[1:39:01] waiting a long time
[1:39:02] but at the time of life i'm gonna give
[1:39:04] you that son abraham
[1:39:06] and abra abraham when he saw the three
[1:39:08] visitors he said my lord
[1:39:11] he had the right revelation of who that
[1:39:13] who they who it was that was standing
[1:39:14] before
[1:39:15] my lord the same god that had changed
[1:39:18] his name
[1:39:19] a few weeks ago a few months ago that
[1:39:22] same god come on the scene and called
[1:39:23] him by
[1:39:24] the changed name his name was abram
[1:39:27] before
[1:39:28] but now he's abraham said the only
[1:39:30] person that knows my new name
[1:39:32] is the one that gave me my new name
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:36] hallelujah abraham say this is my lord
[1:39:41] glory to god as he's sitting there and
[1:39:44] fellowshipping with him and and he's
[1:39:46] revealed the secrets
[1:39:48] had his back turn he had his back turned
[1:39:51] to the tent he said that's important
[1:39:53] because that same thing was to manifest
[1:39:55] itself in this day
[1:39:58] as it was in the days of lot
[1:40:01] so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:40:03] summer man so as the angel had his back
[1:40:05] to the tent and could reveal
[1:40:07] what sarah was doing here in our day
[1:40:10] god's prophets
[1:40:11] would come to certain cities and he'd
[1:40:14] have a prayer line
[1:40:15] come on somebody amen and he'd turn us
[1:40:17] back to the audience
[1:40:19] and he would call out things over here
[1:40:20] and things are there with his back turn
[1:40:22] why
[1:40:22] it was the same god manifested himself
[1:40:26] in this time hallelujah
[1:40:29] glory to god not somebody reading some
[1:40:32] little card and trying to
[1:40:33] trying to conjure up something know this
[1:40:35] was almighty god manifesting himself
[1:40:40] here abraham is sitting there listening
[1:40:43] and
[1:40:44] god finally said you know what abraham
[1:40:47] uh there's a reason that i'm here i'm
[1:40:49] here to fellowship with you
[1:40:50] but i also got some other business to
[1:40:52] take care of
[1:40:53] hallelujah he says now uh them two
[1:40:56] angels
[1:40:57] begin to separate from god and abraham
[1:40:59] they begin to walk off towards sodom
[1:41:02] god himself stayed back with abraham
[1:41:04] come on church
[1:41:06] god himself stayed back with abraham and
[1:41:08] uh he told
[1:41:09] abraham uh something here i want to just
[1:41:11] kind of read this
[1:41:12] uh genesis 18. let's read this uh let's
[1:41:15] read verse 15 through 17 genesis 18
[1:41:18] glory glory glory hallelujah
[1:41:22] i love this amen
[1:41:27] some of the miracles that were taking
[1:41:29] place during this junction
[1:41:30] genesis 18 verse 15 through 17 says then
[1:41:33] sarah did not
[1:41:35] saying i laughed not for she was afraid
[1:41:38] and said nay but thou didst laugh
[1:41:42] hallelujah it says and the man rose up
[1:41:45] from thence
[1:41:46] and looked towards sodom and abraham
[1:41:49] went with them to bring them on the way
[1:41:52] and the lord said i love this
[1:41:55] shall i hide from abraham that thing
[1:41:58] which i do so here you know what it what
[1:42:02] what we find here amen is a couple of
[1:42:04] things glory to god
[1:42:05] how do we who was the prophet in abraham
[1:42:09] and lost day abraham was the prophet
[1:42:13] abraham was the prophet and abraham and
[1:42:15] last day because
[1:42:16] prophets always come at the junction now
[1:42:19] we're going to prove
[1:42:20] amen how abraham was the prophet there's
[1:42:22] a couple ways that we know
[1:42:24] one of them is abraham went down to
[1:42:27] abimelech
[1:42:28] before the body changed he went down to
[1:42:31] abimelech and abimelech he told he
[1:42:33] lied oh my goodness this man of god
[1:42:36] lied to the king and said this is my
[1:42:38] sister
[1:42:39] so abimelech took the man's wife and and
[1:42:42] he was just thanking god that he finally
[1:42:44] had this beautiful woman
[1:42:45] that would be able to bear children from
[1:42:47] him and he he was just so grateful to
[1:42:49] god that god had answered his prayer
[1:42:51] but god came to abimelech in a dream and
[1:42:53] said don't you touch that woman
[1:42:56] he said why he said lord the man say
[1:42:58] that was his sister he said no no no no
[1:43:00] that's his wife and you better not touch
[1:43:02] her he says if you do i mean death to
[1:43:04] strike this place
[1:43:05] say don't touch that woman oh
[1:43:09] glory to god i love the way god
[1:43:11] protected sarah
[1:43:13] because he made a promise to her and i
[1:43:15] want to tell you something
[1:43:17] nobody the devil can't touch you either
[1:43:20] because god has made a promise to you
[1:43:24] and they say say he said i thought the
[1:43:26] man said i was just i said
[1:43:28] god said i know what he said but restore
[1:43:29] that man his wife
[1:43:31] and then he said have him pray for you
[1:43:34] because he
[1:43:37] i'm telling you what god said i'm
[1:43:39] telling you what the lord thought of
[1:43:41] abraham
[1:43:42] nah nah abimelech said he's a liar god
[1:43:45] said he's my prophet
[1:43:46] [Applause]
[1:43:48] oh your mistakes cannot change your
[1:43:52] position
[1:43:54] i say your failure cannot change your
[1:43:56] position
[1:43:57] if you are a son and daughter of god you
[1:44:00] will always be a son
[1:44:02] and daughter of god
[1:44:06] glory to his name hallelujah
[1:44:10] i don't care how far you went insane
[1:44:12] that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:44:14] it god or will you erase all of that he
[1:44:17] will put it in the blood
[1:44:18] and when something has been dropped in
[1:44:20] the blood it's like ain't going into the
[1:44:22] bleach
[1:44:24] it is obliterated
[1:44:27] never to be found again that's why we're
[1:44:30] walking in our blessings
[1:44:32] that's why we're not letting the devil
[1:44:33] hold nothing over our heads
[1:44:35] we have brought it underneath the blood
[1:44:37] [Applause]
[1:44:41] say go go restore that man his wife and
[1:44:43] have him pray for you because he's my
[1:44:45] prophet
[1:44:46] god identified abraham as his prophet
[1:44:52] and i always like to say this because
[1:44:53] you know different ones find different
[1:44:55] mistakes mistakes in the message
[1:44:59] that's what you call them mistakes and
[1:45:00] prophets say i'm full of mistakes
[1:45:02] he's a human being he's a man he makes
[1:45:05] mistakes
[1:45:07] i make mistakes you make mistakes we all
[1:45:08] make mistakes
[1:45:10] hey man sometimes i tell the story and i
[1:45:12] don't tell it the same same way every
[1:45:14] time
[1:45:15] i don't even think to tell it the same
[1:45:16] way every time i didn't even know you
[1:45:18] was holding on to it like that i'm just
[1:45:20] it's just a story
[1:45:23] when you said it like this you you put
[1:45:25] the over here
[1:45:26] and you put ando come on give me a break
[1:45:30] right see even in the prophet's ministry
[1:45:33] even if you found a mistake because
[1:45:35] abraham was full of mistakes not just a
[1:45:37] mistake
[1:45:38] intentional lies
[1:45:41] and god still say he's my prophet right
[1:45:45] all right glory to god uh
[1:45:48] the other way that we know that he was
[1:45:50] god's prophet because in this scripture
[1:45:53] genesis 18 17 the lord
[1:45:56] said shall i hide from abraham
[1:46:00] that thing which i do all right the word
[1:46:03] of the lord comes where
[1:46:06] amen amen surely the lord god will do
[1:46:09] nothing he would not destroy sodom
[1:46:13] even though the angels is on their way
[1:46:16] that it could not be destroyed
[1:46:18] until god revealed the secret to his
[1:46:22] servant the prophet
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:46:28] she said the lord god shall i hide from
[1:46:31] abraham
[1:46:32] that thing which i do and then when god
[1:46:35] began to share with abraham what was
[1:46:37] getting ready to happen
[1:46:38] come on church are y'all with me he
[1:46:40] began to share said now you know
[1:46:42] i don't heard some bad stuff about sodom
[1:46:45] and i heard some bad stuff about
[1:46:46] gomorrah
[1:46:47] yeah and and it and i i'm really sorry
[1:46:50] that men have come brought themselves to
[1:46:51] a place like this
[1:46:53] it says you know the the way that they
[1:46:55] live and say i'm i'm sending my
[1:46:56] angels in as investigating angels of
[1:46:59] judgment
[1:47:00] and we're going we're going to have to
[1:47:01] check this thing out to see really how
[1:47:03] bad it is down there
[1:47:04] because we heard about it but but we're
[1:47:06] going to see for ourself
[1:47:08] he's saying he say now uh and if we
[1:47:10] can't find if we find what we're looking
[1:47:12] for that is just as bad as we heard
[1:47:14] we're getting ready to destroy sodom and
[1:47:16] gomorrah
[1:47:17] now abraham knew he was talking to god
[1:47:20] and when abraham realized destruction
[1:47:22] was about to happen
[1:47:24] abraham didn't go back in the house and
[1:47:26] have another meal
[1:47:27] he didn't go for seconds abraham began
[1:47:30] to plead with god
[1:47:31] can i put it this way abraham had his
[1:47:33] own prayer meeting
[1:47:36] god will you spare if it's 50 righteous
[1:47:40] and then he started he started just
[1:47:42] having this conversation with god
[1:47:43] which is fair if it's if it's 50
[1:47:46] righteousness
[1:47:46] the lord said oh yes abraham if i can
[1:47:49] find 50
[1:47:50] i'll spare now god don't get upset with
[1:47:53] me what about
[1:47:54] 40 righteous if it's lacking 10 they
[1:47:57] only got 40.
[1:47:58] if i find 40 then i'll spare god don't
[1:48:01] get upset with me
[1:48:02] what if it's lacking another team and
[1:48:04] they only have 30 if i if you find 30
[1:48:07] would you spend a city
[1:48:08] he said oh yes if i find 30 i'll spend a
[1:48:11] city
[1:48:11] oh lord please don't get upset with me
[1:48:14] what about if you only find 20
[1:48:16] down in the city that's righteous and i
[1:48:19] can imagine
[1:48:20] abraham going in his mind and trying to
[1:48:22] think this one might be righteous
[1:48:24] i got a loved one over here and he might
[1:48:26] be righteous maybe his wife is righteous
[1:48:29] maybe the children are righteous lord i
[1:48:31] don't know i ain't seen it in a long
[1:48:33] time
[1:48:33] but with your spare if you find 20
[1:48:36] righteous he said i'll spare for 5 20.
[1:48:40] things got real quiet abraham said lord
[1:48:50] [Applause]
[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:48:58] god what about 10. we just spat a city
[1:49:02] and he wanted to get a confirmation
[1:49:05] that god would spell 10.
[1:49:10] if i find 10 righteous
[1:49:13] i spare my god that's what that's the
[1:49:16] condition of sodom and gomorrah
[1:49:19] it was so bad that god couldn't even
[1:49:21] find 10
[1:49:26] christians
[1:49:28] and i got news for you i ain't got time
[1:49:30] to read the quote but i'm going to just
[1:49:31] tell you because we used to hear this
[1:49:32] one all the time

[1:52:19] and here's the other thing about it lot
[1:52:21] offered
[1:52:23] his daughters
[1:52:26] that that that's what the bible said go
[1:52:27] ahead and read it genesis 19
[1:52:29] lie off of his daughters right because
[1:52:32] uh
[1:52:32] and the bible say that the daughters
[1:52:34] were married but their marriage was
[1:52:36] never consummated
[1:52:38] now prophet said that lot had sons
[1:52:43] that's what the prophet said and you
[1:52:44] know lot sons did not come out
[1:52:47] my lord his son's never made a lot
[1:52:50] so you might now remember lot made a
[1:52:53] decision one day
[1:52:54] come on he had an opportunity to stay in
[1:52:57] the planes
[1:52:59] but he left the planes and it went down
[1:53:01] to this other area
[1:53:02] and it impacted his family
[1:53:06] i love something that my brother always
[1:53:07] shared there's a preacher walked up to
[1:53:09] him one time he wasn't serving the lord
[1:53:11] and
[1:53:11] preacher just walked up to him and said
[1:53:14] just start shaking his head
[1:53:16] looked at him just shook his head like
[1:53:18] what they say brother i feel sorry for
[1:53:20] you what
[1:53:21] so you're gonna be held responsible for
[1:53:23] your family yeah
[1:53:26] that's all the preachers say no no more
[1:53:28] from just left just
[1:53:29] said that and walked away and that thing
[1:53:32] just stayed with him for
[1:53:33] for years i'm gonna be responsible for
[1:53:36] my family
[1:53:37] yes you're gonna be respond your wife
[1:53:39] ain't gonna be responsible
[1:53:41] but the husband will be responsible for
[1:53:43] what happens to his family
[1:53:45] how can we say that go back to the
[1:53:47] beginning when things went wrong in the
[1:53:49] garden of eden who
[1:53:50] whose name did god call
[1:53:54] now who actually did wrong in the garden
[1:53:57] but whose name did god call
[1:54:00] who's responsible the man is held
[1:54:02] accountable for what happens in his
[1:54:04] family
[1:54:04] i know in this in this hour the roles
[1:54:06] don't reverse
[1:54:09] but god ain't changed he's the same
[1:54:10] yesterday today and forever
[1:54:13] so we as the men will be held
[1:54:15] accountable
[1:54:16] for what happens in our families praise
[1:54:19] the lord
[1:54:21] all right church glory to god

[1:57:09] in abraham's data the secrets of the
[1:57:11] heart were revealed
[1:57:13] when sarah laughed the secret of heart
[1:57:14] was being revealed
[1:57:16] um another miracles got kept abimelech
[1:57:18] from sarah because
[1:57:20] he made a promise to abraham
[1:57:23] another thing that happened was the
[1:57:24] changing of the bodies because their
[1:57:26] bodies had changed
[1:57:27] uh when they went down to abimelech
[1:57:29] abimelech saw a 90 oh
[1:57:30] 90 year old lady and said i wanted her
[1:57:33] to be my wife
[1:57:34] her body had changed abraham's body had
[1:57:36] changed
[1:57:38] that was a miracle that happened during
[1:57:39] that time
[1:57:41] the blinding of the sodomites was
[1:57:44] another miracle
[1:57:45] they couldn't find the door glory god
[1:57:47] and i pray
[1:57:48] that they won't find this door either we
[1:57:52] want to keep fellowshipping i hope
[1:57:53] you're with me
[1:57:55] yeah y'all y'all know that y'all know
[1:57:58] the government gonna change
[1:58:00] know that right and i already know this
[1:58:03] type of preaching is what we call
[1:58:04] hate speech they say that you know you
[1:58:07] got some real strange ways
[1:58:10] do i did i read it out of the bible
[1:58:14] praise the lord it's right here in the
[1:58:16] scripture i ain't got no strange ways i
[1:58:17] just got the same ways
[1:58:19] that god is establishing his word right
[1:58:23] the blind of the sodomites the rescue of
[1:58:25] lot and his daughters
[1:58:27] amen that was you know some of the
[1:58:29] miracles that happened there
[1:58:33] this uh paragraph e27 out of junction of
[1:58:36] time
[1:58:36] we'll read a few quotes and we'll come
[1:58:39] to a close
[1:58:41] the miraculous the supernatural the
[1:58:43] omnipotent doing the miraculous
[1:58:46] look at him as during the time of
[1:58:48] abraham just before the end time look
[1:58:49] what taken place in the world down in
[1:58:51] sodom the big city
[1:58:53] abraham lived in a tent who was the heir
[1:58:55] of all things lived in a tent so don't
[1:58:57] wonder the poet can say a tent or
[1:58:59] cottage
[1:59:00] why should i care you're heir of all
[1:59:03] things if you're in christ
[1:59:05] god has given him the earth and he's the
[1:59:07] king and we're in him
[1:59:08] and an heir of all things the omnipotent
[1:59:12] miraculous and at the junction time
[1:59:14] notice closely now as we move
[1:59:16] on into this watch how god did just
[1:59:18] before the end time
[1:59:20] locked down in sodom perversion was on
[1:59:22] the increase men
[1:59:23] become homosexuals perverted changing
[1:59:26] the natural course of human nature into
[1:59:28] perverted ways
[1:59:29] look at the world today the whole thing
[1:59:31] has become a perverted
[1:59:33] dispensation dispensation the prophet
[1:59:37] speaks the truth here in the message um
[1:59:43] uh have faith in god
[1:59:47] this uh uh the prophet says the american
[1:59:49] people
[1:59:51] sees him even greater than that i'm not
[1:59:53] talking about you born again christians
[1:59:55] says they go around and say well it's
[1:59:56] some kind of hypnotism
[1:59:59] it is perhaps maybe telepathy or
[2:00:02] something
[2:00:03] something's no wonder the guns are
[2:00:04] trained on us for judgment
[2:00:07] we cannot escape judgment i've said this
[2:00:09] and i say it not to be sacrilegious
[2:00:11] or to be different but if god lets this
[2:00:13] nation
[2:00:14] get by with the sin that it's doing
[2:00:18] he'd have to raise up sodom and gomorrah
[2:00:20] and apologize for burning them up
[2:00:22] that's right god has to remain the same
[2:00:24] he loves
[2:00:25] a sinner but he hates sin
[2:00:29] and he's just and he's sovereign and he
[2:00:31] must
[2:00:32] judge sin god will judge
[2:00:35] sin god's provided way this message
[2:00:38] god's provided way
[2:00:41] glory to god amen the prophet goes on
[2:00:45] and says this
[2:00:47] says even now till the science
[2:00:50] is claiming that the earth is bulging
[2:00:52] out in the middle
[2:00:54] you've seen that here the other day and
[2:00:56] heard them talking of it
[2:00:57] the waters in the north has went down so
[2:01:00] many feet in the middle of the earth
[2:01:02] rather than getting deeper in the north
[2:01:03] and in the south because the earth is
[2:01:06] bulging out
[2:01:07] the sun doesn't go around its orbit like
[2:01:09] it used to
[2:01:10] everything is indicating that that uh
[2:01:13] that coming of the lord we're right at
[2:01:14] the door
[2:01:16] and remember before one of those bombs
[2:01:18] can drop i love
[2:01:19] this promise here because as it was in
[2:01:23] the days of
[2:01:24] noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[2:01:25] son of man as it was in the days of lot
[2:01:27] so shall it be in the comments under man
[2:01:29] god made a a way for noah to come
[2:01:32] in to the ark god made
[2:01:36] a way for lot to come out
[2:01:39] of sodom and god is making a way for the
[2:01:42] bride to go
[2:01:43] up in a rapture
[2:01:47] we're right at the door remember before
[2:01:49] one of these bombs one of those bombs
[2:01:51] can drop don't forget this jesus said
[2:01:54] as it was in the days of noah in the
[2:01:56] days of lot so shall it be in the coming
[2:01:57] of the son of man
[2:01:58] and before noah before any rain
[2:02:01] fell down noah was in the ark
[2:02:05] safely before any fire fell on sodom
[2:02:09] lot was outside and before one
[2:02:12] bomb can strike at the church we'll be
[2:02:15] home in glory
[2:02:18] gone in church i'm looking forward to
[2:02:21] that
[2:02:22] amen it won't be long we can count the
[2:02:26] years as months
[2:02:27] count the months as weeks count the
[2:02:29] weeks as days any day now we'll be going
[2:02:32] home he says be sure just think friends
[2:02:35] if it's that close how much closer is
[2:02:37] the coming of the lord
[2:02:38] because the lord comes before that
[2:02:41] happens
[2:02:42] i'm reading another uh quote here out of
[2:02:45] questions and answers
[2:02:46] part one praise the lord
[2:02:50] it says and what was the last sign
[2:02:53] they had before the promised son that
[2:02:55] they had waited on all these years come
[2:02:58] back
[2:02:59] was god standing in the form of a man
[2:03:02] and
[2:03:02] god discerned the thoughts that was in
[2:03:04] sarah's heart
[2:03:06] sarah being the church representing the
[2:03:09] church
[2:03:10] discern the thoughts that's in the
[2:03:12] church that was even behind him
[2:03:14] is that right and immediately after that
[2:03:17] she changed back to a young man
[2:03:19] and him a young man and isaac was
[2:03:22] brought on the scene the promised son
[2:03:24] i believe you're seeing the last sign
[2:03:26] that i happened to the church
[2:03:28] before the rapture god used this prophet
[2:03:32] amen as a last sign uh you know
[2:03:35] back term revealing the secrets you know
[2:03:37] to the people
[2:03:39] god was in his ministry god certainly
[2:03:41] used them but the other thing that we're
[2:03:42] looking for is not just what god did for
[2:03:44] the prophet
[2:03:45] also we're looking for what god's given
[2:03:47] to do for us and it's a changing of our
[2:03:49] bodies
[2:03:50] amen one day gravity not gonna be able
[2:03:52] to hold us down any longer
[2:03:54] amen we shall be changed in the moment
[2:03:57] in the twinkling of an eye
[2:03:58] we shall be changed this last quote
[2:04:00] coming out of the junction of time
[2:04:01] paragraph e
[2:04:02] 31. we look at the conditions of this
[2:04:06] world
[2:04:07] we look at the uh and it's not just you
[2:04:10] know not just our nation but all over

[2:04:29] but they had it was ghana they had a
[2:04:31] sign in the airport

[2:04:42] leave at the airport
[2:04:46] they didn't welcome it right get leave
[2:04:49] right now don't come into this country

[2:09:40] the gospel to a social affair
[2:09:43] the whole world has become perverted
[2:09:48] from the prophet but the same time
[2:09:52] the world has become perverted
[2:09:56] the believers become converted
[2:10:00] [Music]
[2:10:03] in the lord and the power of god by the
[2:10:05] working and appearing of omnipotence
[2:10:08] how that god and his mercy is showing
[2:10:10] forth these things
[2:10:12] we thank god amen for his word we thank
[2:10:15] god
[2:10:16] for his truth uh we realize that we are
[2:10:19] at another junction amen but we are
[2:10:24] prepared to make the right decisions as
[2:10:27] we turn at this
[2:10:28] junction and i trust that god will just
[2:10:30] continue to lead us and guide us
[2:10:31] amen that we would not just see it just
[2:10:34] as another sermon but let's see the
[2:10:35] spirits that's in the land we can see
[2:10:37] what the prophet was telling us it is
[2:10:39] manifesting right before our very eyes
[2:10:41] but as we see all the evil
[2:10:43] and all the devil say all hell has been
[2:10:45] turned loose against us
[2:10:46] we also ought to be under expectation
[2:10:49] that all heaven will also turn loose
[2:10:52] on us let's bound the word of prayer
[2:10:58] god we thank you for your word
[2:11:02] thank you god for your truth
[2:11:06] the bible tells us that as many as heard
[2:11:09] the word they
[2:11:10] hurt god they believed
[2:11:14] to him to them gave he the power to
[2:11:17] become
[2:11:17] sons daughters of god so lord as people
[2:11:21] have heard the word i pray that
[2:11:22] if there's something that causes them to
[2:11:24] want to repent let them repent right
[2:11:25] where they are
[2:11:27] let them get real let them get right
[2:11:29] with you god
[2:11:31] lord we want to be ready in this hour
[2:11:33] there's a dangerous time that we live a
[2:11:36] very dangerous time
[2:11:38] and lord we just want to we want to make
[2:11:40] it not only us but we want to see our
[2:11:41] families make it we
[2:11:42] feel like abraham we're praying per
[2:11:44] adventure god
[2:11:47] lord there be some righteous lord would
[2:11:49] you spare
[2:11:51] and lord we're praying that you would
[2:11:53] spare our loved ones we
[2:11:54] we know the time is shorter than it's
[2:11:57] ever been before we're praying that you
[2:11:58] would spare we pray that you bring them
[2:12:00] in from the fields of sin
[2:12:01] we don't care how far they've gone away
[2:12:03] lord it's not impossible for them to be
[2:12:04] drawn back to you god
[2:12:06] all that the father has given me will
[2:12:10] come so what help us to remain true to
[2:12:13] the word
[2:12:13] and lord and uh are true to you god
[2:12:18] and father no matter what it is that
[2:12:19] we'll have to go through lord we know
[2:12:21] that you'll come through for us
[2:12:22] you'll manifest yourself you'll prove
[2:12:24] yourself to us
[2:12:26] so lord we just want to give you all the
[2:12:27] glory and all the honor and all the
[2:12:28] praise thank you for your word that's
[2:12:29] been spoken to our hearts today
[2:12:32] it's in jesus name we pray amen
[2:12:35] amen praise the lord
[2:12:38] praise the lord amen
[2:12:42] um i want to do something just a little
[2:12:44] different here uh
[2:12:46] today i asked some time ago
[2:12:50] we had a prophecy to go forth here in
[2:12:52] the church
[2:12:53] uh tongues in prophecy and and god told
[2:12:55] us and that to open our mouth wide
[2:12:58] that we that he may feel it uh instead
[2:13:00] open it wider and wider and wider
[2:13:02] what we have been doing just status we
[2:13:05] heard the word of the lord and
[2:13:06] acts you know for those that say anybody
[2:13:08] had any specific things that happened in
[2:13:10] your life
[2:13:11] uh ever since that prophecy went forth i
[2:13:13] wanted to be able to share testimony so
[2:13:14] it's very specific to
[2:13:16] the prophecy not just you know we have
[2:13:19] testimony service sometimes
[2:13:21] we'll have to figure out a time where we
[2:13:22] can do that but i wanted something very
[2:13:24] specific so i had a brother
[2:13:25] that i want to just come and come and
[2:13:27] share a testimony that happened
[2:13:29] after that a man and he's going to share
[2:13:31] and then brother solomon will come and
[2:13:33] close the service
[2:13:34] and uh and we'll go from there but
[2:13:35] brother simba would you come at this
[2:13:37] time and just
[2:13:38] uh share a quick testimony with the
[2:13:40] church praise the lord let's say praise
[2:13:42] the lord as he comes
[2:13:46] amen brother solomon you can take it
[2:13:48] from from here
[2:14:05] god bless you saints so
[2:14:08] as pastor said i was supposed to be
[2:14:11] sharing this testimony
[2:14:13] um a testimony service but he asked me
[2:14:15] to share today so
[2:14:16] i'm gonna do just that um
[2:14:20] so 2020 right uh a year of the covet
[2:14:24] so it you know it began and just like
[2:14:27] any other year
[2:14:28] um there's certain things that you know
[2:14:31] you're you're praying about and trusting
[2:14:33] in god to fulfill
[2:14:36] you know during the course of the year
[2:14:37] right so
[2:14:39] just like any other year we my wife and
[2:14:41] i had things that we
[2:14:42] were trusting in god for things that
[2:14:44] we're bringing before the lord in prayer
[2:14:47] and like i'm sure a lot of us
[2:14:51] we pray for our finances right we pray
[2:14:53] for our financial situation we
[2:14:55] we we welcome the blessings of god when
[2:14:57] it comes to finances
[2:14:59] right and i and i i my wife and i were
[2:15:01] praying about our finances and i i was
[2:15:03] i was saying to god lord i financially
[2:15:07] lord i i i want to be good
[2:15:09] you know i i i just want to be in a good
[2:15:11] place you know i don't just want to be
[2:15:13] okay
[2:15:14] i want to be in a good place and i said
[2:15:17] as i even said to god i i have no ounce
[2:15:20] in me that wishes to be
[2:15:21] filthy rich you can search within my
[2:15:23] heart there's no ounce in me that wishes
[2:15:25] to be filthy rich
[2:15:26] but i just want to be good you know if
[2:15:28] if something comes up i want to be able
[2:15:30] to take care of it
[2:15:31] i don't want to go into debt because i
[2:15:32] need to you know fix my car or i need to
[2:15:34] change the tires or ac
[2:15:36] is out you know i just want to be good
[2:15:37] that's that's what my prayer was
[2:15:40] so um as the year began
[2:15:43] um i remember telling my wife i said
[2:15:46] you know i don't know what it is this
[2:15:49] year but
[2:15:50] i just feel like we're on the verge of
[2:15:53] breakthrough financially
[2:15:54] i said i i don't know what it is just it
[2:15:57] almost feels like it's about to happen
[2:15:59] right it almost feels like it's
[2:16:01] right there something's about to happen
[2:16:02] we're on the brink of a turnaround in
[2:16:04] our finances
[2:16:06] um and i said i just can't put a finger
[2:16:08] on it but and i don't know how it's
[2:16:09] gonna happen but i just feel like we're
[2:16:11] on the verge of breakthrough
[2:16:12] so um having shared that
[2:16:16] and you know looking for something to
[2:16:17] happen well something did happen but it
[2:16:20] was covered
[2:16:21] you know so it's it's you know just like
[2:16:23] for many for many um
[2:16:25] people around the world um we were
[2:16:28] impacted financially because of kovit
[2:16:31] my wife lost her job and we took a big
[2:16:33] hit financially because of that
[2:16:36] so you know i'm started thinking to
[2:16:37] myself i'm like man i uh
[2:16:39] i i you know i feel like we're on the
[2:16:41] verge and now
[2:16:42] this has happened you know this you know
[2:16:44] my wife has lost the job and
[2:16:46] still that feeling was still inside of
[2:16:48] me that man we're
[2:16:50] we're just on the brink of something
[2:16:52] something happening and i was like maybe
[2:16:53] you know maybe
[2:16:54] you know this is just a temporary
[2:16:55] situation in in a month or so we'll be
[2:16:58] back to normal you know
[2:16:59] lockdown and all that in a month like uh
[2:17:01] uh president trump said by easter you
[2:17:03] know everything will be gone and you
[2:17:05] know people be back in the churches and
[2:17:06] all that
[2:17:07] and so i was like yeah yeah you know
[2:17:08] we'll be you know everything will be
[2:17:09] back to normal and you know we'll be
[2:17:11] back on track
[2:17:11] you know trying to look for that
[2:17:13] financial breakthrough
[2:17:15] but month after month nothing changed
[2:17:17] the situation didn't change
[2:17:20] you know things you know things started
[2:17:21] happening and financially
[2:17:23] nothing was changing you know but i
[2:17:25] still felt within me that
[2:17:28] we're we're we're right on the brink
[2:17:30] something's about to happen i and i and
[2:17:31] i couldn't unders i i didn't know how it
[2:17:33] was going to happen but i just felt like
[2:17:34] something was about to happen
[2:17:36] and month after month nothing did happen
[2:17:38] and um
[2:17:40] i don't know how but each month we just
[2:17:42] made it through each month we just made
[2:17:44] it through by god's grace
[2:17:45] and then come november uh beginning of
[2:17:48] november i think
[2:17:49] i think it was on the 8th of november
[2:17:50] when we were in church and the spirit of
[2:17:52] the lord came down
[2:17:54] and sister naomi spoke in tongues sister
[2:17:56] rebecca
[2:17:58] um gave the interpretation of the
[2:18:00] tongues
[2:18:02] now that was you know there was a mighty
[2:18:03] service and
[2:18:05] within the interpretation of those
[2:18:06] tongues
[2:18:08] um there was an instruction that was
[2:18:10] given right
[2:18:11] and the instruction uh was to ask
[2:18:14] whatever we desired right and he said
[2:18:16] open your mouth
[2:18:17] wide and wider and wider now
[2:18:20] when that happened when the when the
[2:18:23] interpretation went forth
[2:18:27] when sister when sister uh rebecca said
[2:18:30] um
[2:18:30] as soon as she said in the beginning of
[2:18:32] it as soon as she said
[2:18:34] uh you don't have to worry for i am here
[2:18:38] as soon as i heard that i just lost it
[2:18:40] right i just lost it
[2:18:42] and i didn't hear the instruction so by
[2:18:44] the time
[2:18:45] the instruction came to open your mouth
[2:18:47] why you know say whatever you desire i
[2:18:48] didn't hear it because i had lost it
[2:18:50] and i was just caught up in the spirit
[2:18:51] and i was you know just crying and
[2:18:53] uh yelling and i didn't hear the
[2:18:55] instruction you know but by god's grace
[2:18:58] that was the the one of the few sundays
[2:19:01] uh in 2020 that my wife was able to come
[2:19:04] to church
[2:19:05] uh and she heard that instruction all
[2:19:08] right
[2:19:08] and as soon as the instructions said you
[2:19:10] know uh say whatever you will
[2:19:11] and you know open your mouth wide she um
[2:19:15] and she was telling me this on the way
[2:19:16] back home she was like yeah when she
[2:19:18] said that i was like oh wait they said
[2:19:19] that
[2:19:20] and they said uh yeah and uh when when
[2:19:22] when um
[2:19:24] that happened you know i i asked the
[2:19:26] lord for two things
[2:19:27] and i was like two you know we're in the
[2:19:30] presence of the lord you ask for
[2:19:32] two things i'm thinking you know
[2:19:35] i i you know there's a lot of things
[2:19:38] that i could have asked for with
[2:19:39] two things but you know it happens you
[2:19:42] know it happens to me sometimes when in
[2:19:44] church and they say you know just say
[2:19:45] what you want right now and i pray for a
[2:19:47] thousand things but at that moment
[2:19:49] i can maybe think of one right so the
[2:19:52] two things that she said were
[2:19:53] um the pregnancy um her
[2:19:56] uh the the pregnancy and the health of
[2:19:58] our baby
[2:19:59] uh and then the other thing was our
[2:20:01] finances and then she said
[2:20:03] you know when that happened i it it i
[2:20:06] felt a peace come
[2:20:08] over me and um she said it to me and she
[2:20:11] described it as it was like a
[2:20:13] sisterheady right moment right where she
[2:20:15] you know she was told to say whatever
[2:20:17] she desired and she'd receive it right
[2:20:18] there and then he said
[2:20:19] as soon as i spoke it right there and
[2:20:21] then i just felt
[2:20:23] that it was over and i felt a peace that
[2:20:26] came over me i was like oh you know
[2:20:27] praise the lord pray
[2:20:28] thank god that you came to church today
[2:20:30] because if you hadn't i would have
[2:20:31] missed that opportunity right
[2:20:33] and so we went home and we were just you
[2:20:35] know just you know happy and just
[2:20:37] we were just in awe of what you know
[2:20:38] what had happened lord came down and
[2:20:40] that was mighty
[2:20:42] mighty service now two days later uh
[2:20:44] tuesday morning
[2:20:46] um i got a call from my from my boss
[2:20:50] and we're talking as normal and then he
[2:20:52] goes
[2:20:54] well simba um uh just wanted to let you
[2:20:57] know
[2:20:58] that effective this friday
[2:21:01] i'm like oh my god it's like effective
[2:21:04] this friday
[2:21:05] we're giving you a 15 raise
[2:21:09] and i'm like man man oh man
[2:21:13] he said effective this friday we're
[2:21:16] giving you a
[2:21:17] 15 and i was i was in shock right
[2:21:20] and the reason i mean this is something
[2:21:22] i've been praying for this is something
[2:21:23] we've been praying for but i was still
[2:21:24] in shock and it happens sometimes you
[2:21:26] know
[2:21:26] you're praying for something you're
[2:21:27] believing you have full faith but when
[2:21:29] it happens you're in shock it's like
[2:21:30] wait
[2:21:30] so prayer does work you know so
[2:21:34] i was in shock and one of the reasons
[2:21:35] why i was in shock was because
[2:21:38] even though i believe that we were on
[2:21:40] the brink of breakthrough
[2:21:41] i did not believe that it was going to
[2:21:44] come through my job
[2:21:45] and the reason why i didn't believe that
[2:21:46] be i i you know i i do certain things on
[2:21:49] the side and i thought maybe that's the
[2:21:50] avenue that god was gonna
[2:21:51] it was gonna use and the reason why i
[2:21:53] didn't believe it would come through my
[2:21:54] job because
[2:21:55] you know the the company just like many
[2:21:57] other companies when kovit hit
[2:21:58] the company's been struggling pretty bad
[2:22:01] and they
[2:22:02] we even do like um monthly updates now
[2:22:05] where they kind of tell us you know
[2:22:06] the financial situation of you know of
[2:22:08] the company and we we
[2:22:10] like many other companies we've been
[2:22:11] struggling throughout the year they even
[2:22:13] you know let some people go because we
[2:22:14] were struggling
[2:22:15] so i did not see the blessing coming
[2:22:18] from a job
[2:22:19] so when it happened i just couldn't
[2:22:20] believe i didn't know what to say
[2:22:22] and like i said i thought maybe god
[2:22:24] would bless it through the other things
[2:22:26] that i do on the side
[2:22:27] and my boss said um we
[2:22:30] we've only chosen five people uh
[2:22:33] out of our team of about a hundred
[2:22:35] people and by god's grace i was one of
[2:22:37] the five that were chosen
[2:22:39] less than 48 hours after uh the prophecy
[2:22:42] went through and and my wife opened her
[2:22:44] mouth
[2:22:44] and spoke and um not only that
[2:22:49] right but a month later um
[2:22:52] the same company for my christmas bonus

[2:22:56] received in the past

[2:23:00] pandemic
