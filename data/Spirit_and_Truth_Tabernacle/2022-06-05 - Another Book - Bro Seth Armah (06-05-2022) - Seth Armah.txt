i've come to meet a wonderful people so sweet and very accommodating i'm so much happy to see every one of you god richly bless you amen [Music] i was telling pastor jack that i really love the spirit coming coming among you we came over here to um on a vacation and i was telling my brother kwaku that this time i just want to hide myself and then have vacation with my wife but kwiku told me you you can't have vacation now when he said it i i was like oh maybe he's joking but when we came to service the first service that we had here i went outside there and then i met brother troy and brother trump said oh you are a pastor we don't make pastors to sit we make them to work and i said hey there's trouble for me [Music] amen and amen it's it has been i mean normal we sometimes take vacation and then i travel outside with my wife but anytime we get outside and then someone give a hint that oh he's a pastor and then they said no you're coming just as others come and share something with us and it has been that oh you go on a vacation but you still don't have a vacation but this time around it has been very very nice and it has a very long because last year around june i came on a retirement and during my retirement message to my organization i worked with the netherlands embassy as a visa officer and i told my ambassador that this time around i'll have enough time to have vacation with my wife so it's been great to be here and to see very nice people [Music] the message from the prophet has been wonderful and you go to certain places even though you believe the same prophet you have i mean a lot of challenges and but i tell you i came here and my spirit is just connecting and i'm feeling so free and i say god richly bless you every one of you god bless you god richly bless you i was um talking to sister michelle and as if we knew ourselves um a very long time i said as if um it's not the first time we were meeting and it's so it's so nice i said god richly bless you continue in that fellowship and with that sweet love the prophet just taught us something he said whatever when you are eating a pie and there's something they not in it and it's not okay just throw that away and then continue eating your part i may not be the same as um pastor jack but i tell you there's something that connects you and me and that is what we have to look for hallelujah god richly bless you god richly bless you i know the lord is going to bless us this morning and touch us with them with a message that the lord has placed on my heart to share with you this morning hallelujah amen and amen pastor jack god richard bless you for you to give your puppy to me to speak to brothers and sisters we we are not knowing ourselves here we have knew ourselves a long time before hallelujah before the foundation of the world were brothers and sisters amen amen i like to ask to tend to our bibles [Music] and i want us to turn to the book of revelation chapter 20. i'm also going to read the book of danielle chapter 7 verse 9 to 10. let's first read the book of revelation chapter 20 verse 11 and 12 11 and 12 and shall we hear the word of god and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their words amen let us also turn to the book of daniel chapter 7 verse 9 and 10. and he says i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as men in fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were open shall we by his precious lord and our father we thank you again for your word we have read some words and script that lord you give to your children and we are praying the lord you break these words of god unto us that will fill the heart of your people we pray the lord may this word to god bring all every blessing that lord we need from them father heal the sick among us father deliver someone or god from it father i pray that lord you'll leave someone or god from grace to grace a lord you'll lift someone from favor to favor strengthen someone here lord as your welcome or god minister unto every challenge that we have ever gone through the lord we will go out of this house out of this room out of this church of father rejoicing and celebrating oh father the lord you have spoken to us we thank you we bless you i pray myself into your hands the lord you all anoint me and you are going to go my lips father take away o god any weakness of god even from me and lord let me oh god speak oh god even the oracles of god and the things that lord of god will benefit your people father i pray the lord jesus it will be like what paul said that when i came among you i did not come with enticing words of man's wisdom but lord with the demonstration and the power of the holy spirit i pray that lord you will minister unto your people in the name of our lord jesus christ the lord when everything is done glory and honor and adoration will be to your name thank you for this we ask in jesus mighty name amen amen shall we be seated and for just a few minutes i would like to speak on a subject of entitled another book another book and i took this subject from the book of revelation where we read that he said the books were open and another book was open hallelujah praise the name of the lord another book was open amen the book of revelation it's a book of symbols i just want you to get that at the back of your mind that the book of revelation is a book of symbols and so is the book of genesis genesis is also filled with symbols shadows and types hallelujah so you see the book of revelation in the book of genesis they go together and these two books the devil hates so much the devil doesn't want to hear the book of revelation he doesn't want to hear the book of genesis why because it reveals the beginning of the enemy the beginning of devil it reveals and tells us about how the devil began hallelujah praise the name of the lord and the book of revelation tells us about how he's going to end hallelujah so these two books are books that the devil fears so much amen and amen it is full of symbols so but abram preach a message and entitle it revelation book of symbols hallelujah amen it's a book of symbols because it is a prophecy hallelujah it is a prophecy and in the message that the prophet preached revelation of jesus christ the prophet said it is an uncovering it is uncovering what was previously hidden hallelujah he said not the uncovering now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of jesus christ but the revelation of his future works in the oncoming church ages hallelujah he said look the importance of the revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized hallelujah that means revelation means a lot to us praise the name of the lord it means a lot to us he said revelation means more to you then perhaps you realize amen now i'm not talking about this book of revelation and you i'm talking about all revelation hallelujah so the revelation is very important and we need to talk about this revelation praise the name of the lord i want you to keep this at the back of your mind that revelation is a book of symbols praise the name of the lord so here we come they said the books were open right it is not a paper book that was open we are not looking at paper book we are not looking at any lithography or any written thing that is not what we are looking at the books were open when we said the books were open is talking about alive that was open a life that was manifested a life that began and that life that began is what the book of revelation tells it as the books were open hallelujah praise the name of the lord the books opening are lives of people it is life a life of somebody hallelujah when the life of somebody uh begins it says that a book has been opened hallelujah it means that a life has been best right it means that someone has been manifested on the surface of the earth hallelujah so we look at the book of genesis they said the book of genesis it is not a paper genesis but it is talking about the lives of people in that dispensation some people lived and their lives were recorded and they put all of those together and call it the book of genesis the same you read about the book of isaiah it is not um a paper but it is the life of isaiah that was recorded hallelujah and then you have the chapters chapter one chapter two there were people that came through the life of isaiah isaiah had a lot of him amen revelations and god revealed himself to him he showed him some vision say as i went to certain places all these things were recorded and we call it the book of isaiah same as jeremiah you can talk you can call all of them the book of daniel the book of jesus the book of maya the book of god there are lives of people that have been manifested on the surface of the earth praise the name of the lord so if we put all these things together the bible call it the old testament the book of the old testament what they want to say is that the life of people who live at a certain time and their lives that were recorded they called it the book of the old testament so is the book of the new testament we heard about people like stephen you heard about people like paul oh priscilla and aquila we heard about all these people they were lives of people who live at those times hallelujah today if we are no more or maybe if we will pass by this way and some people come along or behind us they will begin to read something they will begin to read your life read my life read every one of us our life maybe they'll put it together and then call it the book of jack the book of erica glory the life that you lead is what has been recorded and have been placed there and it's called a book the book is not a paper book like this my brother it's not a paper book my sister hallelujah so paul said in the book of second corinthians and he said that chapter 3 and paul said ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god in not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart hallelujah ye are written epistles every one of you every one of us is a written epistle once we are going through this life our lives are being recorded your life is recorded my life is recorded every one of us our lives are being recorded hallelujah so ye are books i am a book you are a book that books that were open the lives that were bred is what we are going to talk or we are talking about this morning forget about the past forget about this these ones we are talking about ourselves this morning praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen and amen so the book of revelation gave an account and he said that and i saw the dead small and great stand before god hallelujah remember we are not talking about dead people remember we are not talking about the people in the casket or those that are in the cemetery hallelujah the day that we are talking about here like we know revelation is a book of symbols is talking about people who are living they are alive they are not dead people hallelujah praise the name of the lord but i will tell you why the bible called them the dead and he said great and small praise the name of the lord the great does those who have right they're small they have not right praise the name of the lord they're great glory just talk about the politicians just talk about this incinerators talk about the mirrors talk about the presidents talk about the rich talk about those who have and they did not receive christ or accept the message of their day the bible calls them the dead [Applause] they are the dead they are walking they are alive but they are dead so the bible saw them and the bible recorded them as the dead small that are the the the poppers those who are very poor they're homeless yet they did not accept christ they rejected the message of their day they are walking alive but the bible says they are dead [Music] hallelujah anyone that do not accept the message of his day the bible says that you are dead hallelujah amen and amen and this small and great they stand before the throne the white throne judgment amen let's forget about chess all right chess chair chair the truth let's forget about stools the white trump judgment here is not as true that somebody is sitting on it it is not a chair that somebody is sitting on it because this living that i'm this there that i'm talking about they are standing before that white throne judgment for what to be judged this white throne that we are talking about is the true word of god in a believer and you the believer becomes a white truth to those people that are working there and they don't want to receive the message of their day you become that white throne judgment so anytime you pass and they look at you you are judging them they look at you and they could just talk about something oh they knew they know there's something there's something so special about about this sister about that brother yet they don't want to accept that message that you are holding so you become the true word of god you become the white throne judgment that is searching the people hallelujah amen and amen oh and i saw these people they standing for the white throne judgment to be judged praise the name of the lord let me show you these thrones that the book of revelation is talking about i'll send you to the book confirmed daniel what daniel talked about and i saw the thrones hallelujah praise the name of the lord and daniel was talking about the same truth and said and i'll be hell so the truths were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose comment was white as snow and the hair as of his hair like the pure woo and his strong was like fiery flame and a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him and thousands thousands ministered unto him ten thousands and ten thousand stood before him and the judgment was set and the books were open hallelujah what was daniel talking about here daniel was referring us to the book of revelation daniel saw exactly what was happening in the book of revelation how lives were open but look at how daniel put it he said drones were cast down you see daniel was not looking at the white cast as throwing something down but daniel was looking at the porter molding his image cast you know when a reporter or a sculptor wants to do his um emote something they they do the mood and then maybe they cast whatever if it is concrete or whatever they cast it into it and then the cast would take the shape of the mood so that is what daniel was looking at and that was in the presence of god that was something that was coming in who you and i that god molded god from you god for me god from you and i and we are the trolls and when god casts that troll what did he do the ancient of days the almighty god that she came to your family oh the great i am that i am he came and sit in that troll when you were cast when you were formed then god sat in that troll that glory [Applause] which is you and i when we were formed the almighty god sat in you before the foundation of the world he said i knew you when you were even a cloth of blood in your mother's womb i knew you and i foretell you so before we even came here oh hallelujah god is already dead god was already in you before we came to this surface of the earth oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord he murdered you cast and when it cast he god the ancient of days sit sit where in you in me hallelujah and you became the throne before the people and now judging giving your judgment you know sometimes sometimes sometimes we always take judgment as condemnation preach that's what we did we always think that judgment is what always contamination but when you go to the law court and then the judge will come with this verdict or his decision it is not always that the judge is judging he's going to condemn that person sometimes you are acquitted and discharged said oh amen we found out oh you are you don't have any problem i mean you are you are okay you are right and then they set you free sometimes i see that oh you are rather the right person you rather do the correct thing and and then you are set free there are times that a judge will come with his judgment and say that oh no you are wrong and you have to go in there hallelujah so judgment is not always condemning somebody judgment comes and it is coming either to to to to free you or to to to to to arrest you or to continue you hallelujah and here destroys you and i we come here as as as the judges the church sitting right in us we don't always go fighting the people we don't always go casting the people into hell and say oh you because you have done this you are going to hell oh because you are doing that you are going to hell but we come to you with the power and the word of god and then we bring you out from a place into the presence of god oh hallelujah the thrones that were cast down you were a troll that was cast down praise the name of the lord oh hallelujah amen and amen amen and amen until the thrones were cast down i want to show you how these drones how god casted these thrones and it takes us back to the book of genesis in the book of genesis genesis 1 26 27 genesis 1 26 27 and the bible said and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created him male and female created he them and every one of us knows that this man that god created was a spirit man a spirit man he doesn't have flesh like we do here hallelujah and this flesh this spirit man that god created the bible said it has not gained any experience in the flesh before so write in the book of genesis chapter 2 the verse 7 he said and the lord god form man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul hallelujah out of the dust of the earth that was where god now was making the cast god casted man out of the dust of the earth he murdered man and when he murdered the man that man doesn't have any life there was nothing in that man so that ancient of days had to sit in that cast in that mode that he has formed on the underground so the bible said god placed this adam in genesis 1 27 he placed that spirit man into that um a flesh man the earth that has been molded he placed it in him and when he placed it in him that man became a living soul the ancient of days have now sat and when the ages asians of this sat now adam could now have dominion adam could not take control over the animals the bible said and it was adam that gave names to all those animals and things before god created those rivers their fruits their trees everything that god created god has not tasted of them before hallelujah until adam was molded and put in flesh adam could not taste the fruit and i don't go out of the water hallelujah praise the name of the lord that was god sitting in that mood and that was where daniel was picking up that revelation from that god always make a cast and then place it himself right in the cast hallelujah praise the name of the lord oh daniel when daniel was doing this or when daniel saw that revelation oh hallelujah he saw it as a ceremony that god was organizing right there in that dimension was a ceremony so god cast moved placed himself more to place himself both placed himself and he was doing that more than more than more than more placing himself and all these things were standing right in the presence of god and the bible said thousands and thousands ten thousands times ten thousands they stood before him oh hallelujah i was standing there you were also standing there you were also standing there who else who said that he was standing there god bless you god bless you we were all standing right before that presence and you know it was a ceremony that was being organized what was that ceremony it was a ceremony of what opening of books opening of lives and each one of us whilst we were standing there we were all waiting for the appointed time that every any one of us will step forward hallelujah praise the name of the lord if it is not your turn you will not come if it is your turn you step forward praise the name of the lord so we were standing at the ceremony of opening of books and i heard a voice in the book of isaiah hallelujah and isaiah was screaming so high isaiah screamed and i said and i heard a voice who shall we send and who will go for us hallelujah amen and amen isaiah said isaiah 6 8 and he says also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me oh hallelujah so whilst we were all waiting everybody is waiting for the appropriate time appointed time that we will set forth on this earth we were all waiting and then a book would be open he said who shall i send and i heard the voice of moses i must say step forward and moses said here am i send me and god sent moses look at moses when moses came he was natured in the house of pharaoh he was enjoying the goodies of of of of the house of pharaoh he was enjoying everything that a prince will enjoy oh hallelujah moses was living so good moses was living so good he would just look through the windows and then he saw the children of israel how they were being uh tortured and they were being oh more treated he saw them they were so dirty they were so he he didn't see anything in those people hallelujah that was the most his life that had been opened and he was enjoying that life praise the name of the lord hallelujah but as time went on moses went to that same window he opened the window and when you look at those people it was a different different scenario it was a different thing oh hallelujah he saw those people ask the children of god he saw something so special about them he said no i cannot leave here i have to get out of this place because this is not my place i have to be among those people why because he saw something so special with these people oh hallelujah right there another book of moses was open [Applause] [Music] book was open it was a different book altogether it was not the same book as when it was in pharaoh's house even though when he was there he saw those people differently now he's seen them in another way another book was open [Applause] another book that changed moses it changed his perception he changes the way he looked at things he changed his dressing he changes his actions he changed everything about moses even he changed what he was eating he changed everything completely it was another book another book that was in in the presence and was just and just working on moses hallelujah praise the name of the lord oh how people

that is what the prophet was saying in a message when divine love projects when divine love projects and the prophet said then when you become a son or a daughter of god your disposition changes your attitude changes your all your look towards life and towards other others changes it means that it doesn't mean that you just have joined church right it means that you have been regenerated [Music]

creation is a new thing your body's solid spirit has been changed everything is new hallelujah praise the name of the lord when i was i was born and i was living that life it was another nature that i've been controlling but when i met the world hallelujah that ancient of days that was sitting right in me which my mother didn't know about it oh hallelujah when he made the word he responded and shouted and teared up hallelujah and now it took control over everything that was the control tower oh hallelujah so paul said when i want to do am a evil i want to do good this was a time but when he took over the life that i lived is no longer high but jesus christ who lived in me he lives the life oh hallelujah i do not have control over myself again that football nature has no control over me again but now that great still funny god that sits in me oh hallelujah that everlasting god that reigns in my life now take control and then he leads me in that life oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord he said then as you would love to be in the presence of christ and you become part of christ then people love to to become in your presence because you become a part of god son and daughter of god he said did you ever see that people that you just love to be in their presence there's just something about them that just radiates oh hallelujah oh something about brother jack that radiates so when i got close to to brother jack oh it was just radiating oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord there was something that was connecting oh hallelujah but look when the manager came there was no connection because that connection has been broken completely oh hallelujah i'm done i'm i'm long gone away there was no connection anymore when i meet a believer that's a connection because we are connected by the same word oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord amen and amen it is so wonderful my brother when our new book is stand and when a new book is done we become a judgment unto the people in your community in a school that you you are in a workplace wherever you find yourself you become a judgment to the people hallelujah what is judging them is the word of god hallelujah this word of god when you accept that word of god it becomes one with you and one with you it doesn't mean only that you are going to even preach the word or talk to the people but the life that you live as you go and come that life is being watched by somebody that life is being looked by somebody and the person can look at that life and it is a testimony it is a a scripture that you are giving to the person oh hallelujah hallelujah what a time that we are living in my brothers and my sisters the lord has just blessed us with a message when the prophet was on the scene and he preached his messages look at the people that he was sent to and the people were just rejecting the word hallelujah and the prophet was talking about he said now i went to um the spanish people and they are receiving the word the message and they love the word they love the message so much that was the time that brother abram was feeling so rejected rejected that people have rejected the word hallelujah he said but remember god has not forgotten about his people no god still remembers his people hallelujah it's just because of the clock of the gospel the clock of the gospel just look at something the gospel of the lord jesus christ has got a clock it moved right from there from the east anti-clockwise and went to the north when he got to the north we had people like martin luther we heard people like john wesley they were in the north and the clock was yesterday and then just going until it led the north and came to the west where we found brother abraham oh hallelujah with a message of this salvation that was moving and he was just looking up to these people to accept that message but they turned their back to the message hallelujah he said the clock is still tickling the gospel has to return back to the east where it came from and where is it returning to before it returns to the east it has to pass through the south so he's going that way going that way and then we'll come to the south who are the southless law oh hallelujah the southern people the mexicans the colombians the costa ricans the bolivians the philippians the haitians the the africans oh the gospel is seeking and that is where the revival is that is where the revival is oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord but abram said you go back to the message that he preached on the queen of the south he preached that message several times he preached it once as a the queen of shiva and then he preached it as a queen of the south who is that queen that we are talking about she's not an ordinary lady hallelujah the queen was a woman a woman types a church she is not mean church but she was a queen a queen is always married to the king oh hallelujah king jesus christ praise the name of the lord and what did the prophet said he said the queen of the south shall rise with her generation and shall condemn that generation because they refuse to re-accept that gospel they refuse to accept that way that is why you see the revival just blowing the revival is just moving among the sadness is god moving with this message among them because god has never forgotten them hallelujah god hasn't forgotten them praise the name of the lord praise the name of the lord the lord is moving the queen of the son is on the scene you are on the scene that is why you are on fire when you go among them among the the the the people who brought the message actually to they have rejected the word long time ago judge of the law message long time hallelujah back to you the queen of the south to you the queen of the south god has just laid that judgment in your hands what is that judgment is the true word of god the message of your day that you are having today and that is what is judging the people they could look at the things that problem said they look at themselves and they look at the life that you are living and they say oh yeah at least these people they have fire they they are really on a revival hallelujah praise the name of the lord the queen of the south is on the scene you are on the scene because the gospel clock is just tickling and is cutting to the south empire praise the name of the lord hallelujah when your book another book is open i tell you you will not exchange it with any other thing amen the prophet said in the message that coming on and he said how could you turn that

said the organs and everything that will make him reproduce was changed to a young man you may see the body the same but abraham's body has been changed in order to change it's a supernatural change supernaturally it was changed as you are sitting there you are wearing a supernatural body you don't see it but i tell you that is what god has changed it to be a supernatural body oh hallelujah

book was open i don't know when your book was open hallelujah praise the name of the lord but i tell you when that other book is open he said that works that i do you shall do greater more works than this and i tell you the lord has not left us he has been with us all the time praise the name of the lord i remember when my another book was open i have a friend i used to go up and now with him i mean also playing football and things with him and i was trying to give him the the message i told him well there's something better for us to leave and i wish that you could also come and then i mean eat of this food anytime i invite him he will turn the invitation down i continue i was just always on him always on him and you know his house is along where we started the church so whenever i'm going to church i pass by the house call him let us go and then he will say oh i'll next next week i'll come next week i'll come he kept on i mean postponing and postponing but there was a faithful day i marched into the house i said hey my brother today i'm not living here until you live with me if you are not leaving i'm not going i'll go sit here wait for you and then change so that we go together it's okay okay okay today today i'll go with you i said i haven't been taking my birthday go and shower i'll wait for you i have the all the time so i was waiting for him he went had a shower came changed dress said okay i'm done so let us go i said god thank god so we stepped out and then there's a like a gutter in front of their house he stepped i stepped over the gutter and then when he would step over the gutter to the street where we will walk on the lane he said oh i forgot my bible i said oh don't worry about the bible we will we will provide one day he said oh no lord just just wait for me i'm going to take the bible and come i'm going to say okay so i was just waiting in front of the house and then i found that it was a delay so i kept on walking slowly slowly slowly going towards the church and then i'll turn back and look whether he he was coming he was not coming i would take a little few more steps i was going the guy was not coming until i got in front of because from the the house and the church is about 150 to um 200 meters so when i got there i saw you know i heard the voice of the saints singing and how the songs were going i couldn't wait any longer and then i stepped in the church and then i was thinking that he will follow and come i waited and waited this guy did not come we closed church i went to the house and then i sat down eating with my brother and then another friend of us came to the house and then he saw us eating so oh you have met us come and let's eat he said no you know what has happened he said you know your friend your friend is dead i said who are you talking about is that your friend yeah he said he's dead i said how how is he dead i mean i went to the house we were coming together to the church and and he said he's taking the bible and then we will come later and i mean what happened to him he said the story that came after was that when you left and went to the church some other friends also came with a um a truck pickup and then they were going to the beach and then he jumped into the pickup they went to the beach and he got drowned he got drowned right there here was life that was being given to him life was given to him instead of a certain life he rejected the life instead of a setting that another book of him would be open he didn't want that book to be open just drowned that was the end of the brother moses said here lies between you life and death life and death jews and this brother chose death instead of choosing life i don't know what was what was on me that the lord wanted me to hold this and grip this guy and send him to the church just lost praise the name of the lord my brother my sister when god changes their life and then give you a new book a new life it is not for you alone but we got to let somebody also receive their lives the lord is working mightily and tremendously among us and i see everything that the prophet said brother brown said be manifested in our midst oh before i just close let me share this testimony with you hallelujah my sister and pastor the wife is a nurse they had they have two kids then the brother was in the office when he had a call the call was coming from one of our church members who is also a medical doctor and then he called him he said i'm in your house right now if you can come over to the house and he said okay anything he said when he had a call he knew that there's something something wrong so he took his car rushed to the house and then here was the doctor with a report in his hand and then the report he read a report he said your wife has been diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas he said he's a medical doctor so he said this is one of the deadliest cancer that can kill within the shortest possible time wow it was just a blue it was a blue we said okay we're going to seek the face of the lord because i know that the prophet said if you believe not even cancer can stand so i called the brother called me i said brother just stand strong in the faith don't move don't be terrified by what the doctors say just hold on to that faith because we have a legacy a legacy that anyone who believes the lord will not disappoint you and we know that the lord will not disappoint us we are holding on to that holding on to that we were praying days were going days were going the sister just started deteriorating deteriorating she became like a skeleton i don't know how many of you have ever seen florence 90 girl as shown in the message that's a prophet visit south africa you look at for a 90 girl and that was the sister the picture of the sister day by day as we are praying she was just deteriorating hopes were gone breeding sisters and you know you find people just crying weeping within themselves i mean it's not yet over but people i mean started giving out the the medical doctor said pastor at a point i don't know what to believe anymore because here is my science what i learned this is what it tells me and here is faith and it says that above all this that you have learned just put it as a trash and believe that god is going to heal it amen wow pastor how am i going to match this too am i going to i mean refuse what i've learned i've studied am i going to say that what science is saying is not true or what he said as we were praying then a message came that sister linda will not die she will leave i said god i hold on to this promise i'm never going to leave you until you have made this a fulfillment they have to go to the hospital for surgery looking at chances whether they can do some surgery and then maybe take the growth and things out when they got there they the best surgeons that we have at the calibre hospital she examined her they even cut hair and then when they cut it she realized that the cancer has spread through the lungs and everything and there's no way that he can do it so they have to patch it up again and then liver said he told the brother your wife cannot live beyond six months he's going to die they call it they said it's terminal illness i mean they threw their out and nothing can be done but i tell you at the last point where you have disappointment trust in your god believe in your god don't let that shake you hallelujah before you have a victory there will come disappointment the disappointment becomes like a stepping board you step on that disappointment and you limp to victory when the brother the husband personally came out he met a group of these surgeons doctors that were discussing about the wife fortunately there was one of the doctors who was also a schoolmate and was having a schoolmate to um at the university they attended and he was among the group that i mean saw the sister and then he called the brother and said brother well these were things are free and we know that the prophet said and he's also a message believer he said where things have reached we know that at the last day we are going to meet your sis our sister so just um let's give it up and then we we just wait for the last days when we will meet together and the brother said no way my wife is not going to die sister linda is going to leave just before he returned then here was another doctor that our brother dr cote introduced him to pasanat and then he called himself brother come don't listen to that brother let me tell you we had a similar casey we had someone with a breast cancer we ruled her out we thought that i mean that was all we ruled her out the sister is alive today i will give you the telephone number you call the sister and then be sure what i'm telling you so the brother called the sister and the sister testify and i said oh yeah god did a wonderful thing and i'm alive it's about two years now and i'm still alive and i don't feel anything anymore god has healed me hallelujah so but when i said this encouraged me the more and i said yes lord there's a contract the contract is that he said i believe and then you do it so now i'm doing my part and then i want to see you do your part we went to um brother to church we fasted we prayed and laid hands on her and then we said lord the rest is for you we have done our part the rest is for you months passed the sister was alive seven months eight months she was gaining weight something was changing in her one year she was still because she was a nurse they she has to stay home and we thought that well that was the end of her career one year one and a half years just one one year later she started feeling some symptoms and then they have to rush to the hospital again and when they got there the same daughter who said there's no way we don't you don't have any chance that same doctor asked are you a christian which god are you serving what
