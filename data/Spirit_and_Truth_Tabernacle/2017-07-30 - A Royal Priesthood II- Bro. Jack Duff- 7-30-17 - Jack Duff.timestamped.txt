[1:01:55] prayer over them today so please just
[1:01:59] keep that in mind out those that might
[1:02:01] need to leave will make sure that we we
[1:02:04] dismiss you but for those the parents
[1:02:06] with the kids everything we want to pray
[1:02:08] for them today there's a couple of
[1:02:10] things that's going to be happening over
[1:02:11] the next few weeks where they're going
[1:02:13] to have a lot of people out in one one
[1:02:16] two weeks from now I'll be out in Tucson
[1:02:18] Arizona so I want to do that today a man
[1:02:22] since we can the other thing that I want
[1:02:25] to do today is we have a dedication a
[1:02:28] man for two of our little ones a man
[1:02:33] brother Andrew and sister Candice has
[1:02:37] been blessed a man with two wonderful
[1:02:41] sons and we want to dedicate them to the
[1:02:44] Lord and I want to just read a scripture
[1:02:48] if you all would just get bring them in
[1:02:50] from the field of sin I want to read
[1:02:53] here from mark chapter 10 a man as we
[1:02:58] would just get prepared for the
[1:03:00] dedication anytime we are doing a
[1:03:05] dedication amen I'm always reminded of
[1:03:08] the story in the scripture with Samuels
[1:03:14] mother a man how she went back to the
[1:03:18] temple of God and she she told God that
[1:03:20] if he blessed her you know with the
[1:03:22] child and she would give that child back
[1:03:24] to the Lord and you know and he was
[1:03:27] raised up there in the house of God and
[1:03:29] and God even called him to be a prophet
[1:03:32] so you know we always think of those
[1:03:33] things and and here we don't believe in
[1:03:36] infant baptism things that nature but we
[1:03:40] do believe in dedicating the children
[1:03:41] back to the Lord as God has given them
[1:03:43] to us right here mark chapter 10 verse
[1:03:46] 13 says they brought young children to
[1:03:48] him
[1:03:49] that he should touch them and his
[1:03:51] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:03:53] them but when Jesus saw it he was much
[1:03:56] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[1:04:00] little children to come unto me and
[1:04:02] forbid them not for such is the kingdom
[1:04:06] of God and he said verily I say unto you
[1:04:09] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:04:11] of God as a little child he shall not
[1:04:15] enter therein and he took them up in his
[1:04:19] arms put his hands upon them and blessed
[1:04:23] them amen so we want to do it the way
[1:04:27] the scripture did it amen as they
[1:04:29] brought the kids to Jesus He blessed him
[1:04:31] and this morning we want to bless Ayden
[1:04:34] amen and Jackson and we want to just
[1:04:37] pray over them and dedicate them back to
[1:04:39] the Lord as I just think about Andrew
[1:04:43] and Candace and my god I just remember
[1:04:47] them being you know I mean Candace for
[1:04:50] sure being dedicated right I was I was
[1:04:53] there you know and just seeing how the
[1:04:55] Lord has blessed them the devil
[1:04:58] certainly attacked her body and the
[1:05:00] midst of the pregnancy but God brought
[1:05:02] it through and anytime I see the devil
[1:05:05] attack like that I believe God got
[1:05:07] something special for that child right
[1:05:09] it got something special for the child
[1:05:10] for the parents and you know so it's an
[1:05:12] honor for me just to be able to do this

[1:13:18] thank the Lord for the Saints here in
[1:13:30] 1st Peter 2 best verse ones we continue
[1:13:34] our journey through a man the scripture
[1:13:37] says wherefore laying aside all malice
[1:13:39] and all guile and hypocrisies and envies
[1:13:44] and all evil speakings as newborn babes
[1:13:49] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:13:51] ye may grow thereby if so be ye have
[1:13:56] tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom
[1:14:00] coming as into a living stone disallowed
[1:14:03] indeed of men but chosen of God and
[1:14:06] precious ye also as lively stones are
[1:14:12] built up a spiritual house a holy
[1:14:17] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:14:20] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:14:24] Christ wherefore also it is contained in
[1:14:29] the scripture behold I lay in Zion a
[1:14:32] chief Cornerstone elect precious and he
[1:14:35] that believeth on him shall not be
[1:14:38] confounded unto you therefore which
[1:14:42] believe he is precious but unto them
[1:14:46] which be disobedient the stone which the
[1:14:49] builders disallowed the same is made the
[1:14:52] head
[1:14:53] the corner stone of stumbling and a rock
[1:14:56] of offense even to them which stumble at
[1:14:59] the word being disobedient weren't also
[1:15:02] they were appointed but ye are a chosen
[1:15:07] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:15:12] nation a peculiar people that ye should
[1:15:18] show forth the praises of him who hath
[1:15:20] called you out of darkness into his
[1:15:25] marvelous light which in time past were
[1:15:28] not a people but are now the people of
[1:15:33] God which had not obtained mercy but now
[1:15:36] have obtained mercy the Lord of the
[1:15:40] blessing to the reading of his word
[1:15:41] let's pray amen over the scriptures that
[1:15:43] we've read father we are grateful for
[1:15:45] the privilege to read but father we know
[1:15:50] it takes the Holy Ghost to make it clear
[1:15:53] as to what we have ran so we trust God
[1:15:56] that the Spirit of God would come now
[1:15:58] and take control over this portion of
[1:16:01] the service as you have already blessed
[1:16:04] in the prior part of the service we
[1:16:07] thank you for the specials we thank you
[1:16:09] for the worship we thank you for
[1:16:11] everything that has happened in this
[1:16:13] place and and now God made you minister
[1:16:15] to our hearts today through your word in
[1:16:18] Jesus name we pray amen and amen god
[1:16:21] bless you you can be seated
[1:16:23] we will continue our journey a man with
[1:16:27] the topic of a royal priesthood a man
[1:16:32] and I know this morning that I am
[1:16:34] standing in the midst of royalty a man
[1:16:38] it's a whole bunch of kings no Queens
[1:16:42] Kings right kings I'm standing the midst
[1:16:47] of kings and you know as I thought about
[1:16:49] that a little bit more you know
[1:16:51] sometimes what sisters like well how do
[1:16:52] I take that title you know as a king you
[1:16:55] know I'm a queen I cannot you know I can
[1:16:58] I take the title King was the same thing
[1:17:00] those brothers taking on the title Bride
[1:17:02] of Christ
[1:17:04] all right a man we take on the title
[1:17:07] bride and that's a feminine turn but yet
[1:17:11] we still call ourselves bride right so
[1:17:13] that's this is you call yourself King
[1:17:16] praise the Lord Amen because he hath
[1:17:19] made you kings and he's made you priests
[1:17:21] Oh glory now we want to make sure we
[1:17:24] line it up just right because we're not
[1:17:26] saying that giving right for the sisters
[1:17:28] to preach the gospel a man but it's a
[1:17:31] place it's a it's a position that we are
[1:17:34] laying claim to and and it's something
[1:17:37] that the scripture has told us that we
[1:17:39] we have been given this I want to read a
[1:17:42] man from this sermon the Messiah
[1:17:45] and let's just start here and you know
[1:17:48] and we'll work our way through this
[1:17:50] start on today amen the by the Prophet
[1:17:53] says that he says then when God was made
[1:17:56] flesh and the king the Messiah then if
[1:18:02] we can yield ourselves to be the
[1:18:04] anointed like he was we become messiahs
[1:18:09] little lights that's what the church is
[1:18:13] supposed to be lights little anointed
[1:18:18] ones
[1:18:18] that's God's church his standing light
[1:18:23] is the light of the Messiah risen Christ
[1:18:26] in his people
[1:18:28] the anointed ones carrying forth his
[1:18:31] light into all the church ages now if
[1:18:33] you all remember last week I was how
[1:18:35] about how Jeremiah was the light for his
[1:18:39] day and Isaiah was the light for his day
[1:18:41] well we the light for our day right amen
[1:18:44] we can't look at everybody else that
[1:18:46] song going by we just build upon the
[1:18:49] foundation that they laid amen we not
[1:18:52] changing the foundation we build upon it
[1:18:54] and we just keep walking it and we
[1:18:55] become the light for our day listen it
[1:18:58] says is standing light is the light of
[1:19:00] Messiah risen Christ and its people the
[1:19:03] anointed was carrying forth its light
[1:19:05] into all the church ages sometimes it
[1:19:07] almost goes completely out then it comes
[1:19:11] back again God's anointed one God let
[1:19:14] the Messiah church if Messiah means
[1:19:17] Anointed One and means king then if the
[1:19:23] Church of the Lord by the Messiah spirit
[1:19:25] it becomes a lesser but still a Messiah
[1:19:31] when he some titles for the church now
[1:19:34] you the bride your king your priest your
[1:19:39] Messiah a man I see man to it because
[1:19:46] the prophet said it it man you little
[1:19:49] lights with this thing your lesser
[1:19:51] he our huh alright okay well just
[1:19:56] tell me who you are
[1:19:58] maybe you didn't know that hey man but
[1:20:01] it's time for us to recognize who we are
[1:20:04] Messiah the world is looking for Messiah
[1:20:07] when they see you they have seen Messiah
[1:20:13] all right a man become a lesser but
[1:20:18] still a messiah because it has his light
[1:20:22] reflecting his power reflecting his
[1:20:24] glory reflecting his Dominion so it is
[1:20:29] Messiah oh how it reflects him in his
[1:20:31] kingdom in his domain the trouble today
[1:20:33] we've organized the church to death and
[1:20:36] we got organization instead of Messiah
[1:20:38] like we got wrestle light
[1:20:40] Proctor light and all other kinds of
[1:20:43] light but we need my fire light what the
[1:20:48] church needs today is a lot of the
[1:20:50] Messiah oh I love him for his goodness
[1:20:52] and he goes on now that is true God
[1:20:55] called messiahs God called us and we
[1:20:57] become kings and priests unto God like
[1:21:02] Jesus was God's High Priest
[1:21:04] we become a lesser priest Jesus was God
[1:21:07] in the fullness and God included
[1:21:09] swirling him to shine forth the
[1:21:10] expression of God to the world but God
[1:21:12] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:21:14] himself and have God was in Christ
[1:21:17] reconciling the world to himself God
[1:21:20] comes into his church and anoint him
[1:21:26] some Messiah
[1:21:29] amen not all the church agon get it but
[1:21:32] I believe I'm a part of the group that
[1:21:35] God is going to come in to and anoint
[1:21:37] him supplements at Amen I don't even
[1:21:42] know if that word is in the dictionary
[1:21:43] but it's in the message and I understand
[1:21:48] exactly what he's saying right oh my do
[1:21:50] you see it the same thing he did in his
[1:21:53] church the same power he had is in his
[1:21:57] church and his church becomes his
[1:21:59] Dominion and he's king over this
[1:22:02] Dominion and we are kings and priests my
[1:22:08] question is is winner we kings and
[1:22:09] priests you got the answer you already
[1:22:13] you know we read it last week right now
[1:22:15] we're kings and brief we're not waiting
[1:22:18] on the Millennium now we are kings and
[1:22:21] priests
[1:22:21] all right glory to God we are Kings the
[1:22:24] priests offering spiritual sacrifices of
[1:22:27] God the fruits of our lips giving praise
[1:22:30] to his name amen
[1:22:31] oh my there you are Messiah Matthias
[1:22:35] little Matthias a little Anointed One
[1:22:39] I'm not an upper what the main one
[1:22:42] anointed off of the great one all right
[1:22:47] I'm going on I want to go a little
[1:22:48] further in this I said you see what
[1:22:51] messiahs Messiah is the kingdom of God
[1:22:54] anointed ones Oh glory am i I'm down a
[1:23:00] paragraph 29 I'm sorry I skipped on that
[1:23:04] e 20 9 says that you see what Messiah is
[1:23:07] Messiah the kingdom of God anointed ones
[1:23:09] them an orchard with the Saints fear he
[1:23:11] was anointed with one said to him when
[1:23:13] they will will my son said it the right
[1:23:15] and the left hand he said can you drink
[1:23:18] the cup that I drink can you be baptized
[1:23:20] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[1:23:22] she said yeah and he said you will but
[1:23:25] the kingdom that's it right left is not
[1:23:27] mine to give so it showed that we could
[1:23:29] drink the same cup of persecution be
[1:23:32] called Beelzebub or whatever it might be
[1:23:34] and still be baptized with the same
[1:23:37] spirit he's baptized with so if he if he
[1:23:39] was calling Masai
[1:23:41] which he was because he was anointed
[1:23:43] with the holy spirit and any church
[1:23:46] that's anointed with the same holy
[1:23:48] spirit is a messiah a little smaller God
[1:23:53] I like that you know brother branham
[1:23:57] share and one place you say now you know
[1:24:00] you could go in amen and get into the
[1:24:03] ocean and you got all this water you
[1:24:05] know in the ocean but then you just take
[1:24:08] maybe just a bottle full of the ocean
[1:24:11] amen and you be put in a bottle you
[1:24:12] still up you still got the ocean in the
[1:24:14] bottom if you just got a spoonful amen
[1:24:18] of the ocean in your spoon you still got
[1:24:20] the ocean even if it's just a spoonful
[1:24:24] in still the entire it's the ocean all
[1:24:26] the contents of the ocean are in that
[1:24:29] spoonful if you just got a little bit of
[1:24:31] God that makes all of God inside of you
[1:24:36] if you got a little bit of God all right
[1:24:40] church amen listen so someday when this
[1:24:43] body is resurrected I hope before hand
[1:24:46] that God can get a look at this that's
[1:24:49] why I have to read these things if they
[1:24:50] I hope beforehand that God can get a
[1:24:54] hold of a bunch of people God does want
[1:24:58] to get a hold of just a few people you
[1:25:00] know even even the Marines want a few
[1:25:03] good men God just want to butcher people
[1:25:08] and I'm determined to be in that bunch
[1:25:12] of people if I can just get a gossip you
[1:25:16] can just get a hold of a culture people
[1:25:18] that'll manifest his power in every
[1:25:21] dimension that is supposed to be in
[1:25:24] Messiah Anointed One a king to deliver a
[1:25:28] king your kings and priests teams to
[1:25:32] bring in priests to minister to a
[1:25:34] messiah
[1:25:35] his science was to follow in all ages
[1:25:37] reflected his light his practice with
[1:25:39] his kingdom people let me just go a
[1:25:42] little further then now don't you you
[1:25:45] don't have to die to get this to become
[1:25:49] a king in pre she ain't got to die
[1:25:51] remember last week I saw you now but
[1:25:53] sometimes the court
[1:25:54] that that son is born to his father that
[1:25:57] said makes that son first one son he was
[1:25:59] usually on particularly the kingship but
[1:26:01] you know often times you know the boy
[1:26:03] have to wait for the daddy to die before
[1:26:04] he become king right but you know there
[1:26:07] there are some situations where the
[1:26:09] daddy did not die and the boy became
[1:26:13] king I'm going to try to read one to you
[1:26:15] a little later on in the sermon there
[1:26:17] was one a man that out of something
[1:26:19] happen to the daddy so he couldn't be
[1:26:21] king no more but they're known at the
[1:26:22] blow him he took his place a man
[1:26:25] see our God can't die he is king of
[1:26:29] kings he can't die so we can't wait for
[1:26:32] him to die to become king he can't die
[1:26:38] right but he can still give you the
[1:26:41] authority and the power to be a king he
[1:26:43] can anoint you and place you at King and
[1:26:49] he's still alive
[1:26:51] whoo all right let's go on let's go on
[1:26:54] you don't have to die to get this you
[1:26:58] have to spiritually die but you don't
[1:27:00] have to physically die the inside is
[1:27:03] where God gets in and to control you and
[1:27:08] he and he presses his self forward and
[1:27:11] you don't let any root of bitterness
[1:27:14] hatred malice strife that will run him
[1:27:20] right back again see that now if you go
[1:27:23] back to the 1st Peter 2 and see where it
[1:27:25] says laying aside all malice and all
[1:27:28] guile hypocrisy and envies and all evil
[1:27:30] speaking that's not you praying and
[1:27:32] asking God to take that from you that's
[1:27:34] actually you deciding I'm a little side
[1:27:39] are we going to get somewhere today I
[1:27:42] you know if you actually make it that
[1:27:46] shorts yourself if this one don't want
[1:27:52] to do it I'm still gonna do it oh god
[1:27:55] I'm trying to save something I'm trying
[1:27:58] to say something here but but I'm just
[1:28:00] running it you see that the spirit is
[1:28:02] not just written just to be written but
[1:28:05] God is calling us to something
[1:28:08] right here here here listen this what
[1:28:10] Robert said you say he say he is
[1:28:11] president he presses himself farting you
[1:28:14] don't let any root of bitterness hatred
[1:28:17] malice strife that will run him right
[1:28:19] back again just get all the meanness and
[1:28:24] the superstitions and the unbelief out
[1:28:29] of you and every time you move out a
[1:28:32] little unbelief God steps right in and
[1:28:35] takes over just move out down belief all
[1:28:39] right I'm done with that quote I just
[1:28:41] you know I'm I'm dropping this in
[1:28:43] because the church we once we realize
[1:28:45] who we are it you know the brought the
[1:28:49] prophecy the rapture gun going when the
[1:28:51] bride recognizes who she is you say the
[1:28:53] rapture will actually go oh my god y'all
[1:28:57] got time for just let me read one more I
[1:28:59] got this one last week from brother
[1:29:01] Solomon I want to read it to you and I'm
[1:29:02] we gonna get into something I promise I
[1:29:04] promise just then just coasting that
[1:29:07] always enjoy the ride enjoy the ride
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:12] it's coming out of belief in style did
[1:29:15] you know that there's a sermon in the
[1:29:18] title believe it's down this there's
[1:29:28] always a message in the message right
[1:29:30] but but this listen at some of the
[1:29:32] things that the Prophet tells us you
[1:29:34] know watch this watch this
[1:29:36] it says here 300 years ago in French
[1:29:38] science has proved that if you go the
[1:29:41] terrific speed of 35 miles an hour
[1:29:43] gravitation would take you off the earth
[1:29:44] you think science will refer back to
[1:29:47] that today but they're going 1,900 miles
[1:29:51] an hour's still going on they're
[1:29:52] pressing forward looking forward but we
[1:29:55] want to look back and see what moody
[1:29:56] saying thank you said Finlayson Knox
[1:30:00] Calvin some of those what they said was
[1:30:02] all right that was for their age but
[1:30:04] we're going on my grandfather wrote an
[1:30:07] oxcart I'm driving a Ford a v8 my son
[1:30:12] will fly a jet plane that's what that's
[1:30:16] how we're moving on that's what religion
[1:30:18] ought to be the coming of the Lord is at
[1:30:20] hand
[1:30:21] the church ought to be moving on
[1:30:22] interest into into the powers science
[1:30:27] can only climb so far then it has to
[1:30:29] drop off but we got may not tell our
[1:30:33] science science can only go so far they
[1:30:36] gonna have to drop off so we're gonna be
[1:30:38] on science
[1:30:39] we got untapped sources then a negative
[1:30:45] never that's never been touched that is
[1:30:51] a powerful statement these are things
[1:30:54] that you ain't never seen before you
[1:30:55] ain't even read it before but we got
[1:30:58] untapped sources that's never been
[1:31:01] touched and I believe every trail that
[1:31:04] we're facing God is preparing his people
[1:31:07] through the trial to tap into several
[1:31:09] sources you know Abraham had never seen
[1:31:17] what he saw before in his day he'd never
[1:31:21] seen anything like that he'd never seen
[1:31:24] he never seen a man somebody have they
[1:31:26] body changed like that he was the first
[1:31:28] one to do something like that
[1:31:30] that's Genesis and if it was that way in
[1:31:37] Genesis a first time for something it
[1:31:39] might be their way at the years hop our
[1:31:41] first time for something the Prophet
[1:31:47] says is he says we got untapped sources
[1:31:49] that's never been touched
[1:31:53] all right of the power unlimited no no
[1:31:59] but y'all now you know people like
[1:32:01] unlimited stuff they love it you know
[1:32:04] can we just talk just a little bit I got
[1:32:06] it I got to break things down I got to

[1:34:46] stuff
[1:34:47] a man church glory to God amen alright
[1:34:51] listen he said I feel ashamed of myself
[1:34:54] when I look out here and see the
[1:34:55] institutions and the sickness in trouble
[1:34:58] that's going on right now our church
[1:35:01] that's what the prophecy our church
[1:35:04] ought to be walking the street healing
[1:35:06] the sick what not not the Prophet the
[1:35:10] church our church ought to be walking
[1:35:13] the street healing the sick raising the
[1:35:16] dead casting out Devils doing signs and
[1:35:19] wonders making the whole world realize
[1:35:21] that Jesus Christ lives that's what we
[1:35:23] need to be doing that's what we need to
[1:35:26] be done are doing now you know the
[1:35:29] Prophet had shared a situation one time
[1:35:31] where he was on he was away he was out
[1:35:35] of out of town and somebody in the
[1:35:39] church had had died while the Prophet
[1:35:43] was away from his church somebody died
[1:35:45] and when they died they called the the
[1:35:50] Undertaker in they come in and bomb the
[1:35:52] body and a few of the brothers in the
[1:35:55] church had heard about this person dying
[1:35:57] and brothers kind of got together like
[1:35:59] wait a minute they died then what is
[1:36:00] this it just felt something I write
[1:36:03] about that
[1:36:04] so the embalm body the brothers of the
[1:36:09] church went down to the Undertaker said
[1:36:12] could we just see the body and they got
[1:36:15] there to see the body and then brothers
[1:36:17] pray for the body embalmed that person
[1:36:22] came back to life the prophet went there
[1:36:26] but the brothers in his church did it
[1:36:27] and when he came back he says they say
[1:36:30] they was taught right they was taught
[1:36:35] right that's why they knew what to do
[1:36:37] they were taught right they did not even
[1:36:40] care about embalming Jesus did that he
[1:36:45] went to the grave of Lazarus nas was
[1:36:47] already embalm four days in the grave
[1:36:50] and when Jesus brought Lazarus come
[1:36:53] forth I don't know what the parts
[1:36:55] worth while Lazarus came for the same
[1:37:00] power that was in Jesus is enough all
[1:37:07] right okay let me just uh here we go
[1:37:12] let's let's just jump into something
[1:37:15] here glory to God he has made us priests
[1:37:19] kings and priests now I want to go to
[1:37:23] this sermon the seven church ages
[1:37:24] paragraph 53 and I will slip into
[1:37:29] something here all right now the seven
[1:37:34] spirits that are before God these seven
[1:37:36] spirits was represented as the seven
[1:37:38] spirits that would be sent forth for the
[1:37:39] seven churches seven spirits before God
[1:37:42] we could pick up from the Old Testament
[1:37:45] and pick it out there if we just had
[1:37:47] time and from Jesus Christ was the
[1:37:50] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:37:51] of the Dead and the Prince of the kings
[1:37:53] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:37:57] washed us my just look at John get all
[1:38:00] wound up there when he looked he just
[1:38:03] goes to speak and he said he had an half
[1:38:07] and to him that loved us and washed us
[1:38:10] from our sins in his own blood
[1:38:12] and hath made us kings and priests unto
[1:38:15] God his father to him be glory Dominion
[1:38:19] for ever and ever amen and he has made
[1:38:22] us priests and kings under God us it's
[1:38:25] plural not made me priest and a king but
[1:38:32] made us the church now he's addressing
[1:38:37] these seven churches for it is it's
[1:38:39] seven Church ages now he said Dominion
[1:38:42] and glory and be to him for ever and
[1:38:44] ever
[1:38:45] he has made us priests did you ever know
[1:38:48] what a priest is what his office is a
[1:38:51] priest is to make sacrifice to make
[1:38:55] intercession and over in Hebrews that
[1:38:58] said that we the church is the royal
[1:39:01] priesthood of rooibos of the holy nation
[1:39:02] now that we read that out of first Peter
[1:39:04] right that's back to my statement for
[1:39:07] last week is in you know what I'm saying
[1:39:09] it says a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:39:11] a peculiar people see our holy nation a
[1:39:13] peculiar people royal priesthood
[1:39:15] offering here it is now offering
[1:39:17] spiritual sacrifices every man and woman
[1:39:19] that comes to God enters into the veil
[1:39:25] now there is so many different
[1:39:27] directions on this thought that I could
[1:39:30] go just right there from that statement
[1:39:32] but I'm trying to keep my keep us in a
[1:39:36] certain channel today as far as you know
[1:39:38] going you know when you talk about God
[1:39:40] and every man and woman that comes to
[1:39:42] God can go and come to God enters into
[1:39:46] the veil I want to just kind of focus on
[1:39:48] this part of the priest their
[1:39:50] responsibility was to make intercession
[1:39:53] right their responsibility was to make
[1:39:56] intercession now Jesus would be a
[1:39:59] primary example of of a priest because
[1:40:02] Jesus interceded on our behalf right we
[1:40:06] were guilty
[1:40:07] we should have died for our sins but
[1:40:10] Isaiah 53 and 12 says therefore will I
[1:40:12] divide him a portion with the Great and
[1:40:14] he shall divide the spoil with the
[1:40:17] strong because he had poured out his
[1:40:19] soul unto death and he was numbered with
[1:40:22] the transgressors and he bare the sin of
[1:40:25] many and made intercession for the
[1:40:28] transgressors that's me and you Jesus
[1:40:31] made intercession for us I believe Jesus
[1:40:34] was also interceding a man for the Jews
[1:40:38] when they they they they said crucify
[1:40:40] him they yelled out crucify me but you
[1:40:42] know what what has he done he's done
[1:40:43] nothing wrong
[1:40:44] we don't care crucify him anyway when it
[1:40:47] when he got on the cross he said a
[1:40:48] prayer to the public Father forgive them
[1:40:50] they know not what they do
[1:40:54] hallelujah as a priest we're called to
[1:40:57] intercede on behalf of others alright
[1:41:00] just stay with me here
[1:41:01] Judah interceded on behalf of Benjamin
[1:41:05] when it was time
[1:41:06] amen when Joseph had uncovered you know
[1:41:10] everything and he finally got Benjamin
[1:41:12] in his presence he sent the brothers up
[1:41:14] and put that cup inside of a business
[1:41:17] bag and when he got the when he got the
[1:41:18] city service Dennis another one or two
[1:41:20] finds
[1:41:21] of the cup in the back only bring him
[1:41:23] back he's going to be my server from
[1:41:25] here now well when they got back in
[1:41:27] Joseph's presence and they realized it
[1:41:29] was the couple since I've been rows back
[1:41:31] Judah stepped up and he say I'm done I
[1:41:35] became surety for the last he began to
[1:41:37] intercede Oh on business I say don't let
[1:41:40] Benjamin stay but keep me
[1:41:43] he was into ceding Abraham interceded
[1:41:50] for lot when he knew that destruction
[1:41:52] was on his way the Angels that come to
[1:41:55] visit he knew destruction was on his way
[1:41:56] he began to plead with God peradventure
[1:41:59] there be 50 and 40 and 30 and 20 and 10
[1:42:03] if you find 10 righteous will you
[1:42:05] destroy the city he began to intercede
[1:42:07] and when you recognize that you are
[1:42:11] priests you can't help but intercede on
[1:42:14] behalf of others I was talking to a
[1:42:23] friend last night and I told us a I'm
[1:42:28] gonna have to use what you just shared
[1:42:30] with me in the sermon tomorrow and he
[1:42:33] was saying how he got this job and as he
[1:42:37] you know went to do the work somebody
[1:42:39] called him out to do the work and they
[1:42:41] got it called him he hadn't talked to
[1:42:42] that guy since they've been there
[1:42:44] probably two months here and talk to the
[1:42:46] guy God just they come take care of this
[1:42:47] fund me and you know and we'll pay in
[1:42:49] you know just just take care
[1:42:51] the guy had confidence in them so he got
[1:42:52] them is doing the work but as he's
[1:42:54] working with different people but there
[1:42:56] begin to come some problems and one of
[1:42:59] the guys that was there one of the other
[1:43:01] hat guys was was working behind my
[1:43:04] friend's back and they were trying to
[1:43:06] get him fired they were doing their best
[1:43:08] to get him fired - get him off for that
[1:43:10] job and this man was just going through
[1:43:12] this person and that person he was just
[1:43:14] creating a a you know just a little
[1:43:17] group we're gonna get rid of this guy he
[1:43:19] just got there left his family to go out
[1:43:21] here to take this job and everything and
[1:43:23] say man this guy that start work so so
[1:43:25] why he you know when he kind of caught

[1:43:33] they doing this
[1:43:35] don't know what's gonna say well you
[1:43:36] know we'll try to work through it
[1:43:37] they'll try to work through it so if you
[1:43:39] know he found himself in all kind of
[1:43:40] situations and you know got it - got him
[1:43:44] - argument with another superintendent
[1:43:45] that's all kind of stuff going wrong
[1:43:47] like man I don't think I'm gonna be able
[1:43:48] to last through this job much longer the
[1:43:50] way this stuff is coming against me so
[1:43:53] he said he said just kind of it was
[1:43:55] praying about it and then you know one
[1:43:59] day you know you come into the office
[1:44:01] and the superintendent another
[1:44:03] superintendent just start yelling and
[1:44:05] screaming and cursing them out and they

[1:44:14] so they say just let it go for a little
[1:44:16] bit but he felt so bad he got something
[1:44:18] in his heart against a man so he said he
[1:44:20] went back to work the next day and he
[1:44:22] went to the man and apologize he didn't

[1:45:05] him fired if say we don't let him go and
[1:45:08] we want you to take his position
[1:45:20] but the testimonial stop there he say I
[1:45:26] was he said because you all are offering
[1:45:29] it to me I want to take it but I didn't
[1:45:30] want to take it under these conditions
[1:45:32] but because you are offering me I want
[1:45:34] it I will take it because you offered it
[1:45:37] to me he said but please don't fire that

[1:45:55] that he said I'm just asking if you find
[1:45:57] another place for him to work please
[1:45:59] don't fire the man now what was
[1:46:01] happening he was becoming a intercessor
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:09] so so so so so I'll you know he got a
[1:46:13] call back and say well we you know we
[1:46:15] told other guy that we was going to let
[1:46:16] him go and he began to ask us please not
[1:46:19] to fire him to just reassign him
[1:46:21] somewhere else so we felt we gave in to
[1:46:23] and we reassign them to another state
[1:46:25] but what happened is that God heard the
[1:46:29] the intercessors cry and provided for
[1:46:31] his enemy
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:44] the man's interceded for his enemy not
[1:46:54] his friend his enemy the same way Jesus
[1:46:58] was on the cross and said Father forgive
[1:47:00] them the people never known him to the
[1:47:03] cross Father forgive them they know not
[1:47:06] what they do so we talked about being
[1:47:10] kings and priests this takes it to
[1:47:14] another level
[1:47:15] oh that's not so you can just dress some
[1:47:20] kind of way and look some kind of waste
[1:47:22] you got your robe none on the fisticuffs
[1:47:25] while life his enemies and this was this
[1:47:38] was a young man that don't go to church
[1:47:39] every Sunday I say man that's nothing
[1:47:44] but Christ King you reflected I mean you
[1:47:46] intercedes don't fire him I'm taking his
[1:47:49] job but don't fire him give him another
[1:47:53] job the man got a family to take care of
[1:47:56] oh that thing that's just stop us
[1:48:03] praying against our enemies get him Lord
[1:48:07] get him
[1:48:08] no get you he's made of kings and
[1:48:18] priests
[1:48:20] and a priest is one that intercede on
[1:48:24] behalf of somebody else even Jesus asked
[1:48:28] the question if you if you pray for
[1:48:29] those that like you and do this and do
[1:48:31] that what say what beg have you what you
[1:48:33] think he done did say when you pray for
[1:48:35] your enemies oh my god when you when you
[1:48:39] get to that level you pray for your
[1:48:41] enemies and I mean brother Branham had a
[1:48:42] life that was so that you could not tell
[1:48:45] his enemies from his friends oh we
[1:48:53] talked about royal priesthood this is
[1:48:56] what royal priesthood looks like we've
[1:49:02] been interceding here at this church

[1:49:15] intercessory prayer right that's what
[1:49:18] priests do they intercede when a person
[1:49:21] can't stand for themselves I pray for
[1:49:23] themselves somebody's got to go and
[1:49:24] intercede on their behalf we couldn't
[1:49:27] stand before God but I said so Jesus
[1:49:29] interceded on our behalf right

[1:54:22] intercessory plan please when priest
[1:54:32] pays nothing happens and when the priest
[1:54:35] plays with confidence recognizing his
[1:54:39] position in Christ
[1:54:41] something happens Church
[1:54:50] the sisters chained as priests and they
[1:54:55] were here praying for relatives of
[1:54:57] sister Brown who was medically induced
[1:55:00] in a coma and when the sisters took on
[1:55:04] the prayer requests they took it before
[1:55:05] God God touched the person's body and
[1:55:09] raised him up out of that condition a
[1:55:12] hopeless condition but when the priest
[1:55:15] began to pray as priests we've been
[1:55:25] praying that God would give us
[1:55:27] opportunity to win more souls to Christ
[1:55:31] and I went back and looked a man in the
[1:55:36] past few months probably by the last two
[1:55:38] months God has opened up so many doors
[1:55:40] for us to kind of go in and speak at
[1:55:42] home going servicing and every time we
[1:55:44] go in we offer everybody an opportunity
[1:55:46] to accept Christ we don't give you a
[1:55:49] chance to raise your hand repeat this
[1:55:52] prayer to me and if it's something there
[1:55:59] you go find your way to truth but the
[1:56:04] priest had been praying and God has been
[1:56:07] responding let me go on a little further
[1:56:13] hallelujah I told you about this one
[1:56:15] already there's a sister that came to
[1:56:18] prayer one time to the prayer meeting
[1:56:21] sister's prayer meeting and she hadn't
[1:56:23] heard from a loved one for months but
[1:56:27] when the priests begin to pray after the
[1:56:33] prayer I believe the very next day that
[1:56:38] love when coal
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:51] one time we come in here praying and one
[1:56:56] brother caught a burden for the church
[1:56:58] and for the school and he just as a
[1:57:00] priest begin to enter feet and that very
[1:57:04] week that after he prayed that very week
[1:57:06] we had an opportunity to put in a bid on
[1:57:11] a church it on a school now we didn't
[1:57:13] get it but God heard the prayer maybe
[1:57:17] not that one but God got something else
[1:57:19] for and priest gunky fan search I'm
[1:57:27] telling it as as SSS priest it is our
[1:57:30] job to intercede on behalf of others you
[1:57:36] want to know another thing that priests
[1:57:37] pray for the restoration of our loved
[1:57:43] ones priests afraid and God is doing
[1:57:47] exactly what the priests of Acts for a
[1:57:55] week kings and priests
[1:58:01] I just thought about this royal
[1:58:06] priesthood and to be a king and a priest
[1:58:13] according to the Old Testament a king
[1:58:16] could not be a priest anybody ever read
[1:58:25] the story Uzziah desire was a king in
[1:58:30] the Old Testament and he took on the he
[1:58:35] took it upon himself he got lifted up in
[1:58:37] his heart right he wasn't supposed to
[1:58:40] get lifted up God gave him a position as
[1:58:42] a king and he had two priests the sons
[1:58:44] of Aaron as as the priests but this King
[1:58:47] got lifted up as our he had done so many
[1:58:49] great things he got lifted up in his
[1:58:51] heart he said I'm gonna stop offering
[1:58:52] things like the priests offer they
[1:58:55] wanted to simply start making sacrifices
[1:58:57] as a king but notice the scriptures say
[1:59:01] we are kings and priests but here Uzziah
[1:59:04] as a king took over the role of a priest
[1:59:07] and he ended up getting struck with
[1:59:10] leprosy because he got rebuked by a man
[1:59:14] lift up the priest so that that he got
[1:59:16] refused a you're not supposed to be
[1:59:17] doing this desire this is wrong he did
[1:59:20] not take well to their comments they got
[1:59:23] a little upset and because he got upset
[1:59:27] he ended up taking on leprosy you know
[1:59:32] what else happened when he got became
[1:59:35] leprous it's fun got an honor to become
[1:59:39] king so here he was a living King but
[1:59:45] his son became King because he was a
[1:59:49] leper and he could not compete couldn't
[1:59:52] manage the people in leprosy when you
[1:59:54] took on leprosy you got cast out away
[1:59:56] from the people oh my but while he was
[2:00:02] King his son also became king
[2:00:07] he didn't have to wait for his daddy to
[2:00:09] die oh my all right can I just read a
[2:00:17] little something on that out of
[2:00:19] influence y'all go back y'all read
[2:00:21] second chronicles chapter 26 verse 16
[2:00:24] through 21 you find out about Uzziah
[2:00:27] Uzziah a man here I want to read this
[2:00:31] and then I wanted to strike something
[2:00:33] else this man I was a king but when he
[2:00:37] tried to take on the office of a priest
[2:00:39] he got struck with leprosy well how is
[2:00:41] it that the scripture allows us to
[2:00:42] become kings and priests all right stay
[2:00:45] with me let me read this person then
[2:00:46] we'll give him an answer to that
[2:00:48] influence we find that as long as the
[2:00:53] King felt that way god blessed him but
[2:00:56] when he got to a place that he wanted to
[2:00:59] not abide in his own calling he wanted
[2:01:02] to take the calling of something else he
[2:01:04] thought because that God had blessed him
[2:01:06] that was alright he could do that but
[2:01:09] how sadly we make them mistakes how how
[2:01:12] bad you must absolutely be honest you
[2:01:16] mustn't you mustn't do nothing less God
[2:01:18] has directed you to it and proves it and
[2:01:21] vindicates it and you know that is God
[2:01:23] that's done it usually man of God God
[2:01:27] has to run him down and catch the real
[2:01:29] man of God I like that statement because
[2:01:32] anybody find something I'm trying to do
[2:01:34] it something wrong God has to run them
[2:01:37] down and catch the real man of God it
[2:01:40] ain't those guys that wants a whole lot
[2:01:42] of something to do a whole lot with you
[2:01:44] heart you you heart tell what they went
[2:01:47] wha what they do with if they received
[2:01:50] it see but God usually has to catch his
[2:01:53] man like Moses and Paul and like that to
[2:01:56] run him down to get glory out of his
[2:01:58] life to let him become a prisoner to the
[2:02:01] Holy Spirit listen now we notice that
[2:02:04] this king and another thing we learn
[2:02:07] here on Uzziah that when he was called
[2:02:09] down by the man who had the authority to
[2:02:12] take the sensor in the consecrated man
[2:02:14] for the service when he called him down
[2:02:16] he got angry with him oh what a curse
[2:02:20] thing that
[2:02:20] would be when a man tries to point out a
[2:02:23] fellow that you're in the wrong and
[2:02:25] prove it to him by the Word of God
[2:02:27] you're in the wrong and the man because
[2:02:29] that he feels himself he'll do what he
[2:02:32] wants to and won't submit to the word
[2:02:34] then he gets angry
[2:02:36] you notice what happened to the king
[2:02:39] leprosy broke out in his face and he was
[2:02:42] still in his anger leprosy struck his
[2:02:44] eye on the face and the priest and those
[2:02:47] recognized it and threw him out of the
[2:02:49] temple and he died a leper the great
[2:02:52] life that started out so well ended up
[2:02:55] to be a leper and cast out and had to
[2:02:57] live in a separate house to himself all
[2:02:59] the days of his life the man that the
[2:03:01] man that the life that God wants
[2:03:03] influence I say this respect we got men
[2:03:09] today on the field young men and
[2:03:10] middle-aged men and old men who started
[2:03:12] out on a good run and trying to meet a
[2:03:14] good showing to God but we find them
[2:03:17] today out yonder alcoholics and broke up
[2:03:20] out there in the other way from us some
[2:03:22] of them back split all together some of
[2:03:24] them have went money crazy and some went
[2:03:26] women crazy and there's other women that
[2:03:29] wasn't their wives and all the things
[2:03:31] and disgrace that's been brought on
[2:03:33] every denomination we one can't call the
[2:03:37] other one bad because we're all guilty
[2:03:39] the whole or every denomination we found
[2:03:43] men like that that's once that
[2:03:45] influenced by God and had a great
[2:03:47] influence to the people and yet when
[2:03:49] they felt self-sufficient when a man
[2:03:52] gets the place where he could influence
[2:03:54] for God he ought to Humble himself all
[2:03:57] the time constantly we find out this
[2:04:05] king died in disgrace a leper then he
[2:04:09] was a lesson to the young prophet not to
[2:04:12] put his hopes upon any man but to look
[2:04:15] to God only when he began to look at to
[2:04:18] a man for an example this man fell yet
[2:04:20] being a good man so it's a lesson to us
[2:04:23] tonight to keep our minds upon God
[2:04:26] regardless of what man it is let him be
[2:04:28] Cardinal priest prophet whatever he
[2:04:31] might be he is not immune from mistakes
[2:04:33] and
[2:04:34] and even death and sin but there is one
[2:04:37] who is and that's Jesus Christ he is the
[2:04:39] one by this isaiah learned a lesson god
[2:04:41] orders his man to place let me go on it
[2:04:45] says oh okay i'll leave that right there
[2:04:50] God ordered this man's to this place now
[2:04:52] when we when we when we you go back to
[2:04:54] you read that and second chronicles like
[2:04:57] I said chapter 26 verse 16 through 21
[2:05:01] Uzziah was a king who tried to take the
[2:05:06] place of a priest and got struck with
[2:05:09] leprosy but yet the Bible declares that
[2:05:12] we are kings and priests how could that
[2:05:17] be the Bible does not contradict itself
[2:05:25] the answer is found in Revelation 1
[2:05:28] verse 5 and 6 we read it last week we'll
[2:05:32] read it again today the answer is found
[2:05:35] right there in the scripture of how we
[2:05:38] became kings and priests this is why we
[2:05:42] won't get struck down with leprosy verse
[2:05:49] 5 and from Jesus Christ I could just
[2:05:53] stop right there the answer is found in
[2:05:56] Jesus Christ from Jesus Christ who is
[2:06:00] the faithful witness and the first
[2:06:02] begotten of the Dead and the Prince of
[2:06:05] the kings of the earth on to him that
[2:06:07] loved us and washed us from our sins in
[2:06:10] his own blood wash means he loosed us
[2:06:13] from our sins and the reason that we can
[2:06:15] become kings and priests is because
[2:06:17] we've been free by the blood of Jesus oh
[2:06:20] that's power in the blood and have made
[2:06:23] us kings and priests on the God and his
[2:06:25] father to him be glory and Dominion for
[2:06:27] ever and ever amen
[2:06:28] back in use I'd say there was no blood
[2:06:31] sacrifice but in our day there is a
[2:06:34] blood sacrifice that's why we've been
[2:06:37] made kings and priests Oh glory to God
[2:06:43] now let's go back to the quote that we
[2:06:46] stopped with last week
[2:06:47] and I just got a couple more things I
[2:06:50] want to share with you back to
[2:06:51] revelation of Jesus Christ out of church
[2:06:53] days boo all glory church when you just
[2:06:56] begin to think about the blood the blood
[2:06:58] the blood you stop thinking about your
[2:07:01] problem your problem your problem the
[2:07:03] blood took care of it he has made you a
[2:07:06] king in the priest now it's time for you
[2:07:08] to intercede for somebody else the way
[2:07:10] that people have interceded for you look
[2:07:16] at this paragraph 35 - 3 he hath made us
[2:07:19] oh there are certain truths we need to
[2:07:23] emphasize this is one of them he he hath
[2:07:29] made us salvation is his doing salvation
[2:07:34] is of the Lord all of grace he redeemed
[2:07:38] us for a purpose listen he brought he
[2:07:41] bought us for a purpose we are Kings
[2:07:45] spiritual kings oh we are going to be
[2:07:48] Kings upon the earth with him when he
[2:07:50] sits on his throne but now we are
[2:07:52] spiritual kings and we reign over a
[2:07:54] spiritual Kingdom and he goes on says it
[2:07:57] says in Romans 5:17 but of any man if
[2:08:00] for if by one man's offense death
[2:08:02] reigned by one much more they which
[2:08:05] receive abundance of grace and of a gift
[2:08:07] of righteousness shall reign in life by
[2:08:08] one Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1:13
[2:08:11] who have to live it us from the power of
[2:08:13] darkness and hath translated us into the
[2:08:14] kingdom rain of a dishonor right now we
[2:08:18] reign with Christ having dominion over
[2:08:22] sin the world the flesh and the devil I
[2:08:26] just love that statement right now we
[2:08:29] reign with Christ having dominion over
[2:08:32] sin the world the flesh and the devil
[2:08:36] Shawn forces his praise and glory Shawn
[2:08:39] puts himself for it is Christ in us
[2:08:41] willing and doing of his good pleasure
[2:08:43] yes indeed even now we are seated in
[2:08:45] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[2:08:47] now I stopped it there last week because
[2:08:50] we want to focus on the Royal part but
[2:08:53] today we're folks can focus it on the
[2:08:54] priests part and look at what it says in
[2:08:58] the next paragraph and made us priests
[2:09:01] yes priest unto Him offering the
[2:09:05] spiritual praise of sanctified lips
[2:09:07] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[2:09:11] unto Him worshipping Him in spirit and
[2:09:14] in truth
[2:09:15] I like that worshipping Him in spirit
[2:09:18] and in truth interceding and petitioning
[2:09:24] priest intercede on behalf of others the
[2:09:28] priests have been coming in here
[2:09:29] interceding on behalf of others and God
[2:09:32] has been honoring their request oh we
[2:09:35] didn't realize it but we're priests
[2:09:36] that's why we're doing what we've been
[2:09:38] doing 7:00 a.m. prayer interceding on
[2:09:40] behalf of others tuesday night prayer
[2:09:43] interceding on behalf of others I'm
[2:09:45] going on I'm going to just precinct
[2:09:48] Kings untie God no wonder the world does
[2:09:50] not appeal to us and we are peculiar
[2:09:53] people zealous them to get works we have
[2:09:56] been recreated in him to be children
[2:09:59] like unto our Father Church I got a two
[2:10:04] things that I want to read for you out
[2:10:05] of the scripture you see before of
[2:10:10] Israel was under the law God gave them
[2:10:13] grace God gave them a prophet God gave
[2:10:16] them a number of things and brother
[2:10:19] Branham say they actually went under the
[2:10:20] law they accepted law right there in
[2:10:22] revelation I'm sorry Exodus 19 that's
[2:10:24] where they took it but Exodus 19 also
[2:10:27] had a couple other things in it and I
[2:10:29] want us to read that and then after we
[2:10:31] read that I want to I want to read one
[2:10:32] other scripture for you I'm gonna let
[2:10:34] you go
[2:10:35] Exodus 19 verse 1 through 8 I believe is
[2:10:39] where I want to read we are kings and
[2:10:43] priests a royal precent glory to God
[2:10:49] glory to God and if you are royal
[2:10:54] priesthood you can't help but enter feet
[2:10:55] on behalf of others they man Abraham did
[2:11:00] it for light when he knew the impending
[2:11:03] destruction he began to intercede Church
[2:11:06] we know what's going to happen we got to
[2:11:08] enter see listen here in Exodus 19 verse
[2:11:12] one sits in the third month
[2:11:15] when the children of Israel were going
[2:11:17] forth out of the land of Egypt the same
[2:11:19] day came day into the world whistles
[2:11:21] tonigh Sinai and for they were departed
[2:11:25] from reffered them and were come to the
[2:11:27] desert of Sinai and that pitched in the
[2:11:29] wilderness and their Israel camp before
[2:11:31] the mountain and Moses went up unto God
[2:11:34] and the Lord called unto Him out of the
[2:11:37] mountain stand us shelled out state to
[2:11:39] the house of Jacob and tell the children
[2:11:41] of Israel ye are seeing what I did into
[2:11:44] the Egyptians and how I bear you on
[2:11:47] eagle's wings and brought you unto
[2:11:49] myself now therefore if ye will obey my
[2:11:53] voice indeed and keep my covenant then
[2:11:58] ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[2:12:03] above all people for all the earth is
[2:12:06] mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom
[2:12:10] of priests a kingdom of priests and a
[2:12:19] holy nation these are the words which
[2:12:23] thou shalt speak unto the children of
[2:12:26] Israel so here God is telling that if
[2:12:28] you will follow me if you'll just stay
[2:12:30] with my word the Israelites were totally
[2:12:32] saying you'll be a kingdom of priests
[2:12:35] you'll be a holy nation you'll be a
[2:12:37] peculiar treasure to me and we saw
[2:12:39] Israel become that and God saying when
[2:12:42] you read the Old Testament you see all
[2:12:44] the signs one of the miracles happening
[2:12:46] amongst Israel primarily Israel God
[2:12:50] showed me they were a kingdom of priests
[2:12:52] before they received law Exodus 20 they
[2:12:54] got law but here David they've got
[2:12:56] tongue I'm gonna make you a kingdom of
[2:12:59] priests oh I love this I love this so
[2:13:03] you're your royal priesthood before
[2:13:05] before the mistakes before anything you
[2:13:08] are a royal priesthood
[2:13:10] now I got something to tell you as we
[2:13:13] find ourselves over to Isaiah 61
[2:13:23] because you are priests you get double
[2:13:28] for your trouble I was there 61 a week
[2:13:40] you know we got to get this I you know I
[2:13:43] think about when I think about double
[2:13:46] for your trouble I have to think about
[2:13:47] Joe because of what job went through all
[2:13:51] the great trials and tribulations and
[2:13:54] de-stresses but at the end of jokes
[2:13:56] trial job got double for his trouble and
[2:14:04] look at this promise in that Isaiah 61
[2:14:11] verse 6 but ye shall be named the
[2:14:18] priests of the Lord men shall call you
[2:14:22] the ministers of our God you shall eat
[2:14:26] the riches of the Gentiles and in their
[2:14:28] glory shall you boast yourselves for
[2:14:31] your shame ye shall have double and for
[2:14:37] confusion they shall rejoice in their
[2:14:40] portion therefore in their land they
[2:14:43] shall possess the double everlasting joy
[2:14:48] shall be unto them I'm talking to the
[2:14:51] priest of the Lord
[2:14:52] the ministers of our God you receive
[2:14:54] double for your trouble oh my a king and
[2:15:02] a priest Oh blessed be the name of the
[2:15:05] Lord
[2:15:06] well I'd say that Develin did so much to
[2:15:08] us but now we recognize who we are and
[2:15:10] we can know what to expect from God just
[2:15:13] being a king and a priest that double
[2:15:15] for your trouble
[2:15:21] Oh glory to God church I tell you what
[2:15:25] there's one little statement here that
[2:15:27] I'm making we'll let this go for the day
[2:15:30] I told you there's another angle there
[2:15:33] because I some point in time I want to
[2:15:35] come back and hit that those presets
[2:15:37] right the the Aaronic priesthood or what
[2:15:41] we call a vertical priesthood but how
[2:15:43] that's changed and we got into the order
[2:15:45] of Melchizedek right
[2:15:47] that's the royal priests the order of
[2:15:50] Melchizedek is the royal priesthood and
[2:15:52] after Jesus died the Aaronic priesthood
[2:15:55] ceased oh my but we entered into a new
[2:16:00] priests lift now the the priesthood
[2:16:02] after the order of Melchizedek all right
[2:16:07] unveiling of God this is my last quote
[2:16:09] oh no no no that's not it that's that's
[2:16:16] for later
[2:16:17] give me a let me just find this last one
[2:16:19] and then we will we'll close it here oh
[2:16:21] my I thank God that I'm getting double
[2:16:24] for my trouble a man that devil I'm Rob
[2:16:29] long enough I'm no longer living beneath
[2:16:32] my privileges I'm going to tap into
[2:16:35] these these resources or sources that
[2:16:39] ain't net and he said they never been
[2:16:41] tapped in they've never been tapped in
[2:16:44] so I'm get ready to walk in that church
[2:16:46] I'm looking forward to it oh my Oh God I
[2:16:54] think I misplaced this quote if I did it
[2:16:59] that's fine that's fine
[2:17:06] and I don't want to misquote it let's
[2:17:08] see okay here it is the children of
[2:17:11] Israel isn't it is the title discernment
[2:17:13] the children Israel says I guess it's
[2:17:17] not against the law to state and Phoenix
[2:17:19] hallelujah
[2:17:21] so I mean praise our God and I think
[2:17:26] he's worthy of every praise and
[2:17:28] hallelujah we could wring from these
[2:17:31] motor lips the Bible saying you are a
[2:17:35] royal priesthood a peculiar people
[2:17:39] offering spiritual sacrifices to God the
[2:17:42] fruits of your lips giving praise unto
[2:17:44] Him oh my the fruits of your lips
[2:17:46] pouring up praise daily before the
[2:17:49] people what a high priest we have what a
[2:17:53] priest would that priesthood that we're
[2:17:55] in the priesthood of the circumcision
[2:17:57] not of the flesh but of the heart amen
[2:17:59] the heart circumcised by the Holy Ghost
[2:18:02] that's right then you can offer praise
[2:18:04] and adoration to god but spiritual
[2:18:06] sacrifice your lips pouring out praise
[2:18:08] unto Him I tell you what when you think
[2:18:11] about that my hallelujah belongs to you
[2:18:14] right if it belongs to you Church there
[2:18:17] was a time the Kings could not be
[2:18:19] priests but he's told us in this season
[2:18:23] we are kings and priests and the only
[2:18:26] way we can come to that is because of
[2:18:29] the blood don't ever don't ever amen
[2:18:34] don't ever don't ever don't ever
[2:18:37] discredit what the blood is done in your
[2:18:39] life don't care how low you were the
[2:18:44] blood lifted you up the blood didn't
[2:18:48] save you grace save you but the blood is
[2:18:52] what's keeping you safe
[2:18:57] thank God for the blood let's pray
[2:19:03] father we've been made kings and priests
[2:19:10] and and it's because we were washed in
[2:19:14] blood that we could become kings and
[2:19:18] priests not just any blood but the blood
[2:19:21] of your son Jesus thank you for that Oh
[2:19:25] God when we just look back in Scripture
[2:19:29] and see how others could not Lord a
[2:19:34] Uzziah was he got in trouble because he
[2:19:37] tried to take the office of a priest he
[2:19:39] was a king that tried to become a priest
[2:19:40] he got in trouble with you but there was
[2:19:43] no blood sacrifice for him but today
[2:19:46] what we stand underneath that and we can
[2:19:49] look back now and realize that no matter
[2:19:51] what it is that Satan may think that he
[2:19:54] has on us the blood has washed us and
[2:19:58] cleanse us from it so we can walk in our
[2:20:00] authority as kings and as priests before
[2:20:04] the Most High God as priests it's our
[2:20:09] responsibility to intercede and petition
[2:20:12] on behalf of others and God there are
[2:20:16] things that occur in life just sharing
[2:20:21] the testimony of that precious brother
[2:20:22] who interceded on behalf of his enemy
[2:20:26] lord help us to realize that's what
[2:20:29] you've called us to Jesus did the exact
[2:20:31] same thing when he interceded on behalf
[2:20:34] of his enemies those that caused him to
[2:20:38] go to the cross he's still interceded
[2:20:40] for them now God we've been called to
[2:20:45] this and we will have to intercede on
[2:20:48] behalf of those we love and those that
[2:20:51] are still considered our enemies that's
[2:20:55] true royal priesthood let it be
[2:20:59] manifested in every heart god as my
[2:21:01] prayer know let this just be something
[2:21:04] that goes in one ear not the other but
[2:21:05] let it be something that we meditate
[2:21:07] and reflect upon that it might become a
[2:21:10] manifestation in our lives if you can
[2:21:13] just get a hold of a group of people a
[2:21:15] bunch of people God then you just began
[2:21:19] to manifest the glories and amen the
[2:21:21] great things of God the things that have
