[16:07] i've just been feeling a real uh
[16:11] revival spirit in our midst i

[16:16] something
[16:17] and just expecting just so much more
[16:21] every time i come into the house of god
[16:24] and man i just expect him to do so much
[16:26] more
[16:27] and i'm looking forward to what he has
[16:28] in store tonight
[16:30] uh just before we have the word of the
[16:32] lord just
[16:33] let me give you the announcements and
[16:37] i wanted to say thank you to you all for
[16:41] abiding a man i mentioned that we had
[16:44] a case that was very close somebody
[16:48] came in contact with someone that had
[16:50] tested positive for the virus and
[16:53] we've been doing everything we can
[16:56] not to have an outbreak here and when i
[16:59] when i first heard about
[17:00] the the test my mind was going
[17:05] you know to and fro as to should we just
[17:06] shut church down for two weeks
[17:08] or you know what do we do and
[17:11] um you know as i was just kind of
[17:13] talking things over with brother troy
[17:14] and
[17:15] you know we just kind of came to the
[17:17] conclusion we want to keep
[17:18] church going we really want to keep
[17:21] church going
[17:22] and um and you know and had we
[17:25] shut things down we would not have been
[17:27] able to have the service that we had on
[17:28] sunday
[17:30] had we shut it down and uh have we shut
[17:32] things down we wouldn't be able to have
[17:34] the service that we're having tonight
[17:36] right so uh i want to thank you all for
[17:40] just
[17:40] just bearing with us and and i'll i'm
[17:42] i'm gonna just put this
[17:44] out there uh actual just to wear your
[17:46] mask just for
[17:47] the next couple weeks and so what i'm
[17:49] asking for tonight and for sunday let's
[17:51] wear
[17:51] maybe vigilant about wearing the mask in
[17:54] here but next week
[17:55] those that you know want to lighten up
[17:57] i'm giving you a
[17:59] amen next wednesday amen will will be
[18:02] past
[18:03] that that that little threshold of uh so
[18:05] many days of quarantine
[18:07] right so we'll be past that so those you
[18:09] know one thing i i didn't ever want to
[18:12] do is
[18:12] make it mandatory that when people came
[18:15] to church
[18:16] that they had to wear their mask i don't
[18:18] i didn't feel comfortable about that
[18:20] i just didn't feel comfortable but when
[18:22] we have been
[18:23] told that there there's a positive case
[18:28] nearby then we want to be what we call
[18:31] extra precautions right because we don't
[18:34] want the church shut down in any way at
[18:36] all so thank you all amen for just
[18:39] bearing with us
[18:40] as we get through this you know last
[18:42] year in 2020
[18:44] we shut down but this year we're trying
[18:46] to do something a little different
[18:48] right so uh i mean we this is something
[18:51] i feel like we're gonna have to learn
[18:52] how to live
[18:53] through it amen we got to learn how to
[18:56] live through it and i think it
[18:57] as as a body together we can do that and
[19:00] uh
[19:00] and i just know that god will bring us
[19:02] through i really feel that way
[19:04] um so um just real quickly

[30:23] and it ends with marriage in revelation
[30:25] and that is the mystery of redemption
[30:28] i'm gonna preach on that but i did last
[30:29] sunday amen
[30:33] but it's good to be here you may be
[30:35] seated a moment i'm going to say a quick
[30:36] prayer in a moment i just want to greet
[30:38] you
[30:38] from the family of god church in ocala
[30:41] florida we're
[30:42] we're constantly still on the move i
[30:45] appreciate the faith words of
[30:46] your pastor to continue on with church
[30:49] services
[30:50] you know uh uh there's a great spirit of
[30:53] fear in the land
[30:55] and and rightly so from a natural point
[30:58] of view
[30:59] but when you're when you're called to be
[31:01] the bride of christ it's just something
[31:02] else in you tells you i gotta go to
[31:04] church
[31:05] i gotta get with the believers amen and
[31:08] i know you can have home services and
[31:10] you can have home church and
[31:11] still be just as blessed by the word but
[31:14] oh how
[31:15] good and how pleasant it is
[31:18] to be able to look another brother and
[31:20] sister in their face and smile with your
[31:22] eyes
[31:26] it took someone a little while to catch
[31:28] that brother jack
[31:30] but y'all know what i mean i mean it's
[31:32] just good i i saw brother jack now this
[31:35] is going to throw some of y'all
[31:37] i tried wrote a jack at rudolph's house
[31:40] uh
[31:40] the other day and even if he had covet
[31:42] i'd have still hugged him without the
[31:44] mask
[31:44] we'd had covert together because that's
[31:46] how much i love it
[31:48] i'm just being honest with you that's
[31:50] how much i love him
[31:51] i know that in everybody's faith now
[31:54] amen amen i probably shouldn't have said
[31:57] that
[31:58] that kind of preachers we got in the
[31:59] pool fit today they take risks
[32:01] but no it's just i just meant that the
[32:03] love of god
[32:04] was so great that you could overlook all
[32:06] kinds of things amen
[32:07] you have a wonderful pastor i appreciate
[32:10] him
[32:11] i appreciate you all too i know y'all
[32:13] been supporting us with your prayers
[32:15] i i had an attack by the devil i won't
[32:17] go into the the full testimony of it but
[32:19] i'm just thankful to be standing here
[32:21] and before you tonight i i uh you know
[32:25] it was a battle
[32:26] i remember after i came out of the
[32:28] hospital
[32:30] and i went to a doctor just for a
[32:32] checkup
[32:33] and and he said something that caught my
[32:34] attention because i was just trying to
[32:36] figure out how much longer i needed to
[32:37] take
[32:38] these certain pills and i'm not giving
[32:40] you the whole testimony i'm just
[32:41] breaking
[32:42] in here somewhere and this doctor told
[32:44] me he says if you're not careful what's
[32:46] going on inside of your
[32:48] stomach will kill you
[32:51] and he got my attention because i was
[32:54] trying to stop taking these pills and he
[32:55] was letting me know
[32:57] if you stop taking the pills you may
[32:59] possibly die
[33:00] that's what he was trying to tell me in
[33:02] the midst of covet and everything else
[33:04] now i got i got a a a diagnosis like
[33:08] that that if i don't take the medicine
[33:10] i could die and so i walked out of there
[33:12] and i kept thinking about it
[33:14] uh and i just kept hearing this little
[33:16] song says i shall not die
[33:18] but live and declare the works
[33:23] of the lord
[33:24] [Laughter]
[33:29] i said i got more faith in the word of
[33:32] god than
[33:34] what the doctor says even though i knew
[33:35] my situation
[33:37] was not a light but i did stop taking
[33:39] the pills and i have not
[33:40] died
[33:46] and and they told me you're so healthy
[33:49] we can't even find trace in your body
[33:50] where they've ever had
[33:51] ulcers or anything at all it told me
[33:55] completely the doctor said you're
[33:57] completely healed that's
[33:58] how he said it and i was like thank you
[34:00] for that diagnosis so
[34:01] you know we thank god jack knows how
[34:04] things was i'm sure he shared it with
[34:06] some of you
[34:06] but just want to thank you for your
[34:08] prayers and for god uh delivering and
[34:10] bringing me
[34:10] through that ordeal and just keep me and
[34:13] sister pam in your prayers we were
[34:15] building a new church and when i heard
[34:17] jack say he's waiting to get a new
[34:18] address man i would love it if i
[34:20] i would just love to see you all have
[34:22] your own property and
[34:23] new church and i was thinking about it
[34:25] the other day i was like man if anybody
[34:27] should have it it should be
[34:28] brother jack and god's got a plan and
[34:31] he's working it out amen
[34:34] that we're we're getting um close to uh
[34:39] midway with the church it's a 5 000
[34:42] square foot building so it's
[34:43] and it's 14 foot walls and someone asked
[34:45] me
[34:46] why did you build the walls so high and
[34:48] i said i didn't build the walls to how
[34:50] did
[34:51] the masonry crew built the walls that
[34:52] high i was being shortcast
[34:56] but i said the reason is so high is
[34:58] because the sound booth
[34:59] is up there and they turned around and
[35:01] looked and the sound booth is sitting
[35:03] over the entrance doors
[35:04] way in the back and i said they told me
[35:06] they wanted to be 14 foot high
[35:08] we wanted it up high not on the floor
[35:10] and and
[35:11] and kind of like what the pastor have
[35:13] here but we were not just trying to be
[35:14] big we were just trying to
[35:16] be convenient and so on and so they made
[35:19] it so big up there that it'll
[35:20] seat 25 people up there and i said

[37:16] brother
[37:16] came for sister k first i was thinking
[37:18] about you
[37:20] when they gave me 18 pills a day to take
[37:22] i said brother kate was told me he
[37:24] didn't have to take any pills
[37:26] i said i want capers faith lord
[37:29] anoint me with capers faith the doctor
[37:32] said we're not hearing that you don't
[37:34] take them you shall
[37:35] surely die i said man i mean i was sick
[37:39] 24 hours seven days a week brother
[37:40] capers taking those pills i mean i never
[37:42] had a moment where i wasn't feeling sick
[37:45] and it just took my faith i refused to
[37:47] stay in the bed i refused to
[37:49] to just be bedridden but we kept moving
[37:52] and after two weeks my faith fully
[37:54] kicked in
[37:56] and there was no more pills and i got
[37:57] healed by not taking the pills
[38:00] by not taking the pills so that caper
[38:03] faith
[38:04] all you gotta do is think about the
[38:05] people who've testified to you about the
[38:06] glory of god you may not know it
[38:08] but the prophet said when that that man
[38:10] gave his life to the lord he used to
[38:12] drink and
[38:13] and go out and gamble and everything and
[38:15] god uh he went to church
[38:17] and he told the pastor i'm ready to
[38:18] testify and
[38:20] the pastor said well go ahead and tell
[38:21] us brother he said i hope you don't mind
[38:22] but you used to be a rascal and you used
[38:24] to gamble and
[38:25] so so tell us how you gave your life to
[38:27] god was this what sermon did i preach
[38:30] he said well pastor i got to tell you
[38:33] although you preached some good sermons
[38:36] it wasn't your sermon that did it
[38:38] and although the singers in the choir
[38:41] song good songs
[38:43] but it wasn't the choir singing that
[38:44] done and although the specials were good
[38:48] it was none of the specials he said well
[38:50] then brother tell us
[38:52] what caused you to give your life to
[38:53] jesus christ he says
[38:55] i was at work and there's a man who i
[38:57] made fun of all the time i called them
[38:59] holy roller holy fanatic
[39:01] everything i could think of but he kept
[39:03] on demonstrating the life of christ
[39:05] until one day i said lord i want that
[39:08] jesus that this man right here have
[39:10] and that man right there led me to
[39:12] christ brother brennan came behind that
[39:14] and said
[39:15] he said god uses you
[39:19] to bring people in amen he wants to use
[39:23] us
[39:23] i was preaching a message on hidden in
[39:25] earthen vessels and
[39:27] and and i was close to speaking on it
[39:28] tonight but i i turned
[39:30] felt a little turn there but i'm telling
[39:32] this word is right
[39:33] this word is good and i thank god that
[39:35] he uses us
[39:37] testimonies from each other and if you

[42:21] amen and amen you can have your see
[42:23] thank you for standing with me
[42:25] uh just from reading that verse of
[42:27] scripture i would like to um
[42:30] give it a title if i would call it even
[42:32] a sermon tonight i just like to
[42:34] talk to you from from this verse a
[42:36] little bit the stronghold battle
[42:39] the stronghold battle and man we have
[42:42] battles don't we we all
[42:44] we all have our own personal little
[42:46] battles
[42:47] and and we're constantly at war with
[42:50] something
[42:50] right you know and and that's
[42:53] understanding because
[42:54] we know we have an enemy as long as you
[42:57] have an enemy
[42:58] you're going to have a war you're going
[42:59] to be ever in a battle at some point
[43:01] in your life amen and so uh talking
[43:05] about this stronghold battle
[43:07] the scripture tells us that the weapons
[43:09] of our warfare
[43:11] so we have weapons we have a
[43:14] mighty weapon and the weapon that
[43:18] destroys the strongholds it is the word
[43:21] of god now
[43:23] now the sin nature itself it is a
[43:26] stronghold
[43:28] it is a stronghold we don't go around
[43:29] testifying that we live in this sin
[43:31] nature but it's still there
[43:36] it's still there so and it is a
[43:38] stronghold
[43:39] but but i just like to i want to talk
[43:42] around a little bit
[43:43] and see how god helped me to to to go
[43:46] through this
[43:46] little uh talk with you this evening
[43:49] god's weapons
[43:51] or weapon his word will pull down and
[43:53] destroy anything that has a tight grip
[43:55] on you
[43:58] anything that has a tight grip on you
[44:02] can be pulled down and destroyed
[44:06] is that right amen for our weapons are
[44:08] mighty
[44:09] through god god works his power through
[44:12] his word
[44:14] he gives us the authority to use his
[44:15] weapon is that right
[44:17] and and we can use it on everything that
[44:20] has a stronghold
[44:21] and that is of their sin nature
[44:24] everything
[44:25] and and now there is a quote i want to
[44:27] kind of open up reading to you where the
[44:29] prophet of god said this
[44:30] and brother this is god's word which is
[44:33] sharper than a two-edged sword
[44:35] it's the greatest power that was ever
[44:38] put in the hands of
[44:39] man and gods expecting adam's race to
[44:43] put
[44:43] sin sickness and all kinds of devils to
[44:46] the fighting wrong
[44:49] because we're going to have to fight him
[44:50] now we're going to have to fight him
[44:52] we're going to have to deal with sin
[44:53] issues we have to deal with sickness
[44:56] issues that's we're all
[44:57] dealing with right now is that right
[44:59] he's saying all kinds of devils to the
[45:01] fighting wall
[45:02] that's right we've got the most powerful
[45:04] weapon that there is this
[45:06] is the word of god so now a stronghold
[45:11] is something that has a strong grip on
[45:13] you
[45:14] it's holding you tight or you're holding
[45:17] it tight
[45:18] all right come on come on all right
[45:21] god's word is so designed and has the
[45:25] power in it to pull it down
[45:26] and also to destroy it if you believe
[45:29] that's amen
[45:31] everything about yourself everything
[45:34] that you have allowed
[45:35] yourself to to make up about who you are
[45:38] it has to be pulled down
[45:40] if it's not in line with the word of god
[45:44] there are some personalities and
[45:46] characteristics about us
[45:48] that is anti-god
[45:52] but but we still embrace them because
[45:54] we've convinced ourselves
[45:56] it's who we are yeah
[45:59] and it is who you are but that's a
[46:01] stronghold in your mind
[46:05] that's got to be pulled down
[46:08] a mindset a wrong mindset
[46:12] is one of the most uh hindering things
[46:15] to your life
[46:16] is when you have the wrong mindset you
[46:19] almost can't achieve anything
[46:21] or accomplish anything you can't even be
[46:23] a real good christian
[46:24] when you have the wrong mindset you're
[46:27] constantly
[46:28] battling do i believe do i not believe
[46:30] am i in
[46:31] am i out you know
[46:34] should i listen should i shut it off
[46:37] should i have came out wednesday night
[46:39] or should i stay
[46:40] home i mean you battle that thing right
[46:43] so your mindset can be the very thing
[46:45] that is besetting you
[46:48] keeping you from coming to full maturity
[46:51] keeping you from achieving your goals
[46:52] and
[46:53] overcoming fears and frustrations
[46:58] these kinds of mindset must be pulled
[47:00] down
[47:02] the wrong mindset can keep a church from
[47:04] getting a new address
[47:09] it'll keep you in one place for a long
[47:10] time
[47:14] it'll keep you from growing spiritually
[47:17] developing
[47:18] you'll be coming to church sitting in
[47:20] the pews and you'll repeat that
[47:21] year after year and hadn't grown a bit
[47:25] you don't know if god has gifted you to
[47:27] be a be something
[47:29] or not because in your mind you just a
[47:32] church member
[47:35] that's a stronghold right there brother
[47:38] it's got to be pulled down
[47:40] because every son and daughter of god is
[47:42] gifted to do
[47:43] something amen we all are
[47:47] amen now the bible is our weapon of
[47:50] warfare and the first person we should
[47:52] use it on
[47:53] is ourselves
[47:56] we quickly use it on somebody else i'll
[47:59] give you a quote in a minute brother the
[48:00] prophet said
[48:02] i'll give you a scripture but we have to
[48:04] use it on ourselves first
[48:11] the prophet says this let's diagnose
[48:13] that down
[48:15] like take the chemistry of the blood or
[48:17] the chemistry of water or whatever it is
[48:18] see
[48:19] let's diagnose it down in other words
[48:21] look at how it comes together
[48:22] look at what makes it what it is then he
[48:25] says why why did
[48:26] why did he give the word because
[48:30] he said now are you ready congregation
[48:32] says
[48:33] amen i know you're a little late because
[48:35] you knew i was reading a quote but are
[48:37] you ready
[48:38] okay so he says the word is eternal
[48:42] when i first read this i said you worked
[48:44] the congregation up just to tell them
[48:45] that the word is eternal
[48:47] but watch what he says why that
[48:49] statement is so important he said the
[48:51] word is eternal see
[48:52] and if god made a promise that is
[48:54] eternal and there is nothing nowhere can
[48:56] stop it
[48:57] they couldn't turn every atom upside
[48:59] down turn it backwards
[49:00] could never pierce the word of god one
[49:03] little word see because jesus said
[49:05] both heaven and earth will pass away but
[49:08] my word shall never fail
[49:10] amen he's trying to show us how powerful
[49:13] the word is
[49:14] he said that it is eternal it cannot
[49:16] fail see
[49:18] god was eternal before the beginning
[49:21] he's going to be eternal at the very
[49:23] ending but he put you in a time
[49:25] loop he put you in a tying loop so you
[49:28] can figure that you can get to know who
[49:30] he is now
[49:31] through trial and error sinful birth
[49:35] but he's still eternal now but what he's
[49:37] going to do is put eternity in you while
[49:40] you're on the earth
[49:42] that's his word coming into the ride
[49:44] he's going to give you
[49:45] eternal word by predestination seed
[49:48] that's already in you by faith
[49:52] so he's going to put the i thought about
[49:54] it i've said here i am i'm in
[49:55] eternal in the mind of god i don't have
[49:58] to leave
[50:00] but god created a time loop
[50:04] and deposited us in this time loop
[50:09] creatures of eternity placed in time and
[50:11] if
[50:12] any time something leaves eternity it's
[50:14] got to die now i'm going to prove this
[50:15] to you
[50:20] god put us in this time loop because
[50:23] everything in heaven is perfect nothing
[50:26] dies
[50:27] nothing gets sick nothing hurts there is
[50:30] nothing wrong in heaven is perfect
[50:33] and only perfection can go back there so
[50:35] if you weren't perfect from the
[50:36] beginning you're not going back there
[50:38] because you got to be perfect to get
[50:39] back
[50:40] there so he already knew what it would
[50:42] take to get you back where he was in the
[50:44] original but the question
[50:45] is why did you put me in a time loop
[50:50] if you read revelations chapter 3
[50:53] somewhere around the 19th verse
[50:55] as a matter of fact you can read the
[50:56] whole chapter it talks about all the
[50:59] seven church ages
[51:00] right and every church age as he
[51:03] addressed the church age
[51:04] he says something to every age and he's
[51:07] only talking to
[51:08] the elect of the age of the or the sons
[51:12] and daughters of that age
[51:14] he says this to every age to him that
[51:17] overcome
[51:20] he says this in every seven church ages
[51:23] because there is nothing
[51:25] for failures there's nothing for
[51:27] quitters
[51:29] it's only for overcomers and he knows
[51:31] that there's going to be overcomers in
[51:33] every age
[51:34] he would not have said it
[51:36] [Applause]
[51:37] and how does he know there's going to be
[51:38] overcomers because he's going to give
[51:40] you what it takes to overcome
[51:44] it's not carnal it's mighty
[51:47] because in this age in this world is it
[51:50] is a world of sin
[51:54] hallelujah it's a word of sin i had a
[51:57] young man visiting us
[51:58] a long long long time back and i was
[52:01] preaching something similar to this
[52:02] thought and he said
[52:05] after church pastor
[52:09] it is impossible for anyone
[52:12] to overcome sin
[52:15] take a moment
[52:20] he said no one can overcome sin
[52:23] everybody sins take a moment
[52:30] he says so i don't see how you can
[52:32] preach that i said first of all is the
[52:33] word
[52:35] amen
[52:40] the bible says we can overcome the world
[52:43] he just born of god to not commit sin
[52:46] now he said yeah yeah i know it says
[52:47] that
[52:48] but that's not what it means i said i
[52:49] know what it means you telling me what
[52:51] it means i'm trying to tell you what it
[52:52] means
[52:54] you're the unbeliever i'm trying to help
[52:55] you boy
[52:58] we had a little talk there but i said
[53:01] god
[53:02] never makes a promise he can't keep
[53:05] we're the ones failing god god is not
[53:07] failing us
[53:08] so in your case you're right but god is
[53:11] going to have a bride
[53:12] that he's going to bring to perfection
[53:16] they will not willfully sin
[53:20] now watch now y'all heard me say that
[53:22] right but the prophet said
[53:25] only a christian can sin i mean commit a
[53:28] sin
[53:33] so how are we going to be made perfect
[53:35] you will never be the word in you is
[53:37] already perfect
[53:39] amen you got the blood in you there's
[53:41] nothing against the blood
[53:43] amen you know why the prophet god had to
[53:45] give the prophet a vision of the bumper
[53:47] around the whole world
[53:49] while he was criticizing the lady at the
[53:51] cafeteria table
[53:53] he said i'm a bumper for her sin what
[53:56] wait a minute you mean she's already
[53:58] forgiven
[54:00] y'all you know that's what god was
[54:01] telling the prophet she's already
[54:03] forgiven
[54:04] i'm a bumper for her sins he said my
[54:06] blood already covers her oh
[54:11] because she had already once given her
[54:12] life to jesus now ain't gonna break that
[54:14] down
[54:17] she just needed somebody to restore such
[54:20] a one
[54:24] isn't god good this quote says
[54:28] okay let me i read i read the quote out
[54:30] of context but
[54:31] we'll do it again this quote says but
[54:33] then eve he's talking about eve and he
[54:35] drops down and says
[54:36] satan had to get to her now you remember
[54:40] he's in a warfare with god y'all need to
[54:42] really get this part
[54:44] your adversary is in a war with god
[54:45] which means he's in a war with you
[54:48] because you're god's sons and daughters
[54:50] as a matter of fact i think he says that
[54:51] in the quote
[54:52] he said remember he's in a warfare with
[54:53] god and men and women is his children
[54:56] children of god so he's in warfare with
[54:58] satan god's in warfare with satan
[55:00] satan's in the warfare with god
[55:02] we're in a war y'all understand this
[55:06] we are in a war don't get comfortable
[55:08] now amen
[55:10] don't let your guards down too much amen
[55:12] cause we're in a war and so he says so
[55:14] now remember
[55:15] satan comes down to use a tactic to try
[55:18] to
[55:19] counteract god's warfare god's warfare
[55:23] god's uh weapon is his word remember
[55:25] that his protection so then the only
[55:27] tactic he could use
[55:29] would be reasoning
[55:34] i told the church back home i said i can
[55:36] prove to you
[55:37] very easily why satan is able to get
[55:40] anyone to walk away from the truth of
[55:43] god
[55:44] it's so easy to prove how he does it
[55:49] it's a tactic
[55:53] he has a real good strategy all he needs
[55:56] their mindset to do is lean
[55:59] over here to e empty
[56:02] there's no more word there there's no
[56:04] more belief coming in
[56:06] there's a blocked channel there the
[56:08] channel is blocked
[56:10] you can't pick up no signals it's a
[56:12] block channel you're sitting there but
[56:14] there is no signals coming through
[56:16] that the channels are blocked you know
[56:18] how the parents have the ability if they
[56:20] want if they have television or devices
[56:22] they can block their children from going
[56:24] to certain places
[56:25] they call the block channel
[56:28] that's how some people come to church
[56:29] they have a block channel
[56:32] gosh god's speaking seven church age
[56:35] uh seven seals and they can't pick up
[56:37] the channel
[56:38] just keep going to four and five and
[56:40] three
[56:42] but the preachers on channel seven they
[56:45] say i wish i could zoom i can't
[56:47] link up they're not trying to link up
[56:51] they're on a different channel
[56:54] and it's blocked
[57:00] amen logical thinking see satan tried to
[57:02] give evil a better way to look at it
[57:04] it wasn't a better way but he was
[57:06] deceiving her to think that it was a
[57:08] better way
[57:12] there was no better way but he was able
[57:13] to convince her that it was
[57:17] this thing that message god told you
[57:20] it's not all the truth there is
[57:24] there's a little more somewhere else
[57:28] now what what's striking is that eve
[57:32] already knew yeah she had truth and it
[57:35] was already a settled truth
[57:38] but he gave her another mindset
[57:42] you see we don't like to use god's
[57:44] weapon
[57:45] on ourselves we start looking for the
[57:47] fault everywhere else
[57:50] that's wrong he said this this ain't
[57:52] right
[57:53] pastor said that that ain't right
[57:56] but if you ever use it on yourself
[58:00] this is the only time when i can preach
[58:02] suicide
[58:03] and agree with it
[58:06] amen use the weapon on yourself and make
[58:09] sure you kill yourself
[58:12] okay i said it make sure you kill
[58:15] yourself with the weapon you know what i
[58:16] mean pastor i'm not i'm not i'm not
[58:18] preaching anything
[58:20] i hope y'all following me cause i'm
[58:22] trying to stay simple tonight
[58:25] use the weapon on yourself
[58:28] so anyhow we're quick to use it on
[58:31] somewhere else y'all get it so the word
[58:33] of god the bible said it's not
[58:34] carnal the weapons of god is not conor
[58:37] he's trying to get you to see
[58:38] these are not physical weapons or
[58:40] natural ideas and things that man are
[58:42] creating bombs and
[58:44] all this this ways of fighting with with
[58:46] carnal weapons
[58:48] god has given us a far mightier weapon
[58:51] than those things right
[58:53] that is true so we have a mighty weapon
[58:56] and god
[58:57] has given it to us to use he uses this
[59:00] weapon to pull us out of the grips of
[59:02] sin
[59:03] unbelief sinful behavior backslidden
[59:06] conditions
[59:07] uncertainty of where we stand he has to
[59:10] pull us out of that
[59:12] because all of us don't take a trip
[59:13] there at some point
[59:17] you see your pastors were standing up
[59:18] here and he was choosing his words
[59:20] carefully
[59:20] how he was talking about where your mask
[59:23] for the next two weeks
[59:25] see because that's wisdom pastors has to
[59:28] have that
[59:28] he could have stood up here and says i
[59:31] don't care what happened
[59:32] don't wear no mask in here this is a
[59:34] faith church
[59:36] and everybody who believed this message
[59:38] got to demonstrate that kind of faith
[59:40] and the church of god saying
[59:45] he could have easily said that and some
[59:47] of you with a stronghold would have said
[59:50] i ain't coming to that service i love
[59:53] you brother jack but you just dismissed
[59:55] me for two weeks
[59:57] [Applause]
[59:59] it's funny but it's the truth
[1:00:01] [Music]
[1:00:05] so pastor has to be wise because we know
[1:00:07] what we're dealing with spirits amen i'm
[1:00:14] going to sit down in a minute but
[1:00:16] it feels all right up here brother james
[1:00:18] so let's look at it now
[1:00:22] satan wants to use
[1:00:25] with uh reasoning he want us to use the
[1:00:27] reasoning with the word of god
[1:00:29] once you start doing that you're going
[1:00:30] to start down yourself out
[1:00:34] this this could be an area of of a
[1:00:36] sinful behavior or sickness in your body
[1:00:38] could be kept
[1:00:39] pretty much any any area but if you get
[1:00:41] you the reasoning with it
[1:00:43] you're reading yourself out of your own
[1:00:44] faith now
[1:00:46] uh god do expect us to believe
[1:00:50] that he can protect us i just read that
[1:00:52] in the quote where the prophet says his
[1:00:53] protection
[1:00:54] so god is protecting us god protects
[1:00:57] that seed in us amen
[1:00:58] so that you cannot be deceived so that
[1:01:02] the devil can't pull you out of the
[1:01:03] faith
[1:01:04] he's protecting you that way with that
[1:01:06] mighty weapon of his word
[1:01:08] you need to protect yourself from a lot
[1:01:11] of other stuff
[1:01:13] for example if i'm going to take a drive
[1:01:16] in a very very very very very dangerous
[1:01:18] neighborhood
[1:01:19] i'm going with protection
[1:01:25] i didn't say what kind but i will be
[1:01:27] protected
[1:01:31] right if i'm gonna uh man brother jack
[1:01:33] had a little laugh about this
[1:01:34] earlier this week we vote for chocolate
[1:01:36] brother go about you know
[1:01:38] when we had to go across seas and things
[1:01:40] and we had to take all them shots and
[1:01:42] and uh they they left both of my arms so
[1:01:46] sore and jack got a little
[1:01:47] sick from it or whatever but we took
[1:01:49] them shots we manned up to it
[1:01:52] we had to it was the only way to travel
[1:01:56] let the man up to that thing and brother
[1:01:58] branham said
[1:02:00] he he got ready to go across seas and
[1:02:02] they told him
[1:02:03] you got to have your shots brother brown
[1:02:05] that's right brother brown said but i
[1:02:06] don't need them
[1:02:09] but they said you got to have them
[1:02:14] i told them i didn't need them but he
[1:02:16] took all five
[1:02:20] it wasn't the lack of faith he had to
[1:02:23] have him
[1:02:25] i liked the little quote where the
[1:02:26] brother said you go to the doctor
[1:02:29] and you're dying say doctor i'm dying
[1:02:32] then the doctor says i got a medicine
[1:02:34] for you
[1:02:35] that will save your life he says if you
[1:02:38] refuse to take the medicine
[1:02:39] it's not the doctor's fault if you die
[1:02:47] now back to what i'm preaching here so a
[1:02:49] stronghold
[1:02:51] has got to be pulled down in the church
[1:02:53] say amen
[1:02:55] and the devil used reasoning and all
[1:02:56] these things to try to to get us to turn
[1:02:59] from the word of god he messes with our
[1:03:02] minds
[1:03:03] because he has access to the mind and we
[1:03:06] know this because we're experienced
[1:03:07] people
[1:03:09] we're we're not new at this we we know
[1:03:11] that the devil had access to our mind
[1:03:12] we've been listening to the message
[1:03:14] preaching the word for for many years
[1:03:15] now most of us is that right
[1:03:18] and so we know that's part of his
[1:03:20] strategy is to use reasoning against us
[1:03:22] but some people still
[1:03:24] don't know how to stop it
[1:03:27] they're not using their weapon
[1:03:31] so he uses this reasoning to challenge
[1:03:33] the word of god and
[1:03:34] its meaning its revelation is that right
[1:03:38] but the truth of god will always destroy
[1:03:40] a stronghold
[1:03:42] see you can't stop sinning on your own
[1:03:47] you not not by your own will
[1:03:50] power it might be successful a little
[1:03:52] bit here and there and in this area in
[1:03:53] that area but somewhere
[1:03:55] he's going to get you
[1:03:58] god didn't design you to do it on your
[1:04:01] own
[1:04:03] he designed you to need him
[1:04:06] prove it the prophet said god had
[1:04:08] attributes on the inside of him
[1:04:11] that he needed to express and only he
[1:04:14] could express it he had to create you so
[1:04:15] he could express them
[1:04:17] so he didn't design you to go through it
[1:04:20] alone because he knew you couldn't do it
[1:04:22] by yourself there's some people in here
[1:04:25] got best friends people that they call
[1:04:27] best friends
[1:04:28] people that they can go to and talk to i
[1:04:30] believe me and jackie is like that we
[1:04:32] can go months without talking but when
[1:04:33] we start talking and be like i've been
[1:04:34] talking with him just yesterday
[1:04:37] we have a connection like we can pick
[1:04:38] right back up that's good
[1:04:40] friendship is that right and that's all
[1:04:42] right you you have that
[1:04:44] amen but even in that
[1:04:47] i might need him he may not be available
[1:04:49] sometimes
[1:04:52] he might need me and i may not be
[1:04:54] available sometimes he may be dependent
[1:04:56] on all of you and some of y'all might
[1:04:58] not be here for him all the time
[1:04:59] but god will he designs you not to go
[1:05:03] through it alone
[1:05:04] let me let y'all in on something when a
[1:05:06] pastor calls a meeting
[1:05:08] and he got 50 people in his church and
[1:05:10] only five show up
[1:05:11] that bothers the pastor he ain't gonna
[1:05:14] tell you all that
[1:05:16] so i'm telling y'all for him i don't
[1:05:19] know if that ever happened here thank
[1:05:20] you brother
[1:05:22] but it does the pastor started wondering
[1:05:23] what's going on because he's human
[1:05:28] but in his prayer and in his expectation
[1:05:30] he saw
[1:05:31] everybody in the church but everybody
[1:05:34] didn't show up
[1:05:35] so he gets up here and put on that real
[1:05:37] face this i'm talking about myself
[1:05:40] and he goes through the emotion and the
[1:05:41] good words and being kind to everybody
[1:05:43] but in his mind he wanna say
[1:05:44] i rebuke them devils holding you back
[1:05:46] from coming to church you hit me on that
[1:05:48] zoom
[1:05:49] you know you should be here god was
[1:05:51] talking to you
[1:05:52] you let the devil keep
[1:06:03] amen we deal with this stuff
[1:06:06] these are strongholds even we have to
[1:06:08] deal with within ourselves but we have
[1:06:10] to turn around and put this weapon on us
[1:06:12] stay humble don't let it bother you
[1:06:17] i actually got the other day i said they
[1:06:18] just told me on monday
[1:06:21] that instead of needing just uh master
[1:06:24] jack instead of just needing
[1:06:26] ninety two hundred dollars and another
[1:06:28] seven thousand dollars for witnessing
[1:06:29] doors
[1:06:30] they just told us we have to put all the
[1:06:33] stuff in the church
[1:06:35] before we pass inspection everything got
[1:06:37] to be done
[1:06:39] we only have two months
[1:06:42] before our extension if our permit time
[1:06:45] is out
[1:06:46] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[1:06:48] of dollars
[1:06:50] i looked at sister pam she looked at me
[1:06:52] i said well god
[1:06:54] god is all right he just made it easier
[1:06:57] now
[1:06:57] i could have said harder because in my
[1:07:00] natural flesh i was looking at
[1:07:02] the pam that's thousands of dollars she
[1:07:04] said that's all right
[1:07:06] it's got to be done she put the weapon
[1:07:10] of god on me quick boy

[1:07:24] see once it hit you you're straightened
[1:07:26] up you know
[1:07:28] you got to use it on yourself tried to
[1:07:31] make me doubt how we gonna do that in
[1:07:32] this
[1:07:33] short period of time and all that i said
[1:07:35] god saw that coming before i did
[1:07:39] amen so i went in brother west coast
[1:07:42] office he was sitting there doing the
[1:07:43] budget and writing checks i got in line
[1:07:46] he said what you doing i said i need to
[1:07:50] i need you to write a check and i told
[1:07:52] him the number he just started laughing
[1:07:53] i said
[1:07:54] no i'm serious but that's when we had
[1:07:58] just found out that right sister fam
[1:08:02] all that faith he preached he's still in
[1:08:04] write me that check brother jackie
[1:08:08] oh my god but we still we still love
[1:08:10] each other though but i was
[1:08:12] sister sister uh uh i'm about to call
[1:08:15] you sister duff
[1:08:16] uh i'm sorry
[1:08:19] sister burst it was coming back to me
[1:08:23] trust god we're believing god we love
[1:08:26] god and we love you all thank you all so
[1:08:28] much
[1:08:28] let me try to finish this sermon i don't
[1:08:30] mean to step out but i've been through a
[1:08:32] lot i'm just rejoicing that i'm able to
[1:08:34] be here amen i'm just happy to be here
[1:08:36] amen but but you know you can't stop the
[1:08:40] nature of sin from pulling you into
[1:08:43] sinful behavior
[1:08:44] it's designed to do that that's what the
[1:08:47] sin nature does
[1:08:49] it causes you to sin singular first
[1:08:53] because it's called the sin nature after
[1:08:55] you start sinning it becomes sins
[1:09:00] it keeps pulling you further and further
[1:09:02] into sinful behavior
[1:09:04] and you don't know it's happening but
[1:09:06] there are strongholds developing in your
[1:09:08] life
[1:09:11] and you're still a good church member
[1:09:13] and that's great there's nothing wrong
[1:09:14] with
[1:09:15] continuing to go to church but it has to
[1:09:16] be identified so
[1:09:18] uh we all know some people like this
[1:09:20] there are people who smoke
[1:09:22] and and people who drink people who
[1:09:25] listen to the world's music
[1:09:27] we all know somebody that do that right
[1:09:29] and and
[1:09:30] we know people that dress themselves in
[1:09:32] decent and in my in modestly is that
[1:09:35] right we know these kinds of people
[1:09:36] we know people that will choose to to go
[1:09:39] to parties of the world
[1:09:41] and different things like that and and
[1:09:43] waste their money
[1:09:45] and destroy their good health
[1:09:47] strongholds make them do it
[1:09:49] we know these kinds of people right now
[1:09:51] we're church-going people so this would
[1:09:53] not really be our practice with our life
[1:09:55] am i right
[1:09:56] these are not things that we would find
[1:09:58] ourselves doing
[1:10:00] but there's another side there are some
[1:10:03] church-going people
[1:10:05] who do smoke a lot of lies
[1:10:10] and drink a lot of deception
[1:10:14] amen and listen to a lot of private
[1:10:16] interpretations
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:21] and they will not dress properly in the
[1:10:23] garment of the promised work
[1:10:25] they refuse to put it on
[1:10:31] oh there there are some like that they
[1:10:34] let the devil plant lies in their spirit
[1:10:36] in their mind that's smoking them
[1:10:38] that's right drinking
[1:10:41] deception false interpretations and
[1:10:44] doctrines
[1:10:48] going places they shouldn't go because
[1:10:50] that's not where the
[1:10:51] the word for the bride is at
[1:10:59] they have developed a stronghold in the
[1:11:01] mind
[1:11:03] and it's sad because like the prophet
[1:11:05] said about eve he said
[1:11:07] eve if she had had only waited
[1:11:11] she would have come together with adam
[1:11:13] but she couldn't wait
[1:11:14] so she did an illegal act and took on
[1:11:17] another man's seed
[1:11:20] because she couldn't wait
[1:11:24] he deformed her mind that was the first
[1:11:27] thing
[1:11:29] happened to her was in her mind she
[1:11:32] deformed her thinking
[1:11:34] that's how he formed her by what he put
[1:11:36] in her mind
[1:11:39] and he said if she had only waited
[1:11:42] for the right way and he said the second
[1:11:46] eve
[1:11:46] did the same thing now he's not talking
[1:11:50] about the elect of the age
[1:11:52] he's talking about the gentile churches
[1:11:55] of this age
[1:11:58] he even mentioned the third e but i'm
[1:12:00] talking about the gentile churches of
[1:12:01] this age
[1:12:02] what he says and he quoted the elect
[1:12:05] gets raptured
[1:12:07] the foolish virgin must go through the
[1:12:08] tribulation period and be judged with
[1:12:10] the sinners
[1:12:13] that's a failed bride that's a failed
[1:12:15] church because she really is part of it
[1:12:20] but she took another seat
[1:12:24] i think people are fighting this because
[1:12:27] this seed is coming from the groom
[1:12:32] it's a pure seed
[1:12:35] only the elect gonna take this in
[1:12:40] amen she won't be like the first eve
[1:12:42] she'll keep herself she'll wait
[1:12:45] hold herself in place no matter how
[1:12:48] tempting it gets how hard it gets
[1:12:50] she'll keep herself right
[1:12:53] there's a war going on
[1:12:56] let me try to close this thing up i'm
[1:12:58] sorry i kind of got lost for time here
[1:13:02] but as we look at it these you know you
[1:13:05] know there's this flip side of the
[1:13:07] natural you look at it in the spiritual
[1:13:09] and you can see some some types and
[1:13:10] shadows there and i like something
[1:13:12] random said when you see your shadow you
[1:13:14] can't deny it
[1:13:15] that there's an original following
[1:13:19] amen he said that black woman
[1:13:22] that was standing at the gate waiting on
[1:13:24] brother brown waiting on
[1:13:26] him to get there he says
[1:13:30] when he got there she said good morning
[1:13:31] to him he said
[1:13:34] she saw her type because she told him
[1:13:37] what it was
[1:13:39] she said like the woman in the bible
[1:13:43] was waiting for that elijah to come
[1:13:47] he said once she saw her type god had to
[1:13:49] send the original i
[1:13:50] don't bother you can't get something
[1:13:54] you're not looking for you
[1:13:55] have to if there's a shadow there has to
[1:13:57] be a person following it there has to be
[1:13:59] an original coming with it
[1:14:02] amen i'm talking spiritual
[1:14:05] thank you jesus
[1:14:09] that's good right there my god forgive
[1:14:13] me for being slow
[1:14:16] you know when i when i first come off
[1:14:18] the medicine and everything i
[1:14:19] i wanted to get back to normal so fast i
[1:14:22] ran out that door grabbed my fishing
[1:14:24] boat
[1:14:24] you couldn't stop me i was at any lake i
[1:14:26] saw ready to jump into
[1:14:28] my boat and just drive it my body said
[1:14:30] slow down
[1:14:33] i started having pain fail so you're all
[1:14:34] right i said yeah i'm fine
[1:14:36] i didn't want to tell her what was going
[1:14:37] on but i i was in some pain
[1:14:40] and and she i said but i want to eat
[1:14:42] whatever i want she said no take it easy
[1:14:44] don't eat stuff right away i said it's
[1:14:47] been so
[1:14:47] long since i tasted real food let me
[1:14:50] tell y'all
[1:14:51] to tell on her while i was laying in the
[1:14:53] hospital
[1:14:54] sister pam obeyed the doctor so she they
[1:14:56] brought me some broth
[1:14:58] looked like it was made from the shadow
[1:14:59] of a chicken as brother brown would say
[1:15:01] it
[1:15:03] didn't have a taste and she like you got
[1:15:04] to eat that i said
[1:15:07] i thought this woman loved me
[1:15:12] but she had tiptoed out and brought me
[1:15:14] some old broth
[1:15:16] but it had enough of that thicker sauce
[1:15:18] in it
[1:15:19] i said thank you lord i ate it like
[1:15:22] it was the last shop i was like thank
[1:15:24] you god
[1:15:26] thank you lord but when i got out and
[1:15:28] got a little clearance to go ahead and
[1:15:29] eat
[1:15:30] you know be careful what you eat i said
[1:15:31] all right she said i'm serious don't eat
[1:15:33] too much
[1:15:33] i went drove 35 miles from the house
[1:15:37] and i found the restaurant it said 20
[1:15:39] piece
[1:15:40] buffalo wing with hiberna sauce
[1:15:45] and a large fry for 19.99
[1:15:48] i got to the one that said please give
[1:15:50] me that please
[1:15:52] she said you want something else you got
[1:15:54] i said what else can i get she said you
[1:15:56] got beans and i said give me a large
[1:15:58] beans and rice
[1:15:59] i just did it i sit in that car i looked
[1:16:02] at that food
[1:16:02] i parked over there right in the little
[1:16:05] uh parking lot i said
[1:16:07] thank you jesus
[1:16:10] bless this food that's i'm about to
[1:16:13] receive
[1:16:15] i cut it short i sit there and ate 20
[1:16:19] buffalo wings
[1:16:22] ate some of the fries and the red beans
[1:16:25] and rice
[1:16:28] i drunk up my car and proceeded to go
[1:16:29] back to the house pam said you're right
[1:16:31] i said i'm fine
[1:16:32] by the time i got to the house
[1:16:35] my body began to tell me you're
[1:16:38] preaching you should have better wisdom
[1:16:40] than this
[1:16:42] you should know not to do that said pam
[1:16:46] i just ate 20 wings i said i meant so
[1:16:50] much
[1:16:50] i'm in so much pain oh my god
[1:16:54] i'm sorry y'all ain't trying to be funny
[1:16:56] but
[1:16:58] that's it she said why did you do that
[1:17:00] you deserve what you deserve what you're
[1:17:02] getting
[1:17:06] too much she understood why i did it but
[1:17:09] you know i wasn't supposed to do it
[1:17:11] amen i did it again a week later but let
[1:17:14] me get back in my sermon here
[1:17:18] it's a stronghold
[1:17:24] i needed to be delivered from a
[1:17:26] stronghold
[1:17:28] but now we all deal with strongholds and
[1:17:32] it's a grip on you and sometimes you
[1:17:34] don't even know it's a stronghold in
[1:17:35] your life
[1:17:37] you're just going about your daily tasks
[1:17:39] and things like that
[1:17:40] and and i'll try to wrap this up i i
[1:17:42] know i'm being a bit lithium
[1:17:43] and i do apologize for that but but you
[1:17:45] don't know for example
[1:17:47] sometimes it's normal for the wife to
[1:17:50] make a certain comment to the husband
[1:17:52] that keeps repeatedly doing something
[1:17:53] she had asked him not to do
[1:17:56] you know she might just say to him uh
[1:17:58] how many times
[1:17:59] am i going to tell you to pick up these
[1:18:01] clothes i'm not your maid
[1:18:03] something like that i'm using an example
[1:18:05] now she does that regularly because he
[1:18:07] does his behavior regularly right
[1:18:09] but after a while this arguing becomes a
[1:18:12] stronghold
[1:18:15] because it's going to go from why you
[1:18:16] didn't pick up your clothes to
[1:18:18] why you didn't do this and why you keep
[1:18:21] doing that
[1:18:23] and after a while temple will breeze
[1:18:24] temper and he's going to fire back
[1:18:26] and no one is using the weapon right
[1:18:28] right
[1:18:30] i've used the weapon on sister pam
[1:18:32] before
[1:18:33] just to gain leverage in our
[1:18:35] conversation
[1:18:38] and she would sit there quietly i said
[1:18:40] and that's right
[1:18:42] i know i'm right she'll wait because
[1:18:45] women are small they don't forget they
[1:18:47] just wait for the right time to fire
[1:18:49] back
[1:18:51] i thought i'd be to warn something until
[1:18:53] it comes back around
[1:18:54] and when i talk about she hit me hard
[1:18:57] she gets me good and she do it with
[1:19:01] love that's what's that's what make it
[1:19:03] hurts even worse
[1:19:07] but i thank god for her approach because
[1:19:09] she knows how to
[1:19:11] fire a weapon hit the target but not
[1:19:13] kill
[1:19:14] the intended target
[1:19:18] but it has helped me over the years to
[1:19:20] grow pastor jack
[1:19:21] to be a better husband and all of that
[1:19:23] and hit me to see that sometimes i do
[1:19:25] talk too much this tongue can be a
[1:19:27] stronghold
[1:19:30] oh it can be a stronghold and it takes
[1:19:32] god to pull it down
[1:19:34] some people don't know when to stop
[1:19:36] talking
[1:19:38] getting mad and they just get to go and
[1:19:39] you're like why don't
[1:19:41] they they say women talk a lot no women
[1:19:43] don't talk a lot women are just full of
[1:19:45] information
[1:19:46] that's a nice way of saying they talk
[1:19:48] too much
[1:19:50] this brother oh my god
[1:19:54] i'm sorry sisters
[1:19:59] but i used to say that to my wife honey
[1:20:03] come on that's just too much information
[1:20:06] but when i dissected down every bit of
[1:20:08] it i needed to hear
[1:20:10] god was allowing her to deposit some
[1:20:13] word in me
[1:20:14] that would help me to see myself
[1:20:18] and and i have to take it see if you
[1:20:20] don't take the word
[1:20:21] you're going to continue to be in a
[1:20:22] stronghold battle with yourself
[1:20:26] so i i just hope a little bit of this
[1:20:28] resonates with you all tonight
[1:20:30] amen is that all right and that's why i
[1:20:32] kind of find a closing spot here
[1:20:34] um god is so good to us it'll give us a
[1:20:37] little this little message
[1:20:38] that we have from his prophet let me see
[1:20:41] if i can get this back on read this last
[1:20:42] quote to you i think it'll be a blessing
[1:20:44] to you i'll
[1:20:45] chop this message up here but it's all
[1:20:48] good
[1:20:48] everybody all right i'm about to wrap
[1:20:51] this thing up
[1:20:52] uh so anyhow it takes god to get on the
[1:20:56] inside of us
[1:20:57] and pull down these holes that are
[1:20:59] holding on to us
[1:21:01] and i'm going to give you a little
[1:21:03] example real quick
[1:21:04] of of a stronghold it's a true story too
[1:21:07] i'll share with you in just a moment
[1:21:08] because strongholds if once they get in
[1:21:11] your mind they work their way into your
[1:21:12] heart and they become an emotional
[1:21:13] stronghold
[1:21:15] and you see people that get so caught up
[1:21:17] in their emotions over some of the
[1:21:18] smallest things
[1:21:19] they just get so caught up it didn't
[1:21:22] start there that's where it growed to
[1:21:24] that kep that thing kept holding them it
[1:21:26] becomes part of their emotions
[1:21:28] and now it's in them as a relationship
[1:21:30] they're connected with it
[1:21:32] amen and and god is warning us and paul
[1:21:35] is
[1:21:35] trying to tell us how we can be free
[1:21:37] from these strongholds
[1:21:39] and it don't just stop with paul i got a
[1:21:41] old testament scripture here i'll share
[1:21:43] with you in a moment but
[1:21:44] but the the devil likes to use these
[1:21:46] demonic influences
[1:21:48] to to bring an affliction and an
[1:21:50] oppression on us
[1:21:52] because the prophet said uh christians
[1:21:54] are not possessed with the devil
[1:21:56] but they can be oppressed by the devil
[1:21:59] and afflicted
[1:22:01] by demon spirits and you look at both
[1:22:04] words they're almost saying you can be
[1:22:05] possessed
[1:22:06] but these are demons that will torment
[1:22:08] you and come after you and bother you
[1:22:10] all the time
[1:22:10] they follow you around waiting on
[1:22:13] opportunities
[1:22:14] to get on you every single day
[1:22:19] they do this of course this is this is
[1:22:23] proven in the old testament
[1:22:25] the bible says that when the devil came
[1:22:27] to job
[1:22:28] he said i've been traveling to and fro
[1:22:33] he's looking for someone to oppress and
[1:22:36] afflict and he found the believer
[1:22:39] and so god said you consider my servant
[1:22:41] job yes i want to afflict him and
[1:22:42] oppress him but he couldn't possess it
[1:22:46] because if he could have possessed me to
[1:22:47] kill him
[1:22:50] so the oppression in the affliction is
[1:22:52] possible for him to do to all of us
[1:22:54] because we're all god's sons and
[1:22:55] daughters and the church said
[1:22:57] so he's always trying to do this that
[1:22:59] was a young man i'll tell you this story
[1:23:01] and try to shoot through it
[1:23:02] uh where's your clock at brother oh it's
[1:23:04] 8 54. i see it i'll stop here in a
[1:23:06] minute
[1:23:07] this young man he doubted god
[1:23:11] he doubted the existence of god
[1:23:14] and he didn't know better he was a young
[1:23:16] man he grew up
[1:23:18] in a household they didn't pray they
[1:23:19] didn't acknowledge god at all
[1:23:22] he heard his dad say a few times ain't
[1:23:24] no god
[1:23:25] i'm christian people they're just making
[1:23:26] all that up so his belief was
[1:23:28] he didn't really believe that there was
[1:23:29] a god so he had a good friend of his
[1:23:32] that
[1:23:32] invited him to go to a camp meeting it
[1:23:35] was a christian camp meeting
[1:23:36] and so he decided well i'm going i'll go
[1:23:38] because he's a really good friend of his
[1:23:40] he decided he'd go and he said you know
[1:23:42] just come you know we're going to do
[1:23:43] some things that i think you'll like
[1:23:45] so he went and they flew on a plane to
[1:23:47] get to the place where everybody was
[1:23:49] gathering for this camp meeting
[1:23:50] and so when they got there yes
[1:23:53] just like he thought there were some
[1:23:55] things he did that he really enjoyed
[1:23:57] he was a young adult and they did a lot
[1:24:00] of things that was
[1:24:01] was catering to the to the young adult
[1:24:03] age people there
[1:24:04] and he was just having a great time but
[1:24:06] then it come to the worship service
[1:24:08] and when he went in the worship service
[1:24:10] he said in the back and he heard the
[1:24:11] minister say
[1:24:12] jesus took two fish
[1:24:16] five loaves of bread and he fed five
[1:24:18] thousand
[1:24:20] that thing stayed in a young man's mind
[1:24:23] so after church the minister went over
[1:24:25] to him and asked him
[1:24:26] did he have any questions about the
[1:24:28] sermon anything he wanted to say
[1:24:30] he said i don't believe jesus took two
[1:24:33] fish and five loaves of bread
[1:24:35] and fed five thousand and he stood there
[1:24:38] for a moment
[1:24:39] as if something happened to him and he
[1:24:41] turned and walked away he never said
[1:24:42] another word to the minister next day he
[1:24:45] packed up he left got to the airport got
[1:24:47] on the plane when he got on the plane
[1:24:49] he had this very bad headache
[1:24:53] in his head it was so bad that the more
[1:24:55] the plane
[1:24:56] flew and vibrated it got worse and worse
[1:24:59] and worse
[1:25:02] it got so bad he began to squench and he
[1:25:05] was
[1:25:05] didn't know what to do so god
[1:25:10] when he said that his mind went back to
[1:25:11] what he said to the minister
[1:25:13] i don't believe jesus took two fish
[1:25:16] follows the bread fit five thousand hold
[1:25:19] up let me see
[1:25:20] god i repent i do believe
[1:25:24] jesus took two fish and five loaves of
[1:25:25] bread and fed five thousand as soon as
[1:25:27] he said it
[1:25:28] the pain left him
[1:25:33] he had took on a spirit of unbelief that
[1:25:36] was so bad
[1:25:38] that in front of a preacher he denied
[1:25:42] the word of god and this spirit was on
[1:25:45] him but he what he didn't know is when
[1:25:46] he got on
[1:25:47] when he was leaving the minister got
[1:25:49] together with some of the church members
[1:25:50] and say
[1:25:51] i feel that they pray for that young man
[1:25:53] because right in front of me
[1:25:54] a demon spirit possessed him
[1:25:59] this is a true story another pastor told
[1:26:01] it
[1:26:03] and that young man was telling everybody
[1:26:05] he saw on that plane jesus took two fish
[1:26:08] and five loaves of bread and he fed five
[1:26:11] thousand
[1:26:14] what unbelief was gone he now believed
[1:26:16] the word
[1:26:18] it was a stronghold in him he was
[1:26:19] determined not to believe
[1:26:21] but thank god for the word it pulled
[1:26:24] down the stronghold
[1:26:25] but it taught him a lesson amen you got
[1:26:28] to know when you're listening to the
[1:26:30] word of god don't let nobody influence
[1:26:32] you
[1:26:32] if you think that devil even try to make
[1:26:34] you doubt that's the devil
[1:26:36] amen cast him down hey man let me wrap
[1:26:39] this thing up everybody all right
[1:26:41] amen the spirit of unbelief is a very
[1:26:45] powerful thing
[1:26:46] in some people's lives and as believers
[1:26:48] we don't think we have
[1:26:50] nothing to do with that but but see we
[1:26:52] have to really be careful
[1:26:53] because unbelief follows everybody it's
[1:26:56] a demon spirit
[1:26:57] it's actually sin but it's also a demon
[1:27:00] spirit
[1:27:01] it's an unclean spirit in the church say
[1:27:02] amen it gets a tight grip on some people
[1:27:05] and
[1:27:06] no matter how much you try to show them
[1:27:07] the way i tell them the truth
[1:27:10] they will not they will not come to it
[1:27:13] they can't come out of it see they have
[1:27:14] a blocked channel
[1:27:17] see that's the first thing we're going
[1:27:18] to have block channel second thing is
[1:27:19] they're under the
[1:27:20] influence of an unclean spirit
[1:27:23] because no one in their righteous mind
[1:27:26] would reject the truth
[1:27:28] especially proclaiming to be children of
[1:27:30] god
[1:27:32] everybody follow that now before i close
[1:27:34] i was going to talk about so i think
[1:27:36] i'll skip this i wanted something i want
[1:27:37] to get to let me read this quote to you
[1:27:39] here the conflict between god and satan
[1:27:42] because it's a war we're in right
[1:27:43] see now what is the word of god the word
[1:27:45] of god is god
[1:27:47] himself now if you let that go over your
[1:27:49] head too quickly
[1:27:50] you'll think you caught it but the
[1:27:51] prophet god is trying to show us
[1:27:53] something the word of god
[1:27:55] is god himself this is the authority of
[1:27:57] god it's the power of god is in his word
[1:28:02] it was only intended for believers to
[1:28:05] handle it
[1:28:07] not everybody can handle this word
[1:28:09] correctly
[1:28:11] so he says it's god himself so god gave
[1:28:14] the believers
[1:28:14] himself amen he says it's god himself
[1:28:18] he gave the believers himself to attack
[1:28:20] the enemy by
[1:28:22] in other words he's the father and the
[1:28:24] word is god
[1:28:25] then the word is our father we're born
[1:28:26] by the word and he's standing in the
[1:28:28] uh and he's standing in the forefront
[1:28:30] for his children amen there you are
[1:28:32] he's standing out there for his children
[1:28:34] see i like the picture like this
[1:28:37] god never lost the battle i heard y'all
[1:28:40] singing here up in miami jack got up
[1:28:41] there
[1:28:42] was singing this is how i fight my
[1:28:44] battle and jack picked up the bible
[1:28:46] he was adamant about pushing the bible
[1:28:48] out look at that demonstration
[1:28:50] this is how i fight my battle this is
[1:28:54] how we fight our battle
[1:28:56] but you ain't gonna always have this
[1:28:57] with you
[1:29:00] okay then he's preaching now if it ain't
[1:29:03] in you
[1:29:04] that song ain't gonna help you at all
[1:29:09] you can't shout and get this and be
[1:29:12] victorious you
[1:29:12] this these strongholds don't go away
[1:29:14] just because you sing a good song
[1:29:18] they don't go away just because you
[1:29:19] heard a good sermon i just told you what
[1:29:21] the
[1:29:21] young man said at the church service to
[1:29:23] his pastor
[1:29:25] these strongholds need something more
[1:29:27] more powerful
[1:29:28] now it's not that the word is not that
[1:29:30] the preacher wasn't preaching one
[1:29:31] powerful no
[1:29:32] it needed a lived
[1:29:36] voice it was looking for
[1:29:38] somebody who had the word with skin on
[1:29:41] it
[1:29:44] it was looking for a person that was
[1:29:47] real
[1:29:47] it wasn't just a talk offense but it was
[1:29:49] a manifestation
[1:29:51] right before him he was looking for
[1:29:52] something real
[1:29:55] and when he stepped in now you say well
[1:29:57] wasn't the pastor real yet but those are
[1:29:59] church services
[1:30:00] everybody sitting there has to be sort
[1:30:01] of respectful at that moment in time
[1:30:03] this man was possessed with many spirits
[1:30:06] he had many strongholds
[1:30:08] who would have ever thought but seeing a
[1:30:10] man living clean and pure to the glory
[1:30:12] of god
[1:30:13] would be the the delivering power that
[1:30:16] called him
[1:30:17] out of that sinful condition god used it
[1:30:19] that way he said yeah he heard the
[1:30:21] preaching
[1:30:21] he heard all the singing yeah he heard
[1:30:24] it
[1:30:24] but i'm gonna put a real living example
[1:30:26] in front of him i let him criticize it
[1:30:28] i'm gonna let him tell him it's not the
[1:30:30] right message it's not the right voice
[1:30:33] i found errors in it didn't move it
[1:30:37] all right amen don't sound right
[1:30:41] prophecies were wrong one correct wasn't
[1:30:44] there when the cloud showed up
[1:30:45] all kinds of accusations didn't move it
[1:30:50] finally had to give in that's why we
[1:30:52] ain't moved yet that's why your pastor's
[1:30:54] still standing here preaching it
[1:30:56] that's why he's still keeping you up on
[1:30:57] that we're not moving
[1:30:59] amen those are taking scales away from
[1:31:02] this here
[1:31:02] we know this is it amen we were
[1:31:05] delivered from the strongholds they're
[1:31:07] still
[1:31:07] battling the strongholds amen
[1:31:11] so if you don't move the strongholds in
[1:31:12] them will finally be delivered from them
[1:31:14] if they are seed
[1:31:16] don't let them move you don't be afraid
[1:31:19] it is jesus
[1:31:20] be not afraid amen there you are he's
[1:31:23] standing out there for his children what
[1:31:25] are we scared about
[1:31:28] don't you know fear is a stronghold
[1:31:29] don't be scared
[1:31:31] it'll get on you i heard a young lady
[1:31:34] giving a testimony
[1:31:36] of of of something that was it wasn't
[1:31:39] positive it was kind of negative and she
[1:31:41] was trying to say why
[1:31:42] she had problems still believing the
[1:31:44] message and i don't like to really get
[1:31:46] up and talk about this but i thought
[1:31:48] there was a unique little testimony she
[1:31:49] was sharing
[1:31:50] and one thing she said is
[1:31:54] she says i i don't mean to be negative
[1:31:57] toward it but god i just couldn't see it
[1:32:00] being
[1:32:01] altogether the truth and i just listened
[1:32:02] to her he said
[1:32:04] the reason i couldn't believe it anymore
[1:32:07] is because
[1:32:08] i did some research once she said she
[1:32:10] did some research
[1:32:11] i knew what happened to her same thing
[1:32:14] happened to eve
[1:32:17] her research reasoned her her true faith
[1:32:19] away right out of her
[1:32:20] out of her heart that's why the problem
[1:32:23] said if you look for something
[1:32:24] criticized
[1:32:26] we can all do that i can stand up here
[1:32:29] and give y'all eight
[1:32:30] straight and i ain't exaggerating eight
[1:32:32] straight hours of negative things i read
[1:32:34] on the internet
[1:32:34] about this message you'll get tired of
[1:32:37] me you'll be like jackie stop him from
[1:32:38] preaching
[1:32:39] he's killing my belief system i know all
[1:32:42] that stuff's out there
[1:32:44] read every article everything out there
[1:32:46] i've seen it heard and read it
[1:32:50] and it still didn't move me you know why
[1:32:53] didn't move me
[1:32:54] because when it's revealed to you you
[1:32:56] can't be moved it's when you don't have
[1:32:58] a real revelation that you can be moved
[1:33:01] [Applause]
[1:33:05] you can't be guessing at this it's
[1:33:06] either right or wrong it ain't both
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:11] but when you don't have if god have not
[1:33:13] given to you
[1:33:15] okay well put it to you like he told
[1:33:16] jeremiah jackson they could put this on
[1:33:18] the board i'll sit down cause i ain't
[1:33:19] gonna get to give me jeremiah chapter
[1:33:22] one
[1:33:23] all right now watch i'm gonna be doing
[1:33:25] i'm done i gotta even finish this
[1:33:26] because it's too much i want oil to read
[1:33:28] this with me and i'll sit down
[1:33:30] i'll read that last quote and sit down
[1:33:31] he says here don't have it turn to it in
[1:33:34] the bible
[1:33:35] jeremiah chapter one just start at the
[1:33:38] well
[1:33:38] let's start at the ninth verse
[1:33:42] let's do the ninth verse
[1:33:45] he says then the lord put forth his hand
[1:33:48] and touch
[1:33:49] what my mouth and the lord said unto me
[1:33:52] behold
[1:33:53] i have put my in your
[1:33:56] so god put a weapon in the prophet's
[1:33:59] mouth
[1:34:00] and when he put it in his mouth this is
[1:34:02] what he said to do with it watch watch
[1:34:03] what the word gonna do give me verse 10.
[1:34:05] i'm going to preach it and sit down see
[1:34:06] i have this day set thee over the nation
[1:34:09] over the kingdom
[1:34:10] to root out all right see when paul got
[1:34:12] it paul said that whether our warfare
[1:34:14] are not
[1:34:14] caught by the mighty through god for the
[1:34:15] pulling down of the strongholds
[1:34:17] jeremiah said to root out see when you
[1:34:20] pull something out by the root
[1:34:21] you kill it completely so the word the
[1:34:24] weapon in the prophet's mouth
[1:34:26] was to root out all the unbelief kill
[1:34:29] all of the other influences of system
[1:34:31] beliefs that were out there
[1:34:33] it had to be that way because if you
[1:34:35] hold on to any of it any bit of it
[1:34:37] it'll still cause weeds to grow
[1:34:41] then he says to root out and to pull
[1:34:44] down paul caught it right right paul
[1:34:47] knew what he was preaching
[1:34:49] and to pull down what and to destroy
[1:34:53] watch what god do after he get all that
[1:34:54] out of you and to throw down
[1:34:57] then what he's gonna do to build it back
[1:34:59] up and plant the right thing in your
[1:35:00] heart
[1:35:01] can't put the right thing in to get the
[1:35:03] wrong thing out
[1:35:05] and some people never let it all come
[1:35:07] out
[1:35:09] and while you're trying to get the right
[1:35:10] stuff in it some stuff should need to be
[1:35:12] rooted out strongholds that you're still
[1:35:15] holding on to
[1:35:17] beliefs that you're still holding on to
[1:35:20] and god said
[1:35:21] i gave jeremiah word go find it i said
[1:35:24] where is it at
[1:35:25] and the holy ghost led me there i put my
[1:35:28] word
[1:35:29] in your mouth jeremiah was speaking with
[1:35:32] a weapon
[1:35:33] they couldn't handle it god said it's
[1:35:35] going to root out some stuff
[1:35:37] pull down some strongholds destroy
[1:35:41] that sin nature so when the prophet came
[1:35:44] on the scene
[1:35:45] they didn't understand what god put in
[1:35:47] his mouth
[1:35:48] it was tearing them down rooting up some
[1:35:51] stuff then god says
[1:35:52] i'm gonna have you climb seven steps to
[1:35:54] perfection and i'mma build you up into a
[1:35:56] statue of a perfect man
[1:35:57] and that really threw some people off
[1:36:00] but it's still right here in the bible
[1:36:02] brother branham just said it differently
[1:36:05] root out a total separation from all
[1:36:08] unbelief
[1:36:08] you read the messages if you're not read
[1:36:10] that root out
[1:36:12] pull down what the systems
[1:36:14] indoctrination of other belief systems
[1:36:16] put in
[1:36:17] all of us if we went to them churches
[1:36:22] false son holy ghost speaking of tongue
[1:36:24] evidence pull it down
[1:36:27] get that out of you i'm gonna put the
[1:36:30] i'm gonna put i'm gonna put something in
[1:36:31] here
[1:36:32] build it up real good people see you
[1:36:35] they're gonna see a
[1:36:36] walking sermon
[1:36:40] what do you think the man seen in the
[1:36:41] testimony brother venom gay he saw a
[1:36:43] walking sermon
[1:36:46] amen it was so powerful the man he said
[1:36:48] nothing to him he was making fun of the
[1:36:50] man
[1:36:52] man they said the word sister burroughs
[1:36:53] but he was listening to the sermon the
[1:36:55] whole time
[1:36:56] every step he took amen holy holy
[1:36:59] holy unto the lord holy steps man
[1:37:02] watched holy steps so much he became
[1:37:03] holy himself
[1:37:06] i know this work but can the bride that
[1:37:09] say that abroad today
[1:37:10] live this out or you're sitting there
[1:37:12] thinking i got stronghold
[1:37:14] oh no i'm just i don't know if you're
[1:37:17] thinking like that
[1:37:21] you hinder yourself you'll never grow
[1:37:26] and you'll sit you'll come for years in
[1:37:28] the church
[1:37:29] i have these strongholds and there's a
[1:37:30] lot of them i was going to cover this
[1:37:32] personal that we have in our personal
[1:37:33] lives
[1:37:35] it covers everything the things that we
[1:37:37] do the secret sins the hitting sins the
[1:37:39] stuff
[1:37:39] that we don't want nobody to know
[1:37:43] that we hope nobody ever finds out about
[1:37:46] strongholds
[1:37:49] it's got to be pulled down brother only
[1:37:52] one weapon is capable of doing that
[1:37:54] now you know brother branham said that
[1:37:55] the holy ghost was a weapon
[1:37:58] he even said your prayer is a weapon
[1:38:02] but as he concluded in 1962
[1:38:05] uh put on the whole arm of god he said
[1:38:08] the word it's a powerful weapon
[1:38:10] the reason he anchored it on that
[1:38:12] because when you hear the word preach it
[1:38:14] right
[1:38:16] i don't care what kind of thing is
[1:38:17] holding you down
[1:38:19] that word comes and the holy spirit
[1:38:21] follows the word and it comes right
[1:38:22] where you are in that stronghold
[1:38:24] condition hidden
[1:38:25] don't want nobody to know but the word
[1:38:27] finds you sitting right there
[1:38:29] and you didn't tell nobody but all of a
[1:38:31] sudden god said this is
[1:38:32] your day of deliverance and you are
[1:38:35] coming out of it
[1:38:36] that's why no way give me birth okay
[1:38:38] don't putting that nails up that'll be
[1:38:40] up here too long
[1:38:41] but god knows every single one of us and
[1:38:43] what our stronghold is
[1:38:45] your block channels and all these things
[1:38:47] that that we deviate from
[1:38:49] yeah and it may not be anyone in here
[1:38:51] but i still have to say it
[1:38:54] because the longer we're in this thing
[1:38:56] the more of a battle we're going to have
[1:38:57] to fight
[1:39:00] because you're going to get challenged
[1:39:01] every step of the way would you stand on
[1:39:02] your feet with me i'm going to close see
[1:39:03] if i read conflict part
[1:39:05] the second quote from conflict or the
[1:39:08] last quote
[1:39:09] so the infinite god is going to choose
[1:39:10] for his army the best weapon
[1:39:12] that could be given and he choose it and
[1:39:15] it was his word
[1:39:16] god gave his army the best equipment
[1:39:19] that could ever
[1:39:21] that it could ever use and ever could
[1:39:23] use and would never have to be
[1:39:26] changed it's his word and he said well
[1:39:29] we hear that all the time the word the
[1:39:30] word the word the word the word the word
[1:39:32] but in this it's not just word only
[1:39:36] god is pouring out the holy ghost in the
[1:39:38] end time on this bride
[1:39:40] on the believers of this day that's a
[1:39:42] spirit come to make this word come to
[1:39:44] life
[1:39:45] you can keep this word on your tongue
[1:39:48] you can meditate on this day and night
[1:39:50] you can use this in any situation any
[1:39:52] situation
[1:39:56] i don't care what it is you can use it
[1:39:58] but you got to know how to use and
[1:39:59] don't be afraid when you use it
[1:40:04] stand there our testimony i
[1:40:07] when we speak it we don't even doubt
[1:40:09] y'all remember
[1:40:10] when the walls fell down the front walls
[1:40:13] of the building we were building it up
[1:40:14] and the walls fell down i walked out
[1:40:17] there a tornado came through there and
[1:40:19] one of the members called me and said
[1:40:20] brother on the wood
[1:40:21] oh the walls fell down now when she
[1:40:23] first told me i had to i had to rebuke
[1:40:26] this sister because
[1:40:27] she almost gave me a heart attack she
[1:40:28] said all the walls were down but when i
[1:40:30] got there was just the front walls i
[1:40:32] said sister please give the messages
[1:40:34] by phone correctly you you
[1:40:37] you don't know what i mean i was so
[1:40:39] shook
[1:40:41] but when i got there said lord please
[1:40:42] don't let all the walls be down
[1:40:44] that was over about 8 000 bricks
[1:40:47] if that whole thing would have fell down
[1:40:49] and how we got there was the front wall
[1:40:51] so i got up there
[1:40:52] i walked on top of them like i was
[1:40:54] walking over to mount carmel somewhere
[1:40:56] and i stood there i said it shall go
[1:40:59] back up
[1:41:00] and god told me when you sent out the
[1:41:03] scripture
[1:41:05] in ezekiel you said you were going to
[1:41:07] rebuild the wall
[1:41:10] that was broken down
[1:41:14] you spoke it and it manifested
[1:41:19] you sent out the wrong scripture
[1:41:26] this is a true story in the right sister
[1:41:27] pam i had to tell the church
[1:41:30] i did say we are going to rebuild the
[1:41:32] wall
[1:41:33] that was broken down
[1:41:37] now if god can honor that much of me
[1:41:39] speaking the word
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:44] and listen in 24 hours someone sent me
[1:41:47] the money
[1:41:48] and we built the wall right back up amen
[1:41:50] so i said now that scripture is
[1:41:51] fulfilled what do you want me to do next
[1:41:54] the in saint mark 16 the prophecy i
[1:41:56] didn't understand it so i couldn't
[1:41:57] preach it
[1:41:59] it'll be as you say i think mark 11.
[1:42:02] right
[1:42:02] he said he'd understand so i'd never
[1:42:04] preached on it because i didn't fully
[1:42:05] understand it
[1:42:06] while he was out hunting now this is
[1:42:07] what he said
[1:42:09] he's out hunting he hadn't shot a
[1:42:11] squirrel didn't even see one
[1:42:12] and god told him well you're
[1:42:16] hunting you have need of game
[1:42:19] it's and he told him what the scripture
[1:42:21] and saint mark was all about
[1:42:22] he said but i never understood that so
[1:42:24] god says telling me keep trying to
[1:42:27] make you see it
[1:42:30] what do you want you have neither game
[1:42:33] what do you want
[1:42:34] now look at the significance of this
[1:42:36] it'll be like you say
[1:42:38] what do you want the first one god never
[1:42:40] told him where to say it
[1:42:43] he was teaching the prophet that we have
[1:42:46] the power
[1:42:47] and the authority in us the spoken word
[1:42:49] ability to speak the word
[1:42:53] brother branham said this is not just
[1:42:54] for me he said this is for all who
[1:42:56] believe
[1:42:59] it's in the word brothers and sisters
[1:43:00] but there's a spirit that we already
[1:43:02] have received if you receive the spirit
[1:43:03] that's here to make it work but if you
[1:43:05] have fear you'll fail
[1:43:07] and the prophet of god said you can't
[1:43:09] you can't pretend faith
[1:43:10] because your subconscious will tell
[1:43:12] whether you really have it or not
[1:43:13] because your subconscious is where you
[1:43:15] truly believe
[1:43:19] amen and so he pushed the prophet beyond
[1:43:24] his fears and he finally caught the
[1:43:26] revelation not all of his fears he
[1:43:28] wasn't fearing god but what he didn't
[1:43:29] know about that
[1:43:30] verse and there it was he'll do the same
[1:43:33] thing for you and i
[1:43:34] in any situation can you just believe
[1:43:37] that tonight
[1:43:38] that our god can't fail his word is
[1:43:40] perfect
[1:43:41] he taught the prophet that this is wrote
[1:43:43] around testimony i'm just trying to keep
[1:43:44] it in the proper way he said it
[1:43:46] but when he caught that you couldn't
[1:43:47] stop him that was the second speaking of
[1:43:50] squirrels
[1:43:51] y'all know the story right god is good
[1:43:54] pray with me so i'm sorry so infinite
[1:43:56] god is going to choose his army the best
[1:43:58] weapon that he could be given
[1:43:59] and he chose it and it was his word
[1:44:02] about yes with me father we thank you
[1:44:04] for the word tonight and i know this
[1:44:06] sermon is much longer than i intended to
[1:44:07] be
[1:44:08] and we just caught this inspiration to
[1:44:10] come here tonight we just thank you god
[1:44:13] that our strongholds can be pulled down
[1:44:16] we are in a stronghold battle all of us
[1:44:19] we deal with these issues every day and
[1:44:21] all of these examples that we could have
[1:44:22] said
[1:44:23] i believe the church sees it this is a
[1:44:24] mature audience mostly adults here not
[1:44:27] many children
[1:44:28] and god you know why you had it said
[1:44:31] you know why you wanted these things
[1:44:33] spoken you've helped me through my life
[1:44:36] i pray your help our brothers and
[1:44:37] sisters that are sitting here tonight
[1:44:39] and outstanding
[1:44:40] they have any strongholds in their lives
[1:44:44] that they will know that it can be
[1:44:45] pulled down
[1:44:47] the weapon on themselves go to the
[1:44:50] pastor
[1:44:50] if they don't know the right way the
[1:44:52] right approach to it because we can't
[1:44:54] hide these things we
[1:44:55] want to be right we want to be free
[1:45:02] you don't want to give the devil
[1:45:05] any access into the holy temple of god
[1:45:09] not on purpose if you have done that and
[1:45:12] if there are some things in your life i
[1:45:13] want you to listen
[1:45:15] you can go free from those things right
[1:45:16] now
[1:45:18] you don't have to leave here even if it

[1:45:24] i've been dealing with there's things i
[1:45:26] i'm i'm dealing with right now

[1:45:36] i keep second guessing my faith and

[1:45:49] [Music]
[1:45:50] these things are so real this is for the
[1:45:54] elect of this age
[1:45:56] i don't mean for that to sound
[1:45:57] prejudiced against any other churches
[1:45:58] it's not intended for that but
[1:46:00] god knew who would and who would not
[1:46:03] thank god that he chose you
[1:46:06] lord jesus keep the spirit and true

[1:47:32] as he told jeremiah
[1:47:34] god don't send a word just to play and
[1:47:36] tickle our ears
[1:47:37] it's designed to have an effect on the

[1:48:40] god bless you come on pastor jay
[1:48:43] that's a little song that says let me

[1:48:49] sing that i just love the lord this song
[1:48:50] says
[1:48:52] jesus you are the love of my life
[1:48:59] and jesus you are the hope that i
[1:49:04] cling to
[1:49:07] you mean more than this
[1:49:11] whole world too man and he says
[1:49:14] i wouldn't trade you for silver
[1:49:19] ago
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:22] i wouldn't trade you for rich's
[1:49:26] son
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:37] and i just love that because i know now
[1:49:39] how important it is how important jesus
[1:49:42] is to me it didn't take my experience a
[1:49:44] few months ago but it certainly helped
[1:49:47] i love him too much to fail him now i
[1:49:50] love him too much to break my vow
[1:49:51] i promise you lord that i'm gonna hold
[1:49:54] on and make it
[1:49:56] somehow and i know how the overcoming
[1:49:58] power
[1:49:59] of this word doubles
[1:50:10] praise the lord appreciate
[1:50:14] brother joe tonight just sharing his
[1:50:17] heart with us
[1:50:18] and um i don't think god has things to
[1:50:22] be said
[1:50:24] on a whim i think god has
[1:50:27] he's perfect in all his ways and he
[1:50:29] knows exactly what needs to be said
[1:50:31] and when it needs to be said you know he
[1:50:34] knows
[1:50:35] who needs to hear it and um
[1:50:38] i just love the way that the holy spirit
[1:50:39] just tells you know we we can come to
[1:50:41] church we can
[1:50:42] and he said smile with our eyes because
[1:50:44] we got the mask on our face
[1:50:46] right but uh but god knows the things
[1:50:49] that we're dealing with as we leave the
[1:50:51] building
[1:50:52] and god wants to set us free from every
[1:50:55] stronghold
[1:50:56] uh i think brother branham talked about
[1:50:58] how he went to the
[1:50:59] cincinnati zoo and it just just troubled
[1:51:02] him
[1:51:03] uh to see this eagle just caged up
[1:51:07] and all often times the kate the eagle
[1:51:10] would
[1:51:10] try to get out of the cage and lift so
[1:51:12] high and it hit the top of the cage and
[1:51:13] have to come back down
[1:51:15] and this is what happens to god's eagles
[1:51:17] they get to a certain spot they
[1:51:19] get so high and then the enemy just
[1:51:21] brings them right back down
[1:51:23] but as an eagle that's not your position
[1:51:26] is to be down your position is to be up
[1:51:29] and flying above the problem
[1:51:31] flying above the stronghold and and i
[1:51:33] believe the power of the word of god
[1:51:35] that has been given to us tonight is
[1:51:37] enough to overcome every devil
[1:51:39] if we'll just use it the way god has
[1:51:43] intended for us to use it i thought
[1:51:45] about the woman at the well and she had
[1:51:48] so many strongholds in her life but when
[1:51:50] she heard christ with the word
[1:51:52] she was set free from every stronghold
[1:51:58] i found out this week that sometimes
[1:52:01] when
[1:52:02] uh god is speaking it's not just for
[1:52:04] people that are here in this building
[1:52:06] it's people that's watching online and
[1:52:09] uh
[1:52:09] we don't know who and where but i know
[1:52:11] this word has power to even go through
[1:52:13] the airwaves
[1:52:16] and set captures free
[1:52:20] you've been in this place long enough
[1:52:26] your mountain sign has been

[1:55:59] father we heard the word of god tonight
[1:56:03] and we know the word has power
[1:56:07] to change any of our circumstances and
[1:56:09] situations no matter what it is that
[1:56:11] we've been facing and no matter how long
[1:56:14] we've been facing it i believe the holy
[1:56:17] spirit is here to pull down every
[1:56:18] stronghold of the enemy
[1:56:20] and it only comes through the power of
[1:56:22] the word
[1:56:24] god that's what we have to use to
[1:56:25] overcome when when jesus was
[1:56:28] tempted uh god their amount temptation
[1:56:31] he used the power of the word no
[1:56:33] supernatural strength it kept using
[1:56:37] it is written it is written it is
[1:56:39] written god i pray that somebody tonight
