heart if you want to lift your hand and make it known to him amen the scripture said that he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions and so we believe that by the power of the word that your needs can be met tonight so let's just ask him to bless us tonight and just to let his presence be active in the service lord we come before your throne of grace and mercy

asking lord tonight for a special grace and a special mercy lord may your presence be in every square inch of this room tonight lord i i ask lord that your holy spirit would just be lord just be welcome to be in our midst tonight lord if there be any spirit that would try to hinder the moving of the holy ghost we want to drive it out in the name of jesus christ and lord we declare victory over this service we declare that god will have his way in the service tonight and we want to put the devil on notice tonight lord that we're not giving him any inch of ground we're not giving him our service but we're here to let you have your way tonight lord i pray that you'd be lord not just a spectator but may you be a participator lord in the service may every word be anointed by the spirit of god lord and may you meet each and every need according to your riches and glory when we leave this place we'll be sure to give you the praise the glory and the honor we love you and we thank you we ask for your help now lord in jesus name we humbly pray and the church said amen and amen god we should bless you tonight if you have your bibles we'll go straight to the scripture we'll be reading out of the book of first kings the 19th chapter i would like to say it's certainly an honor and privilege to be here with you and to be here with your midweek service i tell you about went crazy just being here and not a whole lot to do until wednesday night and so uh i know we got a time limit but we got a lot of things on our heart and so you just pull you pull fast we'll preach fast and we'll go home fast i mean many preachers say that and they they lie about it but i'm not gonna try and lie amen we sure love and appreciate you and we just say god bless you the book of first corinthians the 19th chapter we'll begin reading at the 15th verse the bible would say in the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazel to be king over syria and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shafat of abel mahala shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of hazel shall jesus slay and him that escaped her from the sword of jesus so elijah's lay and yet i have seven yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed them so he departed this and found elisha a son of shafat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he that half the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him and he left the ox and i want you to notice the scripture after that elijah laid the mantle upon elisha notice what it did he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave them to the people and they did eat and then he arose and went after elijah and ministered unto him we pray that god will bless the reading of his word as you can be seated just for a few minutes tonight and by the help of god i want to speak to you on the subject of being trained by the prophet amen being trained by the prophet the scripture i'm the book of first corinthians the 11th chapter uh the first verse paul was speaking here under inspiration of the holy ghost would say these words he said be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ and if you were to look at that scripture in an intellectual standpoint you would say my paul is wanting us to emulate the things that he's doing and to do the things that paul does but but paul is not necessarily saying follow me and my humanity but he's saying you follow me as i follow after god now and we're not here to follow the exact life of paul and because he he was there persecuting the christians was he not and so we're not here to follow after the letter of what paul did but but paul is saying in the scripture be you followers of me even as i also am of christ and the book of daniel the second chapter the 21st verse daniel would say some words here that's a very good instruction he would say now and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding so daniel here in the bible is saying that it's god that raises up our leaders and us god that removes our leaders this god that raises up our kings and us god that removes our kings and and looking at this thought here i've always found it amazing how that god god will get a man in his hands and he'll raise him up and use him for an example is that right amen now god has always used the instrumentality of man we don't understand it many times but god he wanted to use man to be a leader to be a guider god has used the instrumentality of a man amen and god amen many of us we could think back in our lives that god would raise somebody to a certain level and they would be like a mentor to us or a guide to us and and daniel here is saying god he puts these men in these positions to be a leader to mentor us and our walk with god and that and that's what amen that's what paul is saying in corinthians be followers of me so so we find that god will use an individual sometimes amen to lead and to guide you amen to a certain place and the message investments the prophet of god would say it like this he says now god he uses an individual now two men will never see the same thing alike so god can only get one person in his hand and then through here like moses and through daniel and through the different prophets so we see that god will use an individual to lead and to guide his children amen for time saying my you could go through many places in the scripture the prophet moses prophet joshua many different prophets uh we could get into this but for time's sake we won't but i want you to see that god will use a man to be a mentor and to be a leader and to be a guider amen and never put that away from your mind that god isn't using somebody to lead you and to guide you but it's actually the the inspiration of the holy spirit that will use a man to lead you and god you know i'll say it like this if it's god doing it he'll always lead you back to the word amen if it's god doing the leading he'll lead you back to the word and and looking at this thought here tonight on being trained by the prophet i uh there's just so much inspiration here when you look at the life of elisha and i just to build a foundation in this i like what happened amen when elijah went to elisha and he laid his mantle upon him the bible says he returned back from him took a yoke of oxen and slew them boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave them to the people and they didn't eat that scripture as i studied these things began to jump out at me i thought my why did elisha do what he did after elijah laid that mantle upon him and amen further study and basically what had happened amen as that mantle got laid upon elisha and he realized he realized his new call now brother branham would get in a certain area in this amen he would preach on i believe a reaction to reaction or action to reaction and things upon that and he said see amen even in the wise man when it came down to jesus what they did showed what christ meant to them amen the gifts even the gifts that they gave to christ showed what christ meant to them amen they gave the gold the frankincense to myrrh and it showed what it meant and amen that's exactly what's happening with elisha as he's getting ready to be taught and mentored by amen elijah's the prophet's ministry amen i just love what he did amen he went he took his livelihood and then he killed the oxen killed the instruments of the oxen amen that for the longest time elisha had his own way of thinking elisha did what he wanted to do did he not amon elisha lived after what he wanted to do amen after his own desire but a time would come that he would encounter the prophet of god amen and the mantle would be laid upon elisha and then he had to choose what am i going to do am i going to leave the am i going to leave my work am i going to leave my farm life and follow after the prophet or will i not amen i love what he did church he he not only left it but he actually burned up everything signifying if i'm going to go be taught by a prophet and be taught by his ministry i'm going to burn all my former thinking i'm going to burn what i think about it i'm going to burn my old light because i'm not going to go back to it i know when i go out to be taught by the prophet's ministry i am not going back amen i'm going to go all the way amen i believe i'm looking at some elisha's here tonight i mean we're going to burn all the things that's going to hinder us and we're going to follow the prophet's ministry brother amen not just part of the way but all the way and what you do with this word it signifies what you think about this word amen what you do with it brother joy signifies what you think about it amen what you remember the action that you do towards the word i tell you what hey when you find somebody that's sold out to this message brother this message begins to be preached you'll find them on their feet you'll find them amen and now listen i'm not here begging for your amens but i'm telling you this how you react to it tells what you think about it amen how you react to it shows what you think about it amen your church attendance i'm just going to preach your church attendance tell us what you think about it i remember i believe i'm looking at a class of people brother that we have given our everything to we've given our all to it but we have sold out lock stock and barrel amen and we have crucified our formal thank you we have crucified our ideas we have crucified what we wanted to do and we have said god we're going to follow the prophet's ministry and where he goes with the word is where we will go with the word hallelujah if he takes us to serpent seed we're going there if he takes us to the godhead we're going there under the prophet's ministry is what we're being trained under hallelujah amen for the longest time elisha lived his own life i'll say it this way amen here he is he encounters the prophet by the jack the prophet takes his mantle lays it upon him amen i just i like to identify myself from the scripture i think of being elijah what it felt like brother solomon amen felt that road draped over him something felt a little bit different brother he realized his new call he realized his life was getting ready to change oh brother amen to the bride of jesus christ we felt that stimulation or revelation of the word and ever since we felt it brother ever since we got that stimulation amount of being a seed of god amen being identified by the message brother and we got that stimulation of the revelation we didn't understand it all no we didn't but one thing for sure something felt different ever since we heard it i said something felt different ever since we heard it we're not able to get away from it we're not able to run far enough away from it but we're hooked on it brother amen we're addicted to it we're tied to it oh god some of y'all know what i'm talking about first time you heard the message a seat on you aiming some light of the world was shining on it i mean you didn't understand it all you didn't know what was happening but one thing you knew for sure something's different i don't understand all of this but i believe it and i'm going all the way with it hallelujah now one theologian would say it this way he said now elijah found elisha draped his cloak around his shoulders recognizing he had been chosen to finish the job begun by elijah now elisha immediately slaughtered his ox and cooked the meat over the fires of his plowing equipment and elisha gave the meat to his fellow family and he set out to follow elijah to become his attendant i mean the message of inspiration brother man talks about it here says now notice amen elijah he knew he was standing before god therefore he was fearless and he got ready to put his robe upon elisha he says now elisha cut loose every shoreline amen i want you to notice even when he encountered the prophet and encountered his ministry amen elisha cut loose every shoreline everything he killed the ox he burnt the sacrifice and he separated from everything not some things not a couple of things but elisha separated from everything to follow god and he says that's the way we've got to do it that's the only way there is a coming to god another place he says it this way after the great prophet was taken elisha took elijah's place he said now i can imagine the type of being a witness when they started off he seen elijah he threw his mantle over on him and blessed him he killed the ox made the sacrifice showing that all the things of the world was dead to him he says now that's the way you come to god is you kill everything behind you you burn all the bridges don't lay up the bottle till tomorrow don't lay up the bottle so you'll find it tomorrow don't lay up the other thing tomorrow he says but get rid of the thing and burn it up a man be a real witness he says come out brother barefooted that's the way excuse those expressions that's the only way i know to say it i mean the prophet's giving a good teaching here he's saying if you're going to follow after god i mean you either follow him all the way or don't follow none of the way amen listen church if we're going to follow this message let me just give you a little command in this if you're going to follow this thing brother please do it all the way amen follow after god all the way if you're going to come to church amen go all the way give it everything you got brother amen and cut loose anything that can be a hindrance to it amen and give everything you've got amen that's exactly what elisha was testifying amen if this thing is worth following it is worth going all the way amen now studying these things you find the call of elisha begins in first kings chapter 19. amen and after you read first kings chapter 19 brother there's chapter after chapter you don't even find the name of elisha i thought my i wonder how come you don't even know where elisha is and you don't even amen his name's not in the scripture all the way until second kings chapter two i mean i'm again thinking on that brother jack i thought my where is elisha i wonder where he is and then it hit me all of a sudden i thought i know where elisha is he is wherever elijah is amen i i know where elijah is i mean i know where elisha is he's well amen every place that elijah went as well elisha went also now i say this i guarantee he learned a lot of things seeing how the prophet of god handles situations amen seeing what he said i mean maybe amen hear some of the sermon that said amen elijah the great prophet preached i say this i'm sure he learned a whole lot amen and historians believe it to be brother joy about six years that elisha followed elijah i thought my god to be right there right behind elijah for six years i mean imagine the encouragement that he got now i thought well you know i imagine the battles that he had did he understand everything as a man i'm sure he didn't did he know everything i mean did he know where elijah was going to take him to i'm sure he didn't understand that i mean i say this maybe he got discouraged in the way sometimes following after elijah's ministry let's just get real for a minute and preach on this and maybe he got discouraged by the troy in the way maybe he saw his faults and failures and thought my i ain't even worthy to follow elijah and his ministry i remember maybe he had enough good enough preaching from elijah to say elisha i don't care what comes and what goes god has got to work for you and you follow me elisha i don't care what happens to you i don't care if you fail god i don't care if you make a mistake amen elisha even if you get a little ways behind me and you do follow elisha as long as you get back up as long as you get back up elisha and as a man i'm sure he had battles he had struggles he had disappointments he had misunderstandings but the prophet elijah probably told him no matter what happens oh boy don't you give up don't you give in don't you stop but you keep on following me for god has a double portion waiting on you come on little bride don't stop fighting don't stop battle for god has got a new jerusalem for you hallelujah amen don't stop fighting do we get discouraged yes do we have battles sure we do but get back up get back up amen i'm sure elisha had battles come on he was a man but he kept on going he got back up he kept on pressing he kept on fighting hallelujah i'm sure he heard a lot of powerful sermons thank you sir amen elijah had been in the way six years everybody didn't stop going hey man he didn't know why the rapture hadn't happened yet but he didn't stop amen he couldn't explain everything amen but he didn't stop i mean if he could hold out long enough there'd be a double portion waiting on him amen there'd be a double portion waiting on him hallelujah amen i'm sure he had battles amen but he didn't stop going amen he was determined brother after this new commission after this new call everywhere he goes amen everywhere the prophet goes i'm going to follow all the places he goes that's where i'm going to go amen church maybe i could say it this way elijah didn't have no quit in him he didn't have no get up in him i i'm no give up him i mean maybe he'd been taught that way i mean maybe the prophet's ministry told him no matter what give up amen church i just want to put the devil on notice i mean because he comes to us does he not he battles with us does he not amen he sits on his shoulders and says you ain't going to make it i mean never been there but i want to put the devil on notice devil and then we do not know the sound retreat we don't know the sound turned back i remember the troy we don't know i know this song turned back but but in fact let me say it this way amen as elijah but he burned up his formal life he burned up his own way of living because maybe he knew oh brother maybe he knew when the going got hard that i would go back to my own life maybe he knew in humanity oh maybe he knew in humanity that if i get weak following the prophet's ministry if i hear something i don't understand and i want to go back i mean so what i'll do i make it to where i got no way to go back so i'll burn up everything so even when i'm weak i still can't go back even when i'm low i still can't go back because the consuming fire of god has burned up my old thanking he's burned up my own life and i believe i'm looking at some elisha's amen y'all didn't just lay up the bottle but you let the fire of god destroy the bottle y'all didn't just lay up the sin but you let the fire of god consume the sin amen i just want to let you know tonight that the fire of god is still a consuming fire but if you get near the fire of god but it'll consume things like you've never thought it would it's still a consuming fire i like what i heard one time there was a i mean there was a boy you know how you got the army amen they'll go out and they'll have the trumpet player send them out in front of the army i mean he'll be tooting the horn and playing the song keep on going aiming a song of charge keep on battling keep on pressing amen and i mean the story went as the champion the captain of the army he said boy i want you to listen the battle's getting really hot amen we might lose so so what i need you to do is i need you to play the song on your i horn retreat the boy kept on playing the victory song kept on playing the charge song kept on playing the march song about that the battle kept on going and sure enough they ended up winning the battle i mean they ended up winning the war amen the captain infuriated came to the boy said boy the battle was hot we barely made it out of that one how come you didn't play the song retreat and as that's what sir when i was learning music they never taught me the song [Applause] but solomon why are we still here we don't know the song retreat but jack why are you still here they didn't teach you the song betrayed well solomon why are you still running with it because my prophet did not teach me give up he didn't teach me turn back but he said draw your sword and when the battle gets hot keep on fighting and keep on slaying every devil hallelujah by the way i'm just going to get ahead of myself might as well but let me say this our elijah prophet he did not train us how to get defeated he didn't train us how to be a barely make it at church he did not train us to be a defeated church but the prophet elijah in our generation he was training a bride with the word to go up not to go down to have the victory not to have defeat that's what he's trained us for [Music] hallelujah amen i begin to think on this amen why didn't elisha even follow elijah in the first place good question what was he doing i mean why was he submitting himself under the mentorship of a prophet why was he being the protege of a prophet amen what's going on why why is he doing what he's doing but why is he following this prophet's ministry amen so they're coming here to a scene amen in the scripture in second kings the second chapter amen so uh amen elijah comes to this point with elisha he's following him amen so elijah thought well you know what i'll do is i'll give elijah a little test i mean i'll give him a little test to see where he's standing at the bible says in second kings two and one it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha terry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and even as i so liveth i will not leave thee amen i will not leave thee so they went down the vessel amen and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elijah said unto him noah how that the lord will take away thy master from the head today and he said yeah i know what hold ye your peace amen this actually happens three times in the scripture as the lordly amen amen elijah here is telling him i've got to go to such place stay back i've got to go to such place stay back and it happens three places in the scripture i mean every single time elijah would do that his same response was as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee amen so they came to jericho amen what what a response to have amen no matter what amen now now it showed it showed the attitude of elisha here again we find the heart and the attitude of elisha he said elijah i'm not staying right here i'm going where you're going i'm not staying here i'm going where you're going amen our elijah would pick it up he said you see what he was doing i'm not staying here at sanctify amen justification i'm not staying here justification but i'm going up to sanctification will you just stay right here i'm not staying at sanctification i'm going on to the baptism of the holy ghost will you just stay back here no i'm going all the way hallelujah and the elijah in our generation he said don't you stop amen adjust justification and don't you stop just that sanctification but go all the way to the baptism of the holy ghost and go beyond the motion let me say this church of the living god i have been taught by a prophet's ministry amen to go beyond justification to go beyond sanctification to go beyond the motion to go beyond sensation but to go to a true word experience with the living god hallelujah brother he taught that a true word experience was possible so we'll receive it we'll receive what he taught amen nobody he was testing him will you go all the way will you keep going amen god commissioned moses i remember him talks about that scenery there he said i can think of all elijah i mean elisha throwed his or elijah throwed his man upon him said come follow me amen and he goes on amen the old prophet went with the young went out there to the school of the prophets luther's sacrification or our wesley saying occasion through the justification he says and elisha or elijah came and said you better turn back and but as your soul lives i will not turn back he was going to stay with him amen and the prophet will cover this in many different places he said you see amen he had the attitude of i'm going all the way i mean he had the attitude of i'm not stopping short but if god has more for me i mean if god has more for me to get i'm going to go get what he has for me i mean i begin to think on those scripts i'm in the scriptures how elijah was telling him to stay back and i thought you know i wonder why brother troy that that elisha would stand there and say you stay back here i thought you know maybe he was just testing to see where he stood and i thought it paralleled so beautifully with jesus in the scripture you say how so even because jesus when he came to the multitude he was there preaching and then what did he say he was going to see where they stood with them he was going to see us they would go all the way with them so it gave them a real hard teaching that they didn't understand [Laughter] i and my father won amen unless you drink my blood unless you eat my flesh you don't have any part with me i mean the word was seeing where they stood amen they said we can't go where he's going we don't understand this this is too hard we're going to have to go back so the bible records that a multitude turned and left and then he turned to peter turned to the disciples and said what about you guys you're gonna leave two and brother they had heard the message that he preached they had heard the revelation that he preached did they understand it no they didn't they know all about it no but one thing for sure one thing for sure brother when they heard him preach when they heard him teach they said lord where will we go where will we run to for you and you alone you're the only one that has words of eternal life hallelujah we've listened to other preachers we've listened to other men but there ain't none of them that's been able to open the blinded eyes there ain't been none of them that's been able to raise the dead there ain't been none of them that had the power that your words have so they said we're going all the way amen we're going to go where you go you're the only one that has words of life eternal so we're going with you do we understand what you said no we don't and but eventually the spirit of god would come back down after he was lifted on the cross and that same spirit would lead and guide them unto all truth and later bring them the revelation of the word hallelujah so you see there was a multitude that wasn't willing to go all the way but there was a few i said we're going all the way we're going where he goes hallelujah amen we're going where he goes and brother ram says this in the master separation relief he says ahab see he was a borderline believer just a fellow that believed enough to make him miserable my did you ever see people like that well well they have a conception they like to go to church and do right and they feel well maybe it'll make them a better social person in their social lives maybe for the sake of their children that they think they ought to maybe belong to a church he says why isn't that the most miserable person i know if i tell you he says the best thing i mean the best thing is to cut loose on shorelines and latch out into the deep or don't go at all he says just simply stay home or either go all the way for christ he says god wants somebody that'll really go all the way and give all you god soul body and spirit to the service of the lord amen all through the message you'll find this amen go all the way with god amen that's exactly what elisha was taught to do is to go all the way amen another prophet in the bible by the name of amen of joshua he was trained by the prophet moses amen now now elijah's here he had been trained what six years amen here we come to another scene and joshua amen is supposed to continue the work and continue the work of moses he had been trained 40 years i mean you find this in the scripture in the book of numbers the lord saying unto moses take thee joshua the son of nine a man in whom is the spirit lay your hand upon them and set them before eliza the priest before all the congregation and give him charge in their sight amen i won't read all the scripture but here even we're finding the call of joshua amen now he had been actually reading the scriptures very powerful amen read the life of joshua amen in exodus 33 and 11 the bible talks about joshua here that had been trained and mentored under moses the bible says the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaking unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle i mean a couple of historians will read it this way they said wherever moses's tent was was where joshua's tent was amen wherever moses was was where joshua was and wherever that prophet was amen joshua was nearby amen being taught and being mentored under the ministry of moses aiming to pick up where moses left off is that right amen hallelujah abraham talks about it in the spoken word he says notice how god did not move israel until his own appointed time he says now this is going to mean something joshua waited for that time now no matter how many people might have said now god gave us the land he gave us the promise now let's go up and take it he said well they might have said joshua you lost your commission you all washed up why are you not doing something like you used to but he was waiting for that thus saith the lord in a moment to find the will of god and god sent the prophet that knew the promise of god and he was going to wait for that promise amen and when the time had come god gave it to joshua who stayed with him by the word he could not trust others but he could trust him now brother i'm saying here he couldn't trust others but he could trust joshua and the reason he could trust joshua with his commission is because he had been taught by the prophet moses amen to continue on among the work that moses would leave amen he had been taught he had been mentored and to carry on the work amen that moses had started with the children of israel amen now i want you to notice joshua amen joshua's training mother troy i mean he knew the whole entire time i'm not being trained for a picnic but i'm being trained for a war i mean i'm not being trained just to take it easy but i'm being trained so that when moses is dead and he's not here anymore i'm going to pick up where moses leaves off amen now listen church joshua knew that he wasn't trained just to sit there he wasn't trained just to sit there and let moses do all the preaching let moses do all the praying let moses do all the casting out of devils amen he knew he was being trained to work he was being trained for battle he was being trained for a war amen hallelujah i mean what about it that angel came down amen immediately brother that angel came down i didn't put his hand on his sword and what'd he say are you forced or are you against us and it was the captain of the host of the lord emma see church he was ready for battle because the prophet had taught him at any time be ready for war this ain't a picnic joshua this is a battle this ain't a picnic this is a war i mean that's exactly what joshua knew even now the time had come amen that joshua amen he'd been through all the training amen and then joshua 1 the bible says moses my servant is now dead so now josh was like well moses ain't here no more moses can't preach no more you ain't here moses can't leave no more he ain't here so joshua i like this the time had come for joshua to pick up where moses left off so he took the responsibility aiming to finish the work to keep on preaching to keep on battling he said well what'd he do preacher this is what he did he kept leading and kept guiding the children of israel but he had been prepared for that moment he had been taught for that moment he had been trained for war amen and we find there they are in one of the greatest battles brother sister they're here in the heat of the battle and joshua stands here joshua stands here in the heat of the battle amen and the and the people that are fighting is getting ready to win the battle so here he has been trained for this moment and he sees the sun amen sitting up there and he knows brother troy that in any moment if that sun goes down they're going to win this battle if that sun goes down they're going to defeat us and they're going to win this battle but he said you know what i've been trained for such a time as this i have been mentored for such a time as this i mean you know what he did he got out his phone moses moses moses couldn't do it he was dead deacon deacon deacon where are you at where you at deacon wasn't there i mean preacher preacher preacher where are you out i need you i need you to pray deacon wasn't there they said you know what i had been trained oh god i have been trained so what did he do he stood there as the seed of abraham as the son of god that had been prepared for war and the sun was there and he said son you stand there over the hill of gibeon and moon over the hill of agilent and has stood there brother he had been taught for it and let me say this the bride of jesus christ we have been taught for battle we have been taught for war and when the need is there we say devil you stay in your place you can't take another step devil you stay in your corner you can't take another step we have been trained for such a time as this god i'm i'm not ready to blow up on this i mean listen church he didn't have to call brother jack he had been trained himself he didn't have to call the deacon church i'm trying to help you tonight the oldest to the youngest person in here amen you have been trained by a prophet you have been trained by a prophet amen you don't have to cause somebody else to pray through for you but you can pray to yourself you know i have to call somebody else to draw the sword and to get the devil out of your house but i believe i'm looking at young people i'm looking at signs i'm looking at daughters that brother the devil literally shakes in his boots when you realize who you are and you realize you've been trained for it oh come on church we've been trained for this moment i mean we've been trained for this hour amen the prophet of god would stand there and tell that dream amen he said there the brother was had that dream that the devil come to him was saying boo boo boo and here he is going down in the corner down in the corner down in the corner amen kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller now listen church elijah tells stories for reasons and when the prophet's telling a story for a reason he ain't saying it just to say it he said but you know what that man he said there was in the dream and i and something in me began to change and so what i did is i said boo back and then he started getting smaller he said what was the prophet doing the prophet was trying to tell you your enemy the prophet was training you to tell you your enemy is only as scary as what you let him be he's only as big as what you let him be the prophet was saying it's time that we start saying boo back oh yeah hey when the prophet was teaching us it's time that we stop letting them get us in a little corner but let's stand up by sons and daughters of god and say devil don't boo you you get down where you belong [Music] we've been trained for it hallelujah we've been trained for it amen he would tell the stories he'd tell the scriptures i mean all of it was to train a bride to dress her with the word that's exactly what it is and church we have been underneath this training but the time has come let's start using what we've been trained for i mean i'll tell you i i'm not trying to beat you up on this but you have some people i mean they'll come up and be prayed for i've got nothing against that i mean we believe in praying for people let's say brother the devil's been telling me this or brother the devil's been telling me that he's been he's been running his way in my family amen and he does that if you let him i mean that's a ministry of the gospel i've been trained to cast that spirit off and to tell them as a son or daughter of god listen you've been trained better than that you don't have to let the amen you don't have to let the devil run your household you don't have to let them sit on your shoulder and whisper in your ear and when you don't have to have anything to do with him hallelujah i'm in church we have been trained for this we have been trained for war we have been trained for battle hallelujah amen stood there and told the son to stand still he said why'd he do it he was trained for it and you know and the beautiful part in this amen you find joshua and caleb was two out of the original the original generation they were the only two that went into the promised land there was millions bro i mean i mean hundreds and hundreds of people amen and just two people was the only ones that went into the promised land he said why was it only two i even brought because they'd been trained for it they hadn't been taught that that promised land is theirs they had been taught not to look to reasoning they had been taught don't look to the giants looked to the promise i mean they had been taught better than that and they knew better amen no matter if there was giants no matter if there was problems no matter if there was a battle in it they knew that land was theirs amen no matter what and the church of the living god we know that the promised land is ours we know that the promises are ours amen no matter what devil stands in our way between us and the promise we know that the promise is ours it's the giants they're sure they are it's the battles they're sure they are hallelujah but as caleb stood at the mountain he said give me my mountain amen give me my mountain you say why did he do it preacher because he was trained for it he was trained i aiming to inherit his promise oh brother we are trained to inherit our promise and we ought to stand as caleb of old and say god give me my mountain hallelujah and back to elijah and elisha was there trained him and to do what the prophet did i mean you said preacher what what do you mean by that that's what i mean by it i'm in the six years that elisha had been trained and mentored been guided been leaded by a prophet he said what was happening he was being shaped and being honed he was being prepared so so so that when elijah was ready to go up and the spirit of elijah was ready to come down he was cut and fit he was cut and fit to handle power is that right now we know when our elijah taught us that power without character is satanic so that's why he was being trained let me just say it this way when it was time for elijah to leave amen well there's so much in this it's so amazing i remember but when elijah's getting ready to leave he turns to elisha and says what will you asking me and what he replied said i asked that i would have your spirit in a double portion amen what was elijah's response you have asked for a hard thing it took you off into another area i thought mom maybe he'd been taught to ask god for big things hallelujah i mean maybe he'd been taught by a prophet ask god for big things hallelujah so he went ahead and asked for a hard thing might as well so he asked for it he said well if you see me when i leave then it'll be what you've asked for amen the church is such a beautiful picture in the bible even the chariot of fire whips down out of the heavens picks elijah up carries them off amen elisha sees that man on circling back down to him he said well islam did it fit him and if it fit him perfectly i mean he said why did it fit him because he'd been trained for it he'd been mentored for it but he had been shaped for it i mean so when the mantle came upon him but he had been trained so long that it fit just perfectly he said brother solomon what are you saying in this this is what i'm saying hey when the word of god has been training abroad it's been shaping a bride it's been holding your bride brother amen so that third pulled power amen that's here to operate but the only way it's going to operate is in that training and that mentorship amen we're not just going to be out here speaking a cadillac into existence is that right god ain't giving us that power we're not speaking a new house into existence come on but we've been mentored and been shaped amen god has amen he's cut off the surplus he's trained us and mentored us so when the need arises we've been trained to operate under it even when the need is there we've been mentored we've been and we've been we've been equipped to operate under the promises of god i ran the prophet stood there and taught it there so beautifully he said there you'll be i mean brother my crops is burning up i have a need for rain so i say i give you your reign in the name of jesus christ you say preacher that's beyond the reach no it's not it's actually it's actually right here in your reach this is not beyond the church this is for the church hallelujah hey when the devil wants to make it beyond us but i say it's for us he wants to put in the future but i say it's for right now hallelujah i'm not and i love this i mean after elijah died and the works didn't stop amen after elijah was off the scene and the works didn't stop but but see this church amen he had been trained all of this time not to sit there and say elijah mighty fine preaching mighty fine miracles mighty fine signs and elijah here i'll tell you what you're just preaching so good we're not even going to preach no more we're going to play the tapes i'm going to go on record that's not what elijah taught come on i ain't attacking nobody but it's the spirit that's not what elijah taught we've been trained by prophet we know better hey we've been trained by prophet we know better hallelujah amen he he stood there and you know what i think you know he all the ministry was it was in elijah all the casting out of devils was in elijah all the miracles the signs and wonders and elijah that's not what the prophet taught haman church i'm just going to go on record and say this there ain't no one-man ministry amen this ain't some one-person ministry i'm just going to cut loose and preach on this for a minute i mean a lot of people like to put it up in brother branham say he's the only one that could cast out cancer he's the only one that can cast out anxiety he's the only one here that can cast out depression but church we have been trained better than that hallelujah i said we have been trained by a prophet not just to watch the prophet do all of it but we've been trained i mean to do the same works we've been trained at john 14 12 church amen greater work shall you do because i go to the father hallelujah hey when the devil thought that it stopped with william branham but i say devil it ain't stopped but it's still going on hallelujah amen there was a depression or still being defeated by sons and daughters of god [Music] hallelujah we've been trained by prophet have we not amen let me say it to you like this william branham would stand there in a meeting nervousness would be there did you find him backing down to it anxiety would be there did you find him backing down to it come on coldness formality amen would be all in the congregation as you see a prophet back down to it aiming devils of cancer devils of blindness among diamond devils of oppression did you ever find a prophet back down to it you never will read on tape you'll never listen on tape by the troy and find brother branham say the devil you you're just too much i can't do it but you'll actually find a prophet stand there brother as a son of a i mean as a son of god he would stand there and say every devil in here amen i take you under my control for the glory of god and brother you wouldn't find him backing down to it you would find him operating as a manifested son of god that every devil of torment he came to amen he didn't subject to it but he put it under the subjection of god he said preacher what are you saying i said what was he a prophet yes he was amen and i'm not saying we're going to have the ministry that he had we won't have that i believe it's one to a generation it's what i believe but i will say this and with the devils that he put under his feet that wasn't just for profit amen hallelujah the cancer he defeated sis that wasn't just for profit we got testimonies and the nervousness even though he defeated that wasn't just for prophets i remember he was teaching abroad listen church the works that christ did you shall do also [Applause] greater than these shall you do because i go to the father amen listen brother sister i'll turn a corner we'll close amen we have been trained for it brother i mean we've not been trained to back down to the devil we've been trying to cast out the devil oh yeah we've not been trained to submit ourselves to whatever spirit amen comes in our household comes on our shoulder and comes to torment our family we've not been trained to fall under it we've been trained to take subject over it hallelujah you believe this tonight i've said this and preaching this sermon around i've been preaching several times just so i mean inspired my heart in this i remember but growing up i mean as a child sometimes you do something you weren't supposed to and mom say you get one popsicle you go get two [Laughter] you go get one candy bar don't you get two and you know it it was fine mom would say that and you know i go off and sneak out as a child go get another popsicle and mom and mommy give it to you she give you the correction and you know that's okay i just enjoyed the popsicle that i had but i'll say this i mean if dad ever told me son don't you go do that and i went and did it and then dad would tell me son i'm disappointed in you you know better than that when i heard them words man it just did something to me when he would say you know better than that i thought my you know that that would really stain me when my dad would tell me no better than that you know i i got to thinking on these scriptures i'm going to got to thinking on this sermon i thought you know as the bride of jesus christ hallelujah we'll hit a high note and then we'll leave even but as the bride of jesus christ amen sometimes you let a little devil sit on your shoulder and you know what i'm talking about you'll let them sit there a little bit longer than what you should you'll get some kind of depression or some temptation or some kind of little battle they may try to lead you this way influence you this way and you'll sit there and let it stay there and let it talk to you and i thought my god we know better than that hallelujah amen we know better than that amen i want you to write it down brother amen step it on your heart and because the devil will come and he will battle he will war but he'll do everything he can trying to defeat you even but i want you to remember these words i know better than that hallelujah i know better than that when it comes knocking on your door remind the devil say devil i know better than that you give him an inch he'll take a mile isn't that right we know better than that tell you i laugh at the devil sometime i'm gonna come to your mind give you some kind of crazy thought and i think devil who you think you're dealing with hey when devil who do you think i am i know better than that amen come on church i mean we have been trained your pastor i'm sure teaches you amen teaching after teaching at their teacher we are without excuse to be defeated come on somebody we are without excuse to be defeated we're without excuse to be down low we're without excuse to be laying on the floor aiming all down and out we are simply out of excuses to be a defeated bride but we have been taught by a prophet not trained for defeat but train for the victory and we know better than that hallelujah you love the lord tonight i'll say this jesus put every devil under his feet so were you the prophet casted out every devil he came to so will you hallelujah he wasn't overtaken but he overtook the i mean he overtook what the devil was trying to do now i say this even turning back to that scripture and daniel god has raised up our prophet in this generation amen like no like no other ministry we've seen and what about on colorado hill spoke a storm out into existence spoke life to a fish isn't that right amen spoke squirrels into existence amen operating under the spoken word as an adopted son of god you say why did god let us see this ministry and know this man why did god send us a ministry like that i'll say this god was rising up a banner amen god was rising up the banner to show what the revelation of the word of god can do and to show what the status of an adopted son and an adopted daughter of god is able to obtain amen god didn't raise it up for us to see and to see just a one-man ministry is that okay but god rose it up to show us that this is possible this is obtainable this is what's amen you're following me and this is what we're able to have hallelujah amen let's stand on our feet amen we've been trained for it can you give the lord a handclap of praise hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] i mean i believe it's time that we operate what we've been trained to do when you believe that i mean if we've been trained for it let's do what we've been taught to do let's just bow our heads and have a word of prayer before we turn it to you pastor lord jesus our faith is challenged tonight lord lord as we thank on the scriptures and the message that you brought us in our generation that we're living in lord lord you have taught us father that we are able to put every devil under our feet lord lord in no doubt this church and the children of god that come here lord the devil will knock on their door lord the devil will come to their homes the devil will come to their shoulders lord try to bring discouragement try to bring defeat try to try to bring down heartedness lord lord he comes to all of your children father for lord he battles us the most but he's not out battling the world but he's battling your children lord but i pray somehow tonight lord that may these words just inscribe on their hearts tonight to know that we have been trained dear lord you have you have trained us in this generation or to defeat every devil or to subdue every devil under our feet lord and we want to put the devil on notice tonight lord to let him know that we have been trained or to take control over every demon spirit lord but the devil wants to come and bring anxiety he wants to bring complexes he wants to bring nervousness but lord we want to put the devil on notice and say we have been trained better than that well we have been taught better than that but lord i pray that your children right now tonight lord may their faith elevate to know that lord if there's some demon spirit that's been battling their mind if there's some more depression spirit some nervousness some anxiety or some be setting seeing lord that or that's trying to have its way over their life lord may they raise up to that devil and look him straight in the face and say boo devil for i have been trained better than that and lord i pray that this wouldn't be just a good sermon but lord i pray we would take this home with us lord i pray we would take it throughout our week lord and lord when the devil comes knocking on our door may the words come to us that we know better than that but we have been taught by the prophet's ministry in our generation lord thank you for teaching us your word lord thank you for teaching us lord how to overcome laodicea and the things of this world we thank you for it lord bless this congregation bless us pastor lord strengthen them settle them lord bring them in the deeper depths of your word lord i ask for your blessing and grace upon them father lord we love you we thank you for these things lord in the name of jesus christ we thank you father and the church said amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah i mean god bless you tonight as we turn it to you pastor praise the lord uh i certainly appreciate the word of the lord on tonight um thank god for brother solomon and he was just just kind of encouraging us and we've been trained we've been thoroughly thoroughly trained that when different situations arise we already know how to respond and i love the way he just used joshua and how he knew to use the spoken word he knew he had that he actually sought an operation in the ministry of moses you know everyone in place was the spoken word right and uh so joshua saw that and when it came time for him to use it he exercised now he might not have had as many um opportunities as moses had because moses was the example the god but he still used the power right and um you know and i was just thinking there when we were just there in in in england there was a powerful testimony of a sister that had come to serve his sister maddie was a name and uh and that night i was preaching i just felt led to share sister tonya's testimony how she say i'm not gonna let the doctor operate on me until i could get prayed for it's a meeting happening i'm gonna get prayed for it then i'll come back and do the surgery and uh and and and and somewhere between here and there between the prayer amen and by the time she got ready for surgery the thing had disappeared the growth had disappeared and i was just sharing that testimony and this sister say i can only come to one service one service and why is it that the one service she came to was a service that i shared that testimony and she came to that service and says you know she told the sisters after say okay i won't see y'all anymore uh i got to go to surgery emergency surgery in the morning you know because of a condition and one sister say no you can't go without being prayed for you've got to be prayed for before you go so they come and got me and say and she told me what was going on and me and brother gwynna just began encouraging the faith and i say look the only thing i know is that god told us to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's our part that's what we've been trained to do just pray lay hands on the sick they'll recover that's what god said it's not our job to make him recover our job is to lay hands on the scene so i say so we're going to pray in the name of the lord jesus and we're going to believe you know that you will you know you i said god to get more glory if you was able to come to church rather than be in surgery so we prayed and um and then we left church that friday night saturday morning she went in got connected to all the machines and while she was being connected to the machines they was ready for her surgery but there was another group stepped up and said no we need to check her first and the doctor said no we ready and prep for surgery let her go to surgery right now they say no we need to check her first and they start fussing and fighting and the group that said we need to check her first it's a group that won and they said we need a checker first they say okay well then they checked they checked to say you have a tremendous improvement you don't need surgery i'm telling you somewhere between here and there it happened again and and i was just telling to say look we we so satanic test testimonies from a few years ago but god just did it again proving that he's the same yesterday there and forever and church we've been trained for these things any time an opportunity present itself let's use the power that has been placed in us oh we ain't got to call nobody we call on jesus amen every brother and every sister has the same authority to back the devil up if you just open up your mouth and speak now you might cry sometime but remember you got to stop crying at some point in time and open your mouth and speak praise god you might not be able to get in touch with people all the time but you need to know what god has placed in you you're not coming to this church hearing these things amen just by accident no god is trying to plant something in your spirit so when when the time comes you can release that i'll tell you we've been trained we've been training and i'm gonna use everything i got every time a devil rise up i'm gonna take everything i got let's take his head off praise the name of the lord oh how i appreciate the word of the lord tonight amen amen every every one of those testimonies we heard the prophet share it was not a man just uh just for us to sit around and say what brother branham did this brother branham did that no that was to elevate our faith to let us know that we could do the same thing too greater works than these shall you do that that's what that's what the promise is ah i thank god for it let's give the lord a hand to praise amen for the word tonight oh praise god was just had in my heart you know for uh us to get some fire and i believe the the holy ghost brought us to fire amen through brother solomon we we certainly thank god well let's have a word of prayer amen um do we have any announcements that i need to make mention of okay just um um don't forget we'll be back sunday morning um nine o'clock for prayer and 10 30 service will start also our streaming will continue through twitter and also facebook and then the church website john423.org and as far as giving uh we have the um um actually multiple ways now we have cash up zell and what i acts that you all do anyone that's using those those methods always try to tell us uh what amounts should go to what places like sometimes offering sometimes tithing uh building fun whatever just just make sure you let us know that even in zell there is that you have the ability to put a description in to tell us how to allocate the funds amen but cash app zell and also paypal those are multiple ways that you can give online and paypal is the email address that you use when you're given to a friend of family members giving at john423.org we wanted to keep it consistent on zell and what's up zell if you want to use the email address of giving at john423.org that that also works and then cash app is dollar sign spirit and truth t amen so um and if you want to mail something in that's perfectly fine uh the address is there at the bottom of the screen so we thank the lord amen for all things uh let's have a word of prayer amen father we are appreciative of what we have heard tonight our our spirits have been uplifted and um god we don't know what it is that we will face but we know that we'll be ready for it uh whatever comes we know that we can use the power and authority that you have given us as sons and daughters of god uh we serve the most high god where's uh his children and god there's a uh i mean there's just there's a status that we have god and it's if we just only knew who we were the prophet said when the bride recognizes who she is then the rapture would go so lord help us to recognize who we are i think about elisha when he knew that he had the mantle he went right back to that same jordan that he crossed and he struck it with the mantle and said where's the lord god of elijah god he spoke it and there the waters parted amen and he walked through on dry ground and lord even the um the critics had to identify that uh that that the spirit of elijah was resting on eli shah and god we realized that it's the same holy ghost today that is resting on us uh my that's even greater if we can recognize that it's not just the spirit of elijah it's the spirit of almighty god amen the spirit that was in the lord jesus christ is resting on us and god how it certainly brings us into a a certain place it causes us to act like jesus to talk like jesus to walk like jesus to be like jesus and god we help us not to to forget our place in our position as our sons and daughters of god may we not not just those that are here but those that are streaming lord any time any time we come against something help us to take the word that has been given to us and use it our prayers are being heard i love how he said tonight maybe elisha was discouraged sometimes and didn't think that he would uh maybe god won't hear my prayer knowing elijah had to encourage him just stay encouraging and just keep pressing on no matter what god made a promise you the seed god his seat will possess the gates of the enemy so lord we we know we're and and we're anchored by that sworn promise so god we help us to walk in that to live in it uh daily oh god to cast all our cares upon you pray your blessings upon brother solomon and his precious wife sister gabriella lord as they um prepare to hit the road and going back home and then they have some more traveling to do father other meetings that are coming up god may you continue to use them for your glory and just bless them abundantly for their uh their uh lord just just the sacrifice of coming this way we pray that you return it back to him a hundredfold and uh just remember all the other saints brother
