[44:26] [Music]
[44:29] we have
[44:32] a prayer request here
[44:34] from brother jerry
[44:37] um
[44:38] exactly that we helped lift his uncle
[44:41] nelson up in prayer before the lord
[44:44] he was admitted to the hospital this
[44:45] morning in a lot of pain
[44:47] and
[44:48] the report is that he is
[44:52] dealing with problems in his prostate so
[44:55] we want to just take his uncle nelson
[44:59] before the lord
[45:01] even now let's just pray father
[45:06] um
[45:07] to know that we
[45:09] are
[45:11] sons and daughters of god
[45:12] [Music]
[45:13] that when we pray in the name of jesus
[45:17] that is just as if jesus himself
[45:20] was praying
[45:23] and to realize that uh our prayers have
[45:27] no limits no distance
[45:30] that uh blocks it from happening
[45:33] we can be here
[45:34] sending a word of prayer to a man that
[45:36] is in the hospital and
[45:38] his pain can stop right now
[45:41] that's the power of prayer
[45:44] so lord we we might not know nelson but
[45:47] you do he's a relative to
[45:49] brother jerry god and a man needs a
[45:52] touch from you father even right now we
[45:54] command this pain that is moving in his
[45:57] body to subside
[45:59] that he would be made whole that uh we
[46:02] we know lord that uh sometimes problems
[46:04] like this and lord cancer
[46:07] attacking bodies but father you even
[46:09] said in through your prophet that if we
[46:12] could just get the people to believe
[46:14] not even cancer would stand in the way
[46:16] of their prayer so lord we send this
[46:19] prayer faith towards nelson even right
[46:21] now that you would touch him if he does
[46:24] not know you in the partner's sin may he
[46:26] come to know you father in that way as
[46:28] well we ask that you would just deliver
[46:30] him from the pain deliver him from the
[46:31] sickness deliver him from anything that
[46:33] the enemy is attacking his body with
[46:36] lord we trust that you god will just
[46:38] move on his behalf
[46:40] it's in the mighty name of the lord
[46:42] jesus christ that we pray amen let's
[46:45] give the lord a hand of praise
[46:47] amen
[46:48] [Applause]
[46:52] amen
[46:53] praise the lord

[53:21] again our our title today is
[53:24] uh
[53:24] calling for
[53:26] his queen amen calling for
[53:30] uh his queen and i'd like to just uh
[53:33] open by reading a couple quotes here
[53:36] uh one of them is
[53:38] our our prophet spoke here in our city
[53:41] here in west palm beach
[53:43] and
[53:44] and i'm just kind of picking up
[53:46] this quote out of the sermon testimony
[53:49] praise the lord praise the lord praise
[53:51] the lord
[53:53] but it says this in florence
[53:56] nightingale
[53:58] a very
[54:00] lovely woman they wanted to send they
[54:03] had two airplane tickets
[54:07] that
[54:09] already come in for me to come to durban
[54:11] africa
[54:12] i laid it on the floor and brother
[54:15] bosworth and i prayed
[54:17] and i said lord if you'll heal this
[54:19] woman i'll go to africa
[54:21] i can't go now
[54:23] lookie here so i just committed to the
[54:25] lord sent a handkerchief back to her
[54:28] and went on
[54:30] not long after that
[54:32] king george of england
[54:35] when a man by the name i forget at fort
[54:37] wayne you remember the meeting of fort
[54:39] wayne gospel tabernacle
[54:42] it was a businessman of the city he had
[54:44] multiple sclerosis and had been a bed
[54:47] patient 10 years
[54:49] and a vision came over the man and he
[54:52] was made perfectly whole
[54:54] uh lehman was his name uh walked up and
[54:57] he was a friend
[54:58] uh to the king's private secretary
[55:02] now this this is just somewhat um you
[55:04] know this this is a blessing the way
[55:06] that this this works out so
[55:08] a vision shows over this man by the name
[55:11] of lehman
[55:12] and and he's a a a friend to the king's
[55:15] private secretary
[55:17] amen and and it just so happened that
[55:20] the king
[55:21] was going through the same sickness
[55:23] uh at the time so here this man is
[55:26] sharing his personal testimony
[55:28] uh with the king's private secretary
[55:31] glory to god and the private secretary
[55:34] begins to share this with the king
[55:38] you know
[55:39] uh sometimes we'd be wondering how this
[55:43] gospel gonna get to different people
[55:45] and you just can't control how god works
[55:48] his network is so perfect
[55:52] god would have a man in fort wayne
[55:54] indiana
[55:56] that is a friend to the king's private
[55:58] secretary
[56:00] this man is healed of
[56:02] a man of uh
[56:04] of of this multiple sclerosis through a
[56:06] vision that god gave the prophet and you
[56:08] can imagine as the as a the secretary
[56:11] sharon my friend is healed my friend is
[56:14] healed it begins to anoint the faith of
[56:16] the king
[56:17] so the king does something when his
[56:19] faith is anointed let's read it amen it
[56:22] says and he was a friend to the king's
[56:24] private secretary and through their king
[56:26] george of england
[56:28] sent word to me
[56:30] i have his statements and have his
[56:32] letters of his fields in every uh he
[56:35] says to come pray for him of multiple
[56:37] sclerosis
[56:39] and so i couldn't go up
[56:42] that time
[56:43] so i just wired back and told the king
[56:46] that i would pray for him
[56:48] here
[56:50] now that sounds like to me if you would
[56:51] just speak the word
[56:53] only
[56:55] then my servant will be made whole
[56:57] now here the prophet has to tell the
[57:00] king i can't come
[57:06] i can't come amen to pray for you but i
[57:08] can pray for you hearing the same god
[57:11] that will answer my prayer there
[57:13] will also answer it here
[57:17] oh hallelujah says that god will hear
[57:20] here here uh here just the same as he
[57:23] would over there and so um then another
[57:26] telegram
[57:27] uh come through
[57:29] then
[57:31] yeah it's another telegram come through
[57:33] and wanted me to come over come on over
[57:35] immediately
[57:37] later when i went to england uh over
[57:40] there to see him
[57:41] the lord healed him he couldn't even
[57:43] stand up for over five five minutes at a
[57:46] time i believe the second day he played
[57:48] 18 holes of golf
[57:51] and never was bothered with it no more
[57:53] until the day he died and i was in
[57:55] africa when he died they found a little
[57:57] tumor here on his lung
[57:59] now brother random say that but if you
[58:00] go read your history you know that the
[58:02] man was a smoker
[58:04] praise the lord
[58:06] right and and see uh if brother branham
[58:08] would have got over there he would have
[58:09] to deal with the sin problem first
[58:12] all right
[58:13] amen they found a little tomb on islam
[58:15] they started to cut it open and air got
[58:17] to it some way i don't know how and
[58:20] cause a blood clot to go to his brain
[58:22] and killed him instantly so so a very
[58:24] fine man now king george that i am uh
[58:28] speaking of here the prophet had an
[58:30] opportunity remember that angelo told
[58:31] the prophet that he was going to pray
[58:33] for kings and potentates and and
[58:36] and important people in the earth and
[58:38] things like that and here king george is
[58:41] one of the people that brother branham
[58:42] prayed for not only prayed for but the
[58:44] man was healed of his multiple sclerosis
[58:47] and i died of something different but he
[58:49] was healed of his multiple sclerosis and
[58:52] king george happened to be the father
[58:55] amen of queen elizabeth
[58:59] so even the prophet had something to do
[59:02] in this household
[59:05] [Applause]
[59:05] [Music]
[59:14] let's look at a little something here
[59:15] door to the heart
[59:18] amen
[59:22] oh this message will go everywhere
[59:25] this message will reach places where you
[59:27] never thought it would reach
[59:29] but here the prophet prayed for her
[59:30] father and she and the man was healed
[59:33] amen before she became queen the man was
[59:35] healed now you know these testimonies
[59:36] all over the palace buckingham
[59:40] [Applause]
[59:42] glory to god
[59:44] who prayed for you
[59:46] who who had the vision
[59:48] what's his name william branham
[59:51] praise god well i need him to come pray
[59:53] not oh my
[59:54] amen not not no or robbers not billy
[59:57] graham get william branham have him come
[1:00:00] immediately
[1:00:01] and then the prophet has to check the
[1:00:03] king
[1:00:05] can i put it that way i can't come
[1:00:08] but the prayer of faith will be prayed
[1:00:10] and i still believe god will hear my
[1:00:12] prayer here just the same way he'll hear
[1:00:14] it there
[1:00:15] and if the king would just get a hold of
[1:00:17] faith
[1:00:18] he'll see his healing and he saw it
[1:00:21] all right let's look at this amen he's
[1:00:24] calling for his queen all right
[1:00:26] door to the heart there's a statement
[1:00:28] that is made here by the by the by the
[1:00:30] prophet he says
[1:00:32] just recently
[1:00:33] the queen of england made a visit to
[1:00:35] canada
[1:00:37] uh she also visited the united states
[1:00:39] now this is queen elizabeth the second
[1:00:42] and he's talking about
[1:00:43] now we
[1:00:45] do not live in her domain
[1:00:48] this is this is the the quote here
[1:00:50] i might i'm sorry if i didn't give you
[1:00:52] the right it's paragraph 20 i think
[1:00:54] there
[1:00:55] um
[1:00:56] but it says we do not live in her domain
[1:01:00] but if she would come
[1:01:04] to san jose
[1:01:06] and would come
[1:01:07] i'm sorry you know what i don't skip
[1:01:10] i'm sorry let me let me go back up uh
[1:01:12] yeah yeah that's where i want to be uh
[1:01:15] so if i or if i own dear beloved
[1:01:17] president dwight eisenhower the
[1:01:19] president of this great united states
[1:01:22] if he would come to the home of the best
[1:01:24] democrat democrat in this country it
[1:01:27] would be an honor to you
[1:01:30] though you would disagree with him in
[1:01:32] politics but it would be an honor to
[1:01:35] have president dwight eisenhower to call
[1:01:38] at your door
[1:01:40] all right amen
[1:01:42] uh my god
[1:01:44] i remember preaching this quote once
[1:01:46] before and i had some saints sitting
[1:01:48] here and i forget who was the president
[1:01:50] then they just did not agree with that
[1:01:52] president at all and i say it would be
[1:01:53] an honor for you to have them at your
[1:01:54] door they say uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:01:58] and i just felt like saying you're lying
[1:02:02] it would be an honor for any president
[1:02:04] to come to your house it'll be an honor
[1:02:06] whether you agree with them or don't
[1:02:08] agree with them it would be an honor for
[1:02:09] a president to show up at your house
[1:02:12] amen not everybody make it to be
[1:02:14] president
[1:02:15] and and you're going to tell me you're
[1:02:17] going to show out in front of the
[1:02:18] president
[1:02:20] no you don't do nothing like that
[1:02:22] and that's another thing if you're going
[1:02:24] to the pope and they want you to
[1:02:26] bow down and kiss his ring and all that
[1:02:27] that's a different thing
[1:02:29] all right
[1:02:30] right but here you know here he says uh
[1:02:32] it would be it would be an honor to have
[1:02:34] a pres have president dwight eisenhower
[1:02:36] call at your door just a common order
[1:02:39] ordinary man like we are and if our
[1:02:41] beloved president would knock at the
[1:02:43] door
[1:02:43] you wouldn't you would you want
[1:02:45] everybody to know it amen you would talk
[1:02:50] about it the rest of your life
[1:02:53] it's the truth in the eye that the white
[1:02:55] eisenhower knocked at my door you'd
[1:02:58] almost want to build a shrine at your
[1:03:00] door because the president of the united
[1:03:02] states came to your door
[1:03:05] it says just recently the queen of
[1:03:06] england made a visit to up to canada and
[1:03:10] she also visited the united states
[1:03:12] now we do not live in her domain
[1:03:15] but if she would come to
[1:03:17] san jose and would come down to some
[1:03:20] little humble home
[1:03:22] and knock at the door
[1:03:24] and one of you
[1:03:25] women would would have went to the door
[1:03:29] she would have said i am the queen of
[1:03:30] england
[1:03:31] oh my let me get this before i uh
[1:03:35] go over my time i'm sorry let me just
[1:03:37] start that now
[1:03:39] i'll lower it just a little bit for you
[1:03:41] all right
[1:03:42] um but but he says uh
[1:03:46] says uh if she would come went to the
[1:03:48] door she would say i am the queen of
[1:03:50] england
[1:03:51] yet she has no jurisdiction over you
[1:03:56] but she's an important woman your home
[1:03:59] would have been honored to have her
[1:04:02] my you to say great queen because she is
[1:04:06] nationally speaking
[1:04:08] the greatest queen in the
[1:04:10] world watch what the prophet says now
[1:04:14] nationally speaking
[1:04:16] amen and you said coming to my home why
[1:04:18] to humble herself to do that to come to
[1:04:21] a humble home while all the newspapers
[1:04:24] would have packed it that she the great
[1:04:26] queen of england visit american to
[1:04:29] miss so-and-so's home it would have
[1:04:31] marked her always for being that humble
[1:04:34] the television would have sent it out
[1:04:36] it'd have been on national international
[1:04:38] news because she's important but who's
[1:04:41] more important than jesus
[1:04:47] hey who's any more turned down than
[1:04:50] jesus
[1:04:52] all right let's go a little further says
[1:04:54] he will knock at the door and you say oh
[1:04:57] oh some other time he's been turned away
[1:05:00] from more doors than all the great
[1:05:02] people that ever is on the earth says i
[1:05:05] say this very day that jesus has been
[1:05:07] turned away from ten of thousands of
[1:05:10] doors today and if the world stands
[1:05:12] before day breaks in the morning he will
[1:05:14] be turned away from tens of thousands of
[1:05:16] other doors
[1:05:18] amen we'd be all excited if a president
[1:05:20] came and we'd been excited if the preen
[1:05:23] if the queen would have come to our
[1:05:24] house but my we ought to be more excited
[1:05:26] because jesus is knocking at the door
[1:05:29] oh they have a song say oh won't you let
[1:05:32] him in
[1:05:33] amen heist up your windows open up your
[1:05:36] doors and let jesus come on in
[1:05:40] hallelujah
[1:05:41] amen amen so he goes on to say this he
[1:05:44] says uh
[1:05:45] uh uh if someone the queen might have
[1:05:48] might have might want something from you
[1:05:50] or our beloved president might want
[1:05:52] something from you he might have some
[1:05:54] message for you want to do something uh
[1:05:56] or want you to do something for him but
[1:05:58] the lord jesus the only thing that he
[1:06:01] wants in for
[1:06:04] is to do something good for you
[1:06:07] amen the only reason jesus is knocking
[1:06:10] at the doors because he wants to do
[1:06:11] something good for you amen he wants to
[1:06:14] bless you
[1:06:16] amen he wants to take away your evil and
[1:06:18] give you righteousness
[1:06:20] amen he wants to give you goodness and
[1:06:23] mercy that's all he can do and to get
[1:06:25] into the heart he knocks at the door and
[1:06:28] the people say oh some other time don't
[1:06:30] be that way this morning amen if he's
[1:06:32] knocking at your door open up and let
[1:06:34] him in
[1:06:35] amen says now it'll be nice for you to
[1:06:38] take in the queen or to take in one of
[1:06:40] the great people but you never do
[1:06:43] anything better than take in jesus
[1:06:47] because when he comes in he gives you
[1:06:49] eternal life
[1:06:50] and to think of turning him away from
[1:06:52] your heart
[1:06:54] but we do it
[1:06:55] you know so as i was just kind of
[1:06:58] pondering this i was
[1:07:00] uh just you know we we had the the
[1:07:03] recent passing of
[1:07:05] queen elizabeth
[1:07:06] and um you know i i love the way the
[1:07:09] brother branham made this statement she
[1:07:12] is nationally speaking
[1:07:14] the greatest queen in the world
[1:07:17] nationally speaking
[1:07:18] and and i like that because there is
[1:07:20] another queen
[1:07:22] in the world
[1:07:24] just in case y'all didn't know there
[1:07:26] there is another queen that's actually
[1:07:28] greater than queen elizabeth
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:35] she's more important
[1:07:37] amen
[1:07:39] right uh she she you know they they
[1:07:42] the the news needs to keep up with her
[1:07:46] but this queen somehow they ignore her
[1:07:50] nobody got nothing to say about this
[1:07:52] queen
[1:07:53] amen but she's the greatest queen
[1:07:54] walking the earth
[1:07:56] hallelujah she's the queen from heaven
[1:08:00] she's married to the lord jesus christ
[1:08:03] she's his bride
[1:08:05] amen and that's the greatest queen
[1:08:07] that's walking there so nationally
[1:08:08] speaking she was a great queen but
[1:08:10] there's another queen
[1:08:12] all right i looked at just a few facts
[1:08:15] here that i i wanted to pull from queen
[1:08:17] elizabeth uh sharing for 70 years and
[1:08:20] just a few facts before we get into some
[1:08:22] other things um i was they were saying
[1:08:26] that her real birthday is april 21st but
[1:08:29] uh the country doesn't officially
[1:08:31] celebrate celebrating until june 11. so
[1:08:34] they said monarchs with birthdays in in
[1:08:37] colder months typically schedule an
[1:08:39] additional official birthday when the
[1:08:41] weather is likely to be better for a
[1:08:42] parade
[1:08:43] so elizabeth had one every june called
[1:08:47] trooping the color
[1:08:48] all right so uh here she was she was
[1:08:51] born april 21st
[1:08:53] right but they celebrate june 11th
[1:08:55] another thing is they say she reigned
[1:08:58] for so long
[1:08:59] that four out of five uk residents
[1:09:02] weren't even alive when she ascended the
[1:09:05] throne and they said eighty-one percent
[1:09:07] of the uk residents uh weren't even they
[1:09:10] weren't alive when elizabeth is sending
[1:09:12] the throne so 81 of people living in the
[1:09:14] uk right now was not even alive when she
[1:09:17] uh accepted the throne that's how long
[1:09:20] she's been raining him all right another
[1:09:21] thing they say she didn't have a
[1:09:23] passport
[1:09:24] or a driver's license
[1:09:26] and this is why brother random just said
[1:09:28] in a quote it says if she just came up
[1:09:29] to your house and say i'm the queen of
[1:09:31] eaglin england she didn't need no
[1:09:32] passport she didn't need no driver's
[1:09:34] license hey man you just let her in
[1:09:37] and not only would you let her in but
[1:09:39] every other nation just let her in
[1:09:41] no no passport no driver's license and
[1:09:44] they said they said nor does she need
[1:09:45] them both driver's license and passports
[1:09:48] are issued in the queen's name so she
[1:09:50] didn't need she didn't need either of
[1:09:52] them
[1:09:56] my goodness another little thing they
[1:09:58] said about her a 2020 reporting in the
[1:10:01] telegraph suggested that the queen uses
[1:10:03] a trusted handbag to subtly exit
[1:10:06] uncomfortable or boring meetings
[1:10:09] they said if the queen was at dinner
[1:10:11] and places a handbag on the table
[1:10:14] her staff knew that she wanted the event
[1:10:16] to end in the next five minutes
[1:10:20] right and if she put her bag on the
[1:10:22] floor it signaled that she would like to
[1:10:24] be rescued from her current conversation
[1:10:27] so she used that handbag
[1:10:29] another thing they said about her she
[1:10:31] had no last name
[1:10:33] uh the queen's official title
[1:10:36] was elizabeth ii
[1:10:39] by the grace of god
[1:10:41] of the united kingdom of great britain
[1:10:43] and northern ireland and of and of her
[1:10:46] other realms and territories queen head
[1:10:49] of the commonwealth defender of the
[1:10:52] faith
[1:10:55] what a name
[1:10:56] and i know another queen that's a
[1:10:58] defender
[1:11:01] of the faith
[1:11:03] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:11:05] saints
[1:11:08] here's another thing they said about her
[1:11:10] she couldn't be prosecuted
[1:11:12] or compelled to give evidence in court
[1:11:16] i thought wow
[1:11:18] if god be for us
[1:11:20] then who can be against us because
[1:11:23] there's another queen in the land that
[1:11:24] can't be prosecuted
[1:11:26] there is nothing against this queen and
[1:11:29] and i'll tell you i think the devil he
[1:11:31] does not like this queen because he
[1:11:33] realized any accusation he brings about
[1:11:36] this queen will be shut down
[1:11:39] be covered in blood
[1:11:43] can't be prosecuted or compelled amen to
[1:11:45] give evidence in court another thing
[1:11:47] that uh that that i found here this is
[1:11:49] the last little statement and it says
[1:11:51] she was
[1:11:52] related to the man she married
[1:11:58] she was related to the man she married
[1:12:00] now i know another queen that's related
[1:12:02] to the man she's married to
[1:12:05] we we've been related to the to the lord
[1:12:07] jesus christ i mean he can only redeem
[1:12:10] those that he was related to
[1:12:15] she was related to the man she married
[1:12:17] philip was a third cousin
[1:12:19] said elizabeth is related to queen
[1:12:20] victoria on her father's side and philip
[1:12:23] was related to queen victoria on his
[1:12:25] mother's side
[1:12:26] so here you know we got these little
[1:12:28] facts about the queen but and you know
[1:12:30] and and brother branham said some
[1:12:32] positive things about her but i tell you
[1:12:34] there is another queen in the land
[1:12:37] amen amen amen and i want you to just
[1:12:40] kind of go with me here this is a quote
[1:12:43] out of perfection
[1:12:44] brother branham makes a statement here
[1:12:46] praise the lord
[1:12:48] it says this here some time ago when mr
[1:12:50] baxter was my manager
[1:12:52] when the king of england
[1:12:54] when we was there to visit
[1:12:56] when the queen come out
[1:12:59] and it's talking about uh king george
[1:13:01] right when when the queen come out
[1:13:04] lovely lady her pretty robe on her
[1:13:06] graying hair
[1:13:07] and the king said and so sick at that
[1:13:09] time he could hardly stand it
[1:13:12] he had a stomach trouble with
[1:13:14] and multiple sclerosis that was just
[1:13:16] before he was prayed for but he could
[1:13:19] hardly stand up but yet the royal blood
[1:13:22] of him stuck
[1:13:23] what little chess he had out and he rode
[1:13:26] down the street in the carriage
[1:13:28] mr baxter standing there and when he
[1:13:30] passed i looked at him his lips was
[1:13:33] quivering the tears was running down his
[1:13:36] cheeks
[1:13:37] he put his big arm around me and said
[1:13:38] brother branham i said yes brother
[1:13:40] braxton he says you know i'm a canadian
[1:13:43] yes he says the the man who's over our
[1:13:46] land the king
[1:13:48] him and his lovely bride and wife is
[1:13:50] passing by
[1:13:52] that's where i can't hold my emotions i
[1:13:54] have to give vent so this man was crying
[1:13:57] because he saw the king
[1:13:59] amen and his and his bride passing by
[1:14:03] my it just caused emotions just to kind
[1:14:05] of come out of him so brother adam took
[1:14:07] advantage of the moment
[1:14:09] and he says i put my arm around him i
[1:14:11] said brother
[1:14:12] baxter as a christian
[1:14:16] with you
[1:14:17] what will it be some glorious day
[1:14:20] when the king comes with his pride
[1:14:24] if a man
[1:14:25] could think that when seeing an earthly
[1:14:28] king which is mortal like we are what
[1:14:31] will it be when we see the king of kings
[1:14:34] coming in glory what a glorious time
[1:14:36] that'll be
[1:14:38] i say praise the lord you know uh you
[1:14:40] know i was just uh uh just kind of
[1:14:43] looking at this you know all over the
[1:14:45] world people are infatuated with the uh
[1:14:48] with the queen and the kings of england
[1:14:50] and all of that they're just infatuated
[1:14:52] with it even though they're not even
[1:14:54] under the jurisdiction they're still
[1:14:55] infatuated with it and i was just
[1:14:57] thinking to myself maybe the reason that
[1:14:59] people are so infatuated with is because
[1:15:01] they can identify amen hallelujah they
[1:15:05] can identify being the queen of heaven
[1:15:08] as the bride of christ we can identify
[1:15:10] with our position
[1:15:12] oh glory to god we can identify with our
[1:15:15] place we can identify we are the queen
[1:15:18] of heaven
[1:15:21] i just thought about this say man and
[1:15:23] you know there there there's been a
[1:15:25] number of queens
[1:15:26] that we can kind of look back to even in
[1:15:28] scripture
[1:15:29] uh you know
[1:15:31] and just one uh she was she was on the
[1:15:33] queen for a very small amount of time
[1:15:36] amen sarah was a queen
[1:15:39] sarah was given by abraham
[1:15:42] to the king
[1:15:43] my god that made sarah queen
[1:15:45] now she let her reign didn't last too
[1:15:48] long
[1:15:49] praise god
[1:15:50] amen but while she was in the house the
[1:15:52] house was cursed because she was married
[1:15:55] to another man and god had to protect
[1:15:57] sarah
[1:15:58] because he had made a promise that amen
[1:16:01] abraham was going to have a son through
[1:16:03] sarah he could not let sarah be touched
[1:16:05] by this other king
[1:16:07] he said now give that man back his wife
[1:16:09] and let him pray for you glory to god
[1:16:12] but here we see sarah is holding that
[1:16:14] that position as a queen glory to god
[1:16:17] amen we see other queens that we can
[1:16:20] find in scripture i read about esther
[1:16:21] and we'll talk about her in a little bit
[1:16:23] but another queen that i want to kind of
[1:16:25] pick up this morning amen uh is the
[1:16:28] queen of sheba
[1:16:31] glory to god look at matthew chapter 12
[1:16:33] verse 42.
[1:16:35] amen matthew 12 42
[1:16:38] the bible speaks to this queen the queen
[1:16:40] of sheba and it calls her
[1:16:43] amen says the queen of the south
[1:16:47] amen
[1:16:48] shall rise up in the judgment with this
[1:16:50] generation
[1:16:52] and shall condemn it
[1:16:54] for she came from the uttermost parts of
[1:16:56] the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon
[1:16:59] and behold
[1:17:00] a greater than solomon is here
[1:17:05] oh i just love i love this i love this
[1:17:07] this this thought here uh greater than
[1:17:09] solomon is here that lady pressed
[1:17:11] through a lot of things
[1:17:12] amen uh in order to get into the
[1:17:15] presence of solomon what we find there
[1:17:17] brother branham gives us a really really
[1:17:19] good picture you know how she had to
[1:17:21] kind of go through go go against some of
[1:17:24] the teachings of her date and maybe some
[1:17:26] of the priests that would have told us
[1:17:27] that now if you go over there to uh
[1:17:29] israel then you're gonna have to
[1:17:31] denounce your faith
[1:17:32] and how she have to stand there and say
[1:17:34] now you know you know your mother was
[1:17:35] this and your father would just say i
[1:17:37] understand what mama did and what daddy
[1:17:38] did but i can't i can't stay here when i
[1:17:41] hear god is moving over there in israel
[1:17:43] say god ain't i i ain't heard nothing
[1:17:45] about god moving here i want to go where
[1:17:48] to move is home
[1:17:49] and she began to press her way out of
[1:17:51] that condition say she had to make a a
[1:17:53] choice that she was going to leave the
[1:17:55] environment that she was in to go hear
[1:17:57] the wisdom of solomon she realized that
[1:18:00] god god had seen a revival amongst his
[1:18:03] people and she wanted she kept hearing
[1:18:05] testimony after testimony until it
[1:18:07] finally got her to a sponsor like i got
[1:18:09] to go and hear this man for myself
[1:18:12] praise god now um the thing that brother
[1:18:14] branham told say this woman would have
[1:18:16] to jump on the back of a camel
[1:18:19] and on the back of a camera she had to
[1:18:21] travel 90 days through the desert
[1:18:25] and i want you to try to get this in
[1:18:26] your mind you know uh they'll probably
[1:18:29] try to make it try to dress it up you
[1:18:31] gotta think about where was she gonna go
[1:18:33] and use the restroom
[1:18:36] 90 days one no one no hotels along the
[1:18:39] way
[1:18:40] right but but she had a uh
[1:18:42] uh something in our heart that no matter
[1:18:45] what i gotta go through
[1:18:46] i got a made up mind
[1:18:49] amen i'm gonna press to get into this
[1:18:51] man's presence so whatever whatever
[1:18:53] happens along the way that's what
[1:18:54] happens while she was on the journey
[1:18:56] brother branham say they were the the
[1:18:58] the sons of ishmael and they were they
[1:19:01] were robbers in the desert they were
[1:19:02] constantly looking for people that they
[1:19:04] could take advantage of and here this
[1:19:06] one queen coming by with all of our
[1:19:08] servants and amen they were easy target
[1:19:11] but somehow god protected them from the
[1:19:13] robbers
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:17] amen i tell you when you got something
[1:19:19] in your heart to do for the lord god
[1:19:20] will protect you and make sure that you
[1:19:22] get to your destination
[1:19:26] glory glory glory the conditions were
[1:19:29] very very very rough
[1:19:32] very tough but over a three-month period
[1:19:34] she finally makes it into the presence
[1:19:37] of solomon
[1:19:39] and i just love the way the scripture
[1:19:40] puts it we're gonna pick up
[1:19:42] a couple things amen here in the uh in
[1:19:46] the scripture
[1:19:47] watch this out of first kings chapter 10
[1:19:49] let's pick this up
[1:19:50] this this queen of sheba
[1:19:54] judgment will come to other generations
[1:19:56] because of how this lady
[1:19:58] pressed through so many things to get
[1:20:01] into the presence of god
[1:20:03] amen hallelujah hallelujah people don't
[1:20:06] press through nothing nowadays

[1:20:10] so many things just to get into the
[1:20:11] presence of god now i want you to catch
[1:20:14] this in scripture sec first kings

[1:20:26] which she told her not so she had some
[1:20:28] things she said i need to ask this guy
[1:20:29] some questions when i get there and when
[1:20:31] she got there everything she had in her
[1:20:33] heart was revealed to her through the
[1:20:35] wisdom of solomon she had never run into
[1:20:38] a man like this what an anointing that
[1:20:39] was on this king
[1:20:41] says when the queen of sheba
[1:20:44] had seen all of solomon's wisdom
[1:20:48] and the house that he had built
[1:20:51] good god
[1:20:52] and the meat of his table

[1:26:02] give him
[1:26:03] now look at what happens in verse 10
[1:26:06] and she gave the king
[1:26:09] 120 talents of gold
[1:26:12] and of spices very great store and
[1:26:14] precious stones there came no more such
[1:26:17] abundance of spices as these which the
[1:26:19] queen of sheba gave to king solomon
[1:26:22] now you know we have to uh convert
[1:26:26] a man into our language today what is
[1:26:29] this 120 talents of gold
[1:26:33] what she was carrying with her a man
[1:26:36] through the deserts on the back of a
[1:26:38] camel was
[1:26:40] 325 million
[1:26:42] 128 thousand dollars
[1:26:46] now if if that's in today's terms that's
[1:26:48] how much money she was carrying now i
[1:26:50] need to understand that that she was so
[1:26:52] excited about what she saw a man there
[1:26:56] in the kingdom of israel that she wanted
[1:26:57] to give everything that she had to it
[1:27:01] amen now i'm not asking you to give all
[1:27:03] your money don't don't don't empty out
[1:27:04] your bank accounts and things like that
[1:27:06] just your tithing offering that's all
[1:27:08] you give god but give god your heart
[1:27:11] give god your time give god your
[1:27:14] commitment give them 110
[1:27:17] give god everything you can
[1:27:19] [Applause]
[1:27:23] but you know solomon got this offering
[1:27:25] from her and you know it didn't change
[1:27:26] him
[1:27:29] it didn't change him oh hallelujah
[1:27:32] amen it shouldn't change us like that
[1:27:35] because god bless us like that and i'm
[1:27:36] going to tell you why i didn't change i
[1:27:38] didn't i didn't hear this brother
[1:27:39] solomon sent me a video
[1:27:41] uh this week and i was watching you know
[1:27:43] it's just something people that uh that
[1:27:46] are underneath this um
[1:27:48] uh
[1:27:50] prosperity type ministries
[1:27:52] people that understand they see things
[1:27:53] in the scriptures that most of us just
[1:27:55] pass right over
[1:27:57] and i pass right over something
[1:27:59] you know in the chapter before
[1:28:02] there was a king by the name of hyrum
[1:28:06] read it in verse uh chapter 9 verse 14
[1:28:10] glory to god actually i think i might
[1:28:12] want to read just a little bit ahead of
[1:28:14] that go maybe like start me at 11.
[1:28:21] okay
[1:28:23] now hiram the king of tyre had finished
[1:28:25] solomon i furnished solomon with cedar
[1:28:28] trees and fur trees and with gold
[1:28:30] according to all his desire
[1:28:32] that then the king solomon gave hiram 20
[1:28:35] cities in the land of galilee
[1:28:39] next verse and hyrum came out of tyre to
[1:28:42] see the cities which solomon had given
[1:28:44] him
[1:28:45] and they pleased him not
[1:28:48] now i thought about this why this this
[1:28:50] man has he doesn't realize what he was
[1:28:52] given
[1:28:54] cities that were near or in the land of
[1:28:57] galilee is that what the next verse
[1:28:58] previous to that said
[1:29:00] amen in the land the city 20 cities in
[1:29:03] the land of galilee
[1:29:05] and when the man come and saw the cities
[1:29:07] it pleased them not
[1:29:12] i want you to understand what this man
[1:29:14] is looking at
[1:29:15] because you know later on there was a a
[1:29:18] a a a great person
[1:29:20] amen the king of kings the lord of lords
[1:29:23] he also came from galilee
[1:29:26] and remember they asked the question
[1:29:28] can any good thing
[1:29:31] come out of galilee
[1:29:35] right but but here here this man missed
[1:29:38] an opportunity to be identified with
[1:29:40] something but let's go on a little
[1:29:42] further even in this disappointment and
[1:29:44] he said what cities of these which thou
[1:29:46] has given me my brother and they call
[1:29:48] them the land of kabul until this day
[1:29:50] look at this look at this the next verse
[1:29:54] and hiram sent to the king
[1:29:56] six score talents
[1:29:58] of gold
[1:30:00] what is that six score it's 120
[1:30:03] if i if i recall correctly it's 120. so
[1:30:06] what happened is that he gave the same
[1:30:08] exact offering
[1:30:09] that the queen of sheba gave
[1:30:11] so it didn't change solomon because he'd
[1:30:14] already seen it before
[1:30:20] and let me just put it like this to you
[1:30:22] amen when god blesses you and i say when
[1:30:25] because it's going to happen don't let
[1:30:27] the blessing change you
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:32] and can i go a little further can i
[1:30:33] prophesy
[1:30:35] you know that one big blessing you're
[1:30:36] looking for
[1:30:38] god gonna double it
[1:30:40] [Applause]
[1:30:44] but don't let it change it see when you
[1:30:46] can handle it he can give it to you and
[1:30:47] he can give it to you again he can give
[1:30:49] it to you again because you can handle
[1:30:51] it
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:55] it just it didn't stop solomon he was
[1:30:57] still there serving and doing everything
[1:30:59] he was supposed to do
[1:31:00] even after the blessing
[1:31:02] some of us get a blessing next thing you
[1:31:03] know we're not found in church no mo
[1:31:05] where you at
[1:31:08] amen you came vacation every week
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:14] all
[1:31:14] right but here you know we see this uh
[1:31:18] this queen of sheba who pressed away
[1:31:21] into
[1:31:22] uh
[1:31:23] into solomon's uh uh uh uh you know
[1:31:25] kingdom and all she wanted to do is just
[1:31:27] hear the word of the lord and see how
[1:31:29] god was using him and uh and and and and
[1:31:32] because of the way that she pressed the
[1:31:34] way that she got there and all the
[1:31:36] things the perils that she had to go
[1:31:37] through the scripture told us there in
[1:31:39] matthew 12 42 that the queen of the
[1:31:41] south was going to rise up in judgment
[1:31:44] with this generation and shall condemn
[1:31:47] it for she came from the uttermost parts
[1:31:49] of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[1:31:51] solomon and behold a greater than
[1:31:55] solomon
[1:31:56] is here
[1:31:59] don't let a testimony bring condemnation
[1:32:01] to you
[1:32:04] here's another queen that we see
[1:32:06] amen in the scripture and we picked her
[1:32:08] up
[1:32:09] as we read about esther
[1:32:12] and let's just kind of look at her just
[1:32:14] for a little bit
[1:32:15] amen uh esther is
[1:32:19] uh
[1:32:21] uh i don't want to call her a man a a
[1:32:24] secondary thought
[1:32:26] in god's mind she was the queen
[1:32:29] and god had to allow a certain situation
[1:32:32] to happen in the kingdom
[1:32:34] so esther can be brought to her position
[1:32:37] oh hallelujah what did god do amen he
[1:32:40] had a queen on the throne at the time by
[1:32:43] the name of vashti
[1:32:44] amen and and vashti uh during this great
[1:32:48] celebration with the women and and king
[1:32:51] hazardous had his own celebration going
[1:32:52] but at the end of seven days king of
[1:32:54] hazard said i want everybody to see how
[1:32:56] beautiful my wife is
[1:32:58] and here he calls for his queen
[1:33:02] glory to god he calls for his queen and
[1:33:04] what we find with vashti is that she
[1:33:06] rejected the call of the king
[1:33:09] hallelujah glory to god by her rejecting
[1:33:13] the call of the king she got rejected as
[1:33:15] queen
[1:33:17] oh hallelujah amen
[1:33:19] what we see is that vashti failed to
[1:33:21] obey the word of her king
[1:33:24] amen but here today god has a people in
[1:33:27] the land amen that will not fail to obey
[1:33:30] the word of their king
[1:33:32] hallelujah amen so so here we want to
[1:33:35] just kind of look at a couple things
[1:33:36] here amen um
[1:33:38] esther
[1:33:40] was what we would call the perfect type
[1:33:43] of the bribe
[1:33:44] she was an oddball
[1:33:46] amen this this lady was was very
[1:33:49] different in a lot of ways and and one
[1:33:52] of the things that uh that we found is
[1:33:53] that she had a situation that she'd gone
[1:33:56] through she lost both a father and lost
[1:33:58] a mother she was an orphan
[1:34:00] hallelujah she was raised taken in to be
[1:34:04] raised by her uncle and her uncle was a
[1:34:06] very very strict man this man has some
[1:34:09] some serious conviction
[1:34:12] hallelujah i love mordecai he had
[1:34:14] serious conviction he would not bow to
[1:34:17] haman
[1:34:18] amen whatever they was doing and
[1:34:21] whatever everybody else was doing he
[1:34:23] refused to do what everybody else would
[1:34:24] say i'ma have to do it this way and now
[1:34:27] he knew his he knew his position he knew
[1:34:29] who he was and he says now esther
[1:34:31] they're looking for a new queen he says
[1:34:32] now what you need to do is make sure you
[1:34:34] go in there don't tell him anything
[1:34:35] about you don't tell him where you come
[1:34:37] from who your people are don't say
[1:34:39] nothing hallelujah and i love the advice
[1:34:41] that he gave esther because amen just
[1:34:44] with her natural beauty
[1:34:46] she woo the king
[1:34:49] just with her natural beauty no no
[1:34:51] additions
[1:34:53] amen she woo the king
[1:34:56] amen and sisters the only way you gonna
[1:34:58] woo the king in this tower amen is with
[1:35:00] your natural beauty he will beautify the
[1:35:03] meek with salvation
[1:35:08] amen
[1:35:09] hallelujah
[1:35:10] you see esther raised up in a household
[1:35:13] like this it caused her to kind of
[1:35:15] develop some convictions of her own
[1:35:18] and uh you know mordecai uh what was the
[1:35:20] man that you know he gave with advice he
[1:35:23] checked on he watched out for and he did
[1:35:24] all the things that he needed to do but
[1:35:26] he raised and not only not only that i
[1:35:28] mean the king wasn't just looking for
[1:35:30] any kind of woman
[1:35:32] the king wanted a virgin
[1:35:34] hallelujah they were going through the
[1:35:36] land looking for the virgins amen so
[1:35:38] living in mordecai's house mordecai
[1:35:40] would have to tell him no you're not
[1:35:41] going to that party
[1:35:43] no you're not going to that person's
[1:35:45] house no you're not going to do this
[1:35:47] because in there you might get tricked
[1:35:49] into something and you got to keep
[1:35:51] yourself until you get married mordecai
[1:35:53] was a strict uncle
[1:35:56] but his strictness paid off in the end
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:00] hallelujah
[1:36:03] hallelujah hallelujah parents you might
[1:36:06] have to pick up that level of strictness
[1:36:08] again your strictness will pay off in
[1:36:10] the end you don't know who god got for
[1:36:13] your daughter
[1:36:14] teaching the right ways
[1:36:16] keep yourself till you get married
[1:36:19] tell your son the same thing keep
[1:36:21] yourself till you get mad it'll save you
[1:36:23] a lot of headaches
[1:36:30] esther was an oddball
[1:36:33] esther a man here in this kingdom
[1:36:36] she was a israelite
[1:36:39] but here she's amongst all the the maybe
[1:36:42] the girls from india and amen ethiopia

[1:36:48] long pla it was a long ways a lot of
[1:36:50] young ladies that come all these young

[1:37:27] beauty

[1:41:31] she can't present herself like the world
[1:41:34] hallelujah
[1:41:36] amen i'm talking about a greater queen
[1:41:38] than the queen that everybody is talking
[1:41:39] about i'm talking about the queen of
[1:41:41] heaven this morning she has to present
[1:41:43] herself in a different way look at this
[1:41:47] it says that's uh that's right not just
[1:41:49] a part washing
[1:41:51] but a full gospel washing
[1:41:56] cleaned up
[1:41:57] made new creatures in christ jesus
[1:42:01] i like what he said here all right let
[1:42:03] me go on a little a little further
[1:42:05] uh here's another quote out of
[1:42:08] meanest man i know
[1:42:10] amen the meanest man i know look at this
[1:42:12] the prophet makes a statement and this
[1:42:14] in this uh
[1:42:15] in this message
[1:42:16] it says the church
[1:42:19] is a whole lot like it was in the days
[1:42:21] of esther
[1:42:22] he says esther didn't take the perfuming
[1:42:25] of the women
[1:42:27] she adorned herself with modest apparel
[1:42:30] the hidden man of the heart
[1:42:32] and the king said put the crown on her
[1:42:34] head
[1:42:35] amen esther was a type of the church
[1:42:38] today
[1:42:39] those who are ready to come out and
[1:42:41] adorn themselves with the sweetness of
[1:42:44] the holy spirit
[1:42:46] not the perfuming and the dressing of
[1:42:48] the world try to compare with them but
[1:42:50] that hidden man of the heart that's the
[1:42:53] one
[1:42:55] i'ma tell you
[1:42:56] you know uh
[1:42:57] they had a thing about you know the
[1:43:00] queen when she was younger queen queen
[1:43:01] elizabeth
[1:43:03] um
[1:43:05] she um her and her sister i think at the
[1:43:07] end of one of the wars they wanted to go
[1:43:09] out and be amongst the people
[1:43:11] and so they kind of took all their royal
[1:43:13] stuff off
[1:43:15] and uh and they just kind of dressed
[1:43:17] down so they just looked normal just
[1:43:19] like everybody else and as they went out
[1:43:21] a lot of people had no idea that the
[1:43:23] queen was in their midst
[1:43:26] my god now you know she's dressing down
[1:43:29] in order to try to achieve that but here
[1:43:31] as the bride of christ we always dress
[1:43:33] down
[1:43:35] we don't dress like the world we don't
[1:43:37] look like the world we don't i mean our
[1:43:39] dresses
[1:43:40] now look we still look nice
[1:43:42] but we just don't look like the world
[1:43:45] hallelujah
[1:43:46] amen our sisters ain't got to wear a
[1:43:48] dress with half half of this hanging out
[1:43:52] it's the truth in it
[1:43:54] this too tight and that now we ain't got
[1:43:56] a dress like that
[1:43:58] to get nobody attention
[1:44:00] you know a woman that wear makeup she
[1:44:02] only wear that to peace men
[1:44:05] praise the lord that's only to peace man
[1:44:07] that's not the peace god you don't do
[1:44:09] that for the glory of god you do that to
[1:44:11] appease a man
[1:44:12] and maybe sometimes it might not be
[1:44:14] another man you might appease other
[1:44:15] women
[1:44:17] it's the truth in it
[1:44:19] you just want compliments and the only
[1:44:21] people compliment you is is another
[1:44:23] girlfriend
[1:44:24] watch us she might have a spirit on them
[1:44:27] all right
[1:44:28] glory to god
[1:44:31] you just think about how many how many
[1:44:33] what men gave you compliments when you
[1:44:34] did that
[1:44:36] some wolf out there give you a
[1:44:38] compliment
[1:44:39] praise god but brothers ain't gonna say
[1:44:40] nothing to you
[1:44:43] a real son of god won't say nothing to
[1:44:45] you dressed like that
[1:44:46] and you wonder why he's saying that
[1:44:48] because he ain't looking for nothing
[1:44:49] like that
[1:44:51] he's looking for a real queen
[1:44:56] is this all right
[1:45:01] oh my so look you know uh we we see this
[1:45:04] amen in the story of esther
[1:45:06] vashti was a perfect type of the church
[1:45:09] that rejected the word in her day the
[1:45:11] word of the king
[1:45:13] amen and esther
[1:45:15] my god she uh uh she didn't go along
[1:45:17] with everything and everybody was doing
[1:45:18] she just took it the way god gave it to
[1:45:20] her you know like i say raised in a very
[1:45:22] strict home but my blessing is that she
[1:45:25] was chosen to be queen
[1:45:28] and not only was she chosen to be queen
[1:45:30] it was she was chosen at the right time
[1:45:32] to be queen
[1:45:33] because as soon as she was chosen to be
[1:45:35] queen
[1:45:36] this other guy heyman came up with a
[1:45:38] plan he says you know what i'm going to
[1:45:40] kill all the jews
[1:45:42] and the reason i'm going to kill these
[1:45:43] jews amen is because you know they just
[1:45:46] they they're not like us they don't
[1:45:48] handle themselves like us and they just
[1:45:50] do everything different maybe we want to
[1:45:52] have a party they refuse to come to the
[1:45:54] party we want to do this they refuse to
[1:45:56] do that we want to go to church and
[1:45:57] worship they won't go to church with us
[1:45:59] they just they just are strange people
[1:46:00] we got to get rid of all the jews
[1:46:03] then she had it was one specific jew
[1:46:05] that he really didn't like
[1:46:08] every time i ride through the city
[1:46:11] there's this guy by the name of mordecai
[1:46:14] he refuses to bow when he sees me coming
[1:46:17] and he knows i'm a man of uh uh with
[1:46:20] authority he knows he's supposed to bow

[1:52:12] is the same trap he got about to fall
[1:52:14] into
[1:52:19] you know
[1:52:20] i just read to y'all early about
[1:52:23] queen queen elizabeth
[1:52:25] anytime she could not be called into law
[1:52:28] she can be called into court for
[1:52:30] anything she couldn't be charged for
[1:52:32] anything there was nothing against a
[1:52:34] queen esther kind of stood in the same
[1:52:36] place
[1:52:37] amen she her people not only up her but
[1:52:40] she stood for her people that they would
[1:52:43] not even die
[1:52:45] they'd be able to defend themselves
[1:52:47] what a queen
[1:52:49] i want you to look at a couple things
[1:52:51] here from the prophet
[1:52:54] vaster was a perfect type of the church
[1:52:55] i want to bring this out of legacy and
[1:52:57] church age
[1:52:59] she's the perfect type of the church but
[1:53:00] queen esther represents the bride
[1:53:03] here brother brandon makes a statement
[1:53:05] in the in the later scene church it says
[1:53:07] a momentary consideration
[1:53:10] of church history will prove how
[1:53:13] accurate this thought is
[1:53:15] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:53:17] entirely lost to the people
[1:53:19] but god sent luther with the word and
[1:53:22] and when i look at god sending luther
[1:53:23] and sending these messages it's just
[1:53:25] like them seven chamberlains amen that
[1:53:27] went to queen vashti but she refused to
[1:53:30] listen my god god sent seven messengers
[1:53:33] amen to the gentile church in this day
[1:53:36] and we have received the word we have
[1:53:39] not rejected the word we have received
[1:53:42] the word
[1:53:45] god said luther with the word the
[1:53:47] lutheran spoke for god at that time
[1:53:49] but they organized and again the pure
[1:53:52] word was lost for organization tens
[1:53:54] toward dogma dogman creeds and you know
[1:53:56] i'm just looking at this how they
[1:53:57] organize vastly organized too she
[1:54:00] organized her own party for the women
[1:54:04] hallelujah i wonder why she organizing a
[1:54:07] party for the women
[1:54:08] and no men are there
[1:54:10] what is that telling the women
[1:54:13] maybe she's saying i i'ma tell y'all
[1:54:15] what now when he calls for me i'ma show
[1:54:17] y'all how we gonna do this
[1:54:20] glory to god
[1:54:21] amen
[1:54:22] look at this he says lutheran spoke for
[1:54:24] god at that time but they organized and
[1:54:26] again the pure word was lost for
[1:54:28] organization tense towards dogma and
[1:54:30] creeds and not simple words they could
[1:54:32] no longer speak for god then god sent
[1:54:35] wesley and he was the voice with the
[1:54:38] word in his day the people who took his
[1:54:40] revelation from god became the living
[1:54:42] epistles read and known of all men for
[1:54:44] their generation when the methodist
[1:54:47] failed god raised up others and so it
[1:54:50] has gone on through the years until in
[1:54:52] this last day
[1:54:54] there is again
[1:54:56] another people in the land who under
[1:54:58] their messenger will be the final voice
[1:55:01] to the final age i'm talking to that
[1:55:03] group of people this morning
[1:55:05] the church vashti the church is no
[1:55:08] longer the mouthpiece of god it is its
[1:55:11] own mouthpiece so god is turning on her
[1:55:15] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:55:20] amen hello somebody
[1:55:23] he will confound her he will confound
[1:55:26] her through the prophet and
[1:55:28] the bride for the voice of god will be
[1:55:31] where
[1:55:33] in her praise god
[1:55:35] yes it is for it says in the last
[1:55:37] chapter verse of revelation verse 17 the
[1:55:41] spirit and the bride say come once more
[1:55:44] the world will hear direct from god as
[1:55:47] that pentecost but of course that word
[1:55:49] bribe will be repudiated as it as in the
[1:55:52] first age i thank god that the word is
[1:55:56] already in the bride you talk about a
[1:55:57] queen in the land
[1:56:01] there's a queen here
[1:56:03] and the king is calling for his queen to
[1:56:05] stand by his side
[1:56:07] but stand dressed according to this word
[1:56:13] hallelujah let me give you a couple more
[1:56:15] quotes here out of the breach
[1:56:17] between the seven church ages and the
[1:56:19] seven seals
[1:56:21] the prophet makes this statement
[1:56:23] oh yes lord
[1:56:25] it says but you see that sleeping virgin
[1:56:29] ain't receiving anything anyhow
[1:56:32] that's right and remember while they
[1:56:35] went to try to buy oil
[1:56:37] you remember the scripture doesn't say
[1:56:39] they got it
[1:56:41] but while they were out trying to buy it
[1:56:43] there come a sound what happened
[1:56:45] all those virgins that slept arose and
[1:56:48] trimmed their lamps
[1:56:50] and went into the supper is that uh is
[1:56:52] that right
[1:56:54] he says an arrest was left for the
[1:56:55] tribulation period
[1:56:57] right weeping wailing and gnashing of
[1:57:00] teeth
[1:57:01] that's the church not the bride
[1:57:04] amen the bride went in and i love this
[1:57:07] there's a whole
[1:57:09] difference between the church
[1:57:11] and the bride
[1:57:13] there's a whole difference between the
[1:57:16] church
[1:57:17] and the bride yes sir went into the
[1:57:20] wedding supper oh notice boys
[1:57:23] it says uh
[1:57:25] the seals was broke
[1:57:27] why in the last church age the seals was
[1:57:30] broke
[1:57:31] in the last church age
[1:57:33] to reveal these truths
[1:57:35] why the lamb broke the seals
[1:57:39] and revealed them to his church
[1:57:42] in order to collect his subjects
[1:57:45] for his kingdom his bride see oh my he
[1:57:48] wants to bring his subjects to him
[1:57:52] now
[1:57:53] what what is it out of the dust of the
[1:57:56] earth
[1:57:57] out of the bottom of the sea
[1:57:59] out of the pits out of everywhere in
[1:58:02] every place out of the regions of the
[1:58:04] dark glory to god i don't care where you
[1:58:06] at god is calling for his bride to stand
[1:58:09] by sight
[1:58:10] amen it says out of the duster out of
[1:58:12] the bottom sea out of the pits out of
[1:58:14] everywhere and every place out of the
[1:58:15] regions of the dark out of paradise
[1:58:17] wherever they may be he will call and
[1:58:20] they will answer
[1:58:23] amen amen he will call and they'll
[1:58:25] answer he come to get his subjects he
[1:58:29] revealed his secrets and they saw it
[1:58:32] and time is no more at that time time
[1:58:35] has run out it's finished all right look
[1:58:36] at this he leaves the throne to be an
[1:58:39] intercessor as a slain lamb to be a lion
[1:58:43] king to bring the world to judgment who
[1:58:46] has rejected his message he's not a
[1:58:49] mediator and see uh uh vashti re
[1:58:52] rejected the message of the chamberlains
[1:58:56] it wasn't the king that came and asked
[1:58:58] for vashti
[1:58:59] it was the chamberlain's that came to
[1:59:01] get vastly
[1:59:02] hallelujah and if i could put it this
[1:59:04] way it wasn't it wasn't the king himself
[1:59:06] that was coming to get his bride amen
[1:59:08] but he sent seven messengers
[1:59:12] hallelujah friends of the bridegroom and
[1:59:14] to reject the friends of the bridegroom
[1:59:17] is just like rejecting the bridegroom
[1:59:23] when vashti rejected it she got rejected
[1:59:28] all right stay with me here all right
[1:59:30] look it says he's not a mediator
[1:59:32] remember the old testament teaching now
[1:59:34] as we hurry when the blood went off the
[1:59:36] mercy seat
[1:59:38] what was it judgment seat and when the
[1:59:41] lamb slain walked forward from eternity
[1:59:43] out of the father's throne and took his
[1:59:44] rights it was a judgment seat
[1:59:46] then he become not a lamb
[1:59:49] but a lion
[1:59:51] king
[1:59:53] and he calls for his queen
[1:59:55] to stand by his side
[1:59:57] and i believe that's the season of time
[1:59:59] that we're living in right now don't let
[2:00:01] these things go over you
[2:00:03] don't get so amen enamored
[2:00:06] with what's going on naturally that you
[2:00:08] fail to miss your spiritual position
[2:00:12] hallelujah
[2:00:14] amen
[2:00:15] one king has died but another one has
[2:00:17] been born
[2:00:18] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[2:00:20] one queen has died but another one has
[2:00:22] been born born by the word
[2:00:24] amen
[2:00:25] all right
[2:00:26] and i'm not taken from what has happened
[2:00:28] i'm not but i am i mean the whole
[2:00:30] purpose is that you would know your
[2:00:32] position
[2:00:34] and god uses natural to type the
[2:00:36] spiritual
[2:00:37] glory to god don't miss your position
[2:00:39] you you are this great queen the queen
[2:00:41] of heaven that is on the earth right now
[2:00:44] just like they didn't know esther was
[2:00:45] there they didn't know it but there
[2:00:46] comes a time where god will god will use
[2:00:48] this bride to be the final voice of the
[2:00:50] final age don't fail to miss your part
[2:00:53] amen all right
[2:00:56] this last quote that i want to read here
[2:00:58] out of thy tier in church h oh he's
[2:01:00] calling for his queen to stand by sight
[2:01:03] god is calling for his queen
[2:01:05] to stand by
[2:01:06] sight hey hallelujah i'll tell you what
[2:01:10] when it was time for esther to be shown
[2:01:12] amongst the people she had no problem
[2:01:13] standing by her king's side vashti had a
[2:01:15] problem with it but but esther didn't
[2:01:17] have a problem with it and esther got
[2:01:20] favor with the king because of her her
[2:01:22] meek spirit
[2:01:25] look at this now
[2:01:27] authoritarian church age brother branham
[2:01:28] makes a statement
[2:01:32] let us go back to
[2:01:34] the beginning
[2:01:36] says in the original physical creation
[2:01:38] as we know it today
[2:01:41] god made everything in pairs
[2:01:44] look at this male and female
[2:01:47] there were two chickens rooster in hen
[2:01:50] because there were two cattle the cow
[2:01:52] and the bull
[2:01:54] he says and right down the line
[2:01:56] but when it came to man there was only
[2:01:59] one
[2:02:01] they were not a pair
[2:02:03] says adam had been made in the image of
[2:02:06] god
[2:02:07] he was a son of god
[2:02:09] as a son of god
[2:02:11] he could not be tempted and fall
[2:02:14] watch it he could not be tempted
[2:02:16] and fall adam as the son of god cannot
[2:02:19] be tempted
[2:02:21] and fall
[2:02:22] think about that
[2:02:24] you know the queen she couldn't even be
[2:02:25] brought to court
[2:02:27] right but as sons of god adam in the
[2:02:30] original condition he could not be
[2:02:32] tempted and fall
[2:02:34] all right watch this
[2:02:35] that would be impossible
[2:02:39] look at it so god
[2:02:41] took a byproduct of man
[2:02:44] to cause the fall
[2:02:47] stay with me woman never step fresh from
[2:02:50] the hand of god as a true product of god
[2:02:53] now let's catch this now let's make sure
[2:02:55] we catch this
[2:02:56] we're talking about
[2:02:58] a man uh the
[2:03:01] uh the physical part of the woman
[2:03:04] now the spiritual part
[2:03:07] was a part of god
[2:03:08] that spiritual part was also part of
[2:03:11] adam when he first brought adam he was
[2:03:13] both male and female so that spiritual
[2:03:15] part was there
[2:03:17] but when god took the spirit out of that
[2:03:20] feminine spirit let me say that again
[2:03:22] let me be very very clear
[2:03:25] god
[2:03:26] took the feminine spirit
[2:03:28] out
[2:03:30] of adam
[2:03:31] so if you see adam
[2:03:33] with a feminine spirit it's a perversion
[2:03:37] because god
[2:03:39] took the feminine spirit out of adam and
[2:03:43] then he also took a rib out of air adam
[2:03:46] and he formed eve
[2:03:49] praise god all right it says so god took
[2:03:52] a byproduct of man to cause the fall
[2:03:55] woman
[2:03:56] never stepped fresh from the hand of god
[2:04:01] as a true product of god
[2:04:04] she was produced from man
[2:04:07] and when god calls her to be brought
[2:04:09] forth from man she was vastly different
[2:04:13] from other females he had created she
[2:04:16] was able to be seduced
[2:04:18] no other female in creation can be
[2:04:21] immoral but the human female may be
[2:04:24] touched at almost any time look at this
[2:04:27] and that weakness in her
[2:04:30] allows satan to seduce her by way of the
[2:04:34] serpent
[2:04:35] and has brought the woman this is a very
[2:04:38] very
[2:04:39] important statement here amen uh it's
[2:04:42] brought the woman to a very peculiar
[2:04:44] position before god
[2:04:46] and his word
[2:04:48] watch it now
[2:04:49] she is
[2:04:50] the type
[2:04:52] of all things vulgar
[2:04:58] you having a hard time with that one
[2:05:00] just put that when type of all things
[2:05:03] vulgar just type type that in type
[2:05:06] t-y-p-e
[2:05:07] of all things vulgar v-u-l-g-a-r
[2:05:12] i think that should be only one and i'm
[2:05:14] reading from thy tier in church age
[2:05:16] all right want to make sure y'all get
[2:05:18] this one
[2:05:20] all right so he says now that weakness
[2:05:22] in her allowed satan to seduce her by
[2:05:24] way of the serpent
[2:05:26] and has brought the woman to a very
[2:05:28] peculiar position before god
[2:05:31] and his word
[2:05:33] she is the type
[2:05:35] of all things vulgar
[2:05:38] not only that
[2:05:39] foul
[2:05:41] and loathsome
[2:05:43] on the one hand
[2:05:44] now see that's that's that's that's
[2:05:46] that's very important that we get that
[2:05:48] on the one hand
[2:05:50] on the one hand because that's where
[2:05:52] some people preach it they always preach
[2:05:54] it on the one hand
[2:05:56] but we gotta preach it on the other side
[2:05:58] too it's two hands two hands to a body
[2:06:04] she's the type of all things vulgar fowl
[2:06:06] and lotion on the one hand
[2:06:08] and on the other hand she's the type of
[2:06:11] all things clean
[2:06:13] and beautiful
[2:06:14] and holy as the receptacle receptacle of
[2:06:18] the spirit and blessings of god
[2:06:22] on the one hand she is called the
[2:06:26] who is drunk with the wine of her
[2:06:27] fornication now let's talk about the
[2:06:29] catholic church
[2:06:30] on the other she is called the bride of
[2:06:33] christ
[2:06:35] on one hand
[2:06:37] she is called mystery babylon
[2:06:40] the abomination before god amen and on
[2:06:44] the other hand she is called new
[2:06:46] jerusalem our mother amen on the one
[2:06:50] hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd
[2:06:55] that she is summarily cast into the lake
[2:06:58] of fire as the only fit place for her
[2:07:04] but i want to talk about the other hand
[2:07:06] but on the other hand
[2:07:08] she is exalted to
[2:07:10] heaven sharing the very throne of god
[2:07:14] as the only place
[2:07:21] befitting
[2:07:24] such a queen
[2:07:26] who is this queen where this place is
[2:07:29] befitting
[2:07:32] i'm speaking to her this morning
[2:07:34] the pride of jesus christ
[2:07:37] and he is calling for his queen
[2:07:39] to stand by his side
[2:07:43] oh my
[2:07:47] i thought it was just very very
[2:07:49] appropriate
[2:07:50] for us to remind you
[2:07:52] of who you are
[2:07:54] you're not vashti
[2:07:56] your type is esther
[2:07:58] and everything esther did that's what
[2:08:00] you want to do
[2:08:02] hallelujah to the lamb of god
[2:08:04] amen by esther submitting herself to the
[2:08:07] word esther refusing to be adorned with
[2:08:09] the things of the world esther did all
[2:08:11] those things
[2:08:12] esther was blessed in the end
[2:08:15] and church this is what happened us
[2:08:16] there there there there's there's
[2:08:18] another voice in the land there's
[2:08:19] another voice in the land and that voice
[2:08:22] the voice of god is speaking through the
[2:08:24] through the bride in this last day that
[2:08:26] final voice to the final age will be the
[2:08:28] bride and notice what the bride gonna do
[2:08:30] the bride gonna say when the but when
[2:08:31] the bible says the spirit of bride say
[2:08:33] come it's because the the spirit the
[2:08:36] bride
[2:08:37] and the prophet
[2:08:38] will say the same thing
[2:08:40] amen
[2:08:41] the spirit gonna tell the prophet to say
[2:08:43] it
[2:08:44] the bride gonna pick up what the prophet
[2:08:46] said and the bride gonna keep echoing
[2:08:48] that
[2:08:49] i don't care how old-fashioned it may
[2:08:51] seem
[2:08:52] but we're going to say what the prophet
[2:08:53] said
[2:08:54] and we're going to live the way the
[2:08:55] prophet told us to live
[2:08:58] because there's a throne that's
[2:08:59] befitting
[2:09:01] for this type of lady amen
[2:09:04] it's the throne that he has prepared for
[2:09:07] us

[2:10:06] king but within two months time

[2:10:16] for her people
[2:10:17] and lord she she walked into that
[2:10:19] responsibility with such a courage
