Praise God. God bless you all tonight. Uh so [music] good to have you here in uh fellowship with us. Some come from far, some [music] come from near, but we all come for one purpose and that's to glorify the name of the Lord. Man, truly he is worthy uh to [music] be praised. And uh I wanted to just take a a moment [music] just read a a scripture as it relates to this weekend. As you all have heard, our theme [music] for this weekend is I will restore saith the Lord. [music] Amen. And um we the church has been on a journey [music] actually for roughly two years uh where God started [music] us off last year with this this inspiration of our restore sayith the Lord and it carried us right through the year and as we entered into &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh 2025 we knew that we were going forward with that theme and um and since the theme carried [music] over then it had a second inspiration and that second inspiration is the year of overflow. Hallelujah. We're under expectation for God to do some overflow in this place. [music] Amen. This this weekend, we need spiritual overflow. Amen. Some of us need the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Some need refillings of the Holy Ghost. [music] And we're expecting God to come in and just fill our hearts. Amen. We want to see change. But our scripture, amen, that we use for our uh [music] theme is out of Joel chapter 2. And I'll start at verse 21. Um, start at verse [music] 21. The Bible says, "Fear not, O land. Be [music] glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things." Anybody believe that? Hallelujah. It goes on to say, "Be not afraid, [music] ye beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness do spring. For the the tree beareth her [music] fruit, and the fig tree, and the vine do yield their strength. Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice [music] in the Lord your God, for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. It says, "And [music] the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall [music] overflow with wine and oil." So that's the year of overflow right there [music] in the scripture. the fat shall overflow with wine and oil. We know that that wine, amen, is is is [music] a stimulation. Praise God. And what we're looking for a stimulation of revelation overflow this weekend. [music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The next verse says this, uh, "And I will restore to you the years that the locust have eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer, my great army which I sent among you." And I love this verse here. Ye shall [music] eat in plenty. Now, I want to I want to just uh mention [music] this because I am very intentional as a as a shepherd that I I didn't let you all know who was going to be preaching. [music] And the reason I didn't do do that because I want you to come under expectation. And the other thing I want you to know is that God made you a promise. You know what God's promise is? Ye shall eat [music] in plenty. That's what God told you. With this inspiration, ye shall eat in [music] plenty. And the Bible says, "And be satisfied." I'm I'm here to tell you tonight, you will not leave these meetings disappointed. God made you a promise. You going to eat in plenty. Just bring your knife and bring your fork. Bring your plate. Get it. Get ready to eat in plenty. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's what God said. No, no, y'all don't go there. Y'all don't go there. [music] Ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you. [music] And I love this. My people shall never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Verse 27 says, "And ye shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else, and my people [music] shall never be ashamed." Thank God for his promised word. Thank God for his promised word. [music] God's prophet makes some comments, [music] amen, about this scripture. I just wanted to read a quote really quick. [music] Amen. [music] You can just pull that up for me. Out of the restoration [music] of the bride tree, Brother Brandham, he preaches a powerful [music] sermon. powerful sermon on this uh on this restoration and [music] and if you have if you haven't listened to it I encourage you go back and listen to it. It is it is powerful. And u there's [music] some inspiration that we're grabbing from this for our meetings. And the prophet says this, notice the same insect that little rascal, the same insect [music] that started and killed the tree in the beginning started right back at them Lutheran branches. But what it can't kill [music] it. It can't kill it because God has done said, "I will restore." [music] My God. That insect started on Luther to kill all the Lutheran branches. It came right over to Wesley, killed all the Wesley branches, but the main part of the [music] tree keeps coming. And it says this. Now notice in the old time when the tree was killed, it was killed went plum to the roots when it killed it back there. But this time because the word is [music] predestinated. Now this right here is very important to me. Uh the prophet said the word is predestinated. And what we're looking at here is [music] the scripture that I just read to you says, I will restore saith the Lord. Let me tell you something. You don't have to do the restoration. [music] That's not your job to do the restoration. It is God's job to do the restoration. And he said it's a predestinated word. It's [music] a predestinated promise. And it's a promise for this day in which we live. [music] Let me tell you something. Uh if if we would just come here under expectation what God [music] promised in this world, we'll get exactly what we expect. Nothing less, church. [music] Here he says it to us. He says, um, he says, "But this time, because the word is predestinated, there is nothing going to stop [music] it. Nothing going to stop it." He says, God said, "I will restore." No matter how much they organize, how much they do this, that, or the other, I'm [music] going to restore it. That settles it. All the laughing, making fun, scoffing, calling holy rollers nonsense, [music] everything you want to. God still said, "I will restore," said the Lord. And look at this. Just as sure as he raised Jesus out of the grave under three days, under three dispensations or three sections, he is going to raise the church to its fullness and power again. We have a promise from God. I will restore, saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I I thank God for his words. [music] As you all are quite aware here in South Florida, we used to do the the meetings uh here in in in July. Precious Brother Wesco was the one that would host [music] the meetings there, Rapturing um Rapture Faith Tabernacle. And and as you're aware, the Lord called [music] our precious brother Wesco home uh on last year, but I tell you, his influence is still felt in many of our lives. Amen. [music] He he taught us how to have services like this. And he would help try to create an environment, you know, where where God could move amongst his people. And that's what we've done. Amen. This weekend [music] is just trying to carry that forward. And and and the meetings that used to go, God said, "I will restore." So this is part of that restoration. Hallelujah. Amen. And we're come we're coming tonight under expectation. Uh I wanted to also just acknowledge uh this weekend we'll [music] have Sister Wesco with us. We thank God. We thank God for her. We truly thank God for her. And I uh I just uh wanted to just just ask [music] amen to just honor her space. Uh this is kind of like the first time she's coming out in in in in a in in a larger crowd like [music] this. And you know, and I know everybody probably want to just get with her and tell her how much you love her and and and and and just talk to her, find out how she's doing, but but just let her have her space if you don't mind. Uh let her just kind of get in where [music] she fit in. Amen. And just keep her in prayer. But we thank God for her. We thank God, Amen, for for what this area was established. [music] We thank God for Rapture and Faith Tabernacle. Thank God for that for the church that's still moving on in the name of the Lord. We thank God. Amen. So, as we come tonight, uh I just wanted to just introduce what the meetings were all about. And um and and I wanted to also put you under [music] the promise that you're going to eat in plenty and you're going to be satisfied. I promise you that this weekend, it's not it's actually not my promise. It's God's promise. [music] You're going to eat in plenty and you're going to be satisfied. But tonight, [music] I uh one of my uh deacons when we were preparing for the meetings, he he [music] just kind of kept asking me, he's like, "Brother Jack, can we do another night of worship?" We did it last last year and um you know, we had a wonderful time last [music] year. Um South Florida Choir, they they were awesome. They were awesome. [music] So when my deacon asked, I said, "Well, you know what? we'll we'll do our best to try to [music] assemble the choir again and and and and see what we can do to make this happen. And um I um I [music] called on brother Joe Underwood Jr. and and brother Paul Jean if they would just kind of help me bring everything together and and they did. Brother Paul was in the midst of uh they were expecting their second child, so he couldn't do as much. But Brother Joel took a a lead role in just really helping bring this [music] choir together and working with the musicians from we got them from multiple churches, the choirs from multiple churches here in South Florida. And I just appreciate [music] the unity and the fellowship, Amen, that we have here. I thank God for it. I thank God for it. So as we just [clears throat] uh prepare uh that I just want to read a scripture in regards to tonight um coming out of 2 Coronicles chapter 20. Verse 20 says, "And they arose early in the morning and went forth [music] into the wilderness of Takcoa." And I believe we have um there's an ensemble that's going to get this started tonight if they would make their way. Um I'll read the scripture. And they they arose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of Takcoa. And as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood [music] and said, "Hear me, oh Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be established. Believe his prophets, so shall you prosper." It says, "And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, and they went out before the army to say, and to say, praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever." And when they begin to sing and to praise the Lord, begin to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Amman, Moab, and Mount Sier, which would come against Judah and they were smitten. It's just something about the word of God a as as we worship and especially when you worship in a time of difficulty when you're going through great trials and tribulations and distresses but you make a choice that I'm going to worship God right through the midst of that. You know what happens is that you actually begin to you begin to give your enemy mind battles &gt;&gt; because he wondering how can you worship when you're going through all that? How how can you praise God when you ain't got no money in your pocket? Because I know the God that's going to put money back in my pocket. That's why I can praise him. But he, the Bible says he set ambushments against the enemy. Your your praise can bring a release in your spirit. So as as they went to battle, we'll see something here. Let's keep reading in the Bible. Um verse uh uh 22 again. It says, "And when the when they began to sing in the praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Sier, which were come against Judah and and they were smitten. And the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Sier utterly to slay and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Sier, everyone helped to destroy another. And when [music] Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and behold, there were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped. Now watch this. And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance, both riches with the dead, uh they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away. And they were three days in gathering of the spoil. It was so much that mean they experienced [music] an overflow. &gt;&gt; But all this happened after the people begin to worship and they begin to praise the Lord. And and as we're getting ready for this weekend, what we want to do is have this night of worship where we just prepare our hearts for what God's going to do this weekend. [music] And and I always say this, when the choir comes up to sing, uh you're not the audience, you actually are the worshippers. They're going to put the words up here for you. So sing along with the choir. Let's just have one big night of worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But our audience is the Lord Jesus Christ. And we come to worship him. We come to praise him. We come to exalt him. So tonight as the choir would come and amen just enter take [music] us into this time of worship. I pray that you would en enjoy amen. The songs that have come and and that you would enter in and also worship right along with them. God richly bless you. Welcome [music] to the 2025 meetings. I'll restore saith the Lord. [music] Do you see? [music] [music] [music] Did you keep your hands [singing] [music] on me? Always wanting [music] [singing] [music] [music] My [singing] soul, [music] you keep your hands [music and singing] on me. Always want [singing] me.

I did 12 [music] songs and 11 of those songs was written by my precious mother, Sister Ellen Burs. [music] And and uh certainly thank God for her. My sister uh my daughter, my nephew, they all got together and collaborated and and kind of created the music uh for this this project. [music] And just a little story behind it, mama wrote most of these songs roughly 20 to 25 years ago. Uh [music] they have been sitting in a folder and uh some of it some of the songs that's [music] there are um uh there's songs about my journey into ministry and just trying to find the will of God before I moved out into [music] ministry and just struggling, you know, with the calling that God placed in my life. And uh so she wrote songs through those those that [music] time period of my life as I was having conversations with her uh God would just birth these songs. And now 23 years [music] later uh the ministry is uh we thank God that you know he he won the wrestling match. And uh uh but [music] 23 years later we look back and um and we say finally finally finally we have peace. Finally we have joy. [music] Finally, amen. We we we we we are doing what God has called us to do. Uh so [music] I have some CDs here tonight.

[music] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's times [singing] I don't spend enough time with you, Lord. But &gt;&gt; I love you, Jesus. [music] Jesus, &gt;&gt; I worship. &gt;&gt; I worship and [music] adore. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, &gt;&gt; just want to tell you, &gt;&gt; Lord, I love you.

Maybe you didn't get to tell them this week. Now's your chance to tell them. I love you, Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; I worship and adore you. Just want to tell you [music] more than anything. Maybe you forgot to tell him last night before you laid down said, "I love you, Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; I love you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I worship and adore you.

Say, "Lord, I love you [music] more." One more time from the bottom of your heart. Lord, I love you more. Lord, I love [music] you more than anything. &gt;&gt; Somebody give him a praise tonight. Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [music] There's nothing about there something about just worshiping him and let him know how much you love him. He's proved his love to us when [music] he went to the cross and died for our sins. Some of us, we weren't even born, but he died before we were born. He made a way. I thank God for his great sacrifice at Calvary. We want to sing a song next. And we're going old school. [music] Some of y'all may remember this one, but I love it when we can sing the scripture. Sometimes we go through things in life. But Paul made [music] a statement says, "Be ye steadfast." And he said, "Unmovable, [music] always &gt;&gt; abounding &gt;&gt; in the work of the Lord." Then he says, "For as much as you know [music] your labor, It's not in vain. Turn around and tell your neighbor. Tell your neighbor. Say, "Neighbor, your labor [music] &gt;&gt; is not in vain. Heat. [music] [music] [music] Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I [music] [singing] [music] often [music] wonder why the clouds [music] seem to dim my sky. Even though I search [music] with hope and determination, so often [music] it turns to nothing but frustration. But when I kneel, I kneel down to pray. [music] Seems like I can hear the small voice of Jesus always seem to say [music] another way about me. [singing] Yeah. in the world. [music] [singing] He lost [music] [singing] in the world. [music] Sometimes [music] the way seems so very hard, [music] so much so [singing] I [screaming] can't seem to lie. But when I kn knowing right from wrong, seems like [music] I just can't get enough courage. Stand up and be strong. But when I kneel, I kneel [music] down to pray. Seems like I can hear the small voice of Jesus always seem to say [music] I'm movable always [music] found [singing] in the world [music] always [singing] in the &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's what you should know that your neighbor [music] your neighbor your neighbor [music and singing] is gone. Oh, your neighbor, [music] your labor, your labor [music and singing] is all your labor, your labor, your labor [music] is hang Hang on in there. Hang on in there. [music] Hang on in there.

Just got a couple more songs uh for tonight. And um the song is is [music] titled We Serve. We Serve. Amen. Heat [music] [music] up here.

[music] He is my [music] [music] father. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] [music] and you have no words to say. When you have no words to say. [music] He's able to [music] come and worship him. Use your voice to say, [music] "Come on, confuse the enemy tonight. Have the word." &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; For unto us a child is born, [music] and unto us a son is given, [music] and the government shall be [singing] upon his shoulder. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor. [music] Isaiah said, "The mighty God, the everlasting father, [music] and the prince of peace." Well, what makes him mighty? [music] Because he gets involved in things that only God can do. [music] You see, I'm reminded when the children of Israel came [music] into the Red Sea, the mighty God showed up. When Moses stretched out the rod, God opened up the Red Sea for the children of [music] Israel, but he closed it on Pharaoh and his army. He is a mighty God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I'm reminded of when he went to the grave of Lazarus. [music] See, he did something that only God could do at the grave of Lazarus. [music] He was man and he was God. He was man when he began to weep at [music] the grave of Lazarus. But the prophet told us that he was God when he said Lazarus [music] come forth. The prophet also told us that had he not called Lazarus by name that everything that was in the grave would have come out [music] because he is a mighty God. Yeah. [music] That's what he is. mighty. [music] I'm a I'm a mighty mighty [music] [music] mighty mighty God. [music] What a [singing] mighty God. What a [music] mighty God. [music] [applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
