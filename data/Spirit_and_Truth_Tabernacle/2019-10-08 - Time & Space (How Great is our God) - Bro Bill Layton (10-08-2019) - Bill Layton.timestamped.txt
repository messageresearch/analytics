[57:17] Thank You magicians you don't understand
[57:31] up there we go
[57:37] maybe we should have kept the musicians
[57:47] thank you brother Duff for that
[57:49] introduction I'm not worthy of that but
[57:52] God is certainly good to us and we've
[57:54] enjoyed our time we went we came from
[58:02] Jeffersonville and traveled to Byron
[58:05] Georgia for a wedding our nephew got was
[58:08] married to a young sister from Byron so
[58:12] brother Yancy asked me to speak there
[58:16] and I'd already called brother Jack
[58:18] before that but no was that far we'd
[58:20] like to come on down well I told him
[58:23] we'd be down last Monday and so we'll be
[58:28] leaving on the seventh but he got it
[58:30] Kenny Wampus so he had us coming in on
[58:34] the seventh instead of leaving on the
[58:36] seventh so but you know the Lord works
[58:39] things out his way and it was nice
[58:42] seeing brother Westco and his folks over
[58:44] Wednesday night I agree we had a
[58:47] wonderful time here and then went to
[58:50] brother jeans Thursday and oh my tow
[58:54] brother Jack because I preached three
[58:56] times on this trip and I'm so wore out
[58:58] the Lord is really the people have
[59:01] really pulled and to be honest it was
[59:03] the same sermon in all three all three
[59:05] churches I've just had it on my heart
[59:08] the importance of prayer I appreciate it
[59:10] brother
[59:12] Morris Bryant's in Sellersburg our
[59:14] priesthood at our church in our home
[59:17] church Sarat brothers Nathan's and
[59:18] priests you to brother Yancy's and
[59:21] preached it here and preached it over
[59:22] brother Jean so preached that same
[59:24] sermon
[59:24] five times but it's not the same sermon
[59:28] same scriptures same quotes but God
[59:31] leads you the different thoughts for
[59:32] different groups because he knows what
[59:34] each one needs but we've had quite a
[59:36] time and it's really maybe because I've
[59:39] gotten older but it really has the
[59:41] spirit being in the spirit like that has
[59:43] really drained me so I told brother Jack
[59:45] I'm not gonna preach real hard I don't I
[59:50] don't think that's after that importance
[59:56] of prayer it was some of it was kind of
[1:00:00] a hard my called a hard sermon you know
[1:00:02] kind of get on to the people and I don't
[1:00:06] I well anyway the Lord knows what he's
[1:00:09] doing so again trust it whatever was
[1:00:12] said was was great but Brenda and I went
[1:00:16] over some things yesterday and you know
[1:00:18] even for us you don't stop and think
[1:00:22] about different things that you've seen
[1:00:25] and heard really until you get to
[1:00:30] talking about it or somebody else does
[1:00:31] and all of a sudden that comes to your
[1:00:33] mind oh I remember this now remember
[1:00:34] they
[1:00:35] remember it's buried back there
[1:00:36] somewhere it's like the computer they
[1:00:38] say when you delete something it's not
[1:00:40] really deleted it's there you just you
[1:00:43] just have to have be a technician or
[1:00:46] whatever to know how to get into that
[1:00:47] computer in and dig those things out so
[1:00:50] it's kind of the way we are with with
[1:00:52] our minds sometimes it's there but the
[1:00:55] Lord has to bring it to the thought but
[1:00:59] sister Layton and I have we were about
[1:01:01] jump ahead of one of these we were we
[1:01:06] were married in February of 64 and we
[1:01:08] spent our honeymoon at brother branham's
[1:01:10] meetings down in Bakersfield which is
[1:01:12] where the area where I was from and I
[1:01:15] was from a little town outside of
[1:01:17] Bakersfield little town and one even of
[1:01:19] town but as a little spot in the road
[1:01:20] called weed patch and it was a weed
[1:01:23] patch so but we had that's where we
[1:01:27] raised it's a bunch of our keys and a
[1:01:29] bunch of Oh keys and you know came from
[1:01:32] there from into California to work and
[1:01:35] that's where my folks were most of them
[1:01:36] are from Oklahoma Brenda's family they
[1:01:39] were from Oklahoma and and in Arkansas
[1:01:43] so all just a bunch of country folks
[1:01:46] that God has brought along and we're
[1:01:49] really blessed so we spent our our
[1:01:53] honeymoon in the meetings in my it was
[1:01:56] really really wonderful to see brother
[1:01:58] be able to see brother Branham that was
[1:02:00] Bakersfield then we went to the Visalia
[1:02:02] meetings after that but I went to
[1:02:05] Vietnam and Brenda attended more
[1:02:06] meetings than I did came home when we
[1:02:09] were able to sit under the hey brother
[1:02:11] Douglas McHugh's his church we set and
[1:02:14] listened to brother Brandon by way of
[1:02:15] the telephone hookup and back then the
[1:02:18] long-distance telephone call cost a
[1:02:20] dollar a minute that was a lot of money
[1:02:22] back in 64 65 and you know so we really
[1:02:28] didn't they didn't start the
[1:02:32] listing on the phone until just a few a
[1:02:34] few minutes before brother random maybe
[1:02:36] like the last song they would would kick
[1:02:39] it in and then sometimes they didn't
[1:02:42] even have all the prayer line on there
[1:02:44] because it was getting expensive so
[1:02:45] they'd cut it off but nonetheless we
[1:02:46] heard the message but we got to talking
[1:02:49] about things yesterday and brother Duff
[1:02:51] asked if we would share a few things I'd
[1:02:57] like to start with with one Brenda's dad
[1:03:00] brother Mayfield brother Lawrence
[1:03:02] Mayfield gave his heart to the Lord in
[1:03:04] 1947 in Arkansas in brother Browns
[1:03:07] meetings and he went up repented went up
[1:03:11] went through the prayer line at that
[1:03:14] time he was still smoking but he went
[1:03:16] outside took his cigarettes out of his
[1:03:17] shirt pocket threw him under the car
[1:03:19] never picked him up again but only did
[1:03:23] he do that he went back into the meeting
[1:03:25] and I believe this is before the days
[1:03:27] that they had prayer cards but he was
[1:03:30] able to get back in the prayer line and
[1:03:32] go through it a second time and wooden
[1:03:35] brother branham got to him for some
[1:03:37] reason he stopped and he looked at me
[1:03:39] says what can I do for you brother and
[1:03:42] he says what brother branham he said I
[1:03:44] just wanted to come and thank you for
[1:03:46] what you've done for me and I'd like for
[1:03:49] you to pray for me that I would go all
[1:03:50] the way and brother Ram turned to the
[1:03:53] congregation and he says wasn't there
[1:03:56] ten lepers that were cleansed and yet
[1:04:00] only one returned to give thanks
[1:04:03] [Applause]
[1:04:06] that's not on tape Fitz brother
[1:04:08] Mayfield's testimony but then brother
[1:04:11] Brandon prayed for him and he went all
[1:04:14] the way he died in 90 years old still
[1:04:16] believe in the Word of God still follow
[1:04:18] the teachings of the prophet of God for
[1:04:20] our date then his time went along in
[1:04:27] 1959 in San Jose while brother Brandon
[1:04:30] was there they went to the meetings
[1:04:31] because they were from the San Jose area
[1:04:33] so they went there and brother Roy
[1:04:37] borders who was brother branham's
[1:04:39] campaign manager at that time attended
[1:04:41] brother McHugh's his church along with
[1:04:43] sister Helen borders his wife and
[1:04:47] brother borders was able to get since
[1:04:50] that's where that Mayfield's went
[1:04:52] further borders was able to get brother
[1:04:54] Branham to the back of the building
[1:04:56] where brother Branham came out at and he
[1:04:59] was able to speak to him for a couple of
[1:05:01] minutes or so and while I don't know
[1:05:03] what they talked about even brother
[1:05:05] Lawrence didn't remember but the one
[1:05:08] thing that he did remember was while
[1:05:10] they were standing there talking brother
[1:05:11] Branham you know he was standing beside
[1:05:13] him he said step a little closer brother
[1:05:15] so reached already put his arm around
[1:05:17] brother Mayfield and he said I was
[1:05:19] nervous and he said I looked over
[1:05:20] brother Branham and he said you know
[1:05:22] brother Branham I gave my heart to the
[1:05:24] Lord in your meetings and 19 everybody
[1:05:26] said he just said 46 brother Branham
[1:05:29] looked at him and said no brother it was
[1:05:31] 47 my point being to give you a deeper
[1:05:37] thought into that if you can go from 47
[1:05:40] to 59 that's 12 years and then try to
[1:05:43] imagine how many people were in the
[1:05:45] meetings in those 12 years the times we
[1:05:48] need to have 10 20 30 40 thousand people
[1:05:50] in meetings how many of those people
[1:05:52] went through in 12 years how many people
[1:05:55] went through the prayer life right so
[1:05:57] how would that man know it was 47
[1:05:59] instead of 46 because he was preaching
[1:06:02] in 46
[1:06:03] if I remember I brother Mayfield didn't
[1:06:05] tell him it was Arkansas he just said I
[1:06:06] gave my heart to the Lord in your
[1:06:07] meetings of 46 and brother Branham said
[1:06:10] no brother was 47 well we know who did
[1:06:13] that it wouldn't be man it was the God
[1:06:16] everything he brought it to him
[1:06:17] so then many of you may or may not have
[1:06:25] heard there was a story and brother
[1:06:26] Billy has told it far and wide of a man
[1:06:30] that took the church age book to work
[1:06:32] and gave it to his Foreman and the man
[1:06:35] read it I don't know if he read it all
[1:06:37] but he read enough of it he brought it
[1:06:39] back and he gave it to the man and he
[1:06:41] said here's your book back he said I
[1:06:43] don't want that book anymore and he
[1:06:45] asked him said well why not
[1:06:47] he said because that man in that book
[1:06:50] called me a vulture the man looked at
[1:06:54] him he said well that's strange
[1:06:55] he said that man in that book called me
[1:06:58] an eagle yeah
[1:07:00] well that man was Brenda's daddy brother
[1:07:04] Mayfield so just goes to show you we
[1:07:10] never know let's see in night April of
[1:07:16] 1965 sister Layton and her family I was
[1:07:20] over in Vietnam they went down to Los
[1:07:21] Angeles and tended the meetings down
[1:07:23] there and my son received march/april
[1:07:30] yeah my son was about a month old my
[1:07:32] oldest son and he was having troubles
[1:07:34] having normal bowel movements and brenda
[1:07:37] was having some problems from the birth
[1:07:39] they wouldn't think she got a prayer
[1:07:42] line and went through the line a brother
[1:07:44] branham didn't tell her her name or
[1:07:46] they'd say he was just like a fast line
[1:07:47] so he prayed for and they were both
[1:07:50] healed so now we've had some relatives
[1:07:58] that we know I'll reaches some quotes on
[1:08:02] these on in 1957 on a message entitled
[1:08:07] God in His Word in Oakland California
[1:08:10] brother Ram says this here's a lady said
[1:08:14] this will settle it for the whole
[1:08:16] group of you now that should have done
[1:08:18] it right there this will settle it for
[1:08:19] the whole group of you if you can
[1:08:21] believe lady if we're strangers to each
[1:08:24] other and God knows both of us do you
[1:08:27] believe the Lord can help me to know
[1:08:28] what your trouble what's your trouble

[1:08:48] like a tumor or cancer it's a big ol
[1:08:50] thing it'll hang it's just a big big
[1:08:53] knot that hangs off under the skin of
[1:08:56] your throat or wherever would be so you
[1:08:59] have a throat border and it never had an
[1:09:01] operation and it never did do right he

[1:15:01] husband they took it over native who
[1:15:03] kind of first time ever heard of it like
[1:15:04] that way but they were co-pastors but
[1:15:07] she was a minister and boy could that
[1:15:08] woman preach the dead were raised eyes
[1:15:11] were open dummy miracles done and she
[1:15:13] could preach I mean she could preach and
[1:15:15] God did use allow it and use it and
[1:15:18] worked miracles as brother Branham said
[1:15:20] it was his permissive will and not his
[1:15:22] perfect will
[1:15:23] but she went through the prayer line and
[1:15:25] brother mem says this lady or the lady
[1:15:27] is suffering with trouble with her eyes
[1:15:29] that was pretty obvious because she was
[1:15:31] pretty much cross sighted and she wore
[1:15:33] glasses so like he said about em Jesse
[1:15:37] you know the heel you can see he's got
[1:15:39] glasses on okay she has trouble with her
[1:15:41] eyes but she not only wore glasses she
[1:15:43] had trouble with her eyes she had
[1:15:46] trouble with her eyes and bits bothering
[1:15:48] her and she's got back trouble that's
[1:15:50] bothering her and she's nervous
[1:15:52] extremely nervous right
[1:15:54] isn't that right if that's right and
[1:15:56] raise your hand say another thing you're
[1:15:58] you're a minister of some sort but
[1:16:00] you're you're like you're a woman
[1:16:02] preacher that's what it is now believe
[1:16:05] with all your heart and go and you can
[1:16:07] have what you asked for that woman's
[1:16:09] name was Rita
[1:16:10] Dawson co-pastor of the first Jesus name
[1:16:13] Church and wheat patch California which
[1:16:16] was my pastor before because I was in
[1:16:20] the service at that time and we just
[1:16:22] come into the message was down there for
[1:16:24] the meetings and anyway we spent our
[1:16:29] time read and I spent our time at their
[1:16:30] house and attended the meetings and they
[1:16:32] went to him also I said I wasn't there I
[1:16:35] was too there I'm sorry it was done that
[1:16:37] was February of when we were there all
[1:16:40] right some things have been told because
[1:16:45] I've been blessed to leave Tucson after
[1:16:49] I'm sorry to leave California after I
[1:16:51] got home from the service and I always
[1:16:54] thought it was not always but here

[1:17:51] out of it what you want I just think
[1:17:52] it's kind of neat let me see in speaking
[1:17:58] and living in Tucson I was we were
[1:18:00] blessed to to get to know a lot of the
[1:18:02] the brothers that brother Graham speaks

[1:18:14] which brother branham talks about he
[1:18:15] called him hick we all did and brother
[1:18:19] Roy Roberson brother Roy borders oh my
[1:18:23] brother brother Soph Minh brother Fred
[1:18:26] Saltzman brother Welch Evans and sister
[1:18:32] Evans trying to pull these names up I

[1:19:18] brother Richard Blair his wife is still
[1:19:20] alive she lives in Tucson
[1:19:21] I mean in Jeffersonville so we were you
[1:19:25] know that and many others we were
[1:19:26] brother brother sister man we were
[1:19:29] blessed
[1:19:30] brother green brother Douglas McHugh's
[1:19:34] brother man speaks as what was our
[1:19:35] pastor in California and then then in
[1:19:38] Tucson have removed
[1:19:39] there for a while we went to brother
[1:19:41] greens and we built a church and those
[1:19:45] of us that came from California went
[1:19:46] there and no no disrespect to brother
[1:19:50] green we just went because those are
[1:19:52] pastor but we did enjoy our time with
[1:19:55] brother green he was quite quite an
[1:19:57] amazing man which I had the memory he
[1:19:59] did but anyway my point was I've heard a
[1:20:03] lot of different stories about brother
[1:20:04] Branham and I I wish I could I wish we
[1:20:07] had cell phones so you could have
[1:20:09] recorded them back in those days but and
[1:20:11] we didn't write them down and things but
[1:20:12] certain ones stick with you one of my
[1:20:14] think that that impressed me from
[1:20:16] everybody was the fact that brother
[1:20:17] Branham was the most humble man they'd
[1:20:19] ever met I'm both loved everybody and it
[1:20:22] was true they all said you couldn't tell
[1:20:24] us his enemies from his friends if we
[1:20:28] only we could all do do that but one
[1:20:31] thing they saw about Hummel now we all
[1:20:33] know brother Branham talks about how he
[1:20:35] could walk and he community walk miles
[1:20:36] and miles and miles on the power lines
[1:20:38] and stuff as and in the Conservancy and
[1:20:41] so forth and he could out walk anybody
[1:20:43] in the hunting or the fishing party and
[1:20:46] but brother Branham was always whenever
[1:20:49] climbing mountains and going camping or
[1:20:51] getting up going up to there's a place
[1:20:52] he was always the last one up the
[1:20:54] mountain and when they came back down he
[1:20:57] was always the last one down the
[1:20:58] mountain and he did that because he said
[1:21:01] he told him he wanted to make sure that
[1:21:02] everybody got up and back down safely
[1:21:05] nobody left behind nobody hurt so even
[1:21:09] though he could out walk him he let
[1:21:11] everybody beat him one of the other
[1:21:14] things that I thought was neat brother
[1:21:16] Green was telling me about that that
[1:21:18] brother branham when they would play
[1:21:21] darts
[1:21:22] he and brother branham he said brother
[1:21:24] Adam never did win
[1:21:26] since brother green said he always he
[1:21:28] always lost but then he said we got to
[1:21:31] noticing that when brother Brandon would
[1:21:33] be over there be over by himself and
[1:21:35] just throw it at the dartboard himself
[1:21:36] he hit a bull's eye every time so he
[1:21:41] said Billy's that purpose in my heart
[1:21:43] cuz he told me this I purposed in my
[1:21:44] heart that I'm gonna make brother
[1:21:46] Branham win he's what you know what he's
[1:21:50] had to get up here and I throw it - he'd
[1:21:52] throw one he said I could even make him
[1:21:55] win city wasn't competitive so you know
[1:22:02] like with a gun I mean now that he did
[1:22:04] that for his Spurs hunting and stuff he
[1:22:06] was a probably one of the best shots you
[1:22:08] ever heard of but yet he wasn't boastful
[1:22:10] were you know he didn't use it to make
[1:22:12] himself some big fellow so that's fine
[1:22:15] but I got one the last one I'll tell
[1:22:17] which is I told it to the pastor and we
[1:22:20] all I laugh every time I tell it it's a
[1:22:22] story of the of the onion sandwich the
[1:22:25] wild turtle and David wood as it banks
[1:22:28] Woods son and brother David is still
[1:22:30] alive he's in Jeffersonville they was on
[1:22:33] a hunting trip and sitting around a fire
[1:22:37] you know of a morning getting ready to
[1:22:39] go hunting and so forth and when they
[1:22:41] got ready to leave brother Brennan stood
[1:22:42] up put on his coat and David and Ronnie
[1:22:44] Evans and Ronnie and I were real close
[1:22:46] brother well Kevin's son we were real
[1:22:48] close friends and he told me this story
[1:22:50] because he was there with it with him
[1:22:52] and said that David hollered out at
[1:22:56] brother branham's and oh brother branham
[1:22:57] he said I fixed you a sandwich and I put
[1:22:59] it in your coat pocket so brother him
[1:23:02] said okay David said thank you and off
[1:23:04] he went hunting well is the day went
[1:23:07] long brother Adam decided it was time to
[1:23:08] eat he sat down under a tree somewhere
[1:23:10] and he pulls out that sandwich and lo
[1:23:12] and behold he's got a great big thick
[1:23:15] slice of onion and two pieces of bread
[1:23:20] the onion sandwich and he ate it
[1:23:24] he liked onions but that's still I don't
[1:23:28] apparently I would what he was expecting
[1:23:29] but thank God they got back to the camp
[1:23:32] and brother Ram didn't say anything the
[1:23:34] day progressed the evening and all the
[1:23:36] brothers they all sat around the farm
[1:23:38] they would talk and they would talk and
[1:23:39] have a good time to jump over to one
[1:23:41] thing first but before it goes here they
[1:23:44] always said it that when they were doing
[1:23:45] that they didn't when brother Brad would
[1:23:47] reach over and pick up his Bible and
[1:23:48] stand up and walk around to the other
[1:23:51] side of the fire everything changed
[1:23:54] everybody got quiet and then he would
[1:23:56] spend the next half hour hour to
[1:23:59] whatever he wanted to do and just talk
[1:24:00] to the brothers
[1:24:01] well this at that time this night he
[1:24:03] hadn't done that but they were sit
[1:24:06] around just having a good time a bunch
[1:24:08] of brothers together and the boys got
[1:24:12] tired I think they were 17 something
[1:24:14] like that 16 17 right in there in 18 but
[1:24:18] Ronnie and Ronnie Evans and David wood
[1:24:22] decided they were gonna go to bed so
[1:24:24] they went to the 10 they told her buddy
[1:24:25] goodnight and as they got to the tent
[1:24:27] well excuse me
[1:24:29] before that time earlier in the evening
[1:24:31] I forgot one part brother Brown looked
[1:24:33] over after a while and he told David he
[1:24:35] said David I'm gonna get even with you
[1:24:37] for that onion sandwich David just left
[1:24:40] yeah sure brother Ram ha ha yeah yeah
[1:24:42] yeah yeah you know how young guys are oh
[1:24:44] yeah sure you are so the evening went on
[1:24:47] nothing else was said they have is just
[1:24:49] having their fellowship the voice said
[1:24:51] good night they went to bed and they
[1:24:52] just kept talking so them didn't say
[1:24:55] anything and they skipped oh I don't
[1:24:56] know how long it was but the boys were
[1:24:58] asleep so brother Brandon gets up he
[1:25:01] goes over to where he had hidden this
[1:25:02] wild turtle whatever they call him
[1:25:05] tortoise turtle whatever it is and he
[1:25:07] picks it up he goes in the Tim and David
[1:25:10] was late David was laying there and had
[1:25:11] his shirt off and he's laying there and
[1:25:13] he was sound asleep so brother Ram takes
[1:25:15] his turtle and drops it on his chest
[1:25:16] grabs that sleeping bag and pulls it up
[1:25:18] over his head zips him up in there
[1:25:21] and he walks out goes back sits down by
[1:25:24] the placard a few minutes later David
[1:25:26] finally gets out of that sleeping bag
[1:25:28] and he comes out his chest is all
[1:25:31] scratched up and he's kind of bleeding
[1:25:32] not real bad but you know you it's kind
[1:25:34] of thin in there and your chest will
[1:25:36] bleed pretty easy and brother I'm just
[1:25:38] stood over there just he hauled he said
[1:25:39] I told you I'd get even with you black
[1:25:41] or that onion sandwich people say wait
[1:25:46] you say this man is a prophet and he'd
[1:25:48] done that yeah he was a man listen this
[1:25:53] is what I appreciate about meeting all
[1:25:55] of these men and I heard these dogs a
[1:25:58] lot of stories which I can remember at
[1:26:00] this time about brother Branham I found
[1:26:01] out that he was a man 100% man just like
[1:26:07] you and I yeah the same feelings he you
[1:26:11] know he was happy and he was sad he was
[1:26:13] on the mountaintop and he was on the you
[1:26:15] know he went through all kinds of things
[1:26:17] just like we do
[1:26:18] he lied to was a man of life black
[1:26:20] passions are lying and so forth so
[1:26:22] listen it was a man yeah but he was he
[1:26:25] was in the office of a prophet but that
[1:26:27] man loved to tell jokes
[1:26:28] he liked to pull pranks he liked
[1:26:31] laughing he was it he was a husband he
[1:26:34] was a father he was a brother he was a
[1:26:37] friend he was a minister he was a
[1:26:40] prophet but he was all of those offices
[1:26:43] but he was a man but in the office of
[1:26:47] the prophet of God sent to this age so
[1:26:51] the Prophet did I think any less of him
[1:26:53] because of this thing about the terms of
[1:26:55] why he shouldn't have done that I don't
[1:26:57] know I might have done worse than that I
[1:26:59] don't know but I'm just saying I thought
[1:27:03] it was funny yeah hey they didn't pull
[1:27:05] any more pranks on brother Adam I tell
[1:27:06] you what
[1:27:09] yeah it was funny and it didn't injure
[1:27:12] him in that sense it just scratched him
[1:27:14] up yeah yeah I'm sure we've some husband
[1:27:16] scratched worse than that and that you
[1:27:19] know he scratched him up and he bled a
[1:27:20] bit and brother Ram then everybody
[1:27:22] thought it was funny brother grant
[1:27:23] thought it was funny so yeah it was it
[1:27:25] was good so my point was that he was a
[1:27:27] man because I've been around long enough
[1:27:30] to see a lot of people are most people I
[1:27:32] should say they've never had these
[1:27:34] opportunities that Brendan I did they
[1:27:37] that they get the opportunity I mean the
[1:27:39] idea in their head of the bullpen and a
[1:27:42] man standing in the pulpit expounding on
[1:27:44] the Word of God revealing the Word of
[1:27:47] God as a prophet of God and they've got
[1:27:49] a one-dimensional view that's God's
[1:27:52] prophet and that's all they can see but
[1:27:56] if they will listen he would say funny
[1:27:58] things in his servant ya know he would
[1:28:00] tell funny things that happen but most
[1:28:03] of them they ignore all of that and
[1:28:04] they're so concentrated on on the
[1:28:06] offices that he was in that they forget
[1:28:08] that he was a man yeah I mean it was a
[1:28:12] man that said it tell him I'm not here
[1:28:15] because he got so stressed out he
[1:28:17] doesn't he couldn't handle it it'd be so
[1:28:19] busy but he had to go make that right
[1:28:21] that showed that the Holy Ghost it was
[1:28:23] ending what he made it right when he
[1:28:26] couldn't even pray for the baby because
[1:28:27] that was hanging over him and he had to
[1:28:29] go make it right I was concerned about
[1:28:31] the man having less respected he's I
[1:28:33] have even more respect for you because
[1:28:35] you would come and make it right and
[1:28:37] then God answered his prayer yeah but
[1:28:40] I'm just so he was a prophet but he was
[1:28:42] also a human being and he also filled
[1:28:44] all of these other offices I know my
[1:28:47] great grandson told me one time he says
[1:28:49] you're different when you're church
[1:28:50] that's what
[1:28:52] yeah I'm different because I'm a deacon
[1:28:54] and I'm a minister but I'm stand at the
[1:28:56] door or or or upon the platform as a
[1:28:58] deacon I'm the policeman of the church
[1:29:00] when I'm in that office I got to be in
[1:29:01] that office right when I'm behind the
[1:29:03] pulpit preaching I stepped from a deacon
[1:29:05] I'm not a deacon now I'm a minister I'm
[1:29:07] out on the field I'm an evangelist and I
[1:29:09] go overseas I'm a missionary
[1:29:11] if I'm teaching a class I'm in the
[1:29:13] office of a teacher yeah I said but when
[1:29:15] I'm home I'm grandpa all right and I'm a
[1:29:18] husband and I'm dad
[1:29:19] but at the same time you want to talk
[1:29:21] about the Bible I shift gears and I go
[1:29:24] back into being a preacher or a teacher
[1:29:25] I said yes I am different active because
[1:29:28] I have to act or going to the office do
[1:29:32] you think a policeman can be a policeman
[1:29:34] 24 hours a day he's hired 24 hours a day
[1:29:37] but when he comes home mama don't want
[1:29:39] to hear this stuff about hey lady you're
[1:29:41] doing this and hey lady you're doing
[1:29:42] they stop doing it hey you're my
[1:29:43] sweetheart you're my husband you're my
[1:29:45] lover you're my friend let's be that way
[1:29:49] you're gonna stuff up over there are
[1:29:52] wrongs now if some of a burglar comes in
[1:29:54] you get that if you stay under that
[1:29:56] always of a policeman see but when you
[1:29:59] hear your daddy and your house night
[1:30:00] sorry you've got a fulfill that office
[1:30:04] we've got to go from one and sometimes
[1:30:06] it sometimes it's hard to shift from
[1:30:08] from one to the other but if you do what
[1:30:12] you have to do all right trust that you
[1:30:15] like those few things that we had to say
[1:30:20] a few things we've seen and don't don't
[1:30:25] do as it's been said I served this with
[1:30:28] the pastor don't take it as as it's been
[1:30:33] said boy which one do I preach on Jack
[1:30:41] anyway don't uh don't take it as it's
[1:30:45] been said before overladen really thinks
[1:30:46] he's something but he get no I didn't
[1:30:48] say all that to think of somebody I just
[1:30:51] said it the pastor asked me to share
[1:30:52] some of these things and Brendan I
[1:30:54] talked about him and we looked ahead to
[1:30:55] go find some of these quotes because I
[1:30:57] knew where they were but I didn't you
[1:30:59] know you don't just carry him now I got
[1:31:00] him I guess so I'll have him the point
[1:31:02] is I said because I'm your brother
[1:31:07] and I just want to share some of the
[1:31:08] things not because I'm anybody because I
[1:31:11] am your brother
[1:31:12] don't make me anything except blessed
[1:31:17] God bless me by being able to meet these
[1:31:20] men and talk to them and be friends with
[1:31:22] them and know them and here are a few
[1:31:23] things and there's people probably out
[1:31:25] there like 80 bits Kohi knows a whole
[1:31:27] lot more and I did dude Jer hear the one
[1:31:30] about brother branham driving through
[1:31:31] the mountains without his hands on the
[1:31:32] steering wheel say so I mean paddy
[1:31:36] bisko's seen a whole lot more and I have
[1:31:38] Billy Paul seen more than any of us so
[1:31:41] he you know I'd love to hear his stories
[1:31:43] over and over and over and over they
[1:31:44] never get old but brother Eddie tells
[1:31:47] the one about brother Branham they were
[1:31:49] driving through the mountains in Canada
[1:31:50] brother Ram started pray and he said
[1:31:52] next thing you know he said brother
[1:31:53] branham's this way
[1:31:57] and they'd he said I looked over he said
[1:31:59] I dared him to say a word he said just
[1:32:01] sat there didn't even move and that car
[1:32:04] is just going around the curves the
[1:32:06] mountain brother rambling say for about
[1:32:08] 15 minutes driving up through there
[1:32:11] brother Hammond had his eyes closed
[1:32:12] praying and his hands up and then also
[1:32:16] when his done he took the wheel start
[1:32:19] never said a word just like you know I
[1:32:21] was going
[1:32:24] I don't really know be honest I don't
[1:32:28] know why kill a man
[1:32:30] that was before Tesla I just thought of
[1:32:40] that one time I put a man in space and
[1:32:45] we've had a man in space for 2,000 years
[1:32:47] although it's not a 10 liter by Tesla
[1:32:49] man we had a Tesla drew by the Holy
[1:32:51] Ghost
[1:32:52] [Applause]
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:58] all right you raise the Lord all right
[1:33:02] friends I trust that'll encourage you
[1:33:05] I'm not gonna preach a hard sermon this
[1:33:07] morning
[1:33:07] I've already did that Wednesday night
[1:33:08] and I'm told brother Jack Anderson
[1:33:11] Mentos those three sermons that same
[1:33:13] sermon three times with the Spirit of
[1:33:14] the Lord falling on me like it it's just
[1:33:16] it's taken a lot out of me oh I could
[1:33:19] preach it again but you know what I
[1:33:20] think I just kind of like to cruise
[1:33:22] through this morning if the Lord let me
[1:33:24] I think I'm gonna preach on because been
[1:33:28] singing these songs about our great God
[1:33:30] or he's if what was the first song you
[1:33:32] lit waymaker yeah yeah waymaker
[1:33:37] never changes never know you know just
[1:33:39] wait maker the several songs that kept
[1:33:41] they both sermons were live up I had one
[1:33:43] two of them here Berta said well I got
[1:33:46] one entitled God super mall Berta said
[1:33:50] well I didn't get to go shopping so
[1:33:51] maybe you ought to preach that one
[1:33:54] I've seriously thought about it then the
[1:33:57] other one is time and space our Great
[1:34:00] God or how great our is our God however
[1:34:02] you want to call it and you just keep
[1:34:04] going back to that one how great is and
[1:34:06] he said though some of the songs that
[1:34:07] were saying this morning I thought you
[1:34:09] know Lord if that's it then we'll start
[1:34:12] with that one if you don't like that one
[1:34:13] can stop me I'll go to the other one you
[1:34:16] know I had that happen up at brother
[1:34:18] Leopards right I was preaching up there
[1:34:20] spent a long time ago I was preaching up
[1:34:22] there for brother Palmer lipfird in
[1:34:23] Middletown Ohio and I was just preach in
[1:34:25] and just I just wouldn't get anywhere it
[1:34:28] all sudden I just stopped and I said you
[1:34:30] know what folks this isn't gonna work so
[1:34:33] I just pulled out my notes one another
[1:34:35] for another sermon and started with that
[1:34:37] one that's what the Lord wanted I'd say
[1:34:39] one time I've ever had that happen to me
[1:34:41] but I do I try to to follow him and I
[1:34:46] know you've had much better preachers
[1:34:47] and I in here so just bear with me if
[1:34:50] you'd stand we'll try to get right into
[1:34:53] this it's already what five after 12
[1:34:55] already oh my I better hurry brother
[1:34:58] Jeffrey let's see what time service
[1:35:02] tonight Oh
[1:35:04] so I preached to force everything right
[1:35:06] no I'm just kidding with you let's
[1:35:09] approach the master before we do this
[1:35:14] Heavenly Father as we come now and try
[1:35:18] to settle down and break the bread of
[1:35:19] life to your children we spoken of
[1:35:22] brother Branham and the things that that
[1:35:25] he has happened and some of the things
[1:35:27] that we have seen and the things we know
[1:35:29] that as we talk to people before so it
[1:35:32] wasn't the man that did those things it
[1:35:34] was you you using the man and in him
[1:35:37] tore through him that you did him it
[1:35:40] wasn't Moses that brought water from the
[1:35:43] rock it wasn't Moses that opened the Red
[1:35:45] Sea it was you it wasn't Moses it
[1:35:49] brought flies and fleas and turned the
[1:35:52] waters of blood or split the city in
[1:35:54] darkness and and all these things the
[1:35:57] miracles that were done Moses did him
[1:35:59] yes Lord but it wasn't the man Moses it
[1:36:02] was you
[1:36:02] man they did it and father that's the
[1:36:05] way it was with his was excuse me Lord
[1:36:08] that's the way it was was brother
[1:36:09] branham when he walked the face of the
[1:36:11] earth
[1:36:11] it wasn't the physical man that did it
[1:36:14] it was you living in the man no more
[1:36:17] than if the any one of us here was to
[1:36:19] pray for someone and they would be
[1:36:21] healed
[1:36:21] we didn't heal him you did it but you
[1:36:25] used man to do these things now father
[1:36:28] we come this morning after telling some
[1:36:30] things that we've seen and heard and
[1:36:33] people that we know that was healed and
[1:36:36] some of the services to raise you up
[1:36:40] before the people because it was you may
[1:36:43] you get the glory from those stories and
[1:36:46] father's we come with this little sermon
[1:36:48] is a lesson you take control I've
[1:36:52] already committed myself and and
[1:36:54] whatever you wanted me to say unto you
[1:36:57] unto you the Lord helped me to move out
[1:37:00] of the way and you just take it and you
[1:37:02] get the glory for it and I thank you in
[1:37:05] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:37:07] I want to read Genesis 1 and then I want
[1:37:15] to read Hebrews 1 Genesis 1 the first
[1:37:20] five verses and then what I did here
[1:37:26] with my Hebrews but I've got Hebrews 1 1
[1:37:31] through 10 but I've only got the second
[1:37:33] verse I think I made a mistake and just
[1:37:34] what is to the second alright in the
[1:37:37] beginning God created the heaven and
[1:37:38] earth okay Wow
[1:37:44] I see brother Jack you know we all make
[1:37:47] mistakes and an amazing Hebrews 1:1 all
[1:37:50] right then we go to John 1 in the
[1:37:53] beginning was the word the Word was with
[1:37:54] God and word was God in the beginning
[1:37:58] was the word the Word was with God in
[1:37:59] the Word was God
[1:38:01] and the same was in the beginning with
[1:38:02] God and all things were made by him and
[1:38:05] without him was not anything made that
[1:38:08] was made and in Hebrews 1 and said
[1:38:13] verses says hath in these last days
[1:38:15] spoken us to and to us by his son whom
[1:38:17] he hath appointed heir of all things by
[1:38:20] whom also he made the world and world's
[1:38:24] and may God at His blessing to the ends
[1:38:27] of his word may be seated please
[1:38:32] many times I looked this over and I
[1:38:34] still realized I typed in a couple of
[1:38:37] things but that's all right
[1:38:38] Lord knows all about it one thing when I
[1:38:45] was in the service and I still like to
[1:38:47] do it to find but you know I looked at
[1:38:49] that motel room last night and talking
[1:38:53] about this little message with Brenda I
[1:38:56] said we could just turn out all the
[1:38:58] lights get rid of all the light
[1:39:00] pollution around the city we could
[1:39:02] really see the stars one thing I enjoy
[1:39:05] being on a ship in the Navy was we could
[1:39:08] get out in the middle of the ocean or
[1:39:10] the only lights you can see it would be
[1:39:12] the ones on the top of the mast and you
[1:39:15] talked about seeing some stars you know
[1:39:18] if you can get out away from the city
[1:39:19] whether it's in the mountains or the
[1:39:21] desert and get away from all the city
[1:39:23] lights or light pollution as they call
[1:39:25] it you can really see the handiwork of
[1:39:27] God and so I want to read a quote then
[1:39:35] I'm trying to just wait and see where
[1:39:36] the Lord wants me to go with this as the
[1:39:38] eagle stirreth her nest in 1960 brother
[1:39:42] Branham says this go out some night and
[1:39:45] look up at the solar system see that's
[1:39:47] what I like to do go out some night and
[1:39:49] look up at the solar system he said
[1:39:51] here's some time ago I was taken up to
[1:39:53] Mount Palomar that's in California and
[1:39:57] there through a glass you could see a
[1:39:59] hundred and twenty million light years
[1:40:00] of space
[1:40:02] figure it up how many miles is it and
[1:40:06] how how many and how fast does like
[1:40:09] travel a hundred and ten 20 million
[1:40:13] years of light space and beyond that was
[1:40:16] still moons and stars
[1:40:19] and world's How Great Thou art How Great
[1:40:24] Thou art
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:37] now I feel better
[1:40:41] so brother Graham said figure it up -
[1:40:45] when I started on this little little
[1:40:48] lesson this little sermon now if anybody
[1:40:51] in here is better at math than I am and
[1:40:53] probably most all of you so if I made a
[1:40:55] mistake on my numbers just as I say take
[1:40:59] me for what I mean not for what I said
[1:41:00] all right but I've tried to get them
[1:41:03] correct the speed of light is 186,000
[1:41:06] 282 miles per second
[1:41:12] that's about 670 million 616 - 629
[1:41:18] million miles in an hour all right it's
[1:41:21] about 16 billions 794 million seven
[1:41:24] hundred ninety nine thousand and 99
[1:41:26] miles in one day while truckers can't
[1:41:29] even do that a lifetime yeah and that's
[1:41:32] about six trillion miles in a year
[1:41:34] that light will travel no brother Ram
[1:41:39] said spoke of looking through a
[1:41:40] telescope and seeing a hundred and
[1:41:42] twenty million light years and he said
[1:41:46] and beyond that was still just think as
[1:41:48] far as they could see now this is back
[1:41:50] in the sixties now they got the Hubble
[1:41:52] and I don't know how far they claim they
[1:41:54] can see with that but farther and
[1:41:56] they've seen a lot of amazing things but
[1:42:00] he said and beyond that was still stars
[1:42:02] moons stars moons and worlds yeah and he
[1:42:06] said how great thou art how great thou
[1:42:08] art on true Easter seal in 61 he says
[1:42:12] now if you'll notice I was standing here
[1:42:14] not long ago at Mount Palomar California
[1:42:16] and I was noticing that the telescope
[1:42:18] that can see a hundred and twenty
[1:42:20] million light-years of space now think a
[1:42:23] hundred and twenty million light-years
[1:42:25] of space how many miles that would be
[1:42:27] broken down to yet but yet heaven is so
[1:42:31] many billions and billions and billions
[1:42:34] of light-years beyond that till it's not
[1:42:37] even thought of how would we get there
[1:42:43] it's the travel it'll be like with the
[1:42:46] mind it'll be so fast it'll be faster
[1:42:48] you can think of heaven and that's how
[1:42:51] quick could be there Jesus after he was
[1:42:53] resurrected came right through the walls
[1:42:56] right through the doors and stood and
[1:42:59] eat boiled fish and honeycomb hallelujah
[1:43:02] speed no sooner than life had gone out
[1:43:05] of this body and were in the presence of
[1:43:07] God younger
[1:43:08] we only know his feet inches yards miles
[1:43:11] and so forth we're in this earthbound
[1:43:13] system but what when we leave here
[1:43:15] brother oh my what a time now we talk
[1:43:21] about the speed of light 186,000 + miles
[1:43:26] per second six trillion miles in a year
[1:43:29] if you're gonna go 120 million light
[1:43:33] years out there I wish I had a
[1:43:36] blackboard or some but I can't do it
[1:43:37] you'd have to look at it this way how
[1:43:40] far is that 720 quin trillion miles 720
[1:43:48] with 18 zeros I didn't even know that
[1:43:51] number existed said that would be equal
[1:43:55] if my figures are right that would be
[1:43:57] equal to taking 15 billion 69 million 66
[1:44:01] thousand five hundred and fifty five
[1:44:03] round trips to the moon back we couldn't
[1:44:08] live that long if you're gonna do a
[1:44:11] round trip of it you're gonna go out 120
[1:44:13] million and come back 120 billion and I
[1:44:15] just figured this one out last night ask
[1:44:17] Brenda what's after Quinn trillion why
[1:44:21] you look it up there is a number after
[1:44:23] Quinn trillion but I did Bob was a
[1:44:25] million dollars boggles me let alone
[1:44:27] this of this size okay and I see
[1:44:34] round-trip of 120 million light years
[1:44:37] how many miles that's 1 sextillion 440
[1:44:41] Quinn trillion miles my Lance and beyond
[1:44:46] that right just think brother branham
[1:44:50] told us before they even had the Hubble
[1:44:52] and before science really knew he said
[1:44:54] there was men
[1:44:55] ian's of solar systems out beyond and
[1:45:01] then they found that out yeah they're
[1:45:03] finding more and more I was explaining
[1:45:05] to Brenda last night when I looked out
[1:45:06] the window I said just think when we
[1:45:08] look up and we go out and we look up in
[1:45:10] space and even with the telescope when
[1:45:13] they take that telescope and they look
[1:45:17] up in space do you realize that they're
[1:45:19] limited on what they're seeing out there
[1:45:21] they may starting to telescope ever how
[1:45:24] big that thing fits over their eye but
[1:45:26] when he gets out there sure it may be
[1:45:27] multi millions of miles across right
[1:45:30] there but they're looking there what
[1:45:32] about up there what about down there
[1:45:34] about over there what about over there
[1:45:36] what about down there what about down
[1:45:38] there see they're seeing one I don't
[1:45:41] know what word I say dimension I don't
[1:45:42] think it's that mentioned I look at one
[1:45:44] quadrant one area but they've got all
[1:45:48] the space and if you turn that telescope
[1:45:49] and look here then what about all of
[1:45:51] that over there what about all that over
[1:45:53] there you're looking in that area and
[1:45:55] what you're seeing is all those stars
[1:45:56] yeah all of those planets all of those
[1:45:59] moons all of those solar systems that
[1:46:02] are out there and yet it's it's it's in
[1:46:04] a great big I guess I've got it right
[1:46:07] space is like a great big bubble or a
[1:46:10] great big ball but it isn't without even
[1:46:13] brother branham said but we've often
[1:46:14] wondered if you go if you could travel
[1:46:16] fast enough and far enough and get to
[1:46:18] shall we say the end of space over there
[1:46:21] that back wall what's beyond that
[1:46:24] nothing all right cuz God didn't make
[1:46:27] anything beyond that but when we talk
[1:46:30] about how big space is time and space
[1:46:33] and travel then I want you to think of
[1:46:35] this Brigham says and then the Bible
[1:46:37] says that God fills all of time and
[1:46:41] space that's how great God is how did
[1:46:45] all of that get there oh one great big
[1:46:48] explosion really well maybe it was an
[1:46:51] explosion but not the way they explained
[1:46:53] it
[1:46:54] it may have exploded all for something
[1:46:56] and exploded all for God's hands and he
[1:46:59] blew it out through there
[1:47:00] as brother branham described he watched
[1:47:01] that thing go down through there to fly
[1:47:03] through space seize it for about a
[1:47:05] million miles then he reached out there
[1:47:06] and he stopped it yeah he liked where
[1:47:09] that one was so then there was another
[1:47:10] one and another one and another one so
[1:47:13] they say in the beginning here's the
[1:47:14] point oh you know I was raised that way
[1:47:16] oh god made heavens on earth in six days
[1:47:19] all right
[1:47:20] no he didn't and to beginning God made
[1:47:24] the heavens and the earth and then after
[1:47:28] that he formed what was on the earth
[1:47:30] that was six days we all know that I
[1:47:32] think all of us do but how much time did
[1:47:35] he take he could have known it I believe
[1:47:37] in one split second if he wanted to but
[1:47:39] he took his time and he drew that map
[1:47:41] out there he laid it all out in it
[1:47:43] everything is just there and every star
[1:47:45] every planet every Sun hangs in its
[1:47:48] place and does not move out of its place
[1:47:52] brother man said about one planet out
[1:47:54] there be it ever so far moved out of its
[1:47:57] orbit and started moving it would upset
[1:47:58] the whole thing now apply that
[1:48:02] spiritually to you in the church if you
[1:48:06] will keep your place think about it
[1:48:09] everything will work just like he's
[1:48:11] supposed to but if you step out of your
[1:48:14] place it's gonna upset the whole church
[1:48:18] it upsets the whole operation of God
[1:48:21] it's like myself I'm a minister but in
[1:48:24] my home church I'm a deacon I cannot
[1:48:26] take out of deacon and step over say
[1:48:28] well I'm gonna be pastor we've got a
[1:48:31] pastor God didn't put me in there to be
[1:48:33] pastor he didn't send me down here say
[1:48:36] all right brother Jack
[1:48:37] God send me down here you're out and I'm
[1:48:39] in will guess what brother Layden God
[1:48:44] need more couple things on that one
[1:48:46] cuz I'm Cillian you see how it is that's
[1:48:50] the way the planets are
[1:48:51] that's the way God's church operate
[1:48:53] brother branham taught us that don't try
[1:48:55] to take the other man's position stay in
[1:49:00] a position where you were called if
[1:49:02] you're a sole leader and not not that
[1:49:03] bastard then stay some leader if you're
[1:49:06] a deacon to stay a deacon
[1:49:08] if you're a pianist or musician say a
[1:49:10] musician if your trustee stay a trustee
[1:49:12] if you're a prayer warriors take a
[1:49:14] prayer boyer you're the pastor stay the
[1:49:17] pastor stay in your position and stay in
[1:49:20] prayer as I said the other night and the
[1:49:22] church will work in harmony but what if
[1:49:25] one person get out of line step out of
[1:49:27] their position and it takes the whole
[1:49:29] thing and turns it into a tumult it just
[1:49:32] won't work right because something said
[1:49:34] it's like going down the road with that
[1:49:36] we your tires have to be balanced they
[1:49:39] put wheels our have weights on the
[1:49:41] wheels in and they got that harmonic
[1:49:42] balancer where they can spin it and they
[1:49:44] know where to put it exactly where to
[1:49:46] put the weights on now most of the men
[1:49:47] know that maybe the women too anymore
[1:49:49] they're so smart with these things but
[1:49:51] and that was a compliment not another
[1:49:54] but you're on a tour of your mark but
[1:49:57] the thing is I'm saying it's one of
[1:49:59] those weights be it ever so small come
[1:50:02] over that wheel and you can tell it with
[1:50:04] yours if you're paying attention you can
[1:50:06] tell it when you're driving because
[1:50:07] something doesn't feel quite right you
[1:50:09] get just that little vibration in the
[1:50:11] steering wheel well I can happen in a
[1:50:13] church have you pay attention to stay
[1:50:15] tuned into God and tune into where
[1:50:17] you're going and what you're doing you
[1:50:18] can feel something's not quite right
[1:50:19] something's a little nervous
[1:50:21] something's happened I don't know what
[1:50:23] maybe don't know exactly what it is
[1:50:24] Omar then what do you do you go back to
[1:50:26] Wednesday night
[1:50:27] pray pray pray pray I gotta say tonight
[1:50:32] one brother I'll be alright but I'm just
[1:50:36] saying if we've got to stay where God
[1:50:38] puts us no it's not even in my note so
[1:50:40] don't ask me why I don't know that was
[1:50:41] for his brother Nathan said I don't know
[1:50:44] what that was for alright listen let me
[1:50:48] go we get back on track we're talking
[1:50:49] about how far to travel Oh
[1:50:51] my point is can you imagine just in your
[1:50:53] mind our great God how great is he I
[1:50:59] told Brenda as I talk about all that
[1:51:00] time point what but about that and dad
[1:51:02] and that girl they'd seen that area what
[1:51:04] about all the rest of this that you
[1:51:06] can't even see what's out beyond what
[1:51:08] that telescope will see what are they
[1:51:11] gonna come up with that telescope that
[1:51:12] brother Brian said they could look
[1:51:13] through that and they'd look around and
[1:51:15] because light bends and because a space
[1:51:18] is not it's not without in they'll look
[1:51:20] and they'll be looking and they'll be
[1:51:21] looking at the back of their head I read
[1:51:24] here a few years ago where they said
[1:51:25] they've already found a planet out there
[1:51:27] that they believe it is exactly like
[1:51:29] Earth
[1:51:30] I've brought to my mind other oh I
[1:51:33] wonder if they are looking at earth but
[1:51:35] they just don't realize it but they need
[1:51:37] something a little stronger
[1:51:38] we'll see I could be wrong it's just my
[1:51:41] thoughts on that that in hand twenty
[1:51:43] dollars against you some deed maybe as
[1:51:47] an eagle Woking sarpy true Easter seal
[1:51:54] 1961 I've already read that one didn't I
[1:51:57] so many miles broken down and that that
[1:52:00] figured out and break it down that's
[1:52:02] what got me on this and I said I did
[1:52:03] that or the best I could
[1:52:04] so let's do the world falling apart the
[1:52:10] world is again falling apart in
[1:52:12] Shreveport 63 now Einstein I was
[1:52:15] listening to a lecture of him here the
[1:52:17] other night in New York City that he
[1:52:20] made in one of his last lectures and he
[1:52:22] was talking about a constellation a
[1:52:24] little galaxy it was out in the in the
[1:52:26] constellation and he said if man started
[1:52:29] through space traveling at the speed of
[1:52:31] light and he said what is that a 8000 or
[1:52:34] something somebody said 100
[1:52:36] 6,000 all right 186,000 miles per second
[1:52:39] it would take him a hundred and fifty
[1:52:41] million light years to get there
[1:52:43] he found eternity then he said to come
[1:52:46] back it would take him another hundred
[1:52:48] another hundred and fifty million of
[1:52:51] years which would be 300 million years
[1:52:54] and the space that he was gone from
[1:52:57] Earth would only be about 50 years
[1:52:59] that's Einstein said there you are broke
[1:53:02] into attorney oh my the greatness of God
[1:53:05] and when he made the whole solar system
[1:53:08] do it you're saying most of us sitting
[1:53:10] on earth don't realize when we look up
[1:53:13] and we see all of these stars and we
[1:53:16] think it's saying it is wonderful do you
[1:53:18] realize all you're doing is looking at
[1:53:19] our part of the galaxy it's a Milky Way
[1:53:23] and you can have the Milky Way and you
[1:53:25] say well here it is there's the Milky
[1:53:27] Way but guess what we're down here we're
[1:53:29] down right down down here in this little
[1:53:31] neighborhood then we got all the rest
[1:53:34] and what's out beyond that and what's
[1:53:36] beyond that and what's beyond that and
[1:53:38] all of it God Himself made by his own
[1:53:43] word spoken into existence and he
[1:53:45] started learning I don't know how many
[1:53:47] millions billions trans or Quinn trans
[1:53:49] or sex trillions of years it took but it
[1:53:52] God had a no beginning no end so we
[1:53:54] don't have to worry about that but he
[1:53:56] made it all friends that's what I'm
[1:53:57] trying to get it he is such a great God
[1:54:00] that he could do all of that and I asked
[1:54:03] Britain I said then why is it if we can
[1:54:06] ever catch that vision that idea that
[1:54:09] revelation if you would I don't mean
[1:54:10] ideal in that sense with that revelation
[1:54:12] and that vision of how great God really
[1:54:15] is that he can make all of that then we
[1:54:23] can't even get healing for a headache
[1:54:29] we can't darn get increase my faith God
[1:54:33] and I can get
[1:54:34] whatever I need for whatever I said
[1:54:37] whatever I need he said what so ever you
[1:54:42] desire whatsoever you have need of
[1:54:46] speaking in faith believing and I will
[1:54:50] bring it to pass
[1:54:52] here we Center you oh I don't know I
[1:54:58] don't know you know I know God healed
[1:55:01] brother so and so on I know he heals
[1:55:03] sister son sir but what about me
[1:55:05] well what about you he's a great gunner
[1:55:08] you his child if you're his child he
[1:55:10] will heal you he will bring it to pass
[1:55:13] where there's today tomorrow next week
[1:55:15] next year he said I will do it what we
[1:55:19] have to do is hold the faith that no
[1:55:21] matter what it looks like
[1:55:22] what brother branham teaches don't look
[1:55:25] at the symptoms look at the author look
[1:55:29] at the promise look at the words God
[1:55:31] said I am THE LORD thy God that healeth
[1:55:34] all thy diseases he said I am THE LORD
[1:55:37] thy God that healeth all thy diseases
[1:55:38] and he will do it but you have to hold
[1:55:43] on to reach out there grab that thing
[1:55:45] and hold on to it don't let go of it
[1:55:48] keep it
[1:55:49] there I don't care you say well it's a
[1:55:51] bottle half empty or half full
[1:55:53] why don't carries got water in it lot

[1:56:07] dying man that being the other pasture
[1:56:08] locally

[1:56:13] blaspheme the Holy Ghost ania I can't I
[1:56:15] can't serve God I can't be saved because
[1:56:18] I blaspheme how did he blaspheme some
[1:56:20] some women it said some derogatory
[1:56:22] comment about something about the Lord
[1:56:25] about the Bible and he read a variety
[1:56:27] about it he belly blast famed I said
[1:56:30] well tell me something Cody I said do
[1:56:32] you want to serve God he's laying in the
[1:56:34] hospital it'll die do you want to serve
[1:56:36] God he said well yeah I want to serve
[1:56:38] God I said tell me something you say you
[1:56:40] blaspheming then why do you bother he

[1:56:44] Testament read it and read it and read
[1:56:47] it and read it and read it and read it
[1:56:49] over and over that's it you would say

[1:57:09] yeah that's it brother branham tata said
[1:57:12] if you ever try speed the Holy Ghost you
[1:57:14] wouldn't care because the story of the
[1:57:16] woman the last thing just sit
[1:57:18] there or stand there watch her mother

[1:57:27] want to serve God as a new heaven
[1:57:30] blaspheme you may have told them women
[1:57:34] all but maybe they deserve it but you
[1:57:35] did not make fun of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:38] they were wrong and you told him in no
[1:57:40] uncertain terms maybe you were right
[1:57:42] maybe you were wrong but you did not
[1:57:44] bless him because if you had you would
[1:57:46] want to serve him well about that time
[1:57:53] the little nurse earth of what you call
[1:57:55] a door what if she comes in with this
[1:57:56] big old thing sets a big pitcher of
[1:57:59] water on there on his table across his
[1:58:03] lap the pastor looks at that water and
[1:58:04] he looks into you know Cody
[1:58:06] he said servant God just like that water
[1:58:10] there's a glass sitting there and then
[1:58:13] that carafe or what have you call that
[1:58:15] thing he said you could either tell you
[1:58:16] reach out there and pour you a drink
[1:58:18] you're in a desert diet of thirst
[1:58:21] you can pour yourself a drink and take
[1:58:23] it and live or you can sit there and
[1:58:26] look at it and die right there
[1:58:36] thing was three months later he went
[1:58:38] home but he had three months he come out
[1:58:41] of that hospital he went he worked for
[1:58:43] American eyelid I have islands oh boy
[1:58:45] it's gonna be good
[1:58:46] American Airlines he was a steward where
[1:58:52] God like the Union steward he was known
[1:58:55] as a troublemaker because he didn't take
[1:58:58] no guff off of the off of the the
[1:59:00] establishment he fought for everything
[1:59:02] he'd give you know they're the rights
[1:59:04] accorded the rules he just boom when
[1:59:05] they didn't like seeing Cody come but in
[1:59:10] that next three months that he had he
[1:59:11] went back he went to everybody he could
[1:59:13] think of that he'd never rolled through
[1:59:14] brought him to I made it right he
[1:59:16] witnessed for God everywhere he went he
[1:59:18] read his Bible can still read his Bible
[1:59:20] but he lived a different life he talked
[1:59:22] to different life he acted a different
[1:59:23] life and I did this funeral and it was
[1:59:25] 400 people are almost all up from his
[1:59:27] work and everybody every one of the
[1:59:29] company said there was something
[1:59:31] different about Cody
[1:59:32] he changed said we don't know what
[1:59:34] happened but something happened to him
[1:59:35] and he changed it was not the same man
[1:59:37] he was before he went into that hospital
[1:59:40] because I preached and told him you
[1:59:41] wanna know what it was it was cause he
[1:59:43] accepted Jesus Christ and on the inside
[1:59:45] was the Holy Ghost and he had changed
[1:59:47] because of that and you want to do that
[1:59:49] you want to be like him
[1:59:50] then you accept the same God that he did
[1:59:53] [Applause]
[1:59:55] but he went home but I don't gonna see
[1:59:57] you again what is it it's what you're
[2:00:01] looking at and how you look at it the
[2:00:03] same people that can hear the same
[2:00:05] message we haven't said huh oh well you
[2:00:07] know I know there's a look at it and
[2:00:09] live because they believe it they can
[2:00:11] pick up the same Bible to read the same
[2:00:12] scripture and get a different
[2:00:14] interpretation a different idea or
[2:00:16] decided don't apply to them or don't
[2:00:18] apply anymore but the same God that made
[2:00:21] the universe humph team billions or
[2:00:23] trillions or quad trains or sex trades
[2:00:25] or whatever it was years ago it's still
[2:00:27] the same
[2:00:28] today they say his word doesn't change
[2:00:30] and he don't change what brother Graham
[2:00:37] said world falling apart again he says
[2:00:39] then this astronaut the other day now
[2:00:41] most of you weren't even alive during
[2:00:43] this time 1963 they talk about Russian
[2:00:47] astronaut that send a cosmonaut up and
[2:00:49] he got up there and I remember this
[2:00:51] reads headlines in the paper Roshan an
[2:00:53] astronaut said he couldn't find God in
[2:00:55] space couldn't find him on the earth
[2:00:58] either this astronaut the other day
[2:01:01] flying over around over Russia there and
[2:01:03] he said he's seen no God angels and
[2:01:05] Brent said how ignorant can people be he
[2:01:07] said when when God and the whole system
[2:01:09] whole solar system he bloated off his
[2:01:11] hands and he sits so many million
[2:01:14] light-years beyond that Wow
[2:01:16] to sing God's it's beyond everything
[2:01:18] he's made there somewhere out there that
[2:01:20] is the seed of God and that's where he's
[2:01:22] at but being out there he's still here
[2:01:25] yeah because he fills all the time in
[2:01:27] space and he knows what we needed when
[2:01:29] we needed it how we need it and he is a
[2:01:31] long time God all right and the whole
[2:01:35] thing is upheld by what by his power and
[2:01:38] his word and every start is as the quote
[2:01:41] I was referring to and every start has
[2:01:42] to hang in it in its place yes sir then
[2:01:45] was humble enough taking of God then he
[2:01:47] was humble enough to come down and be
[2:01:48] made one of us to die for us we're
[2:01:52] without excuse if one of them stars what
[2:01:55] happened to move from its socket from
[2:01:56] its orbit where it is at if it would
[2:01:58] move it would affect the whole solar
[2:02:00] system this whole system would must turn
[2:02:03] exactly the same for one depends on the
[2:02:06] other
[2:02:07] Sun state about the Church of God
[2:02:09] whether it's a local assembly here or
[2:02:12] the world assembly across town where the
[2:02:14] whole assembly no kotoba focus
[2:02:16] down in Bullington every local assembly
[2:02:18] in Jeffersonville we've all got to be
[2:02:20] working insects working together and
[2:02:22] plywood
[2:02:23] what are we Sam what are we uh what's
[2:02:27] our orbit around the Word of God we've
[2:02:30] got to stay around and stay that
[2:02:32] everybody's gotta stay in this place
[2:02:33] everybody's got to stay in this place
[2:02:35] everybody's gonna do what they're
[2:02:36] supposed to do they've gotta stay with
[2:02:37] that word of God and constantly mood in
[2:02:40] the spirit of God in the leading of God
[2:02:41] he is so great that he has set the
[2:02:43] church in order but the churches
[2:02:45] sometimes refuses to get in order they
[2:02:48] want to step out and do their own thing
[2:02:49] they want to step out into well I think
[2:02:51] I've got a better way well that was that
[2:02:54] was the old devil zeal no Satan's old
[2:02:55] thing - I've got a better way I'm gonna
[2:02:58] lift myself up and I'm gonna be like God
[2:03:00] your nose he didn't say he was gonna be
[2:03:01] God he said I'm gonna be like cut
[2:03:03] through the most high well he couldn't
[2:03:06] he be like him alone with him so he had
[2:03:08] a pervert his word to do anything but
[2:03:12] that's the way the many of them are even
[2:03:13] around the message for instance is why
[2:03:15] the other night I was telling the people
[2:03:16] staying with watch you her stay with the
[2:03:18] taste
[2:03:19] stay with the Bible stay with the
[2:03:21] revealed word stay with that no matter
[2:03:23] what I don't care who preaches it with
[2:03:24] me me her brother brother Doug or any
[2:03:27] other ministry comes through if it rings
[2:03:29] off with this little off sound you're
[2:03:31] not quite sure get back to the word and
[2:03:32] find out maybe you misunderstood maybe
[2:03:35] the brother misunderstood but something
[2:03:37] if it's not ringing right it's got to be
[2:03:39] checked out know what brother man preach
[2:03:40] on the uncertain sound we've got to make
[2:03:43] sure we're all in tune with the Word of
[2:03:44] God into but the Spirit of God doing
[2:03:47] what God wants when God wants it and how
[2:03:49] God wants
[2:03:50] if he's a longtime God he expects us to
[2:03:53] be on time we've got to move in unison
[2:03:56] with him about all these spirits and
[2:04:04] several he's in here about that I see we
[2:04:10] read this one it's a paradox in 64 down
[2:04:13] here in Tampa said a few days few weeks
[2:04:16] ago I was in New York City at the Mars
[2:04:17] auditorium and I heard this tape of
[2:04:19] Einstein talking about that of that
[2:04:21] galaxy how how many if we left here and
[2:04:24] when I think was 150 million light-years
[2:04:26] of travel and traveling at the speed of
[2:04:27] light would take us 150 million years to
[2:04:30] get over there and then 150 million
[2:04:32] years to get back now you know how fast
[2:04:34] light travels and just think of it a
[2:04:36] hundred and fifty million years light
[2:04:38] years what if you'd run a row of nines
[2:04:40] around the world around and around and
[2:04:42] around the world you'd never break it
[2:04:44] down in years just nine nine nine closer
[2:04:47] closer all around the world you couldn't
[2:04:49] break it down to news four just like I
[2:04:50] think like travels what is 186,000 miles
[2:04:54] a second and a Lightyear and so forth in
[2:04:57] 300 million years trying to pair it up
[2:04:59] as you and you know how long then it'd
[2:05:01] been gone from Earth to 50 years Wow
[2:05:04] it's hard to hard to comprehend in this
[2:05:07] you can travel 300 million light-years
[2:05:10] and whoops get back up there I lost my
[2:05:16] place I keep doing that ever soft all
[2:05:18] right
[2:05:19] maybe that's good
[2:05:31] they said um who is who is God in
[2:05:33] Cleveland in 1950 brother man said he is
[2:05:35] so first he is he was God Jehovah and
[2:05:38] out of him said just picture now a
[2:05:41] little drama so you can get it let's
[2:05:43] let's see some coming coming out of
[2:05:46] space where there's nothing and make it
[2:05:50] a little white light like a mystic light
[2:05:52] like a halo and that was the logos that
[2:05:55] went out of God in the beginning that
[2:05:57] was the son of God that came out of the
[2:05:59] bosom of the Father that was what was in
[2:06:01] the beginning was the word and the Word
[2:06:04] was with God and the Word was God and
[2:06:06] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[2:06:07] us in the beginning was God and then out
[2:06:10] of God came the logos a part of God that
[2:06:13] went out of God let us notice this now I
[2:06:16] have to make this before going back into
[2:06:18] it just like a little drama here for you
[2:06:20] for a moment in order to get one point
[2:06:22] to you what is in our midst tonight I
[2:06:27] could ask that what's in our midst this
[2:06:28] morning if we just enter into it and in
[2:06:31] there so now see this is like a little
[2:06:34] child playing before the door it was the
[2:06:36] son of God the logos he didn't say it
[2:06:39] was a little child he said was like a
[2:06:41] little child and I can see him there and
[2:06:45] he spake that's why he said that's why
[2:06:47] in the first I said in the beginning was
[2:06:49] the word words lose God Word was God and
[2:06:51] he made everything but then you go there
[2:06:53] he said and by Christ he made everything
[2:06:56] so the light which was God so himself in
[2:07:00] that light that was God that was a part
[2:07:03] of God it was that light from there
[2:07:04] spoken and made everything let there be
[2:07:06] light
[2:07:07] he said there was nothing but there was
[2:07:09] something happen and an Adam turned
[2:07:11] there and began to whirl around this
[2:07:14] away and the son come into existence and
[2:07:16] he said let there be said there's the
[2:07:18] authority where did it come from I don't
[2:07:21] know there was nothing to make it from
[2:07:23] but he believed his own word and there
[2:07:25] was light and I could see a piece of it
[2:07:27] fly off like that it was a meteor in a
[2:07:29] few hundred a few
[2:07:31] years or a hundred million years if you
[2:07:33] want to call it and it's circle way out
[2:07:35] and I see him standing there watching it
[2:07:37] and it falls down in here and he stops
[2:07:39] it after it falls for a few million
[2:07:41] years he'd listen hang there in orbit
[2:07:43] here goes another one flying off the Sun
[2:07:45] and it goes over that it hangs down and
[2:07:47] he stops it what's he doing writing his
[2:07:50] first Bible notice the first human
[2:07:52] beings at once looked up into the
[2:07:53] heavens he put all the stars in the
[2:07:56] heavens the zodiac starting off with the
[2:07:58] Virgin in him with Leo the Lion first
[2:08:00] coming of Christ the second coming of
[2:08:02] Christ
[2:08:02] came by the Virgin came again by as the
[2:08:04] Lion of the tribe of Judah there he put
[2:08:06] his first Bible and back in those days
[2:08:08] the Ancient of Days they looked at those
[2:08:10] things there and he's got his Bible
[2:08:12] wrote here and he wrote it in the
[2:08:14] heavens that man would look up and
[2:08:16] realize that Jehovah the Creator lived
[2:08:19] above and I can see him and he looked at
[2:08:22] that and I can see him to speak this
[2:08:25] speak this world hanging there as an as
[2:08:28] an icicle whatever it was on the way
[2:08:30] whatever it was way away and he moved it
[2:08:34] over there and I can see this little
[2:08:35] light go out now we got to now the
[2:08:38] father and out of the father came the
[2:08:40] light the Sun and I can see that light
[2:08:43] moving over and pulled the earth over
[2:08:45] here near the Sun to dry off and begin
[2:08:48] to raise the waters up and separating
[2:08:50] the land from the water and so forth
[2:08:53] oh my think of it God Himself doing all
[2:09:00] of this making things said where did it
[2:09:02] come from I don't know but he believed
[2:09:04] his own word were they created it of
[2:09:08] nothing but he knew that he had the
[2:09:12] power to do it he was all mighty Jove at
[2:09:15] that time he wasn't God he was Jehovah
[2:09:17] he was at all self-existing one that
[2:09:20] existed within himself until he made
[2:09:22] something to worship Him what do you got
[2:09:24] worship then he became our God see so we
[2:09:27] go down through this then this God
[2:09:29] this great God that brother Graham kids
[2:09:31] talk about this great God that the Bible
[2:09:33] and all the prophets keep talking about
[2:09:35] this great God that we say we worship
[2:09:37] this
[2:09:38] Great God that we say we believe in yet
[2:09:40] we can't reach out and believe for what
[2:09:43] sometimes not a to thing not a headache
[2:09:46] not a handi not a leg a wheel didn't
[2:09:49] feel a little but I've got cancer well
[2:09:50] what's that cancer - God

[2:10:08] couldn't do a thing poor turn Russ and
[2:10:10] you're hopeless get on out of here
[2:10:11] but when she came across God's prophet
[2:10:14] and he discerned God showed him what it
[2:10:16] was and he discerned that in there and
[2:10:17] then he spoke the word she was pure
[2:10:20] because God that made the body can
[2:10:22] cleanse it and cure it soon and he did
[2:10:24] and she lived pouring from that day
[2:10:26] forward to seek God can do these things

[2:12:43] looking at the trees and all the
[2:12:44] different things and the weeds and then
[2:12:46] all these different things that was

[2:12:50] is and how much we loved him and how
[2:12:53] much it all said it serve rollabout

[2:15:08] it it was ours listen we own I don't
[2:15:12] know we've mad a hundred people at that

[2:15:37] along will deduct every time that this
[2:15:40] battalion that's my tithing okay what
[2:15:42] are you gonna do I know the I got a loan
[2:15:43] app and said all you have to do is take
[2:15:45] your time just pay it back as you can I
[2:15:47] don't even know who the two men were
[2:15:49] none of my business 30 I'm not here to
[2:15:55] preach because once you see what I'm
[2:15:58] trying to do is build your faith he's
[2:16:01] serving great God our brother man to say
[2:16:05] somewhere on tape and I don't know where
[2:16:07] so anyway he talked about if you're
[2:16:10] needing money
[2:16:10] he said God can lay I'll cross the other
[2:16:12] side of the world or the other side of
[2:16:14] the country
[2:16:15] lay it on somebody's heart and one day
[2:16:17] you walk out to your mailbox and there's
[2:16:18] a check in there sure brother Joseph was
[2:16:24] one to fix up Stillwater's camp didn't
[2:16:27] have the money to do it
[2:16:28] that brother from the Ukraine I think
[2:16:30] it's the countries from hope there was
[2:16:32] Hannah had been having trouble with his
[2:16:33] crops it was gonna go broke because his
[2:16:35] crops kept failing his crops kept
[2:16:37] failing
[2:16:37] he promised God that if you'll restore
[2:16:39] my crops and let me make you do good
[2:16:42] my crops and so forth I will support
[2:16:43] anybody you want me to support I'll help
[2:16:47] him miss god help him and help him he
[2:16:49] come down to Jeffers a pill for some
[2:16:50] reason I can't remember I know my wife
[2:16:52] does but I can't remember right now and
[2:16:54] he was sitting there and he brother
[2:16:56] Joseph came over and got to talking to
[2:16:57] him and he looked at my brother Joseph
[2:16:59] and he says what can I do for you
[2:17:00] brother Joseph he said I'm glad you
[2:17:02] asked thank come with me
[2:17:05] sure took him out to the lake he told
[2:17:08] this is my vision this is what I want to
[2:17:09] do he said
[2:17:10] do it I'll support it everyone here
[2:17:14] every year every year every year every
[2:17:17] year he's supporting it he says why
[2:17:20] people go to camp free cuz he's
[2:17:21] supporting it and he supported all the
[2:17:23] other stuff so what is it God has a man
[2:17:25] someplace somewhere or a group of people
[2:17:28] that you really wanted God can give it
[2:17:30] to you but what is your buck I told the
[2:17:32] pastor what's your reason for one night
[2:17:34] you gotta have the right reason it's not
[2:17:38] to walk around say well look at us
[2:17:39] that's wrong look what God did for me I
[2:17:41] mean we're really somebody we're really
[2:17:43] special we ain't nobody might be five or
[2:17:48] six foot of the dirt that's all it is
[2:17:49] and when we plan to send the ground we
[2:17:51] know better than the rich man and he's
[2:17:52] no better than us see I'm serious but
[2:17:55] when God this great god I've been
[2:17:58] telling you about when you get sincere
[2:18:00] when you get serious when you get
[2:18:02] desperate this great God will come on
[2:18:05] the scene he did what he tell them what
[2:18:08] he tells sister Hedy right he said you
[2:18:10] would ask anything you want anything you
[2:18:13] want a million dollars gonna put it
[2:18:15] there you want to what your sister
[2:18:16] healed
[2:18:17] she'll be healed she's out with my boys
[2:18:19] the one thing you would last through
[2:18:21] eternity the salvation of her two sons
[2:18:23] money would be gone the sister would die
[2:18:26] sooner or later a new here maybe get
[2:18:27] sick again but the point is she wanted
[2:18:30] to salvation to her boys so why do we
[2:18:32] want a bigger church because we want a
[2:18:34] place that can be dedicated to God
[2:18:38] so we don't have to listen this up I was
[2:18:40] here when they first started worldly
[2:18:42] garbage going on they want to call it
[2:18:43] church a church but it sounds kind of
[2:18:48] like I mean does forgive me look they're
[2:18:56] worshiping God the only way they know
[2:18:57] how okay so we are in reality we should
[2:19:00] feel sorry for them they don't see what
[2:19:03] we see
[2:19:05] they don't have what we had
[2:19:08] Lord can you save them that's what
[2:19:10] that's the way I really feel God I I'm
[2:19:12] sorry they have to go through that
[2:19:14] listen my grandson Whitney's got a
[2:19:17] little girlfriend he would okay place up
[2:19:19] there called southeast Christian oh
[2:19:22] that's farther undermine
[2:19:30] southeast Christian yeah grab your
[2:19:33] coffee and your doughnuts and go able to
[2:19:35] sit down in the sanctuary and drink your
[2:19:37] coffee and eat your doughnuts come as

[2:20:00] hard rock rock rock rock there's nothing
[2:20:01] no Christianity about it just devil
[2:20:03] music is all this and yet that's what
[2:20:06] they like third they're trying to
[2:20:08] worship God in that and what'd she tell
[2:20:09] Andrew said do you like this don't you
[2:20:11] like that music he said no she said why
[2:20:13] he tried to explain to her about singing

[2:24:05] and a place for it and then there's the
[2:24:07] time to replace what God loses nothing
[2:24:08] but the Word of God and repentance is
[2:24:10] done and he leaves his tongue and signs
[2:24:12] and partners and miracles are done why
[2:24:14] because he's a great God about as far
[2:24:19] off my message as the moon is from the
[2:24:21] earth who's that feller so does anyone

[2:25:14] goddamn more Fame asked in the pillar of
[2:25:16] fire goddamn or faiien him in a man

[2:25:21] church
[2:25:22] hello Saints well hundred make you shout
[2:25:26] got it more from you in his church but
[2:25:30] it's a holy God what one is the Holy
[2:25:32] Ghost I've heard bees all over the Holy
[2:25:34] Ghost and God we meet no no what is God
[2:25:36] he's spirited what is God he's holy oh
[2:25:40] did you know wandering one still makes
[2:25:42] to Holy Spirit oh we I know we Pentecost
[2:25:47] call him the Holy Ghost well he's not a
[2:25:50] ghost in that sense but he is the Holy
[2:25:52] Spirit we understand what he's saying
[2:25:54] right God in us God with us God in us
[2:25:59] God above us the condon sending god god
[2:26:03] that was so great that he could come
[2:26:05] down amongst us think about it God they
[2:26:08] created all of this God they've done all
[2:26:11] of this yet he come in a human body
[2:26:14] because he loved us so much that he knew
[2:26:17] because of the fall of Adam and Eve that
[2:26:19] he we couldn't make our way back on our
[2:26:20] own it had to be one brothers head had
[2:26:22] kinsman redeemer he had to come down and
[2:26:26] become a kinsman redeemer a human being
[2:26:28] and suffer like we suffer the same
[2:26:31] temptations the same things that he went
[2:26:34] through and yet loved me and you so much
[2:26:36] that He gave His life for us and hung on
[2:26:41] a cross
[2:26:42] but then he proved he was God like
[2:26:43] brothers and when he died he was man and
[2:26:46] it proved he was man but when he
[2:26:47] resurrected he proved he was God that
[2:26:51] same God thing what'd he do then he
[2:26:52] ascended up on high cities
[2:26:54] very spirit down to the church on the
[2:26:56] day of Pentecost so they could be filled
[2:26:58] with his spirits and live his life and
[2:27:02] that's what we're supposed to do the
[2:27:04] same God that made the whole creation of
[2:27:07] heavens and earth and stars and Suns and
[2:27:09] moons in solar systems and planets and
[2:27:11] then come down to this earth here and
[2:27:13] dried it off and put all the trees and
[2:27:15] and everything else that we see in the
[2:27:17] plants and the animals and everything
[2:27:18] else on here that same God then became
[2:27:21] one of his own to bring us back into
[2:27:26] fellowship with him yeah and then people
[2:27:27] want to sit home on Sunday mornings say
[2:27:29] well I don't know if I can get up and
[2:27:31] make it down there and listen to some
[2:27:33] man I don't blame him for not listening
[2:27:36] to me but the point is go to church in
[2:27:38] fact I just heard brother man say this
[2:27:40] morning go to church somewhere so listen
[2:27:43] one at the motel go to church somewhere
[2:27:46] all right he came down then up there
[2:27:48] there was no up there holy no one can
[2:27:51] touch him he settled upon the mountain
[2:27:52] and even if an animal touched him out he
[2:27:55] had to die but God come down and changed
[2:27:57] his tent and came down and lived with us
[2:27:59] became one of us we held him the Bible
[2:28:04] said in first Timothy 3:16 without
[2:28:06] controversy there's no arguments without
[2:28:08] controversy great is the mystery of God
[2:28:11] for God was manifested in the flesh
[2:28:13] handled with hands eat meat drank water
[2:28:15] god slept God cried God was one of us
[2:28:18] beautiful typed in the Bible that God
[2:28:20] was above us
[2:28:21] God Witness and now it's God in us the
[2:28:25] Holy Spirit not the third person the
[2:28:27] same person God came down became flesh
[2:28:30] and died the death in in Christ so that
[2:28:33] he could clean the church in order to
[2:28:35] get it for fellowship God loves
[2:28:38] fellowship and that's what that's that's
[2:28:40] what he made man fit the first time for
[2:28:42] was to fellowship God dwelt alone with
[2:28:45] cherubims and now notice he made man and
[2:28:48] man fell he came down and redeemed man
[2:28:50] because God loves to be worshiped and to
[2:28:52] bury God means object of
[2:28:54] word God means object of worship and
[2:28:56] this that comes among us as a pillar
[2:28:59] fire is something that changes our
[2:29:01] hearts is the same God that said let
[2:29:03] there be light and there was light
[2:29:05] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:29:06] forever mine it's the same God that me
[2:29:10] had been created everything the same God
[2:29:12] that we go to for the Holy Ghost the
[2:29:14] same God that we go to for prayer the
[2:29:16] same God that we go to for every need
[2:29:18] he's the same God today as he was back
[2:29:21] then he's the same God that created
[2:29:22] flies and pleased and turned the city in
[2:29:25] the darkness
[2:29:26] he's the same God that brought water
[2:29:27] from the rock he's the same God that
[2:29:29] separated the waters and let the
[2:29:30] children of Israel walk through he's the
[2:29:33] same God that rolled back Jordan he's
[2:29:35] the same God that did that created that
[2:29:37] the fish in the and the bread in fed
[2:29:40] 5000 there's the same goddess it cast
[2:29:42] your net out on the other side oh my god
[2:29:44] we we fished all night cast it out there
[2:29:46] anyway they get it almost sunk their
[2:29:48] boat they had so much fish it's the same
[2:29:50] God the same God that walked down to the
[2:29:52] grace of my dream of Lazarus and
[2:29:54] resurrected Lazarus we now save God it
[2:29:56] came down and in West Palm 18 years ago
[2:29:58] and resurrected me in Gothic doing all
[2:30:01] of that this is the same guy that walked
[2:30:03] in top with William Branham cousin same
[2:30:05] God I'm a walking talk with you if you
[2:30:07] got the Holy Ghost business ain't God
[2:30:08] today it was yesterday and we're not
[2:30:11] looking off way out younger somewhere
[2:30:12] except for the resurrection in the
[2:30:14] rapture but we're looking at what is God
[2:30:15] doing for me today
[2:30:17] well it's God doing for you today what
[2:30:20] does God want you to do what do you want
[2:30:22] to do what do you have Nita it's the
[2:30:25] same Almighty God how great this God is
[2:30:28] if we came to serve if we really do
[2:30:31] believe him and we really do say to
[2:30:32] really do serving then you tell me what
[2:30:35] it is that we can ask that he won't do
[2:30:37] for us
[2:30:39] us not but you have not because you ask
[2:30:41] not
[2:30:42] yes not because you don't believe you

[2:32:59] needs
[2:32:59] let's ask God about it let's quit saying
[2:33:01] oh well I'll pray there now hope like I
[2:33:04] said the other night I have to repeat
[2:33:05] this one too it just popped in my mind
[2:33:06] listen I was in the church one time and
[2:33:09] I'm gonna call names you'll probably
[2:33:10] know it but the point is the past little
[2:33:13] sister come up preparator faster when I
[2:33:15] learned he prayed for her and she went
[2:33:16] down he was down that side she's about
[2:33:17] halfway back to her seat he says now
[2:33:19] let's hope that God heals her I looked
[2:33:27] at other children my wife and I said
[2:33:31] hope really Oh message preacher said
[2:33:35] let's hope that God heals err no sir if
[2:33:39] you prayed the prayer of faith then you
[2:33:41] send us as we know
[2:33:44] we thank God for healing
[2:33:47] I don't want anybody that haven't got
[2:33:49] faith I don't want to crane for me huh
[2:33:52] you don't really believe it go sit down
[2:33:54] I want somebody let's breathe together
[2:34:00] so I'll just go before the throne of
[2:34:02] mercy and let's get mercy he promised it
[2:34:05] oh my my see here got hit explain let me
[2:34:10] read this one I think I'm about done he
[2:34:13] said and I said then God the greatest
[2:34:16] that filled all of time and space
[2:34:18] hello City and came down to one little
[2:34:23] journey to the womb of a woman and then
[2:34:26] I said we are
[2:34:28] when are we saved today Jesus no I did
[2:34:33] something wrong man and then I said what
[2:34:35] are we saved today when are we saved
[2:34:37] today okay Jesus was neither Jew nor
[2:34:39] Gentile because the ink was only
[2:34:41] produced the egg only produced the flesh
[2:34:44] the blood had the life the Bible said we
[2:34:49] are saved by the blood of God see he was
[2:34:51] neither Jew nor Gentile he was God
[2:34:54] therefore when we come to the altar and
[2:34:57] we put our hands by faith on his head
[2:35:01] and feel that the tearing and the agony
[2:35:04] at Calvary and confess our sins that we
[2:35:07] are wrong and that he died in our place
[2:35:10] you see I said the blood that that lamb
[2:35:14] could not come back upon this the blood
[2:35:16] the blood that cell that cell was broken
[2:35:21] and the life that was let loose and
[2:35:23] breaking this then this blood cell of
[2:35:25] the Lamb could not come back up on the
[2:35:27] water because it's an animal and it
[2:35:29] could not coincide with a human life so
[2:35:32] God Himself became a kinsman redeemer he
[2:35:36] became a human so that he could be the
[2:35:39] sacrifice and that blood the blood of
[2:35:42] God because it was created is what
[2:35:44] washes our
[2:35:46] it's the blood of God see the almighty
[2:35:49] God who fills all time and space the old
[2:35:52] mighty God who made everything there if
[2:35:53] it is as I said the solitary Sun every
[2:35:56] star every planet every solar system
[2:35:59] every Rock every blade of grass every
[2:36:01] every animal everything that you see all
[2:36:04] mighty God did all that that same God is
[2:36:06] mindful of his children and he wants to
[2:36:08] do for you brother Brennan said in
[2:36:10] another place he said God wants to heal
[2:36:12] you more than you want to be healed not
[2:36:15] to help out how much can we want to be
[2:36:17] healed over laying there sick think
[2:36:20] about that but if you you best be
[2:36:23] everything but then you wants to be
[2:36:24] healed but Almighty God was to heal you
[2:36:27] more than that
[2:36:28] so we're dudes reach out by faith and
[2:36:30] accept that healing because by my
[2:36:33] stripes you are healed
[2:36:35] not by hope by faith in my stripes in my
[2:36:40] word in my promise I will heal you how
[2:36:45] great is our God
[2:36:47] oh how great is our God he said greatest
[2:36:50] God who has ever heard Oh brain is his
[2:36:52] word this hour he said he rolled back
[2:36:54] the waters of the mighty Red Sea and he
[2:36:56] said I'll lead you put your trust in me
[2:37:01] Joe said Behold God is great and we know
[2:37:04] him not what we knowing now neither can
[2:37:08] the number of his years be searched out
[2:37:10] and since the psalmist David said for
[2:37:12] the Lord is a great God and and a great
[2:37:14] king above all gods and brother brems
[2:37:18] said on the fifth seal said now let me
[2:37:20] just let me review just for a minute
[2:37:22] what makes God greatest because he can
[2:37:24] make himself so simple that's what makes
[2:37:27] him great God is great and he can make
[2:37:29] himself in such a simple form that the
[2:37:31] wise of this world can't even see him
[2:37:33] they can't find him because he makes
[2:37:35] himself too simple now watch and this in
[2:37:38] itself is the mystery of the revelation
[2:37:40] of Christ see that this in itself that
[2:37:43] there can be nothing greater than God
[2:37:45] and you can't make anything as simple as
[2:37:48] he makes himself see that's what makes
[2:37:52] him
[2:37:52] I think who would have thought God made
[2:37:56] a way for you and I to come back into
[2:37:58] fellowship simply by becoming us dying
[2:38:04] resurrecting ascending and sending back
[2:38:07] your spirit and yet people read the same
[2:38:09] Bible say well there's three gods oh
[2:38:11] there's four gods
[2:38:13] oh there's two gods or there's no God of
[2:38:16] the Bible contradicts the message
[2:38:18] contradicts this contradicts then I
[2:38:20] don't find it what it is is a failure of
[2:38:23] them to get down and know the same God
[2:38:25] that we know and get the revelation and
[2:38:28] get the balance in the word it says this
[2:38:31] over here and this over here and this
[2:38:33] over here and when you run them through
[2:38:34] there you find out oh now I see what it
[2:38:37] means but you see he is a great God who
[2:38:41] is moved by the infirmities of our
[2:38:43] sickness he's moved by our needs he's
[2:38:46] moved by our desires but we have to make
[2:38:48] sure our desires line up with his word
[2:38:51] so that means healing that means
[2:38:53] salvation that means your mom your dad
[2:38:56] your children your brother's your
[2:38:58] sisters your neighbors your enemy all of
[2:39:01] them you've got to have the Holy Ghost
[2:39:04] you've got to have that then you can
[2:39:06] bring the other sin then you can live
[2:39:08] such a life that maybe they hopefully I
[2:39:10] said maybe I'm sorry you want to live
[2:39:12] such a life that they want to be like
[2:39:14] you so I've tried to tell Andrew I said
[2:39:17] you want this little girl that you think
[2:39:19] you love you want her to be a Christian
[2:39:21] then you live such a Christian life that
[2:39:23] she will want to be like you you don't
[2:39:26] go over to that territory you bring her
[2:39:28] to yours see we've got to that goes for
[2:39:31] me you've any other you want your mom
[2:39:34] and dad your children anybody live such
[2:39:36] a life that they want to be like you is
[2:39:38] brother I said be salty so they'll get
[2:39:41] thirsty live the life if they won out I
[2:39:44] want to be like that brother I want to
[2:39:46] be like that sister oh my help sweet
[2:39:48] they see how wonderful they are you know
[2:39:51] not because they stand up here and talk
[2:39:53] the message all day long or talk to my
[2:39:54] mom but it's because that lived like
[2:39:57] as brother Graham told us he said you
[2:40:00] know the Sun control more water out of
[2:40:03] the earth and up into the atmosphere
[2:40:04] then the pumps can do it and do it
[2:40:06] quietly that's the way we need to be we
[2:40:09] need to be like the Sun live such a life
[2:40:11] that that they'll want to come up and be
[2:40:13] like us and we don't have to be noisy if
[2:40:15] we listen don't go misunderstand me
[2:40:16] there's a time to talk to them about
[2:40:18] things but you know what the most
[2:40:20] important thing is being lived like what
[2:40:22] Paul said you're a written epistle read
[2:40:24] of all men if I stand up here and preach
[2:40:28] this gospel and I don't live it who
[2:40:30] wants to be like me think about it
[2:40:33] same thing goes for you for me for all
[2:40:35] of us we've got to but when I'm trying
[2:40:38] to get across this morning is we're
[2:40:39] serving a great God that will answer our
[2:40:41] prayers if we will pray earnestly it
[2:40:44] will pray sincerely even desperately and
[2:40:46] ask him for things and believe it that's
[2:40:52] it
[2:40:52] he said whatsoever you asked and people
[2:40:55] stop there well I asked him it but he
[2:40:57] said in faith believing did you believe
[2:41:00] or did you just ask did you ask him just
[2:41:03] hope or did you really have faith and if
[2:41:07] you really have faith then you'll have
[2:41:08] that revelation that God you promised it
[2:41:11] and I'm accept that promise I've got a
[2:41:14] revelation you said find my stripes you
[2:41:16] are healed
[2:41:18] you said s whatever you wanted my name
[2:41:20] in the faith believe it I'll do it
[2:41:22] then Lord I'm accepting that in you
[2:41:24] you've got to do it because your word
[2:41:26] said so and you don't why I gotta I
[2:41:32] gotta quit God is so good to us
[2:41:41] don't you love him

[2:49:58] [Music]
[2:50:00] it hasn't changed a bit it's still
[2:50:02] genuine it's old yet it's new let's do
[2:50:07] this before I turn it back to brother
[2:50:09] dev speaking of our Greek god his
[2:50:15] creation his power what he wants to do
[2:50:18] force anybody here need the Holy Ghost
[2:50:20] this morning let's do that first
[2:50:22] anybody need the Holy Ghost if you want
[2:50:26] to come if you have you've repented and
[2:50:28] you don't think you have it we'll do
[2:50:30] like we did it brother jeans will lay
[2:50:33] hands on you that scripture lay hands
[2:50:36] only receive the Holy Ghost if you
[2:50:37] haven't repented then get your life
[2:50:39] straight and this is a good time to do
[2:50:41] it right in the morning the evening
[2:50:43] whatever is you're in this church
[2:50:44] service brother if you haven't repented
[2:50:46] you haven't been baptized and I urge you
[2:50:49] to find a place to get to do that and I
[2:50:53] know you're new and the Binda in the way
[2:50:55] and so forth but you've got to like we
[2:50:57] said Wednesday night and you were here
[2:50:59] you heard the message about praying and
[2:51:01] praying getting desperate with God my
[2:51:03] trying to embarrass you now so if I do
[2:51:04] forgive me
[2:51:05] but we've got to I'd rather be
[2:51:07] embarrassed here and have to stand for
[2:51:09] him and think I'm gonna go in and get
[2:51:10] embarrassed I said step aside I never
[2:51:11] knew you sure let's not be bashful or
[2:51:15] embarrassed here I don't have
[2:51:17] embarrassed by me up there but we've got
[2:51:19] that it's only way you go do you got to
[2:51:21] get with him and really get serious with
[2:51:23] God and get though he goes and this
[2:51:25] here's the thing about it I told the
[2:51:26] sisters down there wanted he get it
[2:51:28] getting the Holy Ghost is not an emotion
[2:51:32] it's not people the openness I was
[2:51:34] raised in Pentecost I understand what
[2:51:36] what what people think sometime in
[2:51:38] Pentecost and some of these religions
[2:51:39] they think you got a jump and shout run
[2:51:41] and holler and speak in tongues you like
[2:51:43] to speak in tongues every prove you got
[2:51:45] the Holy Ghost Devils speak in tongues
[2:51:49] the Holy Ghost is not something comes in
[2:51:51] emotion but when you get it it will
[2:51:53] bring emotion seeking it brings emotion
[2:51:57] to because it make you cry and snot and
[2:51:59] yell and scream and holler to get
[2:52:01] desperate for god I've got a having a
[2:52:02] gun Avenue gotta have it gotta have it
[2:52:04] see but when you can it he said what
[2:52:08] what is I got told them sisters I said
[2:52:10] you know what the evidence says the Holy
[2:52:12] Ghost isn't one of them says not really
[2:52:14] I suppose is your simple it's believing
[2:52:17] every word of God
[2:52:20] and see people forget that because for
[2:52:24] look the devil leaves his message he
[2:52:26] plays every word of this Bible he's read
[2:52:29] the back page - we win he loses he knows
[2:52:32] it
[2:52:33] so just alone sin I believe it so does
[2:52:37] the devil but he fares and trembles
[2:52:40] believe in every word and living it the
[2:52:45] devil can't live it's believing it in
[2:52:48] because you do shame you widely believed
[2:52:51] it down in here to become a revelation
[2:52:53] then it's just like my unlikely that the
[2:52:56] Lamb that produces the wolf he don't
[2:52:59] have to manufacture his brother Manto's
[2:53:00] he did he's just Peter I have to go I
[2:53:02] gotta make more no it's just it's just
[2:53:08] there I don't have to get it
[2:53:14] I get up here that a server and start
[2:53:16] talking and God take hold of it I've
[2:53:18] done that before too
[2:53:20] it's just something it just happens we
[2:53:23] psyche receive the Holy Ghost ones if
[2:53:25] something happens like I'd like to tell
[2:53:27] people an example is you go to you you
[2:53:29] went to church every
[2:53:31] you sought God for the Holy Ghost and
[2:53:33] you weren't sure if he got it or not
[2:53:35] that's what that one man did where he
[2:53:37] went for preacher - pretty sure
[2:53:38] appreciate future
[2:53:39] they finally saved him brother Branham
[2:53:40] he said they've had it all the law you
[2:53:42] mean I've had it all along
[2:53:43] but I didn't jump I didn't shout it in
[2:53:46] Howard its make it does it but you have
[2:53:48] it so you go to bed you come here and
[2:53:51] it'll said you go to bed to get up the
[2:53:52] next morning y'all
[2:53:55] something different something different
[2:53:58] about me I don't understand it God but
[2:54:01] their son I don't want to run with them
[2:54:03] guys anymore or those gowns I don't want
[2:54:05] to go over here do this anymore
[2:54:06] I don't want to do that but I just feel
[2:54:08] such a love Radisson I love you sue me I
[2:54:09] just want to serve you that's all I'm
[2:54:12] gonna make you happy I want to please
[2:54:13] you
[2:54:14] there's something different I don't want
[2:54:15] to do all that stuff anymore
[2:54:18] then you realize
[2:54:19] what happened you got it all cleaned out
[2:54:22] you turned it around cleaned up your
[2:54:25] life and you said Here I am I'm a clean
[2:54:27] vessel door now come and fill me
[2:54:29] [Music]
[2:54:30] and he did it and you realize the only
[2:54:33] thing that bezel is for looks that bomb
[2:54:37] is no good unless I open it
[2:54:40] as one person while one purpose
[2:54:43] first
[2:54:45] that's me that I have one purpose is to
[2:54:48] serve my god
[2:54:50] that's what it's a served up it's not

[2:55:22] so you see that's what it when you
[2:55:24] didn't y'all said you realized oh I must
[2:55:27] have the Holy Ghost there's something
[2:55:29] different about me
[2:55:29] I don't want all that junk out there

[2:55:47] person I do all that I want to it's a
[2:55:50] thing that is the one who's been taken
[2:55:52] out that's it brother

[2:56:08] of cry a lot of praying a lot of beating
[2:56:09] on the older
[2:56:11] whatever it takes
[2:56:13] this inside manner we have now
[2:56:16] earthly worldly spirit till he dies out
[2:56:21] and we're a new preacher but we've got
[2:56:23] to get rid of that old worldly spirit
[2:56:25] that was in there that guy that wanted
[2:56:27] to lust after all the women or chase all
[2:56:29] the men and lions team cheering
[2:56:31] super-steel and spoken and all these
[2:56:34] things that are that the world do all
[2:56:36] these places where you're not supposed
[2:56:37] to go do all these things you're not
[2:56:39] supposed to do as Christians and then
[2:56:41] all of a sudden when that's gone you
[2:56:42] realize something that's happened you've
[2:56:44] got a new spirit in there because he
[2:56:46] said I'll take out your nose Stoney
[2:56:48] spear dental stony-hearted you can do it
[2:56:50] he's nothing I'll put my spirit in there
