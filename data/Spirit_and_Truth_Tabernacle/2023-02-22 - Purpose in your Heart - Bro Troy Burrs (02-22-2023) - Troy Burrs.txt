him O Father God and look on this service oh father God in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated I won't leave you standing if you grab your Bibles it will take a scripture reading real quick from Daniel the first chapter Daniel the first chapter amen probably going to be a little bit different and that might be used to the to the pastor's uh style so I don't I won't I'm not that computer savvy so you won't see all of that all of that stuff but uh hey man we'll go on anyway amen Daniel the first chapter it says here in the third year of the reign of uh jehoy Kim and I hope I said that right king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon until Jerusalem and blessed it and the Lord gave jeho Kim King of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God and he carried amen and he cared into the land of shannar to the house of his God and he brought vessels into the treasures of house of his God and the King spake unto uh FNS the master of his eunuchs that he should bring a certain of the children of Israel and that the king's seed and of the princess children in whom was no blemish he would he but no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning and knowledge and understanding science such as had ability in them to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans and the King appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the King's Wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end of the end thereof they might stand before the king now among these were the children of Judah Daniel hanaya Michelle and Azariah and unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave Daniel the name of belshazzar and to Hana Shadrach and unto Michelle uh Meshach and to Azariah of abendigo but Daniel purposed in his heart that he will not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word amen um the last time I was I was with you um I spoke on a little subject called uh withstanding the changing culture and this was part of that message there that you know uh you know Wednesday night sometimes we have to cut them kind of short so but this goes along with it we see that Daniel and those Hebrews that was uh are taken captive into Babylon amen that's exactly what they were doing they were withstanding that culture that was fastly changing amen the the they was the the king at that time was trying to get them to assimilate now the word assimilate means to to quote kind of uh uh uh to come into line or to be like the other people amen so we see here that uh the beginning of Daniel they offered them meat now I want you to put your spiritual thinking caps on because we're going to go somewhere in this and just point some things out that what you eat in your diet has a lot to do with uh your your physical well-being but in this instance where we were talking about here was a little bit more than the physical appearance amen now this is just types A man that he taught him that saying that they would come back and they would stand before the king amen and see that that that that that what was he feeding them was it taking hold or was it affecting them in the way that the king wanted or desired the food and the drink that he was giving them to affect them we see in this world today that we're living there because we're living in Babylon all over again we're living in the time of Babylon the word Babylon means Mass confusion okay and the world and that the devil is trying to feed you certain things to get you to come in line with the changing of the culture amen spiritually and physically uh I my wife just showed me an article on today as I was studying this message I think it was last night not knowing what I was the thought that I had in my heart and things of that nature but how they're cloning meat it was always a wonder she said I wonder why the eggs going up and the chicken ain't because the chicken is being cloned without in a in a in a petri dish so they they they're Mass producing uh meat that's going to give you no substance because it didn't come from life so there's no life in it and we in turn eat that we look at how uh the farmers and different things are so greedy and we see that hearing about everything is is is is is is so uh uh uh uh uh driven by money driven by greed the farmers that once had a desire to to grow uh fresh vegetables and fruit and things of that nature to feed people that we may have a good diet they are selling out now because it's more um profitable thank you excuse me to become uh landowners to sell their land to developments so they're getting out of the farming business and they're becoming millionaires because they're selling off portions of their Farm to Developers and in turn in doing so the developers come in and uh they cut down the trees and they take away the vegetables and they appeal brick and mortar houses for people to live in and they do manicured Lawns and then they build drainage ditches because they're somewhere near somewhere now for the water to go and they do all of these things uh uh just to make money everyone has a good idea of this is the way I can be rich and be money but they never consider the cost what is it really costing you yeah you're becoming rich you're becoming very well off amen but we'll get to something I don't want to get ahead of myself because you can't live in this life amen without having a true purpose and if I could title this message this evening that is the title we notice here that Daniel purposed in his heart that he might not defile himself with the king's meat no doubt you know I'm a carnivore at heart I love me some meat you know love a good steak every now and then love some chicken and things like that of that nature love you know you could see I love love to eat eat is a good you know I love to do that but at the same time I love to eat spiritual food amen just like I I love to eat natural food but see we're talking about this is it has a natural type also and a spiritual type your your your your spiritual health and along with your physical health is directly related to your diet and what you eat amen let's kind of move forward here as we we can here now the prophet says here that the soul of a man which can also be interpreted as the heart of a man it is the control tower of the human being amen his motives and and his objectives amen come from the heart so we see here that your uh uh what you purpose in your heart is very important amen so when we look at a subject like this we have to go below the surface amen we have to look deeper amen see what causes what causes uh our motivation amen the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaking out of the man's heart now look here in Mark 7 the 18th chapter to the 23rd verse Jesus said and he saith unto them are ye also without understanding are ye so without understanding also do ye not perceive that what things from without interest into the man it cannot defile him because it interests not into his heart but into his belly talking about his spiritual man now and going without into drought purging all Meats and he said that which cometh out of a man that defilest the man from without for from within out of his heart of a man proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornication murders deaths covetousness wickedness deceit that's your business an evil eye blasphemy Pride foolishness these things come out of his heart all these evils come from with these things that come from within the man is what defile him Jesus is telling us the real source of where a lot of our problems are generated from this is why we need to guard our hearts amen keep it from defilement and pollution at our core being because what we allow to enter into our heart will come out and manifest in our lives amen Jesus telling us the real source of work a lot of our problems are generated from what we allow to come into our hearts now we remember King David amen his sin with Bathsheba was because he had let his heart become defiled with wrong thoughts amen because somewhere along the way he had let a thought take root in his heart about having an affair with another man's wife it wasn't that he didn't have wives of his own amen but he wanted another man's wife and so when the opportunity presented itself what was already in his heart came out in his life and it didn't end well for him or the others around him all starting from what David allowed to enter into his heart now the prophet was saying that that uh birds can fly over your head amen but you don't have to let that bird take make a nest so thoughts are going to come the devil is going to come and bring you all kind of thoughts but you have to guard your heart by shoeing those birds away showing those thoughts away anytime you have a evil thought it comes to your mind you immediately shoot that thing away amen the Bible says uh in Psalms 51 David said created me a clean heart O Lord and renew a righteous spirit Within Me it was an outside problem it was a heart condition David had a heart condition because of what he ate Now isn't that quite a type of the natural sometimes what we allow ourselves to eat in our diet would give us heart problems clog Our arteries and and and give us trouble down the road that we are asking the church to pray for us and the Lord to deliver us amen but we can take now and take some steps of being careful of what we allow our diet to be a man to help so that we don't have to go through that spiritually and naturally a lot of time because of our diet we bring things on ourselves now I'm preaching to myself this this evening and I've been really doing some things that's why when this message really came to me it was just so timely because I've been doing a lot of things my wife can attached to it and got her drinking all kind of teas and juicing and all kinds of things and you know uh just trying to do some things a little bit different here I'm no young man anymore my body just don't digest all of that garbage too well I can't go to the McDonald's in the Burger Kings and and all of the fast foods and amen even the the the the the as much as I eat uh uh sister Erica was got me on a little thing now I'm started to do a little intermittent fasting allowing myself to skip a meal or two amen and uh uh uh at first it was really difficult amen but I allowed myself the man down to one meal a day for the most part amen so and I can feel some changes and things in my energy level and and different things like that so y'all just keep praying for me I just keep going but at the same time understanding that that also have some spiritual applications amen I want to be careful of my spiritual diet amen what I'll allow my mind and my heart to feed upon amen because that what you put in your body and your feet upon it can give you a heart condition amen here just like David had a heart condition it came blamed Bathsheba or or or Uriah no one else he had a heart condition that made him sick that made him sick that caused him to do the things that he did amen you must you cannot stop at letting the thought coming into your head you must Shue it away from those things not dwelling on them letting them become a part of the purpose of your heart because it is out of the heart that your life will be manifested in Proverbs the fourth chapter in the 23rd verse here it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life the word initial keep means to God to watch over to protect amen you must purpose in your heart to do the right thing of life according to the plan of God if you purpose in your heart then there where if you have no purpose in your heart then there is no Center core for your convictions you must have a purpose in your heart that drives you that gives you conviction that gives you a reason to keep going if you're just just just just just floating through willy-nilly and and have no purpose you have nothing tied to you have nothing to drive you we see hearing this story with Daniel Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's meat he would not defile himself amen so many people talk about life that you should pursue amen and and pursue uh a great job now that there's nothing wrong with having a great job but what are you doing with it amen um um um a lot of people there was a a fellow in my job I was having a conversation with at one time and and and and and and I was just sort of checking him he's just talking about how much money he's made and how well he's he's doing and things of that nature and it's quite natural yeah you're doing pretty good but I told him I say I facetiously I say yeah he who died with the most toys win and he looked at me and he said yes and I looked at him I said I said my if that's what you really think he who dies with the most tourists when you ain't gonna take nothing with you I told him at that time I told him I said never seen a U-Haul truck falling behind a hearse so you die in your accumulate all of these worldly Goods just to leave it here just to leave it here so what did you really do what was your real purpose what did you really do what are you leaving see you have to purpose in your heart Amen to to to to do something bigger than just having material things now let me let me go on here many people thought that when they got to a certain point in materialism that it would bring them all happiness and contentment only to find out that there's trouble even with all the money you have people that are so wealthy billionaires are committing suicide it shows you that the material wealth a man does not bring you complete peace it does not bring you Joy it does not bring you the happiness that you're seeking amen that only comes with the person of Peace amen the Prince of Peace so we want to find a purpose in our life that's bigger than ourselves amen the little short time we have here on Earth just breathing air and accumulating material things only to lose it all when we die now it is impossible or it is possible for you to occupy this planning for 70 to 80 years and just breathe the air and eat food and walk upon the Earth and collect nice stuff but when you are gone if nothing in your life was achieved for the Eternal purpose of God then it was a wasted life then it was a wasted life so how do I keep my hard guarded that's the question here how do we keep our hearts guarded especially in this day when there's so many distractions and purposes that are fighting us for recognition amen recently on my job I was working there and had to put up some lights on the the street there but this poll that we came to had a swarm of bees these bees had just taken over I mean I wasn't going nowhere near it and I say that but I did and uh just bees everywhere so we had to call out the beekeeper and The Beekeeper come out and he went out and in order for him to do his job he had to know how bees think and how they how they maneuver and how they operate and one of the things here a bee Colony the queen bee are fed a different diet to the other bees in the hive and the only difference in whether you make sure I'm not missing none in the story here the only difference in whether a fertilized egg develops into a worker bee versus a queen bee is the food that it's fed to it during its development okay that's the only difference between a worker bee and a queen bee is the food that it eats The Hive if the hive requires a new Queen then a fertilized egg will be placed into a larger Queen sale either by the current queen or by the worker bees then the special feeding begins an egg which is required to develop into a queen bee is fed a diet of what is known as royal jelly she is fed nothing else the royal jelly causes this egg to develop faster and bigger with the full reproductive capabilities that only the queen bee has the queen bee will remain on a strict royal jelly diet for the rest of her life living 30 to 40 times longer than any other bee in the hive and capable of laying upwards of 2000 eggs per day clearly there's something very special about that royal jelly and there's also something very special about the message of the Hour Diet that is our royal jelly amen that allows us to reproduce a man The Life of Christ amen it allows us amen gives us What It Takes Amen to be uh uh Kings and Priests amen the royal jelly we are sitting amongst on Wednesday nights and Sunday nights and and some Friday nights and being fed royal jelly amen feeding on nothing but royal jelly amen becoming bigger amen and stronger amen and wiser now this goes all the way back down to Daniel when they had to come before the king Daniel we're coming up on the Daniel Fast Daniel said give me beans and water don't I don't give me that stuff that the king is eating or want us to eat what is he trying to do defile us Amen to make us come in line with the culture of Babylon amen get me accustomed to uh that a living in that that manner amen uh uh uh a lot of drinking and carrying on Amen allowing me to my my my my uh my thoughts to be confused amen God belly fat and and full of wine you are a target for the devil now I'm talking spiritually and naturally my brothers and sisters amen we have to watch our diet don't we used to was told don't put your feet under everybody table don't put your feet under everybody table all right people come off of me no thank you no thank you yeah I I remember a while back there was a neighbor uh and and my wife had a problem with this young lady and uh I'm out there on out at the car doing something and she comes out with this drink in a hand and she's striking up conversation and I think it was something my wife and I was just having a conversation say watch that lady send me right by the spirit what's that this lady trying she go back in the house and get some little drinks trying to offer me to I don't want that I didn't even ask you to get me no drink I don't think lady I'm not drinking nothing from you I'm not drinking nothing from you and she weighed good until my wife ain't home to come trying to offer me some dream when my wife came home I told her she said I told you I told you my my spirit something ain't right you watch that I'm glad you didn't take it they don't tell you what happened to you things start happening you don't know what's going on why is this happening you can't put your feet under everybody's table you can't just eat from everybody's hand that's naturally and spiritually my brothers and sisters watch your company you keep your friends because see you get comfortable and and and and they and they they trying to feed you constantly you hanging around the wrong company a lot of times and they're constantly just feeding you little feeding you little things and you find yourself out on a limb and you don't know how you got there man you got to stop eating that stuff it's a lot of time we feel like I'm strong and I can take it just like I was saying yeah when I was young I probably can eat a little McDonald's and and different places like that but after a while it catches up to you you gotta watch You Gotta Have A peculiar diet and every now and then you gotta have a detox man you got to go through a a purge and you gotta you gotta you gotta pull away you gotta I got to stop I'm gonna just shut it down let your digestive system have a break amen feed yourself some good juices and vitamins and and allow yourself to clean out and reset get your chakras right your lymphatic system is all clogged up you get your get your immune system back right amen you got to sit in the steam in the shower and let the impurities come out your body get the mucus out there's certain vitamins and things of that nature hey man we got to get out and get in the sun sometime that vitamin DC everything you have need of God is already provided see but we get so accustomed because we have become accustomed to the culture we got cars now we don't walk no more see we come in accustomed to a change this this culture and it's killing us every time there's more fast food restaurants try to find a good healthy place to eat hard to find but you pass by 50 McDonald's Wendy's and everything else hard to find a good home-cooked meal so you got to take that time Amen to just push away notice what happens when you when you push away and you allow your mind and your body to detox itself the prophet said you begin we look out here in Daniel they allowed themselves to to not be defiled and God was able to deal with them in dreams and visions amen gave them strength to withstand the test and the battle that they had to go through those Shadrach Meshach and then Bendigo a man would not bow down to the king why because they had not assimilated to the culture they had not taken of the king's meat which would have weakened them but they was able to stand in the face of of of of of of of of of of uh the pressure and what happened God came down the prophet said he came down and fanned away the flames amen Daniel he didn't defile himself with the king's meat and became divisions and so divisions was able to the wisest man in the Kingdom because he Sanctified himself because he stayed away from those things he purposed in his heart so he guarded his heart against those things my brothers and sisters it's important to guard your heart we don't want to end up with a heart condition by the diet that we eat amen so we see here that uh the bees they eat this royal jelly they're on a special diet amen that allows them to reproduce amen and to be bigger and stronger amen than their adversary bigger and stronger than those uh worker bees amen why has the world become so defile and filled with crazy things that are taking hold of the people lives the people are going crazy and it is all to do with their diet y'all don't hear me I say the people are going crazy and it's all to do with their diet my wife just pulled up a a a quote for me uh just last night there was some how many mass shootings this year 67 mass shootings now I'm gonna read you a quote the prophet for saw this so much of the problems that come from people's lives has to do with their diet and what they're feeding on naturally and spiritually so the Book of Daniel shows us a mystery for this hour that people the people of God are surrounded by a Babylonian influence it shows us that we are to purpose in our heart in this hour to eat the right spiritual food in due season especially when we are surrounded by all the spectacular and dainties and tasty delicatessens of food and wines of Babylon read between the lines now we are spiritually we are surrounded amen by the spiritual food of Babylon amen which tastes good it don't talk about short dresses they don't talk about decency and in order no it just tastes good eat drink and be merry in other words if it feels good do it amen but sometime that uh food amen that the eunuchs was providing may not be an old taste as The Taste is but it is sufficient amen the prophet said it seemed like God you eat that and God take a a couple of vitamins and just pour it in there for you and then to give you strength amen a couple of quotes here says remembering in this the message remembering the Lord uh 62 1209 he says there has to be a creator and if there is a creation and if there uh and if there is a creation it was made by a creator and any man's work reflects himself he is a good Carpenter he is a good work he does good work he builds and if he is a good mechanic he does good work your work only reflects you and God's creation reflects God and God made everything for a purpose and everything that serves God's purpose when it dies it has a resurrection and if a man serves God's purpose there is a resurrection just as sure as anything we have all no doubt no thought about the purpose of why we have been put here upon this Earth and at this time in history humanity is in Babylon again it is a time of mass confusion where the main idea is that if it feels good then do it and the message the world is falling apart again he says here uh as I said 1963 1172 paragraph 178. just think what could you promise yourself today in another 10 to 15 years if the world shall stand if it does stand that every man in Shreveport Every Woman you have to pack a gun on the street with you in your pocket to protect yourself the hoodlums how you going to stop it he says I was in New York the other week and went down through there for Miles was nothing but these teenage hoodlums with earrings in the ear and ratted hair and legatards on the girls with little bikinis they called it on like that out on the street and the public has to give them the right-of-way what is the matter with this country he says it's because a sign of moral Decay God rejected Nation tell me if we don't see that now people with leggings and leotards more than they were pants they don't went from pants they call them pants I guess you everywhere you waitresses everywhere you go leggings leotards it used to be a time where they kind of that was underneath garments now they wearing their underneath garments as outer garments moral Decay because they have fed from the king's table they've been feeding a diet that has decayed their minds so it's important my brothers and sisters to guard our hearts give ourselves a purpose that is God's purpose not just material things or when there's something to do for the kingdom of the Lord make sure you be caught doing something working for him even in my job in my career I find I I I I I I I tell everybody I say that God has me here for a purpose I have a co-worker who I've been kind of dealing with some 10 years I gave him a church age book and uh he took it held on to it for about four years then just gave it back to him I said did you read it no I didn't read I said okay you have no idea what you what you just turned down but he's religious very religious and one day on the job I was going through something and I I we have our meeting and right in the middle of the meeting not just quoted scripture this came out of inspiration I just quoted the scripture they were getting on my nerves I just quoted a description you get angry sometimes your quote description [Laughter] it's called a scripture and it caught them all off guard room became a little quiet so then he jumped up says oh I didn't know we recording scriptures I got plenty of them but did it come from your heart because if it was inspired to you you would have quoted a scripture don't wait and wait till I quote the scripture talk about how many scriptures you can quote no all right mine came it was real I was dealing with something and that's what came out what come out of your mouth but now he's having an issue so I try to show love and say Lord what is my purpose because we've had some really deep meaningful conversations and I'm sure he's had with no one else on that job those kind of talks those kind of conversations and I'm sure that I I would hope I would say that he's thinking on some of those things now and he said Lord if that's my purpose and let me serve my purpose I'm sorry not my purpose your purpose not my will but your will be done Amen to serve the Lord's will even our young people you know as a young man you can serve God's purpose even in school I have testimony after testimony when I was in school amen they even even on the job now they called me I got a nickname right now every time somebody see me I don't even know the person they say you the preacher man I said yeah okay I guess I wear that title and even as a young man in school I carried that title hey you got a word for us preaching you got a word for I said yeah repent but I had my oppressors had my oppressors I had one fella uh probably he was one of one of the one I mean this good just huge just naturally big running back for the football team I ain't gonna call his name I almost called his name and uh really big fella and we was uh in in the gym there in PE he's typing PE class put him back and he take the basketball and throw it and hit me in the head I say man

he ready oh yeah he think he feel like we shouldn't have get it I get him outside we go outside the gym and I guess the other guys in the class coach Grant from the kill Troy you better go out there and get him I'd have said to my name because this guy was so so much bigger than I was so when we got outside I just caught him and I say man what is the problem what is it I mean you know man you ain't got no problem with you what is the problem I ain't come here to fight man and look what is it you're going through something at home is there anything I can help you with because obviously and I'm maybe a junior in high school and this is how I'm having the conversation with this fella and by that time he's standing there and he looks at me and he say oh man I'm sorry I can't fight you

coach was even the PE coach was impressed with that so you can take even in your school take a stand guard your heart it's okay to be different Daniel didn't have no problem being different those Hebrew boys didn't have a problem being different because they knew it would pay in itself at the end it was the way God wanted them to be see they they had it purposed in their heart that they not going to be just like the other kids these other kids are losing Lord I Have Mercy the kids the kids the kids it's about this I'm looking at these things now Lord let us hurry up and get to church and
