here and and coming up on Friday a man sister Ruth a man be celebrating a birthday so god bless you and happy birthday to you sister Ruth a man so we have been just kind of keeping our finger on the pulse we understand that our county is now the numbers are really starting to rise here in our County as people then going back to work the good thing that we have here in our and our disposal is we have someone that works right in the hospital and man director of emergency room and they given us the real numbers they giving us the real numbers things that you might not hear on the news or you might not see on Google but they tell us what's going on I heard that pretty much here a lot of the Bears are full and they have innocent people to other places because I just don't have the room to take care of some of the the cases a man as some of you all may be aware that there was a sister a man who passed a Memphis this past week she was in her 80s and she passed from this virus and and she was living in the room with a granddaughter and now the granddaughter is also in the hospital and I was told that the granddaughter they lost her I mean her heart be stopped early this week but they were able to get it going again and the family just been asking for prayer and I just want to just mention Church this is this is serious you know it's nothing that we should take lightly and and we ought to do everything we can to help prevent one another from catching this or even present prevent yourself from catching it please amen take it seriously please take it seriously so you know we're we thank God that there haven't been any outbreaks but we're praying that we won't have any outbreaks and that's if everybody could just take it seriously we do like I mentioned before we take precaution we lock our cars when we come into the house of the Lord or when we're at home we lock that we lock the doors when we leave home we lock the doors all of those what we call precautionary measures amen that doesn't mean that we have a lack of faith it's just we take precautionary measures because we live in a sinful world and I was just telling some people you know this week this this this whole pandemic is to me is not natural it's not it's not it's for something there's something strange about all it is and it don't seem like it's nature you know involved it seemed like man is involved but because man is involved we have to do what we got to do amen to take care of ourselves so let's just let's just continue to you know lift one another up in prayer and let's do all we can to prevent this from spreading spreading amongst ourselves amen so we'll continue to do our virtual service on Wednesday night amen we'll join us either vive periscope or via Facebook the I am so grateful we mentioned last week about you know some things we want to do we took the camera away for periscope we had a camera that used to sit right here in the middle of church and we actually got both of our streams which is something that I want to do we got both of our streams running from the same source which gives the same look and feel to both periscope and to Facebook but the camera that was taken away I got many people come to them and say I really like that camera right there all right all right we got a project help us buy another cameraman we'll put a camera right back there but we want to do it the right way and I just mentioned to everyone that we you know we just took we knew that it was going to cost us about four thousand dollars to get the things done that we wanted to get done and and I'm an ounce that last week a man and this week I'm happy to announce that half of it has already done half of it is already done a man so you'll be seeing the changes a man as they as they're being implemented some of the things already on order and the changes will be made in the next few weeks so everybody would like to give a little bit you know towards that we certainly appreciate it but we just want to make the experience a man a very very positive experience for all those that are watching online so we'll continue to do that we don't have a Friday night service but I am considering doing a virtual Friday night service ever since I preached the sermon on that the testimonies of kovat 19 different ones been coming giving me all kind of things that God is doing and and how God has done so I was thinking about doing like a virtual type service just inviting to church those that want to come you have to do it from your telephone or from your computer but if you would like to be a part of that and you want to just share a testimony that night please let me know in advance and we'll we'll just kind of create a little program and and have everybody a part of that but I'll let you know when we'll be able to do it but just let me know if you wanna hit brother Jack I want I want to give a testimony on that night so but it would be a virtual service that we're thinking about doing so keep that in mind we'll continue to do our 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. service on Sunday a man until further notice so let's just continue that way and again just quickly announced that we'll be moving to a new platform on the church app so if you can just download the church app a man from your App Store and then find spirit and choose tabernacle and we'll go from there and you'll find it there as far as giving we have two ways for you to give online you can use PayPal or you can use cash app cash app you use the dollar I mean the cash symbol spirit and true of T amen a cash symbol spirit and truth T is our cash app amen information if you want to use PayPal then you would just a man a gift to a friend or to a family member and the email address - - but use

table and you can put your offerings and tithing there if you'd like to and that's how you would give so and if you don't have cash up you don't have a paypal you want to just send an offering to the church the address to the church is there on the bottom of the screen spirit and truth Tabernacle 39-51 have a Hill Road Suite one on I'm West Palm Beach three three four one seven that's our temporary address a man praise the Lord glory to God we under expectation that the Lord gonna bless us with our own church in our own school a man a property that can house both of them so Amen we are under expectation for that and we're looking forward to seeing God make a way out of no way let us pray Amen over our giving it this time father we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity we have to give Oh God use it for the furtherance of your kingdom god you know every need and you have you have proven to be Jehovah Jireh you provide Lord and sometimes you just exceed our expectations and we're just grateful father for all that you do Lord as we just come father to bring Amen I taught an offering you said bring it to the house so it might be meet in my house pray to chew it use it God for the furtherance of your kingdom be glorified and magnified even in the midst of our giving God we love you we praise you in Jesus name we pray amen a man praise the Lord God bless you thank you musicians we could stand to our feet I want to just read a scripture today and think i'ma have to get our schedule for specials going again that way brothers Solomon he don't have to Acts who got one on a heart who will already know who got one only heart is that all right so we're gonna have to get that going again so that we not coming here to church and a man having to make it up as we go y'all know I don't do that I try to prepare my sermon before I get here and all right so if I'm gonna do that we're gonna need singers to do that to somebody say ma'am all right so we'll get the schedule going so everybody know what when they suppose a sing and it won't be no surprises glory to God a man turn with me to Psalms 103 a man [Music] I'll just start reading here at verse 8 says the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger plenteous in mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded US according to our iniquities that means the things that you know to do right but you still refused to do it is considered a liquid to a man he hasn't he hasn't rewarded us according to our iniquities scripture says for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him I love this as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us a man yeah he's worried it to me praise a man at verse 13 says like as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pities them that fear him for he knoweth our frame he remembers that we are dust a man let's just read another passage here from mark 4 I pray the Lord just help us a man and our journey today mark 4 and this is verse 35 and mark 4 says in the same day when the even was come said unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships other little ships since he was in the ship other little ships and there rose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto Him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and say it one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey Him amen let's pray over the Word of God father we thank you for the ability to read but God we know it takes the Holy Spirit to come and help us to understand what it is that we just read speak to our hearts through your word on this day God be glorified and magnify in this place we trust that you would not only bless those that are gathered but those that are joining a line speak to them father right where they are and courage and strengthen heart so God correct us where we need to be corrected bring deliverance bring healing God feel what the Holy Ghost refilled with the Holy Ghost whatever is needed today God may it be done Lord according to your plan it's in Jesus name that we pray amen amen you can be seated we want to just take a title today on the string of fatherhood a man the strain of fatherhood just bear with me as we just read a little bit you know III want to start with leadership but I you know I'm one that sometimes it's very difficult for me to a man to kind of get a sermon together for daddies you know I I know Mama's man you got to have a mama days for mother day sermon you got to have one but that is a little different a man they don't you know they not like that and and but I felt that would be important for us just to you know try to encourage the fathers a little bit Amen on the day sometime they don't get an encouragement that they need they get a lot of correction people always coming down on them and all those stuff but we want to try to encourage them a man a little bit today we thank God for godly daddies we really really thank God for them and you ought appreciate a godly father say man you might not agree with him all the time but if he's a godly man he's doing the best he can to lead you in the right direction and so you ought to appreciate that but this a man is a sermon leadership the Prophet makes some statements here and we just want to just talk just just take our time and go through the system now the first step you've probably ever taken in your life speaking of leadership said it's probably the hands of some kind o mother a man it says probably the hands of some kind o mother them hands maybe steel tonight out here in some cemetery somewhere but that was the hand that held you to make first step says then after then after he says then after mother taught you how to walk you make a few steps and then fall down and get up and and and and you thought you were doing great things then she turns you over to the school teacher and she began to lead you to an education of how and what you must do and how you must learn and so forth like that then after the school teacher got through with you then you returned back your father got a hold of you a man he says then when your father got a hold of you he taught you perhaps your business a man he says how to be a successful businessman how to do things right your mother taught you how to be a housewife how to cook and so forth like that then after they got through with you then your minister or priests got a hold of you oh my goodness so Mama and Daddy and teaching say didn't you priests get a hold of you now we gonna have to just deal with that in a little bit but I want to keep reading says but who but now who leads you the question that's the question now now we're all are led by something tonight we have to be we're led notice now let's look at this young friend let's talk about the rich young really say what what had influenced him let's look at it this young businessman we could call him because he was a businessman businessman he was a great successful man let's look at his leaders perhaps first perhaps first his mother had taught him as a little boy the things that he should do his father made him such a fine success maybe left him an inheritance because he was a ruler himself perhaps his father was gone so he was a businessman and let's call him day like a Christian Christian businessman or he was a religious businessman I think would be the best quotation he says now this man was religious he was by no means in he had been and had been taught by his mother how to do right how to walk how to dress himself he had been taught by his father a great business and how to be a successful man and his business was successful and father and mother had been raised up in the church and had pointed him in appointing him to the priest and the priest had made him a real religious man I love these statements amen at the prophets making so you know i'ma stop there on that quote you know here mama gets a hold of them daddy Amen mama teaches him just pretty much all the basics of life daddy gets in there and he starts teaching about business and how to be successful but it says both the father and the mother a man I had to get him to a spot where they brought him to the priest and the priest began to teach this boy this rich young ruler he was he was able to tell Jesus that you know what I've been following a man the Word of God from my youth up I mean even the Prophet oh say even the scripture Jesus loved this young man hallelujah and the reason Jesus loved me because this boy's character had been shaped a man by both his father and his mother glory to God in life our children need both a father and a mother Halu they need that the loving care of mama but they need the steady hand of daddy hallelujah amen they need a step they need someone that can force some stuff come on somebody amen we need both of us in our life you can't expect your daddy to be your mama and you can't expect your mama to be your daddy God made them differently for a purpose but this boy man had come into his own space I had an opportunity to meet Jesus his daddy never met Jesus his mama never never met Jesus but he was a product of what they had taught him in the home how they had raised him and when Jesus saw him he loved him he loved him he loved him I want I was just thinking on this other quote kind of comes to me and have not honest I sent thee brother Branham says some because you know you turn your kids over to the priests a man uh this come to my mind and I and I gotta be careful how I say this I you know but there was a it's like it's I don't mean to make the pulpit a place for choke a man but there was a situation over the last couple years a couple of videos kind of surface on social media and there was a preacher man that man when he preached he just he just he pretty much just go off on the congregation he told one one say you won't you expect me to marry you and you this and you dad and you did some he just boy he was whoa he was just give him he giving him what for and any any Demi told one mama say you raising your kids they gonna be a bunch of were Lian's right and he say say when I'm talking to you I'm your pastor but when I'm talking to him I'm his pastor see hallelujah I hope you got that because mom and daddy when they arrange them kids you have to give them all up to the priest hallelujah you gotta find a pastor that you can trust that you can give them over to a pastor that's not gonna take advantage of them a pastor that's gonna tell them the truth where they hurt them or help them the past is going to tell them the truth and mom and daddy can't get in the middle of the pastor's you know advice hello somebody - I'm advising this but mom and dad is it now alright praise the Lord alright when you turn them over you turn them off glory to God hallelujah square and I ain't sayin just give up your kids and you know don't have anything doing them but I'm saying sometime a pastor might have some different advice then the parents have and you got to be able to trust that alright because you know Lord are you getting you get into a situation right now you ain't gotta listen to him alright okay all right I mean and you gotta listen to him don't worry about nothing he say okay all right all right now when your kids really meet a pastor you don't plant a seed in them right now they can't respect leadership I just read the quote from leadership right now they don't know how to respect leadership because of what you planted in them all right hallelujah glory to God you got to teach them a man yet they need to know the roles of the teacher and how to respect the teacher they need to know the roles of a man of different people in our community how to respect those roles in the community they need to know the roles in the house what daddy's role is and what Mama's rollers and how to respect that role praise God and when they come to church they need to know the role of the pasta and how to respect that role how to respect your deacons come on somebody how you respect at the song leader everybody how you respect the pulpit come on your children just can't be running around the church hallelujah somebody we got to teach them these things they don't know no better so they got to be taught all right now let me just read this have night I sit me have not I sit thee it says sometimes I preach pretty rough I said Lord Jesus sometimes I preach pretty rough because I see somebody getting out of line you see you're supposed to do that look at this he says a real daddy will when he why he shake you and say here get back here in line if he's a real true father so sometimes your pasta has to weigh down on something just love him that much more all right just love him that much more because he's a real father to you look at that now amen to talk about the pastor the pastor have to weigh down on something love him just that much more because he's a father - you see trying to keep you lined up because he's watching over your soul which the Holy Ghost has made him the oversee of the church and you must always watch that see that's what you're saying he's just watching over your soul when you're giving advice it just watching over your soul past it and come down on you just to come down and he's watching over your soul hallelujah brother branham gives the example of how a father if he sees this child out in the middle of the street a man and cars are coming and and and the board say you know I just want to go out here and play in and you just you know as a father well Johnny it's okay yeah go right on that there in the middle of street and the cars come in both ways both directions just go right on out there son and you know and I'll stop every car I'll fight every driver you know I'll do no no that's not love that's not love you say what that what that father do is to the board no don't go out there in the middle street staring here on the side of the side of the road over here and you can play in this there you set boundaries for him and if that boy go outside them boundaries you ain't gonna stop the cars you're gonna stop that boy right and you're gonna go you're gonna you're gonna lay hands on I told you not to play in the street right and when a father's doing that when the phone is corrected his child hallelujah amen it's a purpose behind the correction the father does that because he loves the child Hollan I don't want you to get hurt I ain't got time to explain how you can get hurt by a car but listen to what I'm saying don't do that same thing when the Holy Spirit is speaking through the pastor don't do that I don't want you to miss the rapture I don't want I don't want you to end up in hell praise the Lord I want you to make it and I know it's gonna take more than that to make it praise the Lord Amen that's what a father's role is glory to God hallelujah after the father come down or you can go to mama dish your patch on the back alright I was looking at this a man let me just get this out of a hit life there's a little statement that's made here a hidden life a prophet says am I looking at brother at him regrow - god bless you brother Henry I haven't seen you for a long time and brother I'm just happened to look back and seen dad and recognize him when I had my great breakdown or come off the field for about eight months they were real brother and daddy to me he says they stayed right with me all the time I never will forget the day that brother grote there we went out in the cornfield to pray I was so nervous he says I stayed in the vision so long I couldn't tell whether I was in or or out I wolfin I will never forget brother group when he knelt down to pray with me he put his arms around me just simple like that and this is his precious now Papa God it's our brother group began to pray like he knew not now Papa God says will you come and help brother Branham Papa God says will you we will you come and help brother Branham for the RAM state that's always stay with me brother group it says oh what will it be brother girl someday I hope you hope to have my arm around you sat down by the evergreen trees where the Fountains of the waters of life is flowing from under the throne we will be in the presence of our Papa God then forever and forever to live in his presence see I was looking at this list at this turn you know the brother uses Papa God and like what you know why would you know people use the word Papas it's Father's Day and they used the word Papa they were saying this Papa is commonly a man used in the phrase mama and papa it's a word used in many languages as an affectionate term for father a man we call them Papa a man it's Anna it's an affectionate term for father and it's used in in many languages but here in the US a man maybe some other countries there's also another affectionate term that we use for father nests Danny blessed be the name of the Lord's a man that that is that is that is Danny and you know I was just so you know thank you know or something here glory to God any man can be a father because he can have kids if he can just produce children he's actually considered a father any man can be a father but it takes somebody special to be dad hallelujah any man can be a father but it takes somebody special to wear a men the badge of Pat this is this is an affectionate term that uh that the kids use for their father and I was doing I was just thinking here you know the Lord blessed me I had a biological father that brought me into this world and and you know i was very very grateful for that and and i was just kind of reflecting you know just on my own situation my my stepdad is who i consider my my daddy that's that's what i consider my daddy he he had the most impacting an influence in my life you know and you know and and and when i when i just kind of reflect this week i said i can't really remember time i came from i can't remember too many times in my life where i actually called my biological father up and wished him a happy Father's Day I didn't know him like that right I didn't know him but but but but see that the badge of daddy went to amen the man that raised me the man that actually put food on the table glory to God he might not have brought me into this world but he did everything for me that he could we built a bond that you know and he's the one taught me responsibility had to pay bills while I was in the house Laurie and then there was times that you know I didn't have the money to pay the bill and you know you know you got to be able to you got to be able to use that term daddy affectionately when you need it and I'm gonna tell you something I that I'm a daddy I know what it meant when I when I went up and said dad when I would say dad you know I that I I know you told me to pay this bill but I just don't have the money dad and you know I'm not sure how this is going to work out that and I'm just being honest with you dad I don't have it and when I'm going to miss daddy a man I got a confidence that if I can't fix it somehow my daddy go get it fixed and if I just all I need to do now is approach him the right way I need to talk to him the right way I can't come a man with with her with uh I mean I attitudes I can't come disrespectful a man I gotta approach with honor and respect daddy daddy I can't do it daddy can you help me and I got a confidence that when I get to daddy this tango get worked out I remember one time I couldn't pay that bill and I went to daddy and daddy said I don't work here we gonna split it in half but I but but you know he got paid but the next month I made sure I was ready that I didn't have to go back to daddy because see if daddy feel like you playing him daddy felt like you taking advantage of him then daddy gonna change praise the Lord somebody daddy never want to be taken advantage of not in his own house praise the Lord somebody hallelujah daddy put up to put too much out at work all glory to God dad after put up with a lot of stuff out at work I was I won't even I won't I won't read it I was just I'll just I'll speak this brother branham saying how God would come down in the cool of the evening a man that he would have fellowship with Adam and Eve you know there in the beginning and and I was just watching that statement say how God would come down in the cool of the evening to have fellowship with Adam and Eve that that is that's exactly what happens in households today right God what God was showing a man at the very beginning how households would be set up to date oh come on somebody he didn't come down in the morning but God was coming down in the cool of the evening this is after that it gets off work daddy a little tired and when were out from the day and but the kids at home waiting on him when he walked through the door the kids are ready to jump on and pounce on him and you know somehow daddy got enough strength to let the kids grab him around the leg and jump on his back even though he had a hard day's work daddy got enough strength to sit and work with him a man with a home worker whatever the meat is if they need to talk to him daddy got enough strength to work with them kids daddy would do these things in the cool of the evening why because that's a string a fatherhood God God set that strain at the very beginning so when daddy does that it's just a strain of gene from God that it's operating out of that father you see daddy is an affectionate term and I remember you know I was just you know meditating this week and just thinking about different times that I had to call my daddy you know and you get to you get to a stage in life where you feel like you don't need them like you used to need them you want to prove to them that you don't need them there was there was times that I would see daddy pay the bill we all go out to eat and daddy would pull out some money and he paid a bill and but by daddy doing that he don't know he was saying something to me when daddy was paying the bill daddy was saying something to me he he didn't even have to use words his action said son you got to step up one day and you're gonna have to pay the bill and I couldn't wait to get to the point in my life where you know I could take daddy out to eat and I could tell there to keep you keep your wallet in your pocket somebody say man daddy keep your wallet in your pocket daddy I got this you know bad because he has a relationship with you daddy look at saying like are you sure you got it because if you ain't got it I'm here to take care of some things daddy I'm always come true and see if your if you if your earthly father was like that what do you think your heavenly father is if daddy wants to provide for you daddy wants to pay for your dinner then your heavenly father also will supply for you he wants to pay for your dinner he wants to put clothes on your back he wants to put shoes on your feet your heavenly father he wants to take care of you whatever you need is daddy wants to step up that string that's in and amend the water try to take care of his family that's the strain of fatherhood and that comes from Almighty God it's not supposed to be in a man and not want to take care of his family it's not supposed to be in a man I want to run from run from it when the window window when things get a little tight he want to run that's not supposed to be in a man that's the devil perverting something but but the straining of fatherhood say I'm a step up so my daddy was just just just just pay the bill he was pretty much telling someone that he didn't have to say it to me but I knew one day I got a stuff and I got to do it I got to do it and praise God I did it and I still do it glory to God but and but I do feel good when you when you can say daddy I got it because when your kids say that that means you don't impart it something you don't deposit it something you know what and without you ever saying a word they got it they got it they understand hallelujah somebody glory to God glory to God hey man I was just you know just reflecting Lester you know I remember you know cuz a dad is an affectionate term and when you going to Daddy to ask for anything you got to know that daddy got it and there wasn't many things in my life that I you know after that I became an adult and out on my own there wasn't many things I have to go back home and ask daddy for but one thing I'll never forget when I bought my first house I had to go home I needed about $4,500 and I ain't know how to get this $4,500 and and I say I'm short 4509 I sang got ax daddy for the forty five to four forty five hundred but I said let me uh me and my wife just totter I was at three three different people that we interact fifteen hundred dollars each foot and one was my parents one was her parents too was her parents praise the look right and but by seeing like we going back to daddy and Mama and we got a we got to sit down and we got to talk hey man you got a protein right way because you don't want need help somebody say Amen mr. L mr. L mr. L mr. I didn't walk up to my my father lost a hurl no miss Earl mr. Cobb sir this is the situation we need this we need that we need this and this is this way okay all right and by coming to him and just explaining me they probably did not have it to give but because the way we approached them they gonna figure out a way to get it and I remember going to my daddy and dad that's what the situation is and we tryin to get this house dad and this is it just need this dad okay son and he that he told me ladies say you know you came at the right time I needed $1,500 a couple days before my daddy just got a check bonus check for $2,000 and it said so it didn't hurt him I'm just gonna give you what I just got because you need it son and I'm and I'm gonna help you i'ma help you launch into your first house see when you action for big things like that daddy wants to provide i'ma tell you something if my daddy stepped up my father-in-law stepped up the other person that that I need is a father in my life stepped-up hallelujah I'm gonna tell you and if fathers had it in them see this but the Bible speak about if your earthly father want to give you good gifts what do you think about your heavenly father huh hey man why you sitting out here worried why you sitting right here crying what you need to do is go talk to your daddy Papa God you need to have a conversation with Papa God the man say Papa God can you just touch brother branham Papa God you know he's been this and he's been that he don't had a breakdown but Papa God you got to have a relationship with Jesus Christ that you can approach him as Papa taught praise God daddy has a very unique role in the family I want to read to you some statistics this these stats are talking about the impact that dad's faith will have on their kids church attendance if a father does not go to church even if his wife does only one child and fifty will become a regular worshiper if a father does not go to church even if his wife does only one child in fifty will become a regular worshiper if a father does go regularly to church regardless of what the mother does the stats say between two thirds and three quarters of their children will attend church as adults see they walk sin daddy if a father at Ann's Church irregularly let me he come sometime between half and two-thirds of their kids will attend church with some regularity as adults it won't be things would echo everyone's wrong even if Daddy just goes sometime if a mother does not go to church but a father does a minimum of 2/3 of their children will end up attending church all right another one if a father does not go to church but the mother does an average of 2/3 of their children will not attend church here's another one when both parents attend Bible study uh-oh now we don't win a little further than just going to church on Sunday morning praise the Lord about but when both parents attend Bible study amen in addition to the Sunday service seventy-two percent of their children attend Sunday school when they're grown but can you imagine that their children will go to Sunday school when they adults because they parents went to Bible study and church so you don't realize your decisions affect generations you got to get through what you're going through because there's effective generations watch this now when only the father 10 Sunday School 55% of the children will attend when they're grown when only the mother attend Sunday school 15% of their children will attend when they're grown now notice when the father does it 55 percent of the kids go but when the mother's only one doing only 15 percent goes see them the stats are greater when the father's actually involved it's another when neither parent attend Sunday school only 6 percent of the children will attend when they're grown 94 percent fall off look at this some more it's the most stats if tchau is the first person in a household to become a Christian there is a 3.5 percent probability that everybody else in the house will follow that child 3.5% hallelujah if mama is the first to become a Christian there is a 17 percent probability that everybody else in that household will follow but when Daddy it's the first to become a Christian when Daddy is the first to become a Christian there is a 93 percent probability everybody else in my household come follow daddy 93 percent so when daddies remain committed great things happen even statistics short when daddies remain committed committed to God if you ever want to leave our heritage if you ever want to leave something really really important leave them the heritage of faith show them that are you going to church see I go back to my daddy my daddy wasn't a church-going man when we came up now you know what when we first started yes dad we used to see daddy to go to church all the time now we didn't know what happened and what caused dad and stop going to church we didn't realize what happened but I know when the ministry started here you know my daddy uh my daddy started coming and fellowshipping and-and-and and I remember him and my mama having a conversation and momma say you know you need to get out there here you son you need to hear you sir and my daddy say I already hear him I'm gonna say how you hear him you don't go to church how you hear you say every time I get in your car you got a tape going from the service and I'm hearing my son hallelujah CCC daddy and Mama could vouch to say I probably had two preachers for sway back then because I remember when I was in the house dad would tell me say son you talk solely just talk so loud sir the preachers voice I didn't realize it back then right but you know you know that that there's various times a man that I one specific incident that I remember daddy didn't go to church much but I remember one time you know the family wanted to walk to church and me and my brother were way too cool to be walking to church not on a Sunday the boys gonna see us way too cool to be doing something like that so uh my daddy took off going to church with mama and my daddy gave us a little space to say okay y'all then gotta walk with us but y'all better be coming behind us okay daddy will come behind you what we took our post week time getting ready before we knew it we won we didn't have watches we went watching the clock we we just we were gonna come but we weren't coming on the way my daddy's time was right and before we know we was in like we was in the house and and we were getting ready and taking on supposed to be starting and and they had already gone and before we knew it the front door swung open and that dose when we lay who in the world busting themselves like this it was my daddy didn't I tell y'all to be right behind us yes daddy he didn't he didn't amen just just that example that he set there Amen it calls us I'll help us to realize church was important to him especially for his children even though he weren't going as much but but later on when we began to understand things of life we knew why daddy wasn't going to church he was looking for something real my daddy was looking for something real and when my daddy found something real he remain committed if a father is the first one that become a Christian in this family and faithfully serves God it's a 93 percent chance that everybody just in his household will follow every child mama everything in the household follows because daddy has made this commitment I know there we have not nowadays a lot of single dads you just keep doing what you're supposed to be doing God gonna take care of the rest even statistics show it God gonna take care of the rest there's this quote he was the past that way the Prophet makes a statement here he says could you imagine I had people tell me - tell me brother branham I would ask God to heal me but I know he's busy random in this message he was to pass that way says that people come and say so but I just know he's too busy I know he's busy says my could you imagine a little fish about that long out in the middle of the of the Atlantic Ocean saying I better drink of this water sparingly I may run out someday ha ha ha that's just as intelligent of thinking that you are that you could ever exhaust God's goodness to you can you imagine you can't exhaust God's goodness to you says could you imagine a little mouse about that long under the great darkness of Egypt saying I just better eat two grains a day it may not last through the winter oh my you can't he won't just you wants you to ask abundant so that your Joy's could be fool look at this don't be afraid to ask God for anything for he is he's willing more willing to give it than you ought to receive it if we just get that little shadow wipe the way to know that he's willing to do it you're his children he loves you saying you know how you like to minister and do good things to your children how much that very strain of fatherhood of parent to your children comes from God the Prophet is stripes I mean I'm talking about dollar straight on with this let me just finish reading this he says that very strain of fatherhood of parent to your children comes from God because he's the father of us all He loves us he wants he wants to do for us if he could just get us lined up with the blessings and so forth he can trust us and say then he said that the heaven is open to all of us I was thinking of God coming down in the cool of the evening right and I was just you know he was talked about thinking about thinking on God coming down in the cool of the evening he would come down and check on his children the cool of the evening amen and that was a very appropriate thing that God was doing because it was it was actually telling us what life would be like today how fathers would come home in the cool of the evening sit down with their children hallelujah and that that when they're doing that it's a strain of fatherhood a gene from God that has been expressed through that daddy to his family Oh glory to God I like that I like that this scripture that we read like as a father pitieth his children Psalms 103 and 13 like as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pities them that fear him and that word pity means to to love deeply to have mercy to be compassionate to have tender affection have compassion now you know typically when a child is first born man the daddy just has a it's a glow about him he just he just want to hold them he wanna kiss them he want to do this he he want to lay them on his chest and he want to do all kind of things there's a there's a tender affection however when the child needs that diaper change glory daddy that daddy loses somebody perfection and the dad is holding a child up and taking it right to mama something don't smell right they give it to mama you know but but you know what I'll tell you what if there's ever time like you know I recently had my grandson and my wife had to go take care of something and I had them for you know I let I take we had an eight-hour day say okay you got seven hours I'll take the eighth hour I figured he'd be sleeping everything else and I'm good but he was awakened and he needs that diaper change I'm like okay it's time to own up mama I mean grandma here granddaddy here granddaddy need to step up and do something I could sit there and say yeah I'm gonna just wait till your grandma get back but no no sometimes daddy you got to step up praise the Lord amen and that compassion just okay it's not and now it's time for me to kind of step in and do what I need to do here with my with my grandson hallelujah I was just just meditating you know on the scription on these words there's times that even my own daughters but when they approach me as daddy they can get me to milk there was there was a time a man not that they look older they don't get me that that like that no more I don't learn the game but what a my daughter she just used daddy we want to go shopping and it wasn't dad we just want you to drive us cuz I know if I Drive them I might actually get end up going in the store and if I go in the store I'm not gonna shop but I got something in my pocket praise the Lord better help them while they shop so so when they never get there and they know because I you know as a daddy not that I pity my child but you know what I want to be able to come through for so you won't that all right I got it for you you want that I got it for you you want that I got it free then I start realizing I'm gonna always be getting and I'm gonna have to let them get it sometime praise the Lord some hallelujah but whenever daddy would you do this daddy that's a term of affection and I'm gonna tell you if that strain is in me to want to come through for my daughters what do you think Amen it's in God that wants to come through for all of his children what you see expressed through the father hallelujah is what God is actually trying to express to you himself brother Branham used to he made a statement say I thought the father actually hated me I thought he didn't like me he said but I learned he said thought Jesus loved him but the father just really didn't like me just didn't like myself he said but what I learned is that Jesus was the very heart of God Jesus was the very heart of God let me um hallelujah I think I just want to read that and then I want to I want to go into something here Jesus was a very heart of God oh thank you Jesus oh my I think I misplaced it but that's okay you'll find it if you're looking for it Jesus himself was the very heart of God I want to circle back now yeah this is the identified with Christ identified with Christ it's using this as an in a prayer and then I want to just kind of circle back to our scripture mark 5 mark 4 says let us pray now Heavenly Father we are grateful to thee for the goodness of Jesus Christ who is the sin of love and I used to think that you were angry with me but Jesus loved me but I find out now that Jesus is the very heart of God hallelujah so I know that you love me and suffer for me and father God I pray for this world today and for our country I pray Lord for forgiveness of my own mistakes and for the mistakes of my people the people that you give me to ship it over now this is brother branham's prayer okay and it says and I pray that you'll bless them and every one of the people that's been in this little meeting that's asked questions maybe I've said something contrary to what they believe Lord I can't explain it myself I'm unable will you just let them know father that in my heart what I mean please I pray you'll do that bless them together bless us now as we're waiting on your word just a few moments before baptismal service help us to speak that which is right help us in the message in this message to knock my throat being a little a little husky I pray that you'll help me dear God and you'll even heal the sick and afflicted that's in the midst of the people for we ask it in Jesus name Amen brother Branham was staying here in his prayer I used to think God was angry with me and that Jesus loved me but he found out that Jesus was the very heart of God Jesus was the very heart of God as I meditated on that just a couple of things came to me you know when we want to look at the heart of God and how he feels about us even when we've strayed away from him we go back to the story that Jesus told of the prodigal son amen and as you just look at that story you can actually feel the heart of God and what a father represents a man daddy did not appreciate when the board rose up and said you know what I want I want my own I want my inheritance and I'm leaving house right now dad and never really appreciated that but daddy never stopped the boy daddy let the boy go on and do exactly what he wanted to do what he thought he was big and bad enough to do daddy let the boy go but daddy never stopped praying for his son remember those stats now I know if I'm raising my kid the right way if I'm leading by example there is a 93 percent chance that this boy coming back hallelujah there's a not I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna take my chance on living right if it's a ninety three percent chance that my child gonna follow my footsteps I'm gonna take my chance on living right what's I never said I know what I did I know what I sold him I bought another example that I said I don't know where he gonna end up I don't know his story but I just have I have a I have a feeling that some point time this boy won't come back for the RAM said that the dad was out there praying all the time constantly praying praying for his boy lord do something send your angel to touch him sin God I mean get his attention some kind of way didn't know what his boy was doing the boy got bored and spinning up all his money got to hanging with the wrong people amen God got so low that he had to take a job that he shouldn't have never had hallelujah they're taking care of pigs and as a as a as a Jewish person he was not supposed to be anywhere near Pig but he had to take a job that he he shouldn't have had only because of the condition that he was in that is still praying dad is still praying and one day the boy said you know brother branham said angel went to the boy as dad it was praying that angel once was born and just begin to just deal with his mind and and in the scripture said he came to himself and when the boy beginning to come them said I mean he begin to think about some stuff he you know it was better in my daddy's house and you know the servants even live better in my dad and what I want you to understand is that when this boy was coming back to the house daddy's house was still functioning amen daddy's house in changed because the boy left daddy's house was still functioning amen and the boy realized that even the servants live better in my daddy's house I don't have to go back and be a son but let me be a servant in daddy's house I'm gonna repent when I get back to daddy I'm gonna tell him how sorry I am it took something for that boy to come to that point but he had enough sure if it comes down I'm going back home to my daddy's house and as soon as I see daddy I'm gonna make things right come walking down the road and I can see daddy may be looking at with some binoculars and telling mama Here Come your boy how you know that's him because of the way he walk I know my boy I know my boy the way he walking is he's on his way home that you sure that's not that's our son daddy left our house went out to the front of the property just waiting on his son to get back and when he stood out there and the board come and say daddy before you say a word I want to tell you daddy I'm sorry I don't I don't waste it everything I done did this I don't did that and that I was just thinking it's it your service they're better than the way I'm living out here I know I shamed your name and and I'm not even worth it because your son but daddy if you just let me be a servant in your house I'll be happy daddy daddy say you were born son and since you were born son you can never be a servant you'll always be son and saying I don't care what you've done son I'm just happy to have you home same I tell them sir go get go get the fatted calf bring him a ring of gold put him on a rope and we celebrating because my boy is back Manny had a celebration in that house and see this was the this is the heart of God as a father the father is always waiting for his child to come the father is always waiting on the child to find out who they are the father's waiting on that revelation to strike that child and the father just gonna keep on praying if you got to pray by herself he'll keep on praying and to that son get into his position but the daddy had another boy and that other brother come from the field and he said you know what what's going on in here was this great celebration everything he said want a sermon say oh yo daddy it's celebrating because your brother don't come back my brother yeah your brother sell your brother's home and your daddy's in there celebrating and your daddy this your daddy that your daddy said kill the fatted calf your daddy did I mean he see he they haven't they haven't be having a party in there for my brother he don't waste our money and oh the brothers they ain't going in that party for nothing but the heart of a father even when the other boy didn't want to come in if you notice the scripture mama didn't go out and see him but daddy say I got to go out to my other boy and I got to have a conversation with my other boy and he said dad he said daddy I've been here all this time getting had no celebrations for me and you had this you had that he's saying and this your son say this just son then when I don't wasted all his money and riotous living in sin that I can't see how you can celebrate a boy like that and say yeah yeah yeah he has done that he's done everything wrong it's a son but you need to understand something everything I got left actually belong to you and this your brother no no no not this my son but this your brother see your daddy ain't gonna let division coming to his house hallelujah this is Joe Bravo because y'all share blood we're gonna celebrate his return cuz he he once was lost but now he's found he was dead but now he's alive we're gonna celebrate together when you want to understand the heart of God when it comes to fatherhood it just look at that story Jesus was the heart of God we read here in Scripture mark 4 they were on their way to the other side and Jesus giving him commandment to go to the other side and that's there on the way to the other side I love this because the scripture said that it wasn't just their ship that was going over but it was other little ships that's a question for you who you're rolling with let me ask another who you rollin wit who is your ride or die and see if I'm gonna get in some trouble I want to get in trouble with Jesus but these other little ships and even though they they they roll in amen on the Seas with with Jesus and he's in only in one boat now he's only one boat but because Amen they were in the sea at the same time jeez was in the sea then they had the opportunity to receive of the same blessing they might not even heard him speak to the storm but they felt the effects see see that's why it's good to just be in church it's good to be rolling with the right people you don't I mean you may not speak to us tongue but you will reap the benefits little ships disciples say not the king he'll do the other little ships and I mean they tryna they tryin to figure out what they gonna do too but the disciples got Jesus in the bone safe you know hey Jesus do you even care that we bout to die do you even care Jesus he rises up and just walks to the front of the boat and puts his foot up there and says peace be still and when he speaks to the the storm and a man in the waves and you know nay they realized not not only did the disciples in their boat see this but all the other little boats they saw that a man something just happened here so disciple like you know I'll tell us a WETA we don't even know what kind of man this is that would speak to the winds and the waves and they would obey Him who we are we rollin wit but the purpose of Jesus going through this great exercise if it's because there was a father that was in bondage there was a father that had lost his mind there was a father that was no longer going to church anymore there was a father that left his home because of pressure there's a father that has to come to amen the stress of life there was a father they had forsaken his responsibility and the very reason that Jesus would put himself in danger it's because he wants to get to this one father see there's a strain of fatherhood I mean God wants to give you his best God wants you to have his best God doesn't want to see his son and bondage like that so he would he would hear how Jesus leave a revival he have Jesus go through a stormy sea he have Jesus go through a great waves in order to get to one son we pick up this story in mark five let's just read it mark five first one they came over to the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit now the Bible just says that this is a man with an unclean spirit and there there's so many things a man that we could say here the way that this man came into this condition brother Branham said one night he took his first smoke just by yielding to take that smoke brother random say spirit stepped into him then he went home and somebody asked him a question and he lied about his experience that night and another spirit stepped into him and then he did something else and maybe he went out another night and this time you're gonna take a drink and then maybe some what's that on your breath I smell sir I do and just just just going from from one spirit to the next spirit to the next beer to he had two thousand demons living on the inside of one man three thousand demons living on the inside of one man he never thought he'd be that way he probably a young man that went to Sunday school they probably did a lot of things right but but when he did the one thing wrong he opened himself up to other spirits look at this unclean spirits unclean the ones that make you not put on clothes those are unclean spirits huh look at this verse 3 says who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains that means this man lived in a graveyard he left he had probably had his own house left the house moved into a graveyard what type of person would buy laying in a graveyard he didn't own the land he just lived amongst dead things and I'm telling y'all some of us living amongst dead things because that he had been often bound with fetters and changed and the chains have been plucked asunder by him and the land and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him he become a wild man and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying cutting himself with stones I want to tell you that right there is a unclean spirit that has come into the land causing our young people to want to cut themselves praise the Lord that is an unclean spirit that is a demon from Hell doing that to our young people and one time they're gonna cut the wrong vein you're in the wrong place they can hit a vein and that's gonna be it the devil is trying to kill you you got the you get you got to you got to rise up and overcome that some kind of way if you need to stand altar and pray and still in altar and pray but rise up and defeat that devil this man was cutting himself just like young people today and even older people today try to cut themselves look at it verse 6 but when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him and I love the way to script to read this because even though this man was in this condition he didn't really want to be in this condition this band was actually looking for an opportunity to come out of what he was in Jesus was his only opportunity so when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him so even the devil's know who Jesus is hallelujah glory to God he ran and worshipped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the Most High God I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not now how the devil gonna tell Jesus not the torment them but they tormenting this man God I'm living in a graveyard away from his family this is a father it's not just some men but this is a father that has left home he's been broken down by depression hallelujah what we need to learn how to do is sometimes get alongside of fathers and lift them back up encourage them some kind of way you know even as a wife you got to learn how to encourage your husband speak life over praise the Lord amen just every household ain't no households perfect all the striving a man for perfection glory to God don't don't pit your kids against your husband don't do that and don't don't be saying all kind of negative things about your husband to your kids and don't let your kids say negative things about your husband that is your daddy praise the Lord amen amen amen pray pray to God to get a hold of God can get older this man God can get a hold of your daddy all right glory to God look at this and a man and crowd with a loud voice I said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the Most High God i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he axed him what is that name not a demon having a conversation with Jesus any y'all ever want to talk to the Lord if a demon can have a conversation with him I know you can come out of the man down clean spirit he asked him what does that mean in the answer saying my name is legion for we are many you ain't just dealing with no one devil here it's a bunch us alright it says he besought him much that he would not send them away out of country not a devil has already he already received his his his statement come out of him but now the devil is talking back I was like please look at me say say that he might not send him away out of the country now he said now there was nigh unto the mountain a great herd of swine feeding and all the devil's besought him saying send us unto the swine that we may enter into them oh I love the way brother jinga bula put this here these Devils are praying asking Jesus for permission just don't send us to the abyss but send us to the swine the devil was asking permission had if they submitted a prayer request and forthwith Jesus gave them leave Devils got the prayer answered what you think about the children of God so so so I encourage you again don't ask for something small actually something big that only your daddy can handle because there's a strain of fatherhood that flows through your door through your Papa God where he wants to give you the things that you you can even imagine that he could give you don't actually something small actually something great see I only went to daddy when I needed daddy now if I could pay my my $30 bill I paid my $30 bit but when he got the 300 I'm like I ain't got the 300 see there was a time where I used to have to take money out my piggy bank and put gas in my car guess y'all ain't never had to do count my pennies try to walk into the gas station when ain't too many people there y'all and y'all don't know nothin about that how much you want we got to count this up I want this hallelujah see I didn't want it I want my daddy to know that I was doing that bad that I had to take pennies to get gas now if I had I told my daddy he would've gave me money to go get the gas but I just didn't want to tell him some things I wanted to take on myself but sometimes you run into a situation where you just need to sit down and talk to Daddy stop bypassing him sit down and talk to him hallelujah he pities you he sympathizes with you and often times you know you don't you don't really find out things about your daddy until you start going through some stuff when you start dealing with some things in your own life now he can tell you about some of his experiences oh yeah ain't nothing I've been there I've done that and yeah that's happened a nap you're gonna be all right how you pay your ties it's gonna be all right you paid your ties I'm gonna tell you what God say he got them rebuke they devolved for you'll see that's what God said so you ain't got none to worry about daddy you should've you ain't got nothing to worry about never finish reading this and all the devil's besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them forthwith Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about 2,000 and were choked in the sea two thousand demons says and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it what it was that was done and when they come to Jesus see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed see this man the unclean spirit actually calls him to take clothes off and somebody asks a question brother Adam where does unclean spirits if you see people taking their clothes off those unclean spirits have come upon them amen we holy we dress holy we look holy all right look it says uh and they come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the Legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid and they that saw it told them how it be failed to him that was possessed with the devil and all also concerning the swine and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts they asked Jesus to leave a man see these these people actually by being in gathering this is where this happened these people Ghaderi were also a part of the the tribes that did not go all the way into the Promised Land all right they stayed shorter problems then to it let us have our inheritance here so you don't stay short of it God got something else for you and by them stands short they don't even know how to respond to the supernatural they asked Jesus to leave actually you know I'm just I'm gonna just put it this way there's some people would prefer to see you bound than to see you free but Papa God prefers to see you free than to see you bow and Papa gotta go against what everybody else is thinking what everybody else is saying to get one captive set free let's finish this verse 17 they begin to pray him to depart out of their coasts and when he was coming to the ship he that had had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him so pretty much I want to go with you I don't I'm leavin the graveyard but I want to go with you I got clothes on now Jesus and I want to go with you but look at what Jesus say he says howbeit Jesus suffered him not but sitting him go home brother branham goes into his little deeper and we can see that this man had a family at home daddy had left home they say now go go home not only go home go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord had done for thee and and and and have had compassion on thee and neither party began to publish into capitalist how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did marvel and brother branham just come tells how this man was going back home and and maybe as he's on his way back home his daughter's out there playing in the street and she's like is that who I think it is you sure this who I think it is girl can run into now my daddy think daddy coming home what we in steam daddy in years you show us daddy I think it's daddy be careful now you know what happened last time your daddy was here be careful mom I don't know something something look look look a little funny hear something I don't know mama someone look at me dad don't look the same and that's daddy coming up and just looking at the family just wandering and gazing like is that you really you daddy didn't he maybe went when he left the house he didn't have no clothes but I ain't coming back combing these clothes daddy looked different because daddy had come in contact with the Lord Jesus if that is one to be different today dad is gonna have to come in contact with Jesus that are we gonna have a conversation repent to his wife repent his daughter and that family begin to be restored because of what Jesus did in this man's life now I want to tell you that was a strain of fatherhood that was being displayed through the life of Christ going through a stormy sea just to get to one soul that's how much he loves us you celebrate that one song just like he did with the prodigal son he celebrates that one soul because one stole is worth ten thousand world's it's a strain of fatherhood we see expressed and I fought this we see Express and past us we see expressed and God it is a strain of fatherhood hallelujah there's a little statement here on a message adoption part 2 and I'll close right here says well bless your heart sister Georgia no harm can come nothing at all in the evening time we'll go up to the top of the mountains and say Oh Papa God I once was lost I was once in the muck of sin papa God and you saved me why people that's tried to express that switch went crazy well that man who wrote the last verse of the old love of God that was pinned on the insane wall of an institution who tried to express the love of God how that he stopped to save sinners and how that he did his love that come down to save you and I talked about worship angels don't know nothing about it the work the worship a angel only knows he stands there and and Wanda swings back and forth across hallelujah hallelujah but oh mercy when it comes to knowing that I was lost and now I'm found I was dead I'm alive again I'm alive again Oh God I was saying I was muck I was down on the dump see when we realized how he is elevated us then it shifts the relationship and it's just no longer just a simple prayer wheel or Papa God Papa God you did this Papa God you did that see we went to daddy we couldn't fix this thing on our own but daddy somehow got it resolved Papa God thank God for that strain of fatherhood that he has demonstrated to each and every one of us god bless you god bless you praise the Lord a man shall we have

stormy sea to go reach this one father that was lost and couldn't find his way ended up sleeping in tombs father you can reach those men today and I pray somehow someway God you get their attention
