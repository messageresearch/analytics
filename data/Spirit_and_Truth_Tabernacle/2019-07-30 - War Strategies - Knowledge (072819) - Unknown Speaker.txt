have you with us in your family from brother research there in Jamaica my men they drove from Miami to be in service with us on a day so certainly certainly did have you all and fellowship just a couple quick things I just think that meeting the devii need to mention sister Verna brother Jimmy you all know that they're renewing their vows in September and I believe they gave out invitations to the church and I don't think they got the response yet from everybody they meet if you have an invitation please make sure that you get the response back to them as they're making the arrangements and their plans and man for that so please get that to them as soon as possible also I wanted to just mention word of thanks to everyone that contributed to our back-to-school drive on yesterday and it was a tremendous success praise the Lord praise the Lord just everyone that gave you know just supplies and backpacks and you know paper and you know just whatever you did pens we appreciated it because you know we didn't know exactly I was gonna go I think we had a hundred back tanks and and some other things for the high school students and I believe the numbers were up to like 95 is that right 97 97 backpacks were giving out them yesterday and we were very very pleased a man with the results and we just think sister Tina she just worked tirelessly endlessly just getting everything prepped I'm ready and I'm gentle just playing it all out and just everyone that pitched in to just kind of support it while we were there yesterday there was a lady that was going inside the store over here and now she saw what was going on and and she said look so organized and she happens to be a person that actually has given out in the past I believe 1200 backpacks and one drive and so she said I got a lot of supplies and I'd like to just donate it to y'all and so this morning she brought all the supplies for us amen that we can use it the next drive and we thank God for that praise the Lord [Applause] and then we also got another telephone call from a man of sister Tanya told us that her daughter of sister Candace wanted to give us a hundred backpacks and so we already I mean that happening yesterday after we left so for the next year we were doing a little debrief yesterday I saved 200 bags next year where we got a 113 of the 200 already in one day so so we need about what 67 1 so we have 130 all right so we need 70 we need 70 bags for next year so I think all for that so this is just a real blessing paid and a real blessing praise the Lord so [Music] also I haven't

actually be a way in Australia I'll be preaching three times in Australia at two different cities and then also I have a concert that I'll be doing down there with a few weeks ago there was a brother pastor at church by name brother Alex and y'all saw maybe on the bass guitar brother Alex about a year ago start requesting and asking if I would consider coming to Australia and doing a concert down there and I said well brother as you know to what makes a way we'll certainly consider it you know and you know so I have this this this birthday thing coming up and and I told my wife I say you know what this is a special birthday for me and say that my present is going down to Australia a man soul so removing some services and also I get a chance just to kind of do some some touring and things that nature but this is a present to myself a man for just how good God's been to me and I just appreciate the opportunity so just asking that you all keep us in prayer we'll be here next week but we're leaving on Monday the fifth and we'll be back on the 16th I believe which is a Friday a man and a brother brother gene will be handling a man the Sunday morning in brother Troy be handling the

he doing and I missed you know I'm very grateful a man very grateful so we'll certainly be looking forward to all that God has in store a man so I won't take any more time thank you all so much today we want to at the end of service we want to have prayer for amen our students a man as well as teachers and anyone else that's involved in school we we invited just about everybody that got a backpack amen to come for a prayer today if they desire to do so but if they didn't I left some scriptures inside they back a man for them to kind of read a little bit in and then one of them you know especially with all this things happened in school I put in them no weapon formed against you will prosper and every tone that rises against should be condemned so I was like I say read this every day you know just read it over your family every day as you're going out the house who knows what God will do but our job is just to plant seeds and it's God's job to bring increase amen to what we plant so we just we just appreciate the Lord Jesus I want to read a man a couple passage of Scripture a man on today and if you all would just stand with me as I read the word of the Lord I'm reading from 2nd Peter 1 this is our foundation and our journey and man we've been taking we got a little series that's going at this point in time war strategies a man war strategies and we're using the statue of a perfect man as a foundation for those different strategies and I trust that the Lord just continue to bless our efforts I was told by my uncle we had a family reunion last weekend my uncle said I'm enjoying the series you and Joe let's see here he's is a water I say what and he lives up in Washington DC so he's watching the videos as they go up and and enjoying the series and say well praise the Lord you just never know who's being blessed by what you do and and that's that's all of us right so when we come we have to be yielded you know those who's who's getting strength from from what you do a man the song that you sing might be the right song that went cursed somebody at the time that they lead him right so we want to come a man and and and just yielding ourselves to the Lord and allowing him to get all the glory all the honor and men here in 2nd Peter 1 I'm starting at verse 3 according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him they have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and I've forgotten that he was purged from his old sense wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure but if you do these things you shall never fall Amen if you would also turn with me to a passage over in 1st Kings chapter 21 amen today our topic is war strategies knowledge amen we'll be focusing on the the virtue of knowledge we've talked about faith and we've talked about virtue amen but today we will spend time talking about knowledge it men here in 1st Kings 21 verse 17 it says and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite saying arise go down to me 1/2 king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth with him he has gone down to possess it now I find it quite amazing when we read this God sent Elijah after they both had died right now he could have sent him before but he actually chose to send him after they both had died all right and you know we were we were reading something on Wednesday night there and the prophet Isaiah had been had been cut in half by a wicked King at the time before he repented you know he was he was a very wicked King Manasseh he I mean they they said there's a couple of different things but one of them said that Isaiah got inside of a tree to hide from the king but the fringes of His garment let everybody know that he was there so the king ordered somebody to come and cut the tree in half and they cut the prophet in half and you know what brother Branham say he was sent here for witness that was that was a very purpose Isaiah was sitting here for witness God could have stopped him from cutting that tree but it didn't allow it but he was sent here for a witness right and and sometimes you might wonder why I'm going through that you sit here for a witness somebody get strength from the trial that you going through right so don't complain hey man we got to learn we got to learn to count it all joy all right Alleluia I'm telling you something when we when we I can't always forget the the messenger who did it but they said the man could not remember 15 minutes out of any day that he was discouraged he wouldn't he wouldn't let discouragement go past 15 minutes I think brother Caleb give people advice like that when he talk to him say you can have a bad day but just a lot out so much time for your day to kind of talk about that that day and say like like you got a lunch hour after after lunch get back into work brother Caleb and tell them they have a lunch get back into work so after you finish talking about your bad day you screaming and kicking and punching the walls and all that get back to work no just keep holding onto it a lot so much time and i'ma take 15 minutes that's it that's it that's all you got 15 minutes that's it put a smile on your face God can do all things a man and here we see him verse 18 says arrives go down to meet they have king of Israel witches and samarium but he is in the vineyard and a boss tells him exactly is whether he has gone down to possess it and and and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the LORD hath thou killed and also taking possession and thou shalt speak and him saying thus saith the Lord in the place where the dogs licked the blood of nabe off shall dogs lick thy blood even vine amen the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word let's just have a word of Prayer father we're grateful for the privilege and the opportunity we have to come and hear your word God do you know exactly what we stand in need of here today and we pray that the Spirit of God would encourage us but strengthen us a man through the word that we hear bless every heart bless each one has come through the doors those that would even hear this sermon online we pray that you bless them and God we take every spirit that's against your spirit I mean in control of the Holy Ghost even right now some jesus name we pray amen you can be seated praise the Lord so if you let me just kind of start us off here by reading a couple quotes from statue of a perfect man and we will get into this thought war strategies and the virtue that we are focusing on today is knowledge Amen praise the Lord so out of stature of a perfect man I'm at paragraph 160 the Prophet makes the statement he says and then thirdly says then thirdly you add knowledge it says now knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge amen knowledge that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God a man I love this statement because that's foolishness to God but knowledge a man to judge judge what right from wrong all right and that's the type of knowledge you want to add now let's to be able to judge right from wrong how do you judge them if you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong amen and if you can last out all your creeps and all your unbelief everything that you claim you have done then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot lie I like that knowledge to believe that God cannot lie let every man's work be alive but mine be true amen and it says now now you're getting knowledge that's supreme knowledge glory to God you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that have it because all these virtues are given to you by God to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of God yes sir now that's an important statement to me all right the Prophet says all these virtues are given to you by God oh my now I thought we had that's what that's what the Bible say add to your faith virtue and knowledge and and add temperance and have patience and act godless all these things but but when you're really what we need to realize is that when you are born again these things automatically add to you it's not you doing it it's God that's already done the job God just needs a surrender vessel hallelujah glory to God and I love the world the way brother quake ooh Amen put it it's not because we always looked at it as you got to climb this step you gotta climb it and you got to do this and we looked at it going upward like that it's a by God is circular and what I get from that is that you know as a circulars eternal right he meant it and they're different periods of your life where you'll see this manifesting hallelujah another trial come and then you'll see that manifested and then another trial come and then you'll see that and you know any just tell it keeps going [Applause] I'm gonna be a statue of a perfect man are you gonna be the statue of a perfect woman that's what God has called you to how that's why he gave you five for ministry to bring you to that place fivefold ministry is not just to stimulate your intellect huh but fivefold ministries try to bring you to a place where Christ is on display inside of you all right all right glory let's keep on going since because all these virtues are given to you by God to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of God yes sir and it goes on says and and knowledge because knowledge of his word you must believe it in this way such as you should believe today that are accepted that the days of miracles has not passed knowledge that what God said God is able to perform a man what God said God is able to perform glory to God glory to God and it goes on he says Abraham believe that and when he was a hundred years oh can you imagine that he was a hundred years old he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief at a hundred the man is waiting 25 years for this promise to be fulfilled and at one hundred he's not staggering huh how long we've been waiting on the promise right amen we get we got it we got it we got it he wants us to add knowledge at that if God said it he's gonna do it not only he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him hey man anybody diligently seeking God now I'm gonna tell you are you gonna when you pray sometimes you're gonna have to wait oftentimes you're gonna have to wait right God is trying to protect patients in you amen glory God so so understand that you know it's not gonna be i'ma praying then I'm gonna get up in and they're there to answer gonna be no you go you go you're gonna pray then the devil gonna bring some doubt my faith gonna be tested all along the way but my knowledge says diligently seek Him I'm gonna get what I asked for God changing things about you waiting you know what you know I just found out this week while we waiting the price of the church drops seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars [Applause] you just wait on God don't don't don't help him don't do nothing just wait and have knowledge that what he promised you he'll perform it if it dropped once maybe I didn't get no email to tell me that oh nothing I just went back hey then drop seven Oh God thank you Jesus just keep waiting just keep waiting just keep waiting it can't wait I believe that and I received that sense hey man glory to God sometime you gotta wait on your promise but with knowledge know that God gonna do what he's saying amen God is able to do just what he said he'll do he's gonna fulfill every promise to you don't give up on God because he won't give up on you he's able tell your neighbor he's able he's able he's able he's able he's able he's able Oh hallelujah glory to God alright let me keep going amen so he says abraham believed that when he was a hundred years old he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief look how ridiculous that word looked here's a man a hundred years old looking for a baby to be born into his home by woman ninety years old now you can imagine everywhere I looked right over telling him please man stop with the testimony cuz every time I pass to open up a testimony brahim ghetto I want to thank God for my baby now this is ridiculous Abraham you've been saying this for years and nothing that's happened and and and you all are way past bearing but Abraham had a promise from God hallelujah and if you got a promise from God you can stand against everybody not only stand against everybody you can stand against any condition any circumstance you can stand because you got a right for God hallelujah glory hallelujah Manny Manny men say here's a man a hundred years old looking for a baby to be born in his home by one man 19 years OC almost 50 years passed Barry live with her since she was a young girl a teenage and here he is his life stream was dead and Sarah swooned was dead and all hopes is cold my as far as it was hopes a man but yet against hope he believed in hope a man because he had knowledge that God was able to keep everything that he promised all right I love that just a couple of statements a man I won't read these books but I just pulled it out of this section in the in the statute of a perfect man brother Brandon made a bunch of little statements there one of those was all these virtues are given to you by God to police upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of God nothing he says you add this knowledge when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory a man when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory now this is very important because there's many nowadays King seated you get into conversations with people in the first thing they say is we're not we're not men takes understand everything that's not correct because according to my Bible he's gonna send the seventh angel and when he come all the mysteries of God would be finished which means every every mystery everything that you couldn't understand everything you thought was contradictory amen then the Holy Spirit will bring understanding to you but that's after you received the Ministry of that seventh angel you see say he say say when you can see that the Scriptures not contradictory that you can say that and see that by the revelation of God the whole they may sense the whole word is wrote in mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it so when you can get it and say punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith now when you can punctuated with a name and add that to your faith now well they talk about eastern out let me go on another a statement that he makes it when you can see that acts 2:38 does not contradict Matthew 28:19 welcome now now what do we mean by that Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 go and baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Peter standing there listening to Jesus speak these words hallelujah and then 10 days absent Iza speaks this Peter goes into the upper room has a mighty experience with God and then the people that are surrounding a mentor ouessem at that time they understand they saw what was happening there and these people speaking in tongues in their native languages and and all they said begin acts what shall we do to be saved and Peter says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promise is unto you till your children those that are fought as many as the Lord our God shall come ten days after Jesus told him baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost people pick up their Bibles and they will tell you that Peter got it wrong I want to tell you that those scriptures do not contradict one another but those scriptures actually complete each other somebody you can get to your virtue because the Bible does not contradict itself what Matthew 28:19 said because Matthew 28:19 was titles name of the Father and conjunction where of the Son and of the Holy Ghost hallelujah and Peter says he understood by revelation what the name was the name of the Father the name in the New Testament it never changed the three different gods it was God just changing his offices I just love this I'm gonna just just just just give me just a minute or so but you know you know when I got share this with people you know I say you know it's like it's like me I in this church my mama's here that makes me a son right in this church I got children here that makes me a father huh right it makes me a father I'm a father I'm a son amen I'm a human I got a brother here I'm a brother hallelujah glory to God amen there's their sinks that I shepherd here I'm a pastor amen also just titles that I the one person where I'm the one person with all them titles and now you want to know how can I operate at all them titles easy let my mama be standing right here and let my daughter be standing right here and I can have a conversation with my mama and I act like a son standing right next to me is my daughter and when she chime in then I go to father mood all in the same conversation and I'm not talking to myself I just understand my role and then if somebody else woke up say brother Jack brother Jack now I become pastor the same guy talking and all the conversations just changing offices and that's exactly what God did understand you can get these days and find out that the scripture does not contradict then add that to your virtue [Applause] the revelation to the person when you can explain it yourself you add that and then me tell you something I'm gonna tell you how you got the ability to add it because God gave you and when it come down I'm at it oh my super ant oh Jesus come on Church hallelujah I love that so so acts 2:38 does not contradict Matthew 28:19 but it completes it see knowledge he said knowledge not worldly don't don't don't use worldly knowledge because worldly knowledge reasons he says any kind of worldly knowledge will reason says see but faith has no reasoning God reveals to you a certain certain thing going to happen every scientists in the world could say is contrary it could not happen do you believe in it how that's what Noah did right when God revealed to him that it was gonna rain even though people could prove now it has never rained never not one time have we have that was new language to them rain because at that time the earth had perfect irrigation and I mean in order to water you know the water the trees the water the plants they would get their water from underneath the earth they didn't even need rain it was perfect irrigation hallelujah so when no one comes along and says it's gonna rain now we look at that because we know what rain is nowadays but at that time that was completely against common syncing hallelujah glory to God it caused the people to stumble because they never seen nothing like this and this man is building a boat for people to get in and they say they say it's gonna rain come on Noah come on I mean be realistic but when God has revealed something to you you have to stand against everybody can I tell you something when God begins to reveal this word to you huh you can't help but see certain thing I mean there was a family recently that I heard about neighbor stealers they was they just come to the message and I placed our hearing some of these truths they were saying we can't see why people can't see this my dad has said the same thing I can't my dad would have argued argument after argument why can't you see what happened in the garden that it was not somebody eating the fruit why can't you see that and I'm gonna tell you something about this message y'all ever seen like a 3d picture they used to have these things you go inside doctors offices and all over the place they have a 3d peach depicting everybody just stem they gauge that in the picture and they'll tell you now inside the picture is this there's a certain object in the picture and what you have to do is sit there and stare at it and before you know it your eyes begin to focus and you can see behind you know everything that's just on the surface you see behind you can see what's in that picture and any I never had that experience before now I want to taste something once you see it [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] don't look at it keep listening to the tapes cuz you are paying to see glory to God the Prophet says not worldly knowledge because their reasons but we won't we won't say faith does not have any reason God reveals to you a certain thing that's going to happen and every scientist the world can say is contrary it could not happen but you believe it anyhow Noah believed it and it certainly rained just the way no if I prophesied that it would it another little statement that he made and I like this he says you know there's a difference and he was used in the scripture let me let me let me quote this scripture for you before I make this statement usual scripture Psalms 1 verse 1 through 3 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night that's what I think about I just think about the Word of God write and demand that's like that look at verse 3 and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of the water now now the Prophet makes a statement here he says the difference in being planted all right he says being planted and being set out he says you know there's a difference of being planted and set out or stuck out right now now the scripture says he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water now I wanna I want to make a couple statements go back to that script to pull that back up for me that he bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither so when this man is planted by the river water amen his fruit will bring forth in the season a notice it's not his League shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper I love this if his leaf will not wither it means he'll never experience winter if its leaf won't wither he'll never go through seasons you understand I mean because fall is one season and winter is another season and spring and summer if this man's leaf won't wither he will always be blessed this is what I was saying now you know when we are you know yes we have trials but I think it's our attitude in the midst of the trial right because if your attitude don't shift if you realize that no matter what you're going through it falls into the category of Romans 8:28 you understand what I'm saying everything that you're facing your your your family issues your job issues how your school issues amen whatever it is that you're facing it falls into the category all you got to do is put it over there I'm turning that the Romans 8:28 oh this we can't Romans 8:28 Amen you got to be like job when they brought all that bad news to toe joke we refuse to curse God he always worshiped God but this happens open please God that happened please God that happened pray you praise God yes I do the purpose is working good but you get stronger through this I say this way Scott you grow in this somebody is in the Romans 8:28 bucket [Applause] Chloe Lagarde soon as soon as it come your way just take it in take it in throat over in the bucket god don't use it God gonna use it oh my god brother Jack I lost my God gonna use that somehow tests I'm only gonna come up I was in an accident and I lost my house okay it's okay God do you have your life God gonna turn it around get ready for a double-double put that thing in the Romans 8:28 bucket is this is this a thing is this a thing we're all things [Applause] and not some things all things so throw that thing over there see we we we try to we try to fix it ourselves don't worry about that give it to God and have knowledge that God gonna turn that thing around I don't know how he do it some way amen brother brother lost his car at a meeting the man's had a meeting worship Him praise to the Lord and goes back outside after the meeting in the car's gone go he said he went the brother branham say brother I don't you know we just got the brother and say let's pray they prayed and when they prayed Amen that the man that was driving the car away felt convicted in the car and turned around and brought the car back you know he only brought it back so far cuz he want to get caught but yeah he brought the car back look I'm telling you your God will make the devil bring it back you pray and commit that thing to the Lord but he'll bring it back they meant you won't lose nothing all right that so he made this comment you know there's a difference in being planning and being set out of stuck out right and I want to just kind of bring a scripture in on that sums 9 to 13 it's a difference in being planet than just being set out of stuck out now and I like to use another statement it's a difference in being planet rather than being potty [Music] it's a difference when you plant it in a church or you just pot it at the church because when you pot it people just ports you anywhere y'all understand what I'm saying they can just pick you up and take you and put you anywhere winds will come and blow you all over the place right what about when you plant it no no it's gonna be a lot of work to get me out of this look at look at this and now your desert there not let me also tell you this much it's a blessing on you when you plant it there's a blessing psalm 92 13 there's a blessing when you're planted those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the course of our God so if you want the blessings to flow you need to get planted I want to say it again if you want the blessings to flow you need to get plenty don't be part of get planted and when I say planting I mean y'all it's gonna take a lot to get me up out of this I some y'all I don't know y'all playing I don't sing y'all go through some stuff and know this we can't move you that one came you were planted in the house of God hey man you know where you belong they eat man thank God for that thank God thank God trials ain't gonna separate you tribulation ain't gonna separate you I'm persuaded they have no life nor things present nor things to come nothing I'll separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus and my lord that's a person that's planted all right amen amen amen you came just people sweetie but you got to be fully persuaded all right let's look at this he says another little statement that he makes says yes sir he said faith it doesn't reason the Bible said that we cast down reasons you don't reason with faith faith has no reasoning faith knows where it's at faith acts faith holds on it can't move nothing can move it I don't care whatever says this that or the other it doesn't move a bit it stays right there wait wait wait don't make any difference stays right there now this worldly knowledge is based on facts and information and skills acquired by a person through experience and education that's that's that's worldly knowledge amen I want to tell you when you when you're looking at Google to try to determine whether the message is right or not you're actually leaning on worldly knowledge when you're looking at Google amen you can't look at Google to get an interpretation of Scripture hallelujah the Holy Spirit got to be the one to reveal you scripture amen cuz I was just like I never put this question into Google I like to just ask him you know Google is brother branham amen the fulfillment of malachi for his brother branham the fulfillment of Revelation 10 7 right it's brother Brett did he come and fulfill that Google promises I don't know Google might blow up all right but you came base your faith on what Google says you got to base your faith on what God has spoken in its word hallelujah somebody write because we leave to us worldly knowledge we get all confused and we think we don't stumbled on something they made it oh y'all better watch it we better watch it we've been holding onto this for years and we've done nothing crazy yet 30 years we've done done crazy hallelujah somebody it must be something to this close to God this goes beyond worldly knowledge that takes revelation to give this and only God can bring revelation sit there with your Bible and praying and fast and seek car till he reveal his word to you look at it I want to read a little quote here cuz worldly knowledge say that's not in the knowledge that God asking for and when they say add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge not worldly knowledge that's mother not not faxing information and some skills not we heard a message on that recently about fax you know you might have yeah that's a fact but God can go beyond your facts that's a fact it's a fact that I got this problem but yeah that's what the doctor said I got that but God can go beyond my facts and it can change my facts so I'm not limited to facts all right here's a little statement that I want to read in a sermon deceive Church by the world this this little statement says there is no need for any man to try to take his worldly knowledge and ever please God with him no need for you to try to take your worldly knowledge and ever please God with it look you say it's an abomination in the sight of God your worldly knowledge it's an abomination in the sight of God say you'll never please God with the worldly ambitions and knowledge because it's enmity to God says the scripture he cannot do it now it didn't say don't have ambition but if you try to use your ambition to please God then you're missing it right I mean it's it's not it's not the ambition and what you can chief in this world I'm gonna do this and this is how I'm gonna please God no that's not the way this works right amen he says now now and we will just read a quote of Scripture here just to kind of back that statement up don't try that don't try to please them with worldly knowledge amen because it's an enemy to God first corinthians 3:19 look at this for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God think about that right you can't please God with wisdom of the world because it's foolishness to God for this rhythm he taketh the wise in their own craftiness so you can't use the wisdom of the world to try to be pleasing to God it's never gonna work no matter how much you accomplished in this world yes you got to live him yes you wanna you want to be successful while you're here but don't use that the thing that you can you can get some special place in God because you got things and when I was just reading recently in and in Ecclesiastes and Solomon saying you know he learned something that you know he can be wisest I don't know what he can be the wisest man on the earth and then you can have a fool right next to him that don't know nothing he said but at the end of both of our lives it's the same result so how much you accomplished but the bum on the street and next to you at the end of your life it's the same result both of you go six feet under sorry say all that stuff is vanity vanity of vanities huh so don't put your faith in those things put your faith in Christ now he'll supply your need and allow you to you know to achieve certain things here on earth but don't think that that's the thing that's gonna please go hey man amen because I got this certification now that pleases God no no no that ain't no way work well if you want to do something this pleases God add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge to acknowledge temperance and patience and gods and so and so forth do those things then you find yourself pleasing to God there was a statement a little story that the Prophet told about these chickens that was in a cool and say one of the chickens he got up and he starts just just crawling all over the place and sitting in all the all the other chickens he was so loud they all starting just listening like when you know what you got to say it's a you know I've been studying and I found out if we do this and if we dig a hole over here and we do this we do that then you know what will you know will just be would be better will be bigger will be brighter will be this would be that and he's just going on and and he said saying all the other little chickens just sitting there listening to like man that's some good word man that's all right you know wow that's that's really good say now one little chicken that didn't look like much come running up in they say I just heard on the radio chicken is going up full sense of pound we all gonna be dead in the morning so all your add missing add net worldly things all that added up worldly things you're gonna be dead in a little bit and what is it gonna mean then hallelujah somebody you got to keep these things balanced praise the Lord that's not worldly knowledge that's not what you add but we talk about spiritual knowledge heavenly knowledge that's supreme knowledge oh my all right all right let me get skip a little bit more yes just scoot on down a little bit more here heavenly knowledge or supreme knowledge he says you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay aside all your crease and all your unbelief everything that you claimed you have done it says you then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot lie Amen God cannot lie let every man's word be allowed but mine be true see now you're getting knowledge that supreme knowledge a man when you got heavenly knowledge you believe the word and you reason a man you you you reason everything or anything by the word you reason it by the word if don't let it don't line up with the word I ain't doing it that's that's that's that's heavenly knowledge if it does not line up with God's Word then I'm not doing this now you know there's uh let me read this this is gonna come out of a statue of a perfect man paragraph 166 Oh glory hallelujah it says oh you're getting to be a pretty good man right now see you're coming up see with what with faith then with virtue than knowledge see how see how it's building this man you can see there's nowhere escaping it this is the way to become the full stature of Christ so yes sir and that's what our goal is right when we were coming to church we want to be more like Jesus I'm not trying to be like my neighbor I want to be like Christ to judge judge right judge whether it's right or wrong you got to be able to do that yourself sometimes when I feel like in you know a certain stage of life I have to be my children's Holy Ghost because some reason they couldn't judge whether this was the right situation or wrong situation that party that they invited you to amen you probably shouldn't be in that party so I might have to be your Holy Ghost because if you had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost would say no don't go to that party amen but I'ma be your Holy Ghost and I'm gonna tell you no no no I ain't feelin that when a man go get on a boat with somebody I don't know no no no you might not make it back i'ma say no to that hallelujah if you sneak behind my back and go do it that's one thing but if you askme know hey man I'm I have to say no to that I ain't got no good fights none no I'm gonna have to be your Holy Ghost until you can learn to say no to that yourself man your friends are of the devil influenced by the devil even let me take something some don't be influenced by God some gonna be influenced by the devil amen it's only two influences out there so if I see princess influenced by the devil no you can't hang out with them I'm gonna tell you another thing they can't hang out here yeah they can't hang out here hey man I ain't say nothing come that I greet them and you know oh my god hey man we have friends that that that didn't come inside the house they hung outside if they came into my house and my dad has already told me about this one yeah and I let him inside the house it's gonna be some trouble with my dad to get home any man I knew which ones could not come inside hello somebody I knew we had one never just come out and whistle all you do is whistle and when he wished so everybody run run outside the man never knocked on your door ax could you come out he had a spirit on he just come out whistle everybody go running after this guy down the street everything go running after my daddy say watch him and he said my daddy had to be the Holy Ghost watch that fella right there and then when when you think about it he was about ten years older than the rest of us why he want to hang out with us oh my this is gonna take some knowledge mamas and daddies y'all gonna have to be the holy ghosts into our house children they got introduced in the drinkin they gotta introduce of the smokin huh and you wonder where this come from it's the people you let associate with them sometime they're just gonna have to just be no they a pout and they roll neck get over it look at me I got over let me finish let me keep let me keep going to judge that's right judge whether it's right or wrong to believe God's Word judge whether it's right or wrong whether I should serve a Creed or serve God judge whether it's right or wrong see you gotta have to have knowledge to judge whether it's right or wrong I should be born again or join a church then you beget you beginning judge right when when when the preacher says today's America's pass the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now which you going to believe when you say I'll take God now you don't say that just to say well I take it just from your heart but something in you your faith pushes out there there you are your face says I know he's the same a man I've witnessed him the same there's nothing can take it away from me I know he's real a man then add that to your faith lay down on the foundation coming up now come right on up towards the kingdom got to spot now all right now he says you got to be able to judge right from wrong that's that's what knowledge will do it helps you judge right from wrong now I just feel in my spirit just to kind of make a little turn here amen and maybe we'll come back and pick up some other quotes later on oh my but when I picked up a man first Kings and and I wanted to kind of bring this in as a war strategy what we saw in the story in first Kings there in Virtanen chapter 21 verse 17 through 19 is a half this wicked King Amen probably one of the most wicked kings of Israel here he was my god he wanted the field of me boss he wanted the vineyard on a boffin and they might old no I can't give me that this is my my father's heritage and they passed it down to me and and I'll pass it down to my sons and and I can't do that I just can't give up my father's heritage like that this is something that God gave us and and we got to take pride in what God gave us say but I'll pay you say no no money can't and money can't satisfy what God has given me hallelujah amen we got to have the same type of convictions amen when it when it comes even going to church they men this is a man I got to be a part of this lorry the car amen I got you gotta have a conviction like no I don't want to just in and out miss here I want to be planted in the house of God a man that this is your heritage huh not only am I gonna be here but I'm a raised my kids here come on somebody and I want them to raise their kids in the house of God you gotta have convictions like that get planted a man a pastor you can trust get plenty who you somebody gonna take advantage of you glory to God but you want to get planted somewhere but but here you know our neighbors vineyard is a problem because he had walk sitting and Ahab was sitting around my house looking sad and his wife walks in and says what's your so sad about say well you know I I want this neighbor Box vineyard and you know he just won't sell it to me so you look King you ain't gotta ask for anything you can take it if you want it said no I can't do that you know you had some god-fearing principles in them amen but his wife had none that's why you gotta know were you married to she had no God no God of Israel fearing principles because she was not other children Israel his wife's name was Jezebel she come up with a lie amen had all these I mean took the print so something is signed the King's signature on it had some man raised up and just beginning declare lives over leap off hallelujah and when they declare these lines then then they've been they killed him they stoned the man and he died and here comes a hat Rodman after he got the word from his wife Jezebel knee ball spring yarks is available nape office did so here he come ride into Amen this place to claim this vineyard never even acts high-demand I'd never acts how he died right didn't care how he died now now I want to take something he knew his wife had that type of spirit he knew his wife could do something like that so even though he did not kill him physically a man he was still connected to the murder because he knows wife could do something like that that's why the Prophet came down the Prophet didn't even come down on Jezebel the Prophet just like God didn't move in the garden with Eve God only came down with Adam the Prophet was not moved with with Jezebel but the Prophet was moved what they have hallelujah they have a sitting there and the Prophet comes down and pronounced to say just like the dogs have licked Nate boss blood the dogs would now lick your blood now now now now remember you got to have knowledge you got to you got to be able to judge whether it's right or whether it's wrong we got to go forward now in the scripture because I'm drawing a menace war strategy from a man the scripture in in first and second chronicles 18 because this is where G hasta that comes on the scene hallelujah somebody she hasta that's a man is it's been asked by a have to come and go and reclaim remark Illya he says you know we you know this this land is ours and you know and and you know they got it they're keeping it from us and we ready to go to war and we want to go get ramoth-gilead and they say will you come go with me jehosophat eight habits asking for a man of jehosophat's participation in this battle stay with me here today hallelujah amen so hear hear arch the Asura says okay we'll go and you know that as as as they're about to go let's look at something here in the scripture I'll turn with me the second corrupt second chronicles 18 let's just look at this real quick just to make sure you're with me glory glory glory verse 3 second chronicles 18 verse 3 and it says an a half king of israel said unto joseph at king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramoth-gilead and he answered him I am as thou art and my people ask thy people and we will be with thee in the war when we got to get a war strategy now we're getting ready to go to war but we need a war strategy amen and josaphat said unto the king of Israel in quite night he's already made the agreement this is why amen before you make an agreement make sure you've already prayed about it and you got the word you got the Word of God on it before you make the agreement because if you make the agreement before you get God's thought on it you're tied to that agreement Oh hallelujah Jehoshaphat had already made the agreement and then he asked him first for and Johnson said him that the king of Israel enquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today now now I'm looking at this from two different angles he wants a prophecy but there's another thing that the Prophet tells us about Joseph at Jehoshaphat knew that a prophecy had already been given a mentor the heat that the doors was gonna lick his blood and what jehosophat wanted to know is this the battle she had knowledge that that promise was out there waiting to be fulfilled and he needs to know is this the battle that God's gonna bring that to pass because I know what the property law just said about you knowledge of that he knew that something bad was gonna happen so and cry out the Lord now I love to come to where I'm looking at this not just a prophecy but I want you to go back and look at what Elijah said is this a time jobs or is this a time for that it's just is this the season for that because I know it's coming so here Jehoshaphat verse 5 he caught I mean verse 4 he says that therefore the king of Israel gathered amen the king of Reaser gathered together prop a Prophet's four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramoth-gilead to battle shell out shall I forbear and they said go up for God will deliver it into the Kings hand now I need to just kind of stop there we need to bring this thing a little closer to home you know because we you know we'll get to the rest of the story but you know you can go to Google you can go to other churches you can go to all kind of people now tell you something this ain't right this dis message that they follow anything right now you might have one person telling you it is and 400 telling you it's wrong to judge right from wrong right do you have God's knowledge where you can judge right from wrong because a lot of folk might be telling you better get out of it that's a cult they alive this is a reveal word for the hour and I tell you I'm planet I'm planted in this I mean I thought I was potted in my denominational churches but I found something to get planted in let me let me just tell you I mean you gotta have to kind of look at these things don't just you leave it back in Bible history look at it today you might be here for 500 people telling you it's wrong one person saying it's right which one you're gonna stand with now cuz here in the scripture four hundred men come up before the prophet and let me come up before the kings and say go up go up go up go up God is with you 400 400 now let me tell you if you have 400 people telling you to do something you probably just take off doing it but look at what Jehoshaphat does after 400 prophecies 400 look at this of next verse he says such a high surf I said is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him say no no no no I just heard all 400 but here's the problem John spent all 400 400 men said the exact same thing there's got to be a problem with that if further other people pronounce and blessings over you something wrong [Music] something wrong if you go to church every time they always get a a you know every time you go somewhere to preface on something good they've never said none bad all the same that's in your life and ain't no matter said nothing bad nobody and ain't nobody said nothing they even John Smith said something wrong with this 400 of your profits I'm good so no don't just take off with any prophecy cuz every prophecy is nothing gone I'm sorry at least one more you know I improvise here but then here comes the king saying I'm Emma I gave you four hundred I gave you four hundred he said I know but is it at least one more Oh hallelujah and then he said yes one more he said yeah he'd say well where is he a success name is much higher you can take it down his name is Maya every time I go to that church he shakes out on one of the prophets I said don't let the King say say go go go get him and go get him anyway so here could they go and get Micaiah before they go to battle and macaé is told he's informed and advised therefore he goes they say somebody's saying ìlook we just went down there the stand before him all four hundred or said the same thing when you say the same thing we said and you get your meal paid you get your bills paid you get that car that you've been wanting that house that you want you you go you're gonna get it if you just go along with everybody else say let me take some online profits out there they're getting their bills paid by the church in a day charge you for the prophecy you know I get it and come from God God don't charge for this hallelujah hear hear he say you say I'm only gonna say what God telling me to say I don't care what money off said I'm gonna say what God told me to say so mkhaya comes up and Yap say tell us what the word of the Lord is we want to go to ramoth-gilead and and conquer you know it's gonna be with us uh should we forbear so Micaiah says go on up the Lord is with you well you know what the sad part about this is that AI being an unbeliever you that that was not thus saith the Lord you know why because this man has a reputation for speaking the truth and this man always comes against me so if he cut if he had come against me this time something wrong with that so I am say I assure you only tell me what that says the Lord is it say I saw Israel scattered they used a statement it says he is real scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd he say didn't I tell you Jehoshaphat didn't I tell you that he was gonna prophesy evil there it is somebody yeah they got mad and upset with Micaiah you told me to tell you what the Lord said I see Israel scatters Sheik now this was actually fulfilling what Jehoshaphat was looking for he wanted to know whether that prophecy that Eli just said was about to come to pass now Jehoshaphat knew that this was a battle but the problem is he had already agreed that's why before you agreed you got to pray over that thing he had already agreed so he couldn't go back on his word he had to go on with the battle no sir I have said I told you Joseph that he was gonna say this four hundred to one four hundred opinions to one which one you gonna stand with here here Makai is so convinced he heard a half say you know throw this guy in prison I'll deal with him when I get back he said if you come back this panel I see him stand up like sheep now now I want you to understand this that was a prophecy over Israel not Judah Jehoshaphat was king of Judah so good Josaphat had a promise that nothing was gonna happen to him in this battle even though he shouldn't have been there oh yeah yeah he had some protection that promise that was over him was his protection now now now the other thing about this that's very good because Micaiah as they were trying to deal with him you know he doesn't only say I see Israel scatter like sheep and he say I'm gonna tell you how I saw this Oh glory to God brother brother brother whisper hit it last week he told us that there sometime God had to create vessels of Wrath and he said the reason that God had to create vessels of Wrath because it needs a dirty man for a dirty job I think God I'm not a vessel of Wrath but I'm a vessel of mercy so he needed a dirty man for a dirty job then brother whisperer took us right to the scripture because in this scripture what happened is that you know God had a a council meeting in heaven GOG I got invited all the Angels say now we got a prophecy over 1/2 he's saying now how are we gonna get this thing the dogs are supposed to lick his blood because of this very capable hale into the meeting where God was a symbol but it was created for this purpose and the spirit come oh my god the spirit come up and say the spirit come up say Lord I got an idea I want to taste something unclean spirits so when you see unclean stuff happening your life it's unclean spirit that came from hell this spirit come up say I got a knife they say what job did he say you know I'll be Alliance period and I would get in the mouth of all his prophets and I would cause him to believe a lie not only believe a lie but you know what God say that's a great idea they say you know what you are you actually gonna you're gonna accomplish the task now this was something that surprised God this was a vessel of Wrath that was created for this purpose he had that type of mindset I do evil things God they say these righteous angels will never get the job done but you demon I was just talking to somebody I think wins that's I say you know sometimes you can be anointed you can get an anointing from from from the enemy they say oh don't use the word anointing that's so strong no no no no no no no no no no no no you can get an anointing from the devil yes you can you can get an anointed this grip to prove that that anointing came from hell it didn't come from God it came from the hell here God said go ahead yeah you're gonna get this thing accomplished and that spirit jumped on four hundred and men and calls all four hundred to prophesy how you know a spirit didn't come from Hell to get on the person that wrote the Google site that you're looking at i'ma tell you how you can know whether it came from hell or whether it came from God the only way you can tell is that you have to be able to examine by this if you not reading this you don't know if it's right or wrong you got to know the scripture for yourself man and we're gonna be on John 3:16 even in that people looking at it wrong they think God sent his son no God became his son [Music] but the Spirit from Hell comes out I'll do this I'm gonna and got into 400 prophets and cousin believed a lot and went went went when my tire revealed what had happened nobody else came with that type of prophecy nobody said nothin like that but but kaya actually revealed now you know mike is actually living during the days of great prophecy large and Elijah he's still living during that time God was using another man just trying to get something hallelujah glory to God buddy here here macaé son see me tell them say he say he say he'd say this is what happened so when the guys got mad he was the head prophet the head he he got mad got up and walked not and he said not just finished prophecy and I promise I'll and it says something is shoveling and go up and glory to God he heard my tire say this about an anointing that came from hell and you want to know how we know it came from hell because this head prophet walked up to Micaiah until you go to a church were they ready to fight after they just finished preaching something wrong with that church they just finished speaking in tongues they ready to cursed yeah I actually Bible said you bless and curse out of the same mouth hello somebody encourage them that ought to be a sign quick sign get out of here unclean spirits think of unclean things this plan was inspired an anoint all 400 prophets to lie this was a vessel wrath that was created now I want to just read a scripture here this is gonna be out of second critical second chronicles 18 don't pull it up yet just give me verse 31 second chronicles 1831 to try to bring this to a close this war strategy so you have to you got to go back in and look at things you know you got to know what the Word of God says right and this is where this knowledge kind of comes in the King here Jehoshaphat knew that there was a prophecy that was supposed to take place and he's just he's looking at this thing he's looking at it and said but you know you got to be able to judge right from wrong so before he the he made an agreement so he had to stay with the agreement he had to stay with it but before he did that he shouldn't he should have consulted God but he knew that there was a prophecy that was over a half that he was gonna die in the and and the dogs were gonna lick lick his blood just like they lick name box but he knew that prophets today that's why he asked for these prophet these prophets that come forth he made the commitment to go he goes out to battle the prophecy of Micaiah says Israel is scattered but it didn't say Jew to us so he has some protection even though he shouldn't even be in the battle but here Jehoshaphat goes out and they come up with a scheme and they tell cuz you know I can imagine maybe Joseph I said Oh Lord I shouldn't never greet to this Oh God Oh ain't have you done tricked me again and and I don't gave my word and they putting the pressure on and you don't gave your word man you know you got didn't you kept okay Kings word is its bond they putting the pressure on him he said oh I shouldn't do it so eight have come up with a scheme what we gonna do when we go to battle you gonna dress up in your kingly role and I'm gonna just act like a warrior and we're gonna go to bali say okay let's let's do that problem was the other army they strategy was that we only gonna attack the king let everybody else along guess who's dressed up like a king jehoshaphat so everybody turns their weapons on the hospital s read 2nd chronicles 18 and verse 31 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of Israel therefore they can pass about him to fight but the Haas effect cried out and the Lord helped him and God move them to depart from him oh I love that here he was dressed like a king and their strategy is go only after the king but they think he's the king of Israel but now the prophecy is to Israel not to Judah even though he dressed like a king the only thing he can do is cry out and God heard him remember Abijah cried out and God heard him and I love this because here in this scripture Jehoshaphat is surrounded and it's something about when you're surrounded all you gotta learn to do is cry out when you surround about this problem and surrounded by fat bum learn just cry out and your God comes on the scene and I can imagine Jehoshaphat but I'm surrounded by you I'm sorry that's happening you have but I knew this prophecy was coming to pass at some point in time I'm just glad to get out of here with my life because I shouldn't have been tied to you in the first place my Kyah told us you were gonna pass we asked for the word look they have if you would have asked for the Word of God first you might not have even been in this situation he had knowledge that what God has spoke was gonna come to pass she shouldn't have been there but I know I thank God that even when we in places that we not supposed to be he's right there he's right that it delivers he's right there to set us free and that don't mean go out here and get in some situation I want to see how God gonna work this side hey HAP didn't come back it won't work that for you half the prophecy was against Israel but Judah was spared oh my war strategies knowledge knowledge let me just read a closing quote oh this Colton quote is actually going into another a hab later on in his life after a I'm sorry Jehoshaphat later in his life acts were the same thing just getting ready to go to battle and this time I was a half son that one to him I think his name was John Joe Ram want him to come about he's like can we inquire of the Lord because what happened they got these three kings together had the king of Edom I believe king of Israel and king of oh yeah oh my I gotta see this they had these three kings the king of Judah King of Israel and king of Edom and they were getting ready to go in the battle and they wanted to know which way to go but as they were going into battle they start looking out for some of the animals and realized there was no water anywhere around for these animals like look we got a we're in trouble here we can't get what if ourselves we can't get water for the animals so we're gonna be in trouble so they're Josaphat again righteous man is their prophet anywhere around that we can consult they say yeah Elijah's around and when Elisha they went the Elijah's house deal I should say I wouldn't even come out to see y'all if Jehoshaphat wasn't here they say that before I prophesy I need music I need anointed music now now so so for this particular service everybody had to play and you had to play anoint it right it just can be everybody just doing whatever and need to be anointed otherwise otherwise that create frustration amen so I can me I create a communication system to keep us all anointed and we gotta use it to keep everybody anointed right otherwise if it becomes not anointed it becomes confusion so we got to use what we got hello somebody praise the Lord but he said he said I came even prophesy until I have anointed ministers minstrels so here he called the minstrels now notice minstrels not minstrel they saying about one person this everybody hello everybody got to be involved so but we all got to be on the same note doing everything together so here here here he said he said you say it's a get middle northern minstrels and then our prophesied then I can preach then he comes up and they say he say okay after Dayton lay down a good song and everything then he and you know oh my an anointing come down from the music and he gets into the spirit and just begin to prophesy and he told them that they was going to overcome in the battle he said but you know Oh Lord Jesus I want to read this quote I want to read this quote get me the hand of the Lord came upon him before I read that quote just a little statement that the Lord gave me that I want to share with you when a tab was in battle and he disguised himself the Lord told me to tell you your costume King stop the prophecy your custom can't stop it your personality changing when you get amongst other people can't stop the prophecy yo your new behavior it can't stop the prophecy God called you to be something you're gonna be just that I don't care how much of a chameleon you become you can't stop God's prophecy this is out of the message to handle Lord came upon him notice then when their supply was cut off they began to find out if there wasn't something could be done because Jehoshaphat said isn't there a prophet of the Lord surely all this bunch of church people around here there should be a prophet somewhere that we can find out what the will of Lord is concerned indistinct says now it says now they knew the law this is important they knew the law they knew the commandments they had all the written word but they had to have something very very for this specific case and brother Branham talked about here the product here that these two kings these three kings are gathered together getting ready to go into battle and they've run into some trouble right and so now they had the law they had the commandments they had the written word but they had to have something for this specific case hallelujah says I hope you're getting this something now for this case now we got all these churches got all these denominations they got the same Bibles that we got but we got all kind of problems and we need something specific for this case if we want to understand the Word of God we're gonna need something specific for this case and I want to tell you what the specific thing that God gave me for this case he's saying you a prophet the whole I seen you Elijah the Prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord and he turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers God gave you something specific for this case that's the way in the meat and sometimes say well why don't you just pray for the people sometimes you notice it means it has to be something the whole picture is divine healing salvation but sometimes there's something in a fellow and a fellows way that keeps him from getting healed you hear it right here on the platform something they done somewhere else and something they've got to make right they have to do that before the blessing of God can come on them certainly not you can't do that you'll never so before you get all the blessings got you got some things you need to take care of that's what he's telling us Church I tell you with this war strategies go back and find out what the Word of God say and stay with that hold on to it you got the judge whether it's right or wrong and the way you judge whether it's right or wrong you judge it by the word god bless you god bless you [Applause] amen let's have a word of Prayer father we just thank you for your word thank you for your truth as we go got down this journey of war strategies we are facing the enemy daily and how we need to know Lord which direction to go which way to return father we just pray that you would just continue to direct us that you would lead us that you a goddess that you would help us and you would anoint us Lord for the job that must be done let us be united as one one mind one accord one spirit father let us be that way that we might not give place to the enemy Lord we just trusts as we just look at these various characters in in Scripture God that we would just be able to draw from their experiences and be able to apply the things that they went through Lord to the things that we're going through and we know father the same way that you provided and you made a way for Lord Jehoshaphat you'll make a way for us he looked back at the word he knew that something was supposed to be happened and he knew it no God but he was already committed but help us look not to get committed until we Lord of line things up according to your words God
