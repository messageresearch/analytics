this morning we appreciate um the musicians this morning amen without them we just have to clap our hands and stomp our feet real loud you know and hopefully we we all could stay on on the same beat you know cuz sometimes some of us to be doing different things so they help help us balance balance it out we appreciate brother brother Troy I was I was telling them in the back I say man you got a lot of hats you just you know you change hats depending on what the need is so this morning he was needed to uh sing songs cuz brother Solomon is not here just remember for him in prayer thank God for his his family being with us this morning amen we always a blessing to have them and the musicians that they bring with them so uh we appreciate them pray that God will bless them let us look at a couple of places in the scripture now y'all pray for me I feel nervous this morning sometimes I feel like that so uh I've been kind of moving around a lot back there we just trusted God Leviticus chapter we're going to read a couple of places in the scripture we'll read um what Leviticus and I have you to be seated and then we'll read a couple of more places and then we'll get started uh Leviticus chapter 25 we want to start at the eth verse it says and thou uh shall number seven sabbaths of years unto thee I see some of us still turning you got to say amen amen okay and thou shalt number seven Sabbath of years into the seven time seven years and the space of seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee of 49 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall Hollow follow the uh 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land until the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall uh return every man unto his possessions and he shall return every man into his family amen uh you can be seated and we want you to turn to Isaiah 61 I don't really like to have people standing too long some brothers will have you standing 30 minutes while they read the scripture I just think that's a little bit much we want to look at a scripture in the book of Isaiah chapter 61 amen we want to read the first two verses it said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach the Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and to open up the the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn and one more place uh in the Book of Luke chap 4 verse uh 18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recover and the sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word this morning um I like to use as a little topic this morning um The Year of Jubilee or Jubilee year and uh just as as a uh context to the text is uh seeing God's Provisions in our present circumstance now y'all just kind of bear with me I I I approach the gospel probably a little bit bit different than uh the other brothers is just we all made up up different and and uh so uh one of the things brother Burley always used to say uh uh when he preached uh he can't be anybody else but he know how to be himself I struggle with just trying to find out who I am so don't you try to imitate me because you'll be a quirky type of a person but I I I appre I just appreciate you know I'm I'm I'm not very schooled I don't have a lot of uh uh I guess book education as we would say now I'm not ignorant I have to say that as a disclaimer because when you start saying that then people think that you know you don't really know what you're talking about and but it's not much you can push past me uh I may not have all of the kind of education that a lot of us might have this morning but uh just in the way that uh we I've I've learned over the years to study you know we all have our different approaches but I when God gives us something I just I'm the type of person I just like to sit and let God uh inspire me let God uh open up the scriptures to us because you know there is a veil over the scriptures where where the prophecy that uh men have eyes and can't see and ears and can't hear that's just scriptural that's that's prophecy so it's it's it's a blessing this morning to be able to see right now remember our context is seeing God's Provisions right that's a real blessing because everybody can't see and the word see translated is to understand everybody can't understand God a lot of times we we we find that uh I think I see but uh M hey what up buddy uh we we find people Miss God just in the way that God uh does things and the way that God reveals himself we we know in studying and having a prophet he lets us know that God does hides himself in in Simplicity and reveals himself the same way God does things in such a you know we prone we we're built uh in a way we you know we look for God to you know uh do things in a in a big way but God comes down and does things in such a simple way you know like the birth of of of of the king come right down Amen in the wound of a woman went to a stable and who would say that's a king we know Kings now nowadays with all the the the the pump and all of these different things that's associated with their births our King came down according to scripture and went to a manger and because of that he was rejected but that was that was God is that right but but watch this great men of that day smart men couldn't comprehend that is that right they they totally missed the Simplicity of God so amen and and you know God can do something and and it'll go right past us and we won't even know it scriptures can be fulfilled and we know that already this morning that scriptures can be fulfilled and and you know like when Jesus was on the scene and he was speaking to his disciples about John John had already come on the scene amen and fulfilled his part of the word but yet still people were still looking and then it was quickened to them you thank God for the quickening power this morning say that again you ought to thank God for the quickening power this morning because if God doesn't Quicken the revelation of the word of God to you then you'll miss totally what God is doing and sometimes you know you you listen to people and mainly critics is what I'm dealing with right uh and and how they try to uh uh disqualify the Bible and and just different things it's it's just to me I listen you know I Len and it's like it's just that people just lack uh Insight they they they miss they miss the unfolding we going somewhere this morning they miss the the the the nature and the character of of God Amen as he moves through the scripture as he unfolds himself through the scripture we we've had a sear in this hour right that's right boy that's only brother Troy let me say that again we've had a sear in this hour that was a little bit better we've had a sear in this hour all right that's a little bit better this morning y'all said y'all woke up this morning and you didn't have no doubt yeah that's a lot of doub in there that's a lot of trembling and shaking I'm not going to throw you off because to do that I'll be the wrong type of trumpeter we going somewhere this morning right the Trump the sounding of the trumpet has got to give a certain kind of sound and and and you you all have got to be taught to the sound right come on to understand what what this this sounding is all about but I'm getting ahead of myself but but you know uh we we have to always go back to and this just the way that I look at the scripture and and trying to follow God to make sure that that nothing is offbeat I I always go back to the beginning right and and this is just how the the the spirit of God works with me in studying because I'm I'm I'm I'm not I never been to a Bible school or anything things so I always have to look back to the beginning and and and research and and watch the nature and the character of God Amen as it moves through the scripture and and that gives me a peace when I'm looking at scripture when I can see the characteristics the nature the makeup the mind of God God in scripture then then then I I you know I get a little settled in the spirit right see for me it might be something different but I'm going just help us this morning all right one of the things we know and looking back in the beginning uh from the beginning it's always been the nature of God for for Humanity to be free yes God made man and man made slaves come on and I mean sometimes you know I'mma bust a bubble or two here this morning I know we like to we like to say the white man did this and the white man brought us from Africa and all of that well you know what before the white man ever bought us here the black men had slaves get that off my chest right God made man and man make slaves it's never been the intent of God I hope that don't hurt y'all little feelings it's never been the intent of God for us to be slaves it's it's always been the intent of God for us to be uh dominant not dominated huh our our true position in restoration is to have dominion come on come on we talking about the will of God y'all going to make me shout I'm starting to feel something the the nervousness starting to move now I done walk back and forth I done ate peanuts I done did all kind of stuff Garen like you're all right man you know I'm St but I'm starting to feel good because the pre is starting to move in all right but the intent of God right is for us to uh have dominion not to be dominated we look back in scripture see one thing about this the Bible say he say I'm God and I don't change right God God's uh objectives has to always line up with the original thoughts and plans from the beginning this is what the prophet taught us true watch if you study the message he always talks about going back to the original God's provided way and over the years you know you say those things and the people cringe it's like you you just don't understand the sounding of the trumpet is that right and and What Makes You free yes see glory to God so so in in looking at this thought you know I see God I try to see God you know like brother B talked about you see God in nature you know God is in music maybe not some of this stuff that we see we see now you don't see God in it you know when you watching Kirk Franklin up there hair dressed and you know gyrating around uh you be like I no don't care how you dress that up boy that ain't God cuz cuz God is not going to do anything that's unseemly everything in God is going to be done in decency in order see when you come to me amen with anything I want to see amen the order of the thing see the characteristics the makeup of the thing and how it lines up with the original plan and program of God no matter what it is is that right if if you start moving away amen from the original plan and program you getting yourself in trouble it ain't God it's something else right glory to glory to his name but here here's the thing Amen in the the the sovereignty of God you know what I'm glad that that and we talk about God being infinite right and I'm glad he is I'm I'm glad he's not getting a a a a new plan or a better plan or having a better way and and things catching him off God no matter what has happened to me or you Amen in our life it never caught God off God is that right amen God has never been thrown off no matter what our situation no matter what our circumstances might have been it never caught God of God God is that right if it if it catches God off God I don't know what kind of God that we say we serve him is that right God has always been well aware amen of of situations and circumstances if not he never could have put his plan and program into to motion right be because his first Bible was written in the Zodiac right and in writing in the Zodiac he had to have some sort of understanding that that Eve would fall and circumstances would present itself right glory to God Amen this this is just you know God and letter form right but uh we we could look back to the Zodiac we could look to the pyramids y'all might quiet on me this morning well I'm going preach Amen to y'all quietness but is that the truth we've been taught that there's three Bibles right glory to God and so uh uh nothing nothing could be altered nothing could be changed is that right it didn't catch God off of God that that you know Eve Eve would be deceived and and Adam would you know Adam would do what he did now I got into trouble the last time I'm leave this alone cuz you know maybe y'all just ain't where I am when I start preaching cuz sometimes I feel like things might offend us but I but I but uh I I'm so sorry that that that under grace and truth under grace and truth you got to follow the word come on I'mma I'mma medal just a second right right CA cuz you could take you could take a quote out of context huh and and see when brother brownon made this statement about about uh uh uh Adam back in Genesis walking out with his wife and things of that nature because of love that was for that day for that at time yes sir see under under under the baptism baptism of the Holy Ghost and truth of the word of God love will not require you to do that come on Church don't get scared now brother Jack is straight me when he come back right that would that a't in my notes but I thought I'd say that cuz you know the last time I was like oh I don't know if they followed me on that not to be offensive I don't say things to be offensive but but we have to present truth that was trueth for for Adam's day right but but under great in truth the second Adam right that's not required glory to God that's not required with agap of love I wouldn't require that of my wife if if I would require her to go to hell with me something's wrong with the kind of love that I say I got come on church Preach with me I'm not going come on this see I'mma get I'mma say it before I get to it this this is what the good news and freedom is all about the sounding of the Gospel trumpet up under the seventh seal is all about right it's it's it's a about truth right because look uh uh the son of man Ministry came to bring us Liberty he let the sun set free and he's the word right right not not a portion upon the the opening of the seventh seal it's not a portion right because when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away with so we don't have a part understanding come on we we we got a full seven course meal right glory to God we have a full seventh course meal we got a complete understanding that's the only way amen we'll get uh total Liberty total freedom is up under the seventh seal yes sir y'all going to make me preach for my time this morning and so it it will not require that cuz the debt was paid so so we we're we're walking Amen in the word because we've been taught that one word off produces death and man shall not live by bread alone but by y'all going to preach with me in yeah I know it right but but uh to just kind of get back to where I'm going y'all still with me y'all ain't left the building you know your body still here but but but but watch but watch but watch this the sovereignty of God see I need to understand these things right for myself personally I'm preaching to me if nobody else it's important for me to understand uh uh how God moves and how God works in my present circumstance and the only way that I could do that I got to go back to the word of God in order to be able to see God how he moves down through the history of the Bible right and how he's worked through the the Old Testament how he's worked through the New Testament is that right that's important for me glory to God Amen the sovereignty of God before the fog and then knowing that there would be a fall God knowing that there will be circumstances right circumstances surrounding Humanity's life realizing we're in a battle and talking they've been talking about that for three services we we've been in a battle this is not a picnic this is a war this is this is you know we we're we're Humanity even the great Apostle Paul says you know what when I would do good evil was present Paul said man things that I would do good man I don't even do those things the things I know that's right right why because we in in this however many elements you want to argue about it is right we in this we bypassed our theophanies to come to be tested and tried put through the test is that right encounter circumstances encounter issues encounter arguments encounter frustrations to encounter drugs and to encounter amen prostit institution and all right y going to make me run up in this place this morning all right right glory to God God knew what Humanity would face right amen and so with with the knowledge of what Humanity would face right and in writing the word the laws came from God can I get a witness you know uh people that criticize they try to make this a man's writing right but it it it it can't be a man's writing cuz we can't hardly put two thoughts together with without tripping ourselves up and to see to see how uh perfect in in the the time AP and the Shadows of the scriptures actually are right amen I'm glad I ain't go to Bible school did I come in contact with with sound Doctrine right I come in contact with a prophet cuz now I bounced around in church too you know I had one grandmother was Baptist and one Grandmama was Holiness right right amen glory to God that's most people grew up that way right amen and so it in all of that I still didn't get what I needed but now through the teachings of the Prophet I can understand the the sounding of the trumpets Amen in the different ages is that right and and why and why uh uh Luther sounded the trumpet right amen uh in his day with the message of justification and the just shall live by faith right uh calling the the Believers to a jubilee a coming out or a a word I was looking at I I shouted at my house a reset right they needed a reset and when Luther and and Luther was considered a Fanatic in his day right when he wrote those thesis and and and placed them on the y'all know what I'm talking about right sir y'all familiar with that you know he was considered a fanatic right but but he was a trained Trumpeter by almighty God to sound a trumpet in that day to liberate the people from Catholicism right because what Catholicism had was a lot of man-made Creeds and Doctrine right things that were so contrary to scripture kind of like what it was amen when Jesus came on the scene sounding the trumpet according to the scripture right opening the the eyes of the Blind and all of the things that amen he was required to do according to scripture right in in his day what was that that was Liberty that was true Freedom that was you know because the people sometimes people don't even really know that when they bound people really don't know what bondage really is sometimes right you might think it's having your hands tired and this and that and the other that's a form but but there's a greater level of bondage that you find Humanity on and they walking every day up and down going to work and everything else but yet it's still they're Bound in so many ways and we going there right yeah glory to God but but in the sovereignty so so God God you know God understand that Humanity we sometime we think we the only ones that can't hardly pay our bills money short you working hard and come on preach with me somebody well I know y'all got a whole lot of money in here but y'all just stay with me work with me I know y'all got plenty of money in the bank and all that but I don't glory to God well I'm preaching it myself brother Smiley God knew right oh glory to God cuz y'all y'all sit there looking like y'all got plenty of money now when when when when this you know service over I'm stand at the door y'all just slip me little something I won't say nothing you know I W Ain nothing praise the Lord thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you but but God knew that that the people in the Old Testament I'm I'm move moving us along right God knew that the people would move into heart times Believers having hard times that that seem like it's hard to F right so you know CU sometime we might turn turn our heads up and then no God you know God knows who's going to do what and who's going to have what and this that and the other and no matter how much we try to preach Prosperity everybody ain't going to have no millions of dollars you know if he feel led to drop me off I'm going to be all right praise the Lord but but God but God God understands that you know uh uh uh through struggle Humanity will take advantage of humanity right glory to God come on Amen but see in the watch in the writings of the levitical law God had to write with the original thoughts in mind glory to God watch this God it's never been been amen uh God's motive or objective for us to be being bondage to be to be slaves God has always wanted us to be free God has always wanted for us to to to be a family right and I'm preaching now I'm I'm about to cut up but I'm preaching watch what brother Jack and them been preaching see you said well you just out there no I'm not while y'all shouting I'm listening right I'm I'm getting contacts right plus I can't jump up quick like y'all you know these joints don't let me after a hard week all right but but I'm trying to bring in to perspective uh uh the holy spirit in the inspiration in the church right glory to God see in the writing of the levitical law uh God pended or had it pinned in a way that that that it lines up with his original uh uh thought for the church for the family God has never wanted for the family to be separated dysfunctional come on Ah that's never been God huh amen that's never never you can't show me no scripture nowhere right but God wrote in such a way right knowing by having knowledge being infinite that hey let's face it things will happen right but but but when he writes he's always looking back to the original right in the Old Testament right with the with the levitical uh preet he had them to write a about this Year of Jubilee right at this this this 50th year right it shall be uh uh uh reset time where where you know cuz Hard Times come and and we see it all through the scriptures where you know father it I don't think I could do it but you know had to sell their daughters right come on Church well I would say something but I know it hurt some folk feeling I'll just say it like this this is why it's so important as as men we we watch how we train our our our children up and train them up they gonna do what they want to do I know when they get of age where they can make their own choices but while they're plyable is so important uh to train them up in a certain way right dress them a certain way is that right you you make it your business to show them the right way even the even though you know they they have Choice before them right choice is a big thing choice is something that can never be taken from us but you you give them the right way from the beginning beginning right amen so that so that uh your sons and your daughters understand because you know you you look at Society now you just like now now I'm a little older than them most of everybody in here set for a few folk right and and and just when we were coming up we just believe in dressing up even when the were going to hang out on the corner and do wrong they went out on the corner like this with a pair of gators on I I mean as a youngster growing up in New Jersey you know I I used to just you know kind of admire I guess that's why I am the way that I am but it's like you you know I used to see Tyrone and Tony and them come down the street and they had a little Swagger going you know and but they dressed to the tea to go hang on the corner we went to school we man when we went to school we we had polos sometimes we you know they I remember when I was in the ninth grade cuz I was coming from New Jersey so my first two years I never even wore jeans or nothing like that at school I went to I had shoes on slacks a shirt maybe tie uh polo shirt or something like that that's that's how I went to to a junior year and then I knew I was going off then once I put on jeans and Converses oh Lord everything went down here from there but but when we went to school um um man you had you had to look you best but they talked about you buddy you know even if you wor jeans and Converses your Converses had to be clean and all that you know what I mean yeah you somebody know what I'm talking about you know somebody just somebody as old as me I'm an old young man but but you know that's how so so when when I see the way this off my notes but when I see the way that that that people carry themselves it's the women and the men it's it's like it's mindboggling it it just shows us the the flashing red light signs of his coming because because you know because they make it don't mean you got to wear it you know folk coming out in lears and that's a little thick past stockings come on it's I mean ain't nobody leaving nothing to no imagination you know a man ain't got to imagine he seeing it all cuz you showing it all see uh and now you could you could see where the the prophet preached invasion of the USA and he start talking about television and the influence of Television right glory to God now don't tell me about my TV I ain't tell you nothing I'm just talking about the invasion how Satan has invaded our lives through through and and hey I like style don't don't misunder understand me but I realize I can't wear everything that they wear out there cuz some of the stuff I see these fellas wearing I be like bro come on man you 69ine I'm talking about athletes ball players and they think that's sty I'm like boy that's got so much femininity associated with it it's like come on bro nothing in your spirit is telling you don't wear that see my spirit tell me certain things you can't wear that huh it might look okay on somebody else but my spirit said don't you put that on see amen and see I come up in a day boy I don't went off I come up in a day where the fellas look at you kind of funny like bro what's up what Smiley I was kind of popular too smiley what you know you know Smiley what's this bro no bro you know and and you know I dated a little bit and man you I'm not taking you nowhere like that what you call with that huh but you know I wasn't I wasn't uh 250 something pounds now back in them days you know I was too now I was even 200 lb and it's like there's no sense of me getting beat up because I allow you to come out with all your good showing and it's attracting attention and and I can't say nothing without getting knuckled up come on talk to me somebody amen see glory to God so so I mean even as as brothers you know I I I know sisters like fashion but you can't wear everything I mean some things you can you you know you can wear and some of that stuff you just can't wear you know and if if if it's pushing the borderline you know as a a husband or whatever dad you got no baby go honey you know I love you but I just can't let you go out like that huh now men used to do that let me get on topic Lord have mercy y'all done pull me way out there i a I didn't I did not come to medal with nobody's Affairs I had a good nice hallelujah praise the Lord thought well I guess because I see things you know in the Run of a day and all of that and it's like you know I can see now why uh the prophet of God uh made those statements in a time where women still wore dresses right for the most part in the 60s women hadn't fully gravitated or the 50s and the 40s to pants yet come on now go go search your history look at your history books look at all the pictures from back then women had not gravitated towards pants yet now I'm going to say this like I want to uh I'm just sounding a trumpet you can do whatever whatever you want to do you could you could accept it or reject it I'm still preaching I ain't got nowhere yet but it's the truth we you you got to be able to to follow the spirits and the anointing that that that be on things be but Lord help me to get away from this Lord right be because look at the just the the the anointing that follows those things is what people and we wonder why the world is is is is all uh upside down and right is wrong and wrong is right right and because the ministry is more concerned about uh uh uh um you know membership and popularity instead of sounding a trumpet that will prepare people for a Rapture huh amen and I know we got to have a balance on things but but true Liberty and true Freedom comes from amen the sounding of the trumpet let let me hit this and then I'm I'mma Dash into what I want and then I'm get on out of here right watch watch the mind of God right and and Leviticus knowing that man folk will be in slavery folk will be in bondage but watch the provision right watch the provision of God God set that up right right God set that up to stay with a standard it's like yes they they'll go in there but in the 50th year amen I'm I'mma send the high priest through right and watch this to sound the trumpet right types and shadows to sound the trumpet and here's the next thing it's important for you to be trained to the sound of the trumpet right what does this sounding mean for me preach huh this sounding of the trumpet in the 50th year what does it mean what what does it signify right it signifies amen that I can go back that it's it's time for a reset right I want when this when when when the trumpet sound in the 50th year it says I once was a slave but boop boop come on I I don't I no longer have to obey you God s that up God is always a provider is that right the nature in the mind of God doesn't change she say God I can't change I I always want for my people to be free I always want for my people amen watch the sounding of the trumpet the last couple of weeks oh that's just brother Troy oh that's just brother Jack no no that's the high priest after the order of mzd right sounding sounding a trumpet under the seven seal telling his church to get rid of the isms and the schisms right under the voice of the seventh angel amen that sounding was getting rid of the isms and the schisms the things that was so contrary to the word just like when Jesus came on the scene Jesus say man y'all with all of this stuff y'all make the word of God of non effect right the word of God cannot affect you properly with all of this stuff right Jesus understood he had the year of of acceptance Ministry a Ministry that would call a people out right CZ they just they had a lot of religion in the days of Jesus right that's that's why they blast them they couldn't see God hidden in revealing Simplicity they couldn't see the unfolding of scripture boy I got some man I don't know which way to get I got quotes I thought I was gonna read but I'm feeling good now I feel my rhythm right I feel my rhythm right but but may maybe maybe maybe we'll we'll do this I got about 30 minutes y'all got 30 minutes y'all can hold with me for for 30 minutes right you see I'm just trying to show us God's God's Provisions God God provides for us in such a way that we don't understand sometime right we don't understand God's provided way is Liberty is freedom is that right glory to God we we want to go our own way we want to do it our own thing that's that just shows you you fulfilling prophecy right because the the Bible talks about uh the women in this day they want to take on the name but but I'm going do my own thing come on no I'm not being critical cu the woman type the church that's the same thing with the church right we we want to we want to try to hold on to whatever we trying to hold on to as far as what we feel is Christianity but yet still we want to do our own thing go where we want to go it it don't work like that everything has been governed by God everything has got to meet a certain standard sir right if God is going to be Iden identified with it see God is not going to be identified you know we think that God is just going to wink at at at our ignorance it's not happening not not now because the word has been uh uh revealed unfolded right glory to God so so no longer is God just winking at ignorance right see if if we say we believe God said his voice to the Earth right to call a people out then then then you know we can't reject the voice and and and have Liberty now I'm going somewhere on that note right y'all bear with me y'all all right um oh Lord y'all give me a second te NY I think my okay I could read use this quote okay y'all Y my my my power went out but watch this in the choosing of a bride uh 1965 he said says remember when the Jubilee year comes the UB the purpose of this coming is so that the people can go free y'all with me that's all I'm preaching right I want to you know meding that he said Remember When the Jubilee comes the priest rides with his trumpet sounding right amen and see the of the trumpet is the good news that's good news right what cuz if you was a slave and you hear this sounding of the trumpet that ain't bad news right not not for the elect that's good news but I'm done with this right I'm done with this it's a time for a reset it's a time to now go back and and and read the entire uh levitical 20 25 from uh verse 8 all the way to verse 55 I just wrote a couple of vers read a couple of verses it it signifies okay you can go back now you can go back to your inheritance you could go back to what's yours God always wants for us to get our stuff back come on Amen you might you might have lost some stuff Amen on the journey but now at this sounding you can get it back amen right glory to God but you got to be able to recognize that sound and the importance of it we still working with it right his trumpet sounded that every slave could go free right watch this next statement though right but if they refuse to accept their freedom freedom this present tense now right because we hear the gospel we go to church why are you coming it's not F every 50 years under the Old Testament is every week we we see every week we're hearing the gospel trumpet sound right and see every week you can go free right of something but I was pondering this all week long I said you know what could you could you and we all can imagine being slaves cuz we were once were right come on but could you imagine the the the trauma right and all the things that a slave even though the the trumpet sounding that they physically right can go free right there's a lot of bondage up here right see all of us free right now this morning we we free to praise him we free to come to church but amen all of us ain't free up here all of us ain't really totally free in here there there's still things that's got us in in abundance I'm a living witness huh there's there's things and this is why we have got to preach a holistic gospel so that amen the liberated redeemed attribute of God can go totally free right sometimes we can't highly Fellowship because of something up here come on sometimes it's hard fac us to even have uh the proper relations with our spouses because of trauma and things that's up here come on Church come on church this thing goes deeper than chch get the Holy Ghost and just jumping and shouting cuz people shout and jump and and just as bound just as bound that that shouting and jumping only good for a church service we we we we we liberated you know long as somebody pumping and pulling and you know but then we leave here we just as as bound right we bound especially if you could get offended at the word you definitely bound right but see the sounding of the Gospel trumpet let me let me read this and I'mma comment and I'm gonna get out of here in a few few minutes I ain't GNA hold you I Ain gonna wear yall out but I like this it it it gives me perspective and and it and it gives us perspective if you're here this morning why are you here here cuz Jack is a good guy I know that but Jack being a good guy Won't Set You Free his personality his character alone Won't Set You Free what sets you free is when he takes that trumpet and gets to sounding it it that's the thing that sets you free right cuz we got a lot of hangups in church huh we cheese and we smile and all of that and you know and we got issues right and I'm not saying that to be negative I'm just saying that to be realistic right but we thank God that that we have the son of man ministry right we thank God that that Christ takes amen the trumpet and sounds it right and see you could even re uh you could even accept the liberty of the word right or you could reject it it's up to you right amen he says but if they refus to accept their freedom right how many people refus to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post right amen and a ABB boarded through he through uh the ear and then he served his master always right it was put in his ear as a type of of Faith coming by hearing right he heard the trumpet but he didn't want to listen to it see see how detrimental that is right I'm I'mma stop here for a second I'm I'mma stop here I'mma medal with the young folk for for a little little bit when when your parents are sounding the gospel trumpet not nothing in the flesh now parents we can't get in the flesh we got to stay on the word maybe they don't like it but but but we we it's important for us to give them the word see and and as young people and that's all of us I'm going to include all of us I ain't going to be I ain't going to do them like that see they they always picking on you people you know I heard that for so long it's like you just like understanding of God's provision and what God is doing see Clarity is important I'm not picking on you I'm trying to pick pick off you we we we want we we want for a a a another generation to be liberated you you want for another gener cuz see watch this we rub elbows with the world right and young people come in we all we all come in contact with the world and the things of the world and the influences of the world and we think she's popular check her out about 40 years from now see what she look like huh

been pulled so tight it won't move your eyes can't blank nothing W Lord have mercy man these guys out here these actors and all that I look at Sylvester Salone he I don't know probably up in his 80s man this man no nothing move he done have trying to hold it together you get Jesus Jesus will hold you together I don't need none of that don't need none of that then you know they say we don't crack no way but that's another story let me let me let me try to get out of here let me try to get out of here but what watch this re refusal right see in in one place he says to to refuse the sounding of the trumpet is to take the mark of the beast boy I got some information up here now I ain't going to get to it this is deep the natur the natural type in the spir spiritual takes on feet right it just gets so much broader in the spiritual right glory to his wonderful name but you know one of the things I'm I'm I'mma dash out of here I know my time is just about up uh I I wanted to just dwell on so much is is being able to discern right and wrong standing God's provision right amen why God did this understand what's actually going on well this ain't hate speech this is not uh uh uh I don't listen church I Don't Preach to just try to hurt people feeling I'm not made up like that right but I will say this when I get anointed I don't see nobody I don't see none of y'all y'all ain't my friend till I get get somebody this mic my kids my wife so if you you might hear me say I try to dial it down cuz I know y'all get a little nervous if I say something like that but I'm not nervous because they got to come God's provided way just like right glory to God now amen every all of y'all and all of y'all children and all of y'all husbands and all of y'all wives right you cannot make it by passing the word and I'm not trying to be destructive right or belittle it's none of that but amen you know if because if a trumpet don't give the right kind of sound how could you prepare what are your hearing see what like if if you're listening to the sounding of the trumpets the trumpeters now you never make own Rapture that's hate speech for some people but it's the truth right because they only had part interpretation of the word right they had the at Ephesus God gave them the complete word right his complete thoughts right but then in the next age they started to drift go back to the church age book I know what I'm talking about they started to drift away from amen and brother J done Tau on this away from the original word right glory to God Amen they got tasa then they they brought in false baptisms they brought this they brought that they brought this then they brought that right then in the next age and in the next age and then it's like man what in the world do we got what do what do we have here this thing is so far away from the original thought and intent of God then God started uh restoration back to the word with Luther come on church but Luther was just a reformer he goes off the scene before the complete understanding of the word could be revealed he had a portion then then m Luther right I mean Wesley right did Pentecost great Revival huh great Revival Pentecost had a great Revival but it was only the restoration of the gifts right it wasn't the complete interpretation the complete interpretation didn't come to the sounding of the voice of the seventh angel right according to Revelation 10 right when he shall begin to sign the mystery of God shall be finished now it's no more part word right the the the trumpeter has to sound out complete word or you won't go free so if y'all want me to sugarcoat it and baby it I'm quitting cuz I can't do it it ain't in my makeup it ain't in my makeup up church I could go to heaven sitting in the back back seat right amen but but amen I won't compromise the Integrity of the word of God for a group of people that that that'll turn down God cuz when you turn down the revelation of the word you turning down God you turning down your actual freedom is that right so I can't do it I ain't built like that I ain't built like that people like you know I I had all kind of labels over the years boy brother Smiley boy he it's you just like understanding that's all that is if you knew and un really knew and understood me you wouldn't say that right come on Church you'll see that you know what this man is is trying to give me something that produces more more freedom more freedom in my life more freedom as a adult more freedom as a young person is that right more more freedom as a family glory to God the the more the more brother Jack digs and get inspired right and elevates that's to my benefit that sounding is to my benefit I don't know about y'all right sometimes it might it might hurt hurt me in the flesh but it serves as a benefit to me right glory to God as a son yeah it's chastisement you know ain't good for a moment but but after it's over with you say praise the Lord that that he stood there and said that right I got just what I [Music] wanted I'm going to go got just what I wanted got just what I wanted from the Lord it came from the seven seal make up a song Let The Musicians come see if I preach any other interpretation of the word of God y'all gonna be bound it will not produce a faith cuz listen there's got to be a faith Fai that's being produced in us as Sons and Daughters of God to be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye right and and here's here's the thing we just trying to get you get you ready right for that change to try to keep you from from coming up amen at the white Throne judgment and having to be judged see I'm going be standing on the side of the judge with the judge right glory to God glory to God Amen not not standing there because I've rejected the word and all of that not saying that everybody I we we've never preached that everybody in denomination going to hell I don't know where people get that theory from I ain't I
