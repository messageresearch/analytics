[46:58] this year is get back in step and um and
[47:03] and there this this goes in so many many
[47:06] uh uh uh places uh but uh what we're
[47:10] focusing on this uh morning is is this
[47:14] uh third part of the restoration which
[47:17] was the restoration of the gifts amen
[47:19] into the church and um uh so we want to
[47:23] continue our journey that we started on
[47:25] last week so Joel 1 4 says this that
[47:29] which the palmerworm ha left ha the
[47:31] Locust eaten and that which the Locust
[47:33] ha left uh hath the korm eaten and that
[47:36] which uh the korm had left hath a
[47:39] caterpillar eaten and uh over into
[47:42] chapter
[47:43] two we just kind of pick up uh I'll
[47:46] start at verse 25 amen uh for today just
[47:49] to kind of shorten the reading it says I
[47:52] will restore to you the years that the
[47:55] Locust ha eaten the the cankerworm and
[47:58] the caterpillar and the Palmer worm
[48:00] palmerworm my great Army which I sent
[48:02] among you and ye shall eat in plenty and
[48:04] be satisfied and praise the name of the
[48:06] Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously
[48:09] with you and my people should never be
[48:11] ashamed and ye shall know that I am uh
[48:15] in the midst of Israel that I am the
[48:17] Lord your God and none else and my
[48:19] people should never be ashame it should
[48:22] come to pass afterward that I will pour
[48:25] out my spirit upon and All Flesh and
[48:28] your sons and your daughters shall
[48:30] prophesy and your old men shall dream
[48:31] dreams your young men shall see visions
[48:34] and also upon uh the servants and upon
[48:38] the handmaids in those days will I pour
[48:40] out of my spirit and I will show wonders
[48:43] in the heavens and in the earth blood
[48:45] and fire and pillars of smoke the sun
[48:48] shall be turned into darkness and the
[48:49] moon into blood before the Great and the
[48:52] terrible day of the Lord come and it
[48:54] should come to pass that whosoever shall
[48:56] call on the name name of the Lord shall
[48:57] be delivered from Mount Zion and in
[49:00] Jerusalem uh shall be Deliverance as the
[49:03] Lord has said and in the remnant whom
[49:05] the Lord shall call amen Lord at a
[49:07] blessing to the reading of his word
[49:08] let's just quickly pray father we thank
[49:10] you for uh the ability to read the
[49:14] scripture but we know it takes the Holy
[49:16] Ghost to make the word live uh for the
[49:18] day in which we are living so speak to
[49:22] our hearts God in only way that you can
[49:24] minister to every need I may have notes
[49:27] I may have a thought that I'm I feel
[49:30] you've given me to present to the people
[49:31] but Lord you know the needs of the
[49:33] people so God I ask that you Minister
[49:35] ter heart uh those present those online
[49:38] speak father only words that you can in
[49:41] Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless
[49:44] you uh you can be seated
[49:55] amen praise the Lord so we will continue
[49:59] our journey here with get back in step
[50:02] and again the theme uh is I will restore
[50:07] saith the Lord um I was
[50:13] um throughout this this this whole uh
[50:17] study or this time of uh just just this
[50:20] series there was a there's a sermon that
[50:23] was ministered by a God's prophet and
[50:26] and I want you to kind of try to get the
[50:29] the um um just how God does things
[50:34] brother Brandon was sitting in church
[50:37] one um one day I don't know if it was a
[50:40] Sunday morning or what it was but he was
[50:43] sitting in church listening to brother
[50:44] Neville preach brother Neville was
[50:47] actually um really he was the
[50:50] pastor uh there at the church because
[50:52] brother Brandon was gone so much on the
[50:55] field that he um he he had a brother
[50:58] that started out as a deacon uh well no
[51:01] no no no I'm sorry not brother Neville
[51:02] it's another brother but uh brother
[51:04] Neville uh came over as a pastor another
[51:06] church and he started pastoring there at
[51:08] brandom Tabernacle and as he preached
[51:11] that
[51:12] morning uh brother brandham sat there
[51:14] and heard a statement about restoration
[51:17] from Brother Neville and from that the
[51:19] Holy Spirit gave him inspiration uh to
[51:22] preach the message the restoration of
[51:24] the Bride tree and he preached the uh
[51:26] probably about a twoh hour or so sermon
[51:29] uh from a statement that was made
[51:31] through brother Neville now there's
[51:33] there's so many things that I can say
[51:35] right there and I might as well say it
[51:37] um um brother brandom got his
[51:40] inspiration from a man preaching
[51:42] live Amen in the in the church and now
[51:46] we've come to a spot where people want
[51:48] to take the preachers out of the church
[51:49] and just put uh tapes in only praise the
[51:53] Lord and uh and I want to just tell you
[51:56] uh we we don't want to do that the the
[51:58] tapes don't replace the live
[52:01] preaching amen the tapes are there to
[52:03] encourage us and to strengthen us and
[52:05] you know give us direct I mean often
[52:07] times I listen to a tape and I get
[52:08] inspired by I was listening to
[52:10] Restoration Bri tree and I got inspired
[52:12] to bring this sermon right this whole
[52:14] series so uh nothing wrong with that but
[52:16] that's not to replace the preaching amen
[52:19] God don't order ordained tape recorders
[52:21] to preach the
[52:22] gospel amen that's not what God do God
[52:26] ordained men to preach the gospel so uh
[52:29] if you ever run into something like that
[52:30] no we don't stand for that here we we we
[52:32] believe that men should be preaching the
[52:34] gospel amen and uh so in in this sermon
[52:38] um brother brandom begins to kind of he
[52:40] he has this inspiration of um of our
[52:43] restore and and the way he gets the
[52:46] inspiration is from a situation that
[52:49] happened in the church there was a
[52:51] brother that lost uh he was at church
[52:54] and while he's sitting in church
[52:56] somebody comes up and steals this man
[52:59] car and um and so you know when when
[53:02] when the car was stolen after church you
[53:05] know they they go outside and the man's
[53:07] done drove for hours to get to church
[53:09] and now his car and everything in the
[53:10] car is gone suitcases everything gone so
[53:13] they begin to you know the brothers got
[53:15] a little worried and concern and they
[53:16] knew there was a little ring going on
[53:18] with they were taking cars and
[53:19] repainting them and changing the plates
[53:21] and doing all kind of stuff then
[53:22] reselling it and they like brother your
[53:24] car probably gone they probably got it
[53:26] they did this and said well let's just
[53:27] pray about it and uh they got brother
[53:30] brandom and they prayed about it and
[53:32] then God gave him uh a scripture that he
[53:34] been uh uh meditating on if you abide in
[53:37] me praise God and my words abide in you
[53:42] amen hallelujah the Bible says you can
[53:45] ask what you will now there is there's a
[53:48] there's an important part before you ask
[53:50] anything of God the first part is you
[53:52] have to be
[53:54] abiding you can't be coming in and going
[53:57] out and coming in and going out you got
[53:59] to be abiding in him if you want to see
[54:02] that type of power in your life you got
[54:04] to be abiding if you abide in me and
[54:08] then my word has to abide in you then
[54:11] you can ask what you
[54:13] will brother and sisters I'm just
[54:16] telling youall we've been abiding in
[54:17] this for a long time and we know this
[54:20] word been abiding us for a long time I
[54:22] believe we've entered into the season
[54:24] where we can ask what we will
[54:27] and not just ask it'll be done after we
[54:31] ask can I tell you something don't be
[54:33] afraid to ask if you've been Abiding and
[54:36] his word abiding you don't be afraid to
[54:38] ask God got something for you but but
[54:41] but that inspiration struck him so then
[54:43] he just be they they begin to pray
[54:44] underneath that inspiration and a vision
[54:46] came in the
[54:48] prayer the car is coming back is going
[54:50] to come back with half half a tank of
[54:52] gas it's going to be waiting for you
[54:53] over in this area you'll find it right
[54:54] over there told him exactly where to go
[54:56] and get the car now I'm I'm just I'm
[54:58] going to be honest with you I don't
[55:00] think that God
[55:01] died when brother random left here I
[55:03] don't think that God died we we supposed
[55:06] to see Visions we supposed to have
[55:08] dreams according to what I just read in
[55:10] the scripture this is supposed to happen
[55:12] in the church but like I said we done
[55:14] preached it so far out of the church
[55:17] amen that we don't see it no more but
[55:19] God said our will
[55:21] restore sayith the Lord not say brother
[55:25] Jack sayith the Lord somebody got to
[55:28] catch the inspiration of what God is
[55:29] saying in his word and begin to preach
[55:31] that back to the church as we preach the
[55:33] promises we'll see the promises made
[55:36] manifest so there uh the the whole our
[55:41] store also came from the story of Sarah
[55:44] in
[55:45] scripture and um Abraham took off down
[55:49] there because of a famine in the land
[55:52] and he took off down there to I believe
[55:53] it was gar aimc was the king
[55:56] and I and I've I've shared with you all
[55:58] many times how AMC was just praying that
[56:00] God would send him a wife he wanted to
[56:01] have some children and uh and he was
[56:04] praying that God was send him a wife and
[56:05] here comes Abraham with a 90y old
[56:09] woman amen a 9y old woman walking into
[56:13] this this city and this man began to ask
[56:17] questions like he he looked at Sarah at
[56:19] 90 now now you already know something
[56:21] Supernatural must have happened to Sarah
[56:23] for this man to desire her to be his
[56:26] wife wife not only be his wife but be
[56:28] his wife to have kids by can I can I can
[56:31] I say something else this man had no
[56:34] idea Sarah was actually
[56:38] Barren that man didn't even know Sarah
[56:40] was a barren woman but yet when he saw
[56:43] her he's like and and and God had
[56:45] changed her uh from the inside to
[56:47] reflect on the outside and when God
[56:49] changed this man say I got to take her
[56:51] as my wife you say she your sister yeah
[56:53] that's my sister this is your brother
[56:55] yeah that's my brother
[56:56] well you know what thank God for that
[56:58] because I needed a new wife took on down
[57:01] there to the house and and as he's
[57:03] thanking God for this new wife uh God
[57:05] comes to him in a dream and say don't
[57:06] you touch that man's wife he said wife
[57:09] so wait a minute I thought the man said
[57:10] that's my sister she said brother I know
[57:12] what they said but that's his wife and
[57:14] you better not touch
[57:16] her and then he used this term I want to
[57:18] go to Genesis 20 and 7 I want to go to
[57:21] Genesis 20 and 7 because there's a
[57:24] little bit more in this story that I
[57:26] need to read for
[57:27] today praise the Lord he uses this
[57:32] term
[57:34] therefore restore the
[57:37] man his
[57:39] wife Glory this is where I I will
[57:41] restore sayth the Lord oh I I I I like I
[57:44] just love the word of God I like reading
[57:47] that restore the man his
[57:50] wife and I'm I'm saying that to the
[57:53] devil restore the
[57:56] man his
[58:00] wife give her back that's pretty much
[58:03] what God is saying give that man's wife
[58:07] back and he didn't have this man I mean
[58:10] AMC didn't have no um no choice in this
[58:13] all he could do is exactly what God say
[58:15] because he said now therefore restore
[58:17] the man his wife amen for he is a
[58:21] prophet not a liar he is a prophet amen
[58:25] and then he said says this um uh uh and
[58:28] and he shall pray for thee and thou
[58:31] shalt live and if thou restore her not
[58:35] know thou that thou shalt surely die
[58:37] thou and all that are
[58:41] thine my my my my my my my let's keep
[58:45] going here I want to read a little bit
[58:46] more therefore aimc Rose early in the
[58:50] morning and called all his servants and
[58:54] told all these things in their ears
[58:56] and the men were so afraid after they
[58:58] heard what the dream that he had and
[59:00] what happened in the dream and then he
[59:02] says then ailec called Abraham and said
[59:05] unto him what hast thou done unto us and
[59:10] what have and what have I offended thee
[59:13] that thou has brought on me and on my
[59:16] kingdom a great sin thou has done Deeds
[59:20] unto me that ought not to be
[59:23] done right and then aimc said unto
[59:26] Abraham what sawest thou that thou has
[59:29] done this thing why you lied to me like
[59:32] that right well that thou has done this
[59:34] thing he says and Abraham said because I
[59:37] thought now this where a lot of us get
[59:38] in trouble with because of what we think
[59:42] because I thought surely the fear of God
[59:45] is not in this place and they will slay
[59:48] me for my wife's sake he says and yet
[59:51] indeed she is my sister she is the
[59:54] daughter of my father but not the
[59:56] daughter of my mother and she became my
[59:59] wife he let that part he left that part
[1:00:01] out right he says and it came to pass
[1:00:05] when God caused me to wander from my
[1:00:07] father's house that I said unto her this
[1:00:10] is thy kindness which thou shal so show
[1:00:13] unto me at every place whether we shall
[1:00:16] come save me he is my brother look and
[1:00:20] ailec took sheep now this is the part
[1:00:22] that I want you to catch because God
[1:00:23] told him say now let that man pray for
[1:00:25] you rece Resto that man's wife now he
[1:00:27] didn't just restore the man's wife he
[1:00:30] gave some gifts to
[1:00:32] Abraham so in the
[1:00:35] season of
[1:00:37] restoration amen we should see gifts
[1:00:39] being given
[1:00:43] back watch this now look look look at
[1:00:46] verse 14 it says AMC took sheep and oxen
[1:00:51] and men's servants and women's servants
[1:00:54] and gave them unto Abraham and restored
[1:00:58] him Sarah his wife glory to God and aimc
[1:01:02] said behold my land is before thee dwell
[1:01:05] where it pleaseth thee wherever you want
[1:01:08] to wherever you want to live you can
[1:01:09] have it right he say he says and unto s
[1:01:12] said behold I have given thy brother oh
[1:01:15] my my my a thousand pieces of silver
[1:01:21] gifts I've given thy brother a thousand
[1:01:24] pieces of silver behold he is to thee a
[1:01:27] covering of the eyes amen unto all that
[1:01:30] are with thee and with all others thus
[1:01:34] thus she was prooved and I want you to
[1:01:36] get this Abraham never asked for this
[1:01:39] Hallelujah but because he had favor with
[1:01:42] God God gave him this amen God gave
[1:01:46] Abraham gifts in the restoration oh my
[1:01:50] and this is a part of the restoration
[1:01:52] the gifts are part of the restoration
[1:01:55] that's all I'm trying to tell you this
[1:01:56] morning amen let me go on a little
[1:01:58] further it says um uh verse 17 but so
[1:02:01] Abraham prayed unto God and God healed
[1:02:04] ailec and and and here here's another
[1:02:06] one here's another one and his wife and
[1:02:09] his maid servants and uh and his mid
[1:02:12] servants and they bear
[1:02:15] children now I want you to understand
[1:02:17] what happened is that when Sarah came
[1:02:19] into the house oo Lord have mercy Sarah
[1:02:23] was a barren woman but because he had
[1:02:25] the wrong woman in his house barness
[1:02:28] struck the whole house but the way
[1:02:30] baress was taken away is when Abraham
[1:02:33] prayed for
[1:02:35] ailec so a priest or a prophet or amen
[1:02:39] someone like that can pray for you and
[1:02:40] your baress can be taken
[1:02:43] away a minister can take it away if you
[1:02:46] got faith in what he's saying oh my
[1:02:50] church church amen for the Lord had fast
[1:02:54] closed up all the woms of the house of
[1:02:56] ailec because of Sarah Abraham's
[1:03:01] wife baress was taken away I I just li
[1:03:04] like I like this gifts were given
[1:03:06] barness was taken away I mean and and if
[1:03:09] I could just put it this way Abraham had
[1:03:11] the the gift of
[1:03:14] healing just through his prayer the gift
[1:03:16] of healing took place let's go on a
[1:03:19] little further let's read let's read
[1:03:20] something from the restoration of the BR
[1:03:21] tree I I I know where I'm standing at
[1:03:24] this morning now now there is uh I'm
[1:03:27] giving you the natural I've just given
[1:03:29] you the natural type and um but I want
[1:03:32] to now bring in the spiritual type you
[1:03:35] know I I might not have updated this on
[1:03:38] you all's list but if you all would put
[1:03:41] in your table app search
[1:03:44] Sarah a type of the church Sarah a type
[1:03:48] of the church I'm going to be reading
[1:03:50] from restoration of the Bri tree um
[1:03:53] brother brandom now takes this this this
[1:03:56] this natural type that I just shared and
[1:03:59] now we're going to switch it and bring
[1:04:00] it over to the spirit because when you
[1:04:03] look at a woman in the scripture anytime
[1:04:05] you read you know about a woman a woman
[1:04:07] in scripture you have to think of the
[1:04:09] church amen because the woman represents
[1:04:11] the church in the Bible amen just don't
[1:04:13] you know Sarah say no no no no I mean
[1:04:16] they represent us as a church so so look
[1:04:18] at it a little deeper now watch this he
[1:04:21] makes this statement it says
[1:04:23] Sarah a type of the church Church the
[1:04:27] true church the Free Church the free
[1:04:32] woman amen uh Hagar would have been the
[1:04:35] Bond woman and and when Sarah tried to
[1:04:37] use Hagar to bring forth a child it just
[1:04:39] created
[1:04:40] problems she told Abraham now I don't
[1:04:43] think that her thought was I don't I
[1:04:45] don't think God G to use me to be able
[1:04:46] to bring forth this child I ain't had no
[1:04:48] children all these years I don't think
[1:04:50] it's going to happen now I'm I'm too old
[1:04:52] to have a child so but you can take
[1:04:53] hagga her thought was to take hagga
[1:04:56] and you can have a child by her and then
[1:04:57] I I'll raise that child the problem was
[1:04:59] it it it just never worked so then when
[1:05:02] when when when when Sarah comes up with
[1:05:03] this idea Abraham goes along with it and
[1:05:06] they get a child ishmail is born and it
[1:05:08] just create problems in that household
[1:05:09] it was so so it was so bad that Sarah
[1:05:13] told Abraham I know I told you to go to
[1:05:16] Hagar but now I'm coming back to you you
[1:05:18] going have to tell Hagar and her son to
[1:05:22] leave that's how bad it was in that
[1:05:24] house right and Abraham said you know
[1:05:26] mama I got to cast my own son out you
[1:05:29] have to him and his mama got to
[1:05:32] go and here you know Abraham cast him
[1:05:36] out God took care of them but you know
[1:05:38] um all the problems that we have in the
[1:05:40] Middle
[1:05:41] East comes from that it stems from that
[1:05:44] right there it it it's the the children
[1:05:46] of Israel are the children from Isaac
[1:05:50] right the promised son that that's the
[1:05:51] natural flow of the seed line from Isaac
[1:05:54] but the other ones amen that surround
[1:05:56] them cuz if you ever go to Israel let me
[1:05:58] tell you something you wouldn't be able
[1:06:00] to tell the
[1:06:03] difference I I I went to the Gaza Strip
[1:06:06] and it just a wall that was separating
[1:06:07] it's like Rivier Beach and West Palm
[1:06:09] Beach and and just a little wall in
[1:06:11] between and we went down to Gaza Strip
[1:06:13] Gaza Strip is where Bethlehem was and
[1:06:16] Bethlehem is where Jesus was born but
[1:06:18] you they had signs up say no Israelites
[1:06:20] better come past this wall that's right
[1:06:23] but but but I couldn't tell you know I I
[1:06:26] I I I couldn't tell who was Israelite
[1:06:28] and who wasn't I I had know but they
[1:06:30] know yeah all right they know and they
[1:06:33] and and and and um I just remember you
[1:06:36] know just kind of being down in there
[1:06:37] and my God some rough things that
[1:06:39] happened but but but what what we find
[1:06:41] is that the those people they are the
[1:06:43] sons of ishmail and they've always had a
[1:06:47] problem with the promised
[1:06:49] seat amen so this suggestion that Sarah
[1:06:53] had actually created a bigger problem
[1:06:55] problem not just for that they household
[1:06:58] but for many households they got a big
[1:06:59] problem
[1:07:00] nowadays all right let me keep reading
[1:07:04] look it says Sarah type of the Church
[1:07:06] the true church the Free Church the free
[1:07:08] woman with a free child type of the Holy
[1:07:11] the the Born Again Church with the
[1:07:12] promise let them say whatever they want
[1:07:15] to call it Holy Roller fanaticism
[1:07:18] they've tried to stop it since Pentecost
[1:07:21] and they'll never do it oh my God now
[1:07:25] these statements are very important
[1:07:27] they've tried to stop the gifts in the
[1:07:30] church amen since Pentecost they called
[1:07:34] it fanaticism they called it out of
[1:07:36] order they called it uh uh you and your
[1:07:39] flesh they called it all kind of things
[1:07:42] and they called you a Holy Roller right
[1:07:45] I mean they they said all kind of stuff
[1:07:47] about in order to try to stop those
[1:07:48] gifts from going forth in the church let
[1:07:51] me go on a little further now it says
[1:07:53] they've tried to stop it since Pentecost
[1:07:55] and they'll never do it they'll never do
[1:07:58] it he says no sir it it says just keep
[1:08:00] your hands off of it so so watch this
[1:08:02] now it says that's all God's going to uh
[1:08:05] that's all that's all God is going to
[1:08:08] take that and do something with it just
[1:08:10] as certain as I'm standing here I'm
[1:08:12] coming right down through the age of it
[1:08:14] now in a few minutes God help me I'll
[1:08:16] prove it to you where we're where we're
[1:08:18] at right they're never going to destroy
[1:08:21] it cannot be destroyed let me just let
[1:08:22] me just make sure we got that if God is
[1:08:25] giving your gift can't nobody take it
[1:08:26] from

[1:08:33] ordained to happen nobody can preach it
[1:08:38] out because God ordained it to be here I
[1:08:41] will read you promises out of the
[1:08:44] scripture hallelujah amen I I before I
[1:08:48] even get there I'll just tell God
[1:08:49] promised in the book of Isaiah that with
[1:08:52] stammering
[1:08:53] lips will I speak to them now when
[1:08:56] Isaiah wrote that I'm sure people
[1:08:59] thought this man is really crazy what is
[1:09:02] a stammering
[1:09:04] lip what's a Stam lip but yet it was
[1:09:07] there in the scripture and it had to be
[1:09:09] made manifest and on the day of
[1:09:11] Pentecost it was made manifest
[1:09:14] hallelujah hallelujah but God didn't
[1:09:16] just stop at the day of Pentecost he's
[1:09:17] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:09:19] he's still moving on in the same
[1:09:21] manner can I tell y'all God used his
[1:09:23] stammering lips to speak to his people
[1:09:26] right all right let me keep reading let
[1:09:29] me keep reading um it says they they're
[1:09:31] never going to destroy it can't be
[1:09:33] destroyed that's right and look at what
[1:09:35] he just said look at watch this next
[1:09:37] statement take your hands off of
[1:09:41] her the church oh I told y'all Sarah
[1:09:45] represent the church now he's speaking
[1:09:47] to the church and now he's telling the
[1:09:49] devil take your hands off of
[1:09:52] her you've been stifling her for years
[1:09:55] years you've been uh suppressing her
[1:09:58] depressing her oppressing her but take
[1:10:02] your hands off of
[1:10:06] her oh my God my God take your hands off
[1:10:10] of her why there come the natural seed
[1:10:13] the natural seed had to come says uh if
[1:10:16] Sarah would have been married this other
[1:10:18] man the natural seed would would would
[1:10:20] have never been born he's talking about
[1:10:21] ailec it had God not
[1:10:24] intervene and stop aimc amen from this
[1:10:28] desire to want to have children through
[1:10:29] Sarah he would have messed up God's
[1:10:33] program I'mma oh Lord have mercy Jesus
[1:10:37] God was not uh I I I want to I I I have
[1:10:41] to say kind of watch How I say this yes
[1:10:43] he was protecting Abraham but actually
[1:10:45] he was protecting something greater than
[1:10:48] Abraham he was protecting his
[1:10:52] promise and Abraham just happened to be
[1:10:54] the one to get the promise but God was
[1:10:56] protecting his promise God could not let
[1:10:58] his word fall to the ground and return
[1:11:00] void and if God could not do that in the
[1:11:03] days of Abraham and Sarah God can't do
[1:11:06] that
[1:11:09] today if he said your sons and your
[1:11:12] daughters going to prophesy then it's
[1:11:14] got to happen some kind of way it ain't
[1:11:17] up to us to do this we ain't got to
[1:11:20] manufacture this this is God's
[1:11:23] promise and he watch over his word to
[1:11:27] perform
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:29] it take your hands offer High loose her
[1:11:35] and let her
[1:11:36] go she's a free woman not a bond bound
[1:11:42] woman free in the
[1:11:45] spirit
[1:11:48] Hallelujah hey the word is what sets you
[1:11:51] free when you recognize your position in
[1:11:54] the word
[1:11:58] no I ain't going to be bound no more I
[1:12:01] refuse to be
[1:12:02] [Applause]
[1:12:03] bound oh my God my
[1:12:06] God that's why brother brandham say this
[1:12:09] take your hands off of her
[1:12:11] SAT take your hands
[1:12:14] off and people have used the word to try
[1:12:17] to bind the church brother brandom say
[1:12:20] the Holy Ghost been bound by
[1:12:21] denominational Rivers for for over 2,000
[1:12:23] years but this is the season where it's
[1:12:26] got to be
[1:12:27] released and when Abraham when Abraham
[1:12:30] and Sarah were restored restor that man
[1:12:32] his
[1:12:33] wife then they gave gifts to
[1:12:37] Abraham things he didn't even ask
[1:12:41] for and some of y'all ain't even ask for
[1:12:43] the gift of knowledge and wisdom and
[1:12:46] speaking in tongues but you'll get it
[1:12:48] anyway because every church every local
[1:12:51] church is supposed to have the
[1:12:53] non-spiritual gifts flowing in it
[1:12:56] right I'm I'm I'm I'm going keep on
[1:12:58] reading but I know where I'm
[1:13:01] standing Hallelujah I know what I'm
[1:13:03] looking for and and and and and and the
[1:13:06] other thing I want to make it clear we
[1:13:07] want gifts with a
[1:13:12] life don't don't be living like a devil
[1:13:15] and then trying to manifest in gifts
[1:13:16] that's what throw people off but I'm
[1:13:18] talking about the gift with the
[1:13:20] life you know this person been living
[1:13:23] right you don't seen him for years
[1:13:25] living right uh the word abiding in them
[1:13:27] and them abiding in the word no them the
[1:13:29] ones that we want
[1:13:31] manifesting and we realize when God
[1:13:33] begin to move you're going to have all
[1:13:34] kind of stuff if you see somebody with a
[1:13:36] a a a gift being manifested in your life
[1:13:38] and they ain't living nothing just
[1:13:40] praise God God bless
[1:13:43] you he you know why and and rain falling
[1:13:47] just and
[1:13:49] unjust and and that mean everybody going
[1:13:51] to get rain weeds get rain and weat get
[1:13:54] rain
[1:13:56] the grass get rain and the weeds get
[1:13:58] rain and then you know what you know
[1:14:00] what Jesus say when you see uh uh the
[1:14:03] the these tears growing with the
[1:14:08] wheat no no no you know what y'all do
[1:14:11] y'all get out there y'all start picking
[1:14:12] the
[1:14:13] tears Jesus said let it alone because if
[1:14:17] you start picking the tears the way it's
[1:14:19] wrapped around the wheat you actually
[1:14:21] hurt the
[1:14:22] wheat so that's why Jesus said just
[1:14:25] leave it alone let it grow together it
[1:14:28] said because at the end in the end time
[1:14:30] I'm going to take care of that
[1:14:32] problem so I'mma tell you something
[1:14:34] makees sure you are
[1:14:38] weak all
[1:14:40] right let me go on
[1:14:43] Hallelujah take your hands off of
[1:14:46] her why there come the natural seed the
[1:14:49] natural seed had to come uh if it would
[1:14:52] if Sarah would have married this other
[1:14:53] man the natural seed would have never
[1:14:55] been born so God had to protect uh his
[1:14:58] word right the promise that he say Sarah
[1:15:01] your wife going to have a son and he
[1:15:03] could not let this man touch Sarah amen
[1:15:05] because it would have messed up his
[1:15:07] promise so he had to make the man give
[1:15:09] give that man back his wife I know he
[1:15:11] lied to you but give that man back his
[1:15:12] wife because I got a I got a plan here
[1:15:15] and you messing up my
[1:15:18] plan glory to

[1:16:02] extremes to make sure he protects you
[1:16:05] and to protect the promise that he gave
[1:16:06] you he'll pull your children from out of
[1:16:09] out don't know where the pits of
[1:16:14] hell because he made you a promise and
[1:16:18] he said the promise is unto you and to
[1:16:20] your children and those that are far off
[1:16:23] as many as the Lord God shall call so
[1:16:26] whatever God got to do to bring his word
[1:16:29] to pass he will do
[1:16:32] it brother brandom say if God had to
[1:16:35] bankrupt
[1:16:37] heaven in order to fulfill one of your
[1:16:40] needs then he'll just bankrupt

[1:19:51] further I I I'm trying to move into
[1:19:54] something here let let's go on uh I'm
[1:19:55] I'm I'm continue reading here
[1:19:57] restoration of the Bri tree says now God
[1:20:00] talking of
[1:20:01] restoring now here in Joel he's talking
[1:20:04] about it I preached one on this before
[1:20:06] and now when I read the scripture in
[1:20:08] Joel chapter uh one and chapter
[1:20:11] two initially when I started this
[1:20:13] journey I I gave you all
[1:20:16] um um a
[1:20:19] uh definition
[1:20:22] from um theologian
[1:20:26] theologians got together they read this
[1:20:27] scripture and when they looked at it
[1:20:29] they said themselves we don't know what
[1:20:32] this means it's it's uncertain that's
[1:20:35] what the the people that studied the
[1:20:38] Bible for years and they run into that
[1:20:41] scripture and then they say this is
[1:20:42] uncertain we don't know what to mean so
[1:20:44] the average Church would pick up that
[1:20:45] scripture and say well we don't really
[1:20:47] know what to say here but in the message
[1:20:51] because we had a prophet I can take a
[1:20:53] whole series out of just that scripture
[1:20:56] that they're uncertain about and preach
[1:20:58] through the entire year from this one
[1:21:00] from this scripture that they're
[1:21:01] uncertain about that's the beauty of the
[1:21:05] message because a prophet begins to show
[1:21:07] you wait a minute this means this this
[1:21:09] means that this see if it if can I can I
[1:21:11] can I can I can I just make it real
[1:21:13] simple Joel was a
[1:21:16] prophet Isaiah was a Prophet Jeremiah
[1:21:21] was a prophet Moses was a prophet uh
[1:21:26] there's different ones in the scripture
[1:21:28] uh I I know I'm going miss some names
[1:21:30] here all these prophets that wrote the
[1:21:32] word Old Testament prophets that wrote
[1:21:35] the word if a Old Testament Prophet
[1:21:37] would write it wouldn't it take a
[1:21:39] prophet to reveal
[1:21:42] it again like I told you how is how do
[1:21:45] people going to understand what
[1:21:46] stammering lips
[1:21:48] mean actually when it just even even
[1:21:50] Isaiah when he say thus sayth the Lord a
[1:21:54] virgin going to
[1:22:00] conceive you can imagine the people that
[1:22:03] day like now look man
[1:22:07] uh
[1:22:09] really they you can imagine what they
[1:22:11] speaking at at dinner did and everybody
[1:22:13] the elephant in the room nobody want to
[1:22:15] talk about the elephant in the room and
[1:22:16] they just go oh yeah then we have a
[1:22:17] wonderful service today yeah it was a
[1:22:19] good service yeah it was
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:22] great silent pauses silent PA pause it
[1:22:24] silent pause
[1:22:27] it then somebody maybe maybe one little
[1:22:29] boy in the in the house that don't know
[1:22:31] no better daddy did you hear the prophet
[1:22:35] he said a virgin was G to con oh boy
[1:22:38] just don't say things like that I don't
[1:22:40] know what to say about the prophet I
[1:22:42] really don't know what to say about him
[1:22:43] I just I think he's getting
[1:22:49] older see in their minds they thought
[1:22:53] and and and action like that and brother
[1:22:54] said there were some people that
[1:22:55] believed it during that time so you had
[1:22:57] girls walking around acting like they
[1:22:59] was
[1:23:00] pregnant virgins but that's not how God
[1:23:03] was manifesting his word that Prophet is
[1:23:05] going to come come years
[1:23:07] later oh my see so so um if it took
[1:23:12] prophets to write these things it take
[1:23:13] Prophet a prophet to understand what was
[1:23:15] written and give it back to us so let's
[1:23:17] pick up what he's saying to us now God
[1:23:19] talking of
[1:23:20] restoring now here in Joel he's talking
[1:23:22] about I preached on this once before and
[1:23:26] took it in another angle he says never
[1:23:29] thought never never thoroughly went
[1:23:31] through it as I intend to today and
[1:23:34] won't have time to do uh uh to do it
[1:23:37] where it ought to be done but God is
[1:23:39] speaking here in Joel God is speaking of
[1:23:43] his fruit
[1:23:44] tree amen that he planted God planted a
[1:23:49] fruit tree he planted it on the day of
[1:23:52] Pentecost hello y'all I want to just
[1:23:55] this is important God planted a fruit
[1:23:59] tree on the day of
[1:24:01] Pentecost and when God planted this
[1:24:03] fruit tree on the day of Pentecost he
[1:24:06] expected it to always give
[1:24:09] fruit it didn't just stop on the day of
[1:24:11] Pentecost but even for every generation
[1:24:13] after that they're supposed to get the
[1:24:15] fruit from this tree oh my I'm going to
[1:24:18] tell y'all what's on the tree in a
[1:24:20] second you do you want some fruit
[1:24:25] my my mama my my daddy put a fruit tree
[1:24:28] many fruit trees in his backyard now my
[1:24:31] daddy want just planting trees just to
[1:24:34] say his backyard look pretty but my
[1:24:36] daddy put them trees there for a purpose
[1:24:38] if they're fruit trees I want them to
[1:24:41] bear
[1:24:42] fruit if if if I'm putting a mango tree
[1:24:45] in the ground I want some
[1:24:47] mangoes i i i i and and and don't just
[1:24:50] give me any I want them haens
[1:24:53] [Music]
[1:24:55] don't know nothing about no
[1:25:00] mangoes my neighbor got this fruit tree
[1:25:02] like we don't know about these mangoes
[1:25:05] he got he got two different kind of
[1:25:07] mango trees the Hayden in the backyard
[1:25:10] but them turpentine in the front yard
[1:25:12] and uh and and like we don't know and we
[1:25:14] see them going around getting them
[1:25:16] hating they the big purple ones they
[1:25:18] like meat when you cut through them like
[1:25:19] meat like come on
[1:25:21] church I mean you get full off a hating
[1:25:25] you can make a real fruit salad with
[1:25:28] that but then he said then you know we
[1:25:30] see them over there getting all them
[1:25:32] haens and then uh that you know they
[1:25:34] want to be nice to us and they come and
[1:25:37] gave us a box of
[1:25:40] turpentine and I felt like
[1:25:44] now you going to have to keep these we
[1:25:47] want them and and look we know the
[1:25:50] difference we've been raised on these
[1:25:52] things we know the these little drinking
[1:25:54] mangoes getting you can't do nothing
[1:25:56] with this but the
[1:26:01] hating when you plant a fruit tree you
[1:26:03] want
[1:26:05] fruit God planted a fruit
[1:26:08] tree the prophet tell us God planted
[1:26:11] something on the day of Pentecost watch
[1:26:14] this now it says um God is speaking of
[1:26:18] his of his fruit of his fruit tree that
[1:26:19] he planted God planted a fruit tree he
[1:26:21] planted it on the day of Pentecost and
[1:26:23] he and he brought that tree there for a
[1:26:27] purpose he wanted it to bear his
[1:26:32] fruit word God's word he wanted a
[1:26:37] church that would keep his
[1:26:42] word and now now now watch this all down
[1:26:46] through the a so not just at Pentecost
[1:26:48] God wanted a church that was going to
[1:26:50] keep this all the way down Through the
[1:26:52] Ages right he says uh Eve had failed to
[1:26:55] keep it the Jews had failed to keep it
[1:27:00] the law had fail all had failed so God
[1:27:04] planted him a
[1:27:05] tree a tree now remember there was two
[1:27:09] trees in the Garden of Eden we know that
[1:27:11] you call you call them whatever you want
[1:27:13] I have my idea but anyhow one of them
[1:27:16] was a defile tree now now he now he he
[1:27:18] didn't go into great de detail here but
[1:27:21] you know I might as well just mention it
[1:27:23] while I'm here
[1:27:24] he planted two trees the tree of
[1:27:26] knowledge good and evil and the tree of
[1:27:29] life now um the the the the God's
[1:27:33] children were told you can eat from any
[1:27:35] Tree in this Garden but don't eat from
[1:27:37] the Tree of knowledge good evil don't
[1:27:39] eat from that tree and um
[1:27:43] Satan got into the serpent and and see
[1:27:47] this serpent that was in the garden
[1:27:49] actually stood on two feet like a man
[1:27:54] this animal that was in the garden he
[1:27:55] stood on two feet just like a man and he
[1:27:58] was the only animal in the garden that
[1:28:00] could actually have a conversation with
[1:28:03] the man he was the only one that could
[1:28:05] have it he just didn't have a soul
[1:28:07] inside of him right but but but but here
[1:28:09] he here here he is standing there and
[1:28:11] he's having conversations and you know
[1:28:13] Adam and Eve they have they have
[1:28:14] Fellowship all the time Adam was the one
[1:28:16] that named all these animals right so
[1:28:18] here this one day the serpent comes not
[1:28:20] and Eve not recognizing that the serpent
[1:28:23] had been anointed by the devil y'all
[1:28:26] don't believe Satan getting
[1:28:27] animals what happened to them pigs at in
[1:28:30] gadera why they jumped off a cliff the
[1:28:32] they was grazing eating and then the
[1:28:36] devil got into pigs and caused them to
[1:28:37] jump off off a
[1:28:39] cliff amen the devil gets into
[1:28:43] animals that dog you've been running
[1:28:51] from use the power in your
[1:28:55] mouth and tell Satan I bind you in the
[1:28:58] name of
[1:28:59] Jesus Satan can get inside of an animal
[1:29:02] when brother Brandon was crossing that
[1:29:04] path and that killer bull was there and
[1:29:06] that killer
[1:29:07] bull he need he just looked at him and
[1:29:10] and and and when he when he looked at
[1:29:11] him he just started doing like
[1:29:17] this brother brandom knew what that
[1:29:19] meant and he actually went looking for
[1:29:21] his gun but didn't have no gun now now
[1:29:24] what you think he was going to do if he
[1:29:26] looking for his gun I'mma have to shoot
[1:29:28] this bull because he knew a few weeks
[1:29:31] later that bull saw a brother walk by
[1:29:34] and did the same
[1:29:37] thing ran right
[1:29:39] over well when when brother brandom sees
[1:29:41] this and know get what's going happen he
[1:29:43] say uh I'm going to pray for one of
[1:29:44] God's sick people you go back and lay
[1:29:46] down in the name of
[1:29:47] Jesus he said that bull was doing this
[1:29:50] and got so far and just turned around
[1:29:52] and went back and laid down that's the
[1:29:54] power that we have not just he had we
[1:29:57] got that kind of
[1:30:00] power so you use your power but Satan
[1:30:03] get in animals and and what Satan did he
[1:30:05] got into he got into the serpent and he
[1:30:07] began to have this conversation he
[1:30:08] saying now now you know uh yeah God told
[1:30:11] us that we're not supposed to we can eat
[1:30:12] from any tree but not that tree uh you
[1:30:15] know the tree of knowledge could even in
[1:30:16] the one in the midst of the garden we're
[1:30:18] not supposed to eat that one said no no
[1:30:20] no you he say the day we eat that of
[1:30:22] thereof we going to die uh said now you
[1:30:24] won't surely
[1:30:26] die that's not really what was being
[1:30:29] said that that's not I mean ain't no
[1:30:30] death in God he's an eternal being there
[1:30:34] ain't no death in God so you won't
[1:30:36] surely die no God said you're gonna
[1:30:42] die Eve partook of the fruit and then
[1:30:44] she went and gave it to Adam now we know
[1:30:47] it was not a natural fruit tree that Eve
[1:30:49] ate from because the Bible begins to
[1:30:51] tell us that after she partook of this
[1:30:53] fruit
[1:30:55] fruit she got pregnant so we know
[1:30:59] automatically it's not an apple tree
[1:31:00] that she ate from it's not an apricot
[1:31:03] tree it's not a banana tree if she got
[1:31:06] pregnant from eating
[1:31:10] fruit now how people get pregnant today
[1:31:13] by eating
[1:31:16] fruit no there's a fruit in the midst of
[1:31:19] the garden and your body is the garden
[1:31:23] there's a fruit in the the midst of the
[1:31:24] garden and when you get them two fruit
[1:31:26] trees coming together we get
[1:31:33] problems if that's how children are born
[1:31:35] today that's how children were born back
[1:31:39] then
[1:31:41] amen and the only time God want them
[1:31:43] trees coming together CU we back in
[1:31:45] sanctification right only time God want
[1:31:47] them trees coming together is under the
[1:31:49] bonds of marriage
[1:31:55] am if you ain't married and you you you
[1:31:58] you intertwining your
[1:32:01] fruits and I'm trying to be
[1:32:05] is trying to clean it up a little bit
[1:32:09] but you got your your fruit all mixed
[1:32:16] up
[1:32:18] amen then you out of God's will way out
[1:32:22] of his will
[1:32:26] now I'm I'm going just tell you the
[1:32:27] reason that God can bless it in marriage
[1:32:29] is because God designed Adam and Eve and
[1:32:32] he gave them reproductive organs and
[1:32:35] brother Brandon say it it might have
[1:32:37] been God's will for Eve to have children
[1:32:40] that way it might have been God's will
[1:32:42] but but but they they actually didn't
[1:32:44] wait on the will of God they got ahead
[1:32:46] of God and it's created all these
[1:32:48] problems so it was no physical fruit
[1:32:51] tree
[1:32:54] just like when I just said that God
[1:32:57] planted a tree at the day of Pentecost
[1:32:59] that was not a physical fruit tree it
[1:33:02] was a spiritual tree but it got fruit on
[1:33:05] it and it's planted for a reason and I
[1:33:08] want to
[1:33:09] partake of these
[1:33:12] fruit I'm coming to tell you what's on
[1:33:14] the tree now just give me a second give
[1:33:15] me a second I'mma tell you what's on
[1:33:17] God's
[1:33:18] tree and it was planted at
[1:33:22] Pentecost look at this now now remember
[1:33:25] there was two trees in the Garden of
[1:33:26] Eden we know that you call them whatever
[1:33:29] you want to I have my idea but anyhow
[1:33:32] one of them was a defiled tree it got
[1:33:34] defiled and the other one wasn't
[1:33:37] defiled that tree of life come from
[1:33:40] God out of Heaven he said your fathers
[1:33:43] eat man and are dead but this tree you
[1:33:45] eat and you you live forever and the
[1:33:47] angel guarded that tree of life from the
[1:33:50] Garden of Eden kept it in Eden that tree
[1:33:52] of life is in Eden now spiritually
[1:33:54] speaking now notice now when this tree
[1:33:58] that God planted it was to Bear nine
[1:34:02] different kinds of fruit nine different
[1:34:06] kinds which means nine spiritual nine
[1:34:09] fruits of the spirit to go with the nine
[1:34:11] spiritual gifts that was God's tree he
[1:34:13] planted it in the Earth on the day of
[1:34:17] Pentecost oh my my my my my let me go a
[1:34:20] little
[1:34:21] further and then at Pentecost house
[1:34:24] where the church for the bride tree I'm
[1:34:27] sorry actually I got to stop there
[1:34:28] because I'm skipping down to another
[1:34:30] Another Part let's just read here really
[1:34:32] quick these fruit go to 1 Corinthians
[1:34:36] 12 he just told us what was on the tree
[1:34:39] he said it was
[1:34:42] nine spiritual
[1:34:46] gifts First Corinthians 12 it was
[1:34:49] planted at
[1:34:51] Pentecost and if it was planted at
[1:34:53] Pentecost
[1:34:54] you tell me when did God uproot this
[1:34:59] tree so if the
[1:35:01] tree is still planted it should still be
[1:35:05] bearing
[1:35:07] fruit you know when the children of
[1:35:10] Israel got into a little trouble one
[1:35:13] time they got on a little
[1:35:15] journey and they
[1:35:19] um they went for battle when they got
[1:35:23] there on battle went seven days with all
[1:35:25] the animals and they could find no water
[1:35:27] at all now you know people die if they
[1:35:29] if they if they don't have water certain
[1:35:32] amount of time so they got desperate and
[1:35:34] they knew that there if we try to turn
[1:35:36] around and go back seven days journey
[1:35:38] that's going to be 14 days with no water
[1:35:41] and some of us the animals ain't going
[1:35:42] to make it and some of us ain't going to
[1:35:43] make it they had nothing so they begin
[1:35:46] to uh like hey is there a Prophet or
[1:35:48] somebody we can go to and try to get an
[1:35:50] answer from God they said yeah yeah yeah
[1:35:52] there's a prophet here and and when they
[1:35:53] they went Elisha was there and they say
[1:35:56] um please we need a word from the Lord
[1:35:58] like um he says go to your false gods
[1:36:01] and and get a word from the Lord don't
[1:36:03] come to me to get no word from the Lord
[1:36:04] you don't need serve God you don't abide
[1:36:06] in me and my words abide in you don't
[1:36:07] come over here to me just go find your
[1:36:10] he say it was only because the presence
[1:36:11] of
[1:36:12] Jehoshaphat he says you know what I I I
[1:36:15] I say give me a minstral give me a I
[1:36:17] need an anointed musician somebody that
[1:36:20] can bring the presence of the Lord down
[1:36:24] they got a clean life that the spirit of
[1:36:26] God can flow through them and they say
[1:36:28] said give me one of them minrs and and
[1:36:30] and say okay they start playing some
[1:36:31] music next thing you know he got into
[1:36:32] the spirit music got him in the spirit
[1:36:35] and the man be to
[1:36:37] prophesy he says go go dig some ditches
[1:36:40] he says because you ain't G you ain't G
[1:36:42] to hear no wind you ain't GNA you ain't
[1:36:44] GNA feel no rain but dig the ditches dig
[1:36:46] them as deep as you can because there's
[1:36:48] going to be water in the
[1:36:50] ditch so we ain't going be no wind and
[1:36:53] ain't going to be no rain ain't gonna be
[1:36:54] no this and and but it's going to be one
[1:36:56] what and so so brother brand say where
[1:36:58] the water came
[1:37:00] from where the water come from he says
[1:37:03] because the he said the water came from
[1:37:05] the spiritual Rock which was Christ that
[1:37:08] was following
[1:37:12] them that same Rock is following us
[1:37:15] today brother sister their rock is not
[1:37:19] like our Rock
[1:37:25] they got water from a desperate
[1:37:28] situation we're going to get gifts out
[1:37:31] of a desperate situation where were the
[1:37:33] gifts they were always
[1:37:35] there oh my God my God let me keep on
[1:37:38] reading I'm here in in 1 Corinthians 12
[1:37:41] I want to start at verse
[1:37:45] four now there are diversities of gifts
[1:37:49] but the same
[1:37:52] spirit and there are differences of
[1:37:54] administrations but the same Lord now
[1:37:57] this is very important that we
[1:37:58] understand this in
[1:38:01] scripture uh because when when it comes
[1:38:03] to gifts in a church somebody be like
[1:38:05] well God don't use me as much as he used
[1:38:07] so and so and God don't do this and go
[1:38:09] no no no no no no don't don't compare
[1:38:11] yourself with
[1:38:13] anybody don't don't do that God use you
[1:38:15] where he wants to use you and you got to
[1:38:18] learn to be satisfied with what he does
[1:38:20] through
[1:38:22] you all us are made different I got I
[1:38:25] got six other preachers in this church
[1:38:27] you know everybody preach
[1:38:29] different and and I've always said this
[1:38:32] if
[1:38:33] um if uh if if a 100% of us were
[1:38:38] alike then 99% of us would not be
[1:38:43] needed if 100% of us were alike then 99%
[1:38:48] of us would not be needed so let's
[1:38:50] appreciate our differences amen we all
[1:38:53] preach different we all approach the
[1:38:55] word different and and we learn to
[1:38:56] appreciate that I I'm not trying to be
[1:38:58] nobody and I I don't want nobody trying
[1:39:00] to be me be yourself just give us the
[1:39:02] word that's all just give us the way God
[1:39:04] use you to give the word give us the
[1:39:05] word even even when it come to singers
[1:39:07] you know uh there are certain songs go
[1:39:09] for certain
[1:39:13] singers musicians are different I I'm

[1:39:25] that's going to carry them 30 40 years
[1:39:27] from now if the Lord ter what is it it's
[1:39:30] going to be different but it's okay that
[1:39:32] is different long as it got the word in
[1:39:34] it that's what matters the most cuz the
[1:39:35] word is what's going to keep
[1:39:37] you but we all different the musicians
[1:39:40] play their styles are different singers
[1:39:43] sing different I mean uh there are
[1:39:45] certain songs but you just give it to

[1:40:05] different it's okay it's okay and and we
[1:40:07] all got different
[1:40:08] administrations certain notes that some
[1:40:11] people can hit I can't hit and ain't no
[1:40:14] sense to me trying to do that hello
[1:40:18] don't don't don't get jealous of
[1:40:19] somebody else gift this is this is what
[1:40:22] has messed up the church sometime this
[1:40:24] person God always speaking this person I
[1:40:27] I don't hear from God at all first thing
[1:40:29] another thing I'm going to tell you I'm
[1:40:30] going just I'm going tell you this now
[1:40:31] you might not you might not know this
[1:40:33] but you're G to know it today God don't
[1:40:35] speak as much as people say he
[1:40:42] speak 1 Corinthians 12 let me what verse
[1:40:47] my you going to realize that one day cuz
[1:40:50] everybody's ready say the Lord told me
[1:40:53] just
[1:40:53] what you got to learn how to do is like
[1:40:55] Jeremiah Jeremiah went to church one day
[1:40:57] and he heard a man say the Lord said and
[1:41:00] Jeremiah know the Lord told him
[1:41:01] something different you know what
[1:41:02] Jeremiah said have he heard that man
[1:41:04] prophesy
[1:41:09] amen then later on he got them to
[1:41:11] himself because you got these people all
[1:41:12] worked up like that you're going to die
[1:41:14] before you see a
[1:41:16] manifestation just sometimes just learn
[1:41:18] amen just move on don't make nothing out
[1:41:20] of Amen but you ain't got that that
[1:41:22] don't mean you re receiving
[1:41:25] it y'all know how y'all give me y amen
[1:41:31] sometime all right let me keep reading
[1:41:34] amen preach fastor preach n
[1:41:38] no I can feel right through
[1:41:43] that all right 1 Corinthians 12 these
[1:41:46] are the fruit that's on this
[1:41:48] tree and God got fruit that we want to
[1:41:51] partake of brother br said God planted
[1:41:54] this on the day of Pentecost and I I
[1:41:57] want these
[1:42:00] fruit I I got to have them man don't
[1:42:03] give me them turpentine
[1:42:07] haens I know what a hating is I know
[1:42:10] what I I know what it tastes like glory
[1:42:13] to God all right look at this verse
[1:42:16] five and there are differences of
[1:42:19] administrations but the same Lord
[1:42:24] and there are differences I'm sorry and
[1:42:26] and there are diversities of
[1:42:29] operations but is the same God which
[1:42:32] worketh all in all so it's diversity of
[1:42:36] operations they operate
[1:42:39] differently everybody operate
[1:42:40] differently it's okay but it's the same
[1:42:42] God in control of it all watch this
[1:42:46] now am I reading the
[1:42:51] Bible and it says this
[1:42:54] it says and there are diversities of
[1:42:56] operations but it is the same God which
[1:42:58] worketh all in
[1:43:00] all look at this but the manifestation
[1:43:04] of the
[1:43:05] spirit is given to every man to profit
[1:43:09] with all we all get benefit from
[1:43:13] this for to
[1:43:17] one is given by the
[1:43:20] spirit who gave it spirit
[1:43:25] the word of
[1:43:29] wisdom we were in prayer on on um
[1:43:33] Tuesday night and brother Solomon made a
[1:43:34] statement in his prayer that just stuck
[1:43:36] with me it's like Lord we see the gift
[1:43:38] of wisdom in our church it says when we
[1:43:41] were going through the co protocols that
[1:43:43] was wisdom speaking to
[1:43:48] us
[1:43:50] amen and and and and and sometime we
[1:43:52] don't even recognize what God is doing
[1:43:54] in our midst and and and and let me tell
[1:43:56] you
[1:43:57] something I I ain't got time to read all
[1:43:59] of this but but I'm going give you some
[1:44:01] homework read 1 Corinthians 12 when you
[1:44:04] go home because other thing that tell
[1:44:06] that start telling us that you know the
[1:44:08] gifts are like parts of the body your
[1:44:11] natural body your your hand can't say I
[1:44:14] don't need the feet and and and and the
[1:44:17] ears don't need this and and and and
[1:44:20] heart saying I don't need the liver I
[1:44:22] you can't be saying things like that no
[1:44:25] no and like and even like like this all
[1:44:27] these four fingers sitting together but
[1:44:28] the fifth one the way over
[1:44:30] here these these can't talk to the thumb
[1:44:33] and say we don't need you even when you
[1:44:36] try to come close to us look at how you
[1:44:38] stand next to
[1:44:40] us we don't need you we don't need
[1:44:49] you I can't even hold this microphone
[1:45:01] it I can try but it has no support and
[1:45:05] in the slightest move I might drop it
[1:45:07] but what locks
[1:45:13] it what locks it is when I bring that
[1:45:16] thumb around now I feel secure and God
[1:45:21] designed the body that way
[1:45:25] every piece of the body is
[1:45:28] needed even my little
[1:45:32] toe you let me stump my little
[1:45:40] toe my my my my mother-in-law did that
[1:45:42] last week she she hit a sidewalk or
[1:45:46] something like that with that little to
[1:45:48] the whole body felt it
[1:45:53] the whole body was wrecking with pain
[1:45:55] just from hitting the
[1:45:57] toe so look we we not we not trying
[1:46:01] to demeanor or minimize any gift that's
[1:46:05] in the body we want to encourage every
[1:46:09] gift that is in the body it's different
[1:46:13] administrations it's different
[1:46:15] operations and this is important to
[1:46:18] understand because it might look
[1:46:20] different on a different person I mean
[1:46:22] everybody different so this gift might
[1:46:24] look different on this person than it
[1:46:25] does on that one so don't don't try to
[1:46:27] gauge it B it should do no no it's the
[1:46:29] Holy Ghost The Same Spirit but it's
[1:46:31] different administrations different
[1:46:33] operations it's
[1:46:34] diversities that's the way God
[1:46:37] is let me go on I'm reading on this is
[1:46:40] what's on the tree this is on the tree
[1:46:43] that God planted at
[1:46:46] Pentecost what verse am I
[1:46:49] on verse eight okay for one is given by
[1:46:53] the spirit the word of
[1:46:56] wisdom that's the first gift first fruit
[1:46:59] on the tree the to
[1:47:02] another the word of
[1:47:06] knowledge and that's that's
[1:47:08] important sometimes knowledge can come
[1:47:11] in different
[1:47:13] forms uh let me just I'm just I'm all
[1:47:15] over the place now knowledge some
[1:47:17] sometimes just come in this General
[1:47:19] conversation that we having and somebody
[1:47:22] might have learned something from a
[1:47:24] prior experience that they can share
[1:47:26] with you so you can avoid a future
[1:47:30] mistake
[1:47:33] knowledge amen and sometime you know
[1:47:36] what it could come through you know the
[1:47:38] I don't know why I felt led to tell you
[1:47:40] this but the Lord just keep impressing
[1:47:42] me for to just tell you this and I don't
[1:47:44] know why he telling me to tell you this
[1:47:45] you don't know what that person going
[1:47:47] through at the time and that word of
[1:47:49] knowledge is coming forth now let me
[1:47:53] kind of stop there because there's
[1:47:54] another side to this you done heard
[1:47:58] something that somebody done told you
[1:48:01] and now you feel led to tell me
[1:48:05] something it's sometimes it's hard to
[1:48:07] receive that as a word of knowledge
[1:48:10] right amen but I tell you what when when
[1:48:12] it's somebody that don't know me and
[1:48:14] don't know nothing about me and the Lord
[1:48:17] just keep telling me to tell you this
[1:48:19] knowledge
[1:48:23] oh my let me keep going um to another
[1:48:28] the word of knowledge by The Same
[1:48:31] Spirit to another
[1:48:34] Faith now what is
[1:48:37] this if you don't know what this
[1:48:40] is I I I I wish that you would had the
[1:48:43] opportunity to be raised underneath the
[1:48:45] ministry of darl Wesco
[1:48:53] we all got faith but this is a gift of
[1:48:56] faith I'mma tell you how I know you got
[1:48:58] faith I'mma tell you you you I ain't got
[1:49:01] faith yes you do you got it you don't
[1:49:03] even know it you want to know how you
[1:49:05] got
[1:49:06] faith you actually came in here saw that

[1:49:49] somewhere you ain't checking this out
[1:49:51] how you going to do this Lord how you
[1:49:52] going to do that you got to explain this
[1:49:53] to me you say that to the
[1:49:58] chair if you just apply that to God you
[1:50:01] might go
[1:50:02] somewhere but this gift of faith just
[1:50:04] seemed like no matter what come up in
