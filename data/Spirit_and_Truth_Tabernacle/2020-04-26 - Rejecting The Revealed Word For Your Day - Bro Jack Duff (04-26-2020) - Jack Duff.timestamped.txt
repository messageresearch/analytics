[25:29] we want to wish our precious brother
[25:32] Jeffrey a happy birthday amen today I
[25:35] have another year here man we just
[25:40] appreciated the Lord

[25:48] changes that have be coming forward to
[25:49] the next couple couple of weeks we will
[25:51] be communicating to the church once we
[25:55] will just kind of change our schedules
[25:56] but for right now we want to kind of
[25:58] continue to go the path that we have
[26:00] been going until we get all the
[26:02] information I know that they're starting
[26:03] to open up some of the non-essential
[26:07] businesses and things like that so look
[26:10] like we're trying to get back on on
[26:12] don't schedule but as we get more
[26:15] information we'll certainly let you know
[26:16] but for right now let's just kind of
[26:18] keep going with the path going the path
[26:20] that we have it going and we'll continue
[26:22] our virtual service so Wednesday at 7:30
[26:26] by a periscope we have through all of
[26:30] this we got a new Facebook
[26:34] [Music]
[26:37] channel as well so you can you can
[26:39] stream through Facebook I saw an update
[26:42] sister Linda think it was this week and
[26:55] just blessed our heart about coming to
[26:58] church and how we all need church a man
[27:01] it was just real blessed thank God for
[27:03] her so also no service on Friday night
[27:07] till further notice so who get back to
[27:10] that schedule soon and we'll continue
[27:13] our 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. services on
[27:16] Sunday number like I said things there
[27:18] are no things are changing but we will
[27:20] start making our adjustments over the
[27:23] next couple of weeks and we will
[27:24] communicate that to you so regarding
[27:29] giving as you know we have it we're
[27:32] actually doing something that's very
[27:33] biblical you know in the scripture what
[27:36] they would do with
[27:38] with giving they actually had a little
[27:40] box that they were taken for they they
[27:42] their money in remember Jesus told the
[27:45] story about the woman that casts our two
[27:48] pimps into the Treasury it was a little
[27:51] box that they would put their money in
[27:53] so that's where we're going right back
[27:54] to Scripture
[27:55] when we do things like this and so we
[27:58] have the little box amen there for those
[28:00] that are inside the sanctuary you can
[28:02] put it inside the box either when you're
[28:04] coming in and when you're going out it
[28:07] might be something that we might
[28:08] continue to do cuz it kind of helps you
[28:10] know move the service along as well so
[28:12] we'll keep you informed but those that
[28:14] are online they menu actually have two
[28:17] options now there used to be one option

[31:24] well let's turn a man in our Bibles
[31:28] Thank You musicians amen
[31:31] appreciate you all this morning
[31:37] amen let's just turn the first Kings 19
[31:41] I'm gonna read just one verse out of
[31:44] this chapter and and then from there we
[31:50] will just start a path of a thought I
[31:53] don't feel like I'm gonna be able to get
[31:56] all of this thought out today so we'll
[31:59] go as far as we can and and then we'll
[32:02] just let the Lord have his way so here
[32:07] in 1st Kings 19 verse 15 and the Lord
[32:14] said unto him go return on that way to
[32:19] the wilderness of Damascus and when thou
[32:23] comest anoint has al to be king over
[32:28] Syria and let me just keep going and
[32:31] jehu the son of nimshi
[32:33] shalt our North to be king over Israel
[32:35] and elisha the son of shaphat of abel
[32:40] Mahalo shall darlin ought to be profit
[32:43] in thy room and it shall come to pass to
[32:47] him that escaping the sort of has a ljj
[32:51] who slayed him that escaped a--the from
[32:53] the sword of Jehu show Elijah's Lee yet
[32:56] I have left me seven thousand in Israel
[33:00] all the knees which have not bowed unto
[33:03] Bale and
[33:05] every mouth which have not kissed him
[33:08] ain't man a man a man praise the name of
[33:13] the Lord let's just bow in a word of
[33:16] Prayer father we thank you for the
[33:20] privilege to read the Word of God but we
[33:24] know it takes the Holy Spirit to help us
[33:27] understand what it is that we're reading
[33:29] and not only understand it but to apply
[33:31] it in the day in which we live
[33:35] so god help us to catch by revelation
[33:38] the things Lord that must be known to us
[33:43] so that we could position ourselves for
[33:47] [Music]
[33:48] overcome to overcome father in this hour
[33:51] and now Lord we just pray that you just
[33:54] take control over the thought I thank
[33:56] you for the Saints that have gathered
[33:58] here in the sanctuary those that are
[34:00] joining us online thank you for them as
[34:02] well
[34:02] and pray father that you would get all
[34:05] the glory and all the honor from our
[34:07] thoughts today in Jesus name we pray
[34:09] amen amen god bless you can be seated
[34:25] praise the Lord so as you are aware the
[34:30] Lord has us on a journey here this year
[34:36] being twenty twin it is perfect for
[34:38] stepping into the vision and we've been
[34:41] just kind of dissecting and taking
[34:43] different parts of the Angels words to
[34:49] the Prophet when he told him to pick up
[34:51] his pen and write and we just been
[34:53] trying to bring the church through that
[34:56] because that the angel spoke about us
[34:58] the angel was writing writing to us
[35:02] right and and I think it's it's very
[35:05] important for us to understand you know
[35:07] what what's going on and and where we
[35:10] are I believe just as Mary was
[35:15] predestinated by Almighty God to fulfill
[35:19] the scripture of a virgin conceiving a
[35:22] man and how the Word of God had to wait
[35:25] for Mary to come on the earth Mary was
[35:29] not born by accident if you all study
[35:31] the life of Mary you would know it was
[35:34] even difficult mom had a problem even
[35:37] you know I think conceiving and the
[35:41] parents were old and and and when Mary
[35:43] finally was conceived and I think her
[35:44] father had already passed away and you
[35:47] know just a lot of difficult things but
[35:48] yet married was ordained by God to come
[35:53] through that union and to be here to
[35:55] fulfill Scripture Amen for that for that
[35:58] time I believe the angel the Lord wrote
[36:01] things
[36:02] I mean spoke to the Prophet the Prophet
[36:04] became a scribe
[36:05] he wrote these things down and he knew
[36:07] that there was a people coming that
[36:09] would
[36:09] and offense what was being written so I
[36:12] can tell you that your birth was not a
[36:14] mistake
[36:15] a man your I don't care who say you know
[36:20] you shouldn't have been here whatever
[36:21] not another that none of that matters
[36:23] when you recognize who you are and
[36:25] according to God's plan that none of
[36:28] those other things matter right so I'm
[36:30] trying to help the church see that we
[36:32] are we're coming into something a man
[36:35] and I believe this is a perfect year for
[36:37] us to kind of look at this so I'm going
[36:39] a little further in our fault now I'm
[36:42] not using the title of a step into the
[36:46] vision a man that's my inspiration so
[36:48] we're gonna be in that inspiration for a
[36:50] little bit but the title for today is
[36:53] rejecting the word in your day right
[36:57] rejecting the word in your day all right
[37:01] hallelujah all right so just just bear
[37:04] with me a man I read this scripture here
[37:09] in 1st Kings 19 because it goes along
[37:12] with what the angel spoke to the Prophet
[37:15] in pick up your pen and write and this
[37:19] is another section of just a
[37:22] continuation of where we have been I'm
[37:25] going to start off today by reading from
[37:27] spoken words original seed part 2 but
[37:30] this is this what I read to you is what
[37:33] the angel was saying to brother Branham
[37:34] the original time that he gave this
[37:36] thought to us is out of the message
[37:38] spoken word as original seed then he
[37:40] took it later on and I took the thought
[37:42] and put it inside the church age book as
[37:44] well so in the church age book is
[37:46] dressed up a little bit more but but I
[37:48] wanted to go back to the original time
[37:50] when he was under inspiration in the
[37:52] very first time and brought it to the
[37:54] Turks
[37:56] Oh hallelujah I hope y'all with me hey
[37:59] man so here he says this in spoken words
[38:02] original seed Part 2 it says like Elijah
[38:05] and and just just so that you you know
[38:08] when he spoke spoken word his original
[38:11] seat if I recall correctly this was a
[38:13] six-hour sermon hallelujah it was so
[38:18] long they had to break it up into two
[38:20] services like what we doing eight man
[38:24] right now we were breaking things up in
[38:27] two services but but you know it was it
[38:30] was necessary and needful for the Bride
[38:33] of Christ to hear this spoken word is
[38:37] the original feat even there's there's a
[38:44] message in the title of the sermon right
[38:47] so so here the Prophet is telling us
[38:49] something says like Elijah after that
[38:53] mighty vindicated prophet that the Word
[38:58] of God came to have finished preaching
[39:01] his message to the modern American
[39:05] groups of the first lady with their Bob
[39:09] hares and Jezebel paint groups right God
[39:15] confirming his prophet every time he
[39:19] prophesied hallelujah we even have a
[39:22] prophet that wasn't missing
[39:27] preface it hit the mark glory to God and
[39:33] I know people trying to find all kind of
[39:35] things a man that he missed hearing he
[39:38] mr. muoi studied the message that's one
[39:42] and you just take it what somebody else
[39:44] you need to go back and see what
[39:47] the message says the reason people get
[39:52] all confused and messed up is because
[39:54] they are they leaving today old
[39:56] understanding how study the message for
[40:00] yourself
[40:01] glory to God don't just take what
[40:04] somebody put out on the Internet
[40:06] anybody can put anything on the Internet
[40:10] I was telling somebody you know I'll
[40:13] take that down this for a second I'm
[40:15] coming back you know even without with
[40:16] with all this going on right now with
[40:19] with you know this justice just covet 19
[40:23] right now somebody could go to the
[40:26] Internet and they can say brother Jack
[40:28] got Cohen 19 just like that and you know
[40:32] what folk will be calling folk would be
[40:34] texting phone said brother Jack October
[40:37] night night night they haven't checked
[40:39] the information they just spread it like
[40:42] like wildfire
[40:44] without sure
[40:44] and this is what's happened with people
[40:46] coming against the myth somebody just
[40:48] come up with something that they begin
[40:50] to spread you know why spec because you
[40:52] had a spirit
[40:54] [Music]
[40:55] [Applause]
[41:04] [Applause]
[41:16] [Applause]
[41:20] it's a spirit that causes people to do
[41:23] this
[41:24] amen and that's why I don't come against
[41:27] a person I come against the spirit I got
[41:32] a faith for the person so my god alright
[41:40] let me just kind of keep going on
[41:42] because I look at what the the angel
[41:44] sings hallelujah glory to God so you
[41:48] won't find it like this and in the
[41:50] church textbook that's why I had to go
[41:52] back to spoken word is the original seed
[41:55] and I'm reading again a man it says like
[41:58] he larger after that mighty vindicated
[42:02] prophet that the Word of God came to
[42:05] have finished preaching his message to
[42:08] the modern American groups of the first
[42:10] lady with their bobbed heads a man and
[42:16] Jezebel paint groups
[42:19] God confirming his prophet every time he
[42:24] prophesied it was for truth amen look at
[42:29] this now God had to call him off the
[42:34] field until he played that generation
[42:39] with mighty please very early at a young
[42:52] age and a young age God called a prophet
[42:56] all right all the field amen
[42:58] yeah leave that generation with my tea
[43:01] please
[43:02] and if we not experiencing one of the
[43:04] mighty plates of any generation the
[43:07] whole world was shut down entire world
[43:11] that's a plague a man if said Julia
[43:15] playing that generation with mighty
[43:17] bleeds for rejecting the message of its
[43:20] profit Oh hallelujah you know this thing
[43:22] that's just it's just I can't help I'm
[43:25] looking through prophetic insight we
[43:27] know the role that that Rome place a man
[43:31] according to Scripture we know that
[43:33] brother Branham brought things out to us
[43:36] they may had a quarter in revelation 17
[43:37] 18 and all that we know we're wrong
[43:40] place and earlier we were watching how
[43:43] they would just tell us that up smoke
[43:45] cases of kovat and and and Italy there
[43:48] there was anywhere but for somehow a man
[43:52] they stopped talking about that because
[43:55] you want to know where no we're not
[43:57] aware of where the most cases are found
[43:59] in your country and the Prophet told us
[44:03] that there was a hope that would come
[44:06] from your country hallelujah we better
[44:10] watch these things a man the Catholic
[44:13] Church is very involved in health care
[44:15] all right let's just keep our eyes on
[44:18] some things a man not not to not to be
[44:21] in fear glory to God but but understand
[44:24] prophecies about to be forfeit son the
[44:27] brother Branham spoke about somebody put
[44:29] out a quote just yesterday showed up
[44:30] brother Branham talked about we're gonna
[44:32] walk around with masks on our face in a
[44:36] quote he said the planes were coming to
[44:38] people you're walking around with Mac's
[44:40] with masks on the face are we doing it
[44:41] the brothers saying we would do it Oh
[44:44] hallelujah glory to God
[44:47] alright let's keep going hey man he says
[44:50] God sent him into the wilderness and
[44:53] hiding not even the king could call him
[44:56] out and them that tried to persuade him
[44:59] against the will of God died for doing
[45:03] so he says Oh God
[45:06] that's what the prophecy say since but
[45:10] when God spoke to his faithful prophet
[45:12] by a vision this is it out of the
[45:17] wilderness he come with us says the Lord
[45:19] what did he do straight to the word back
[45:22] to the word he went but brought the 12
[45:25] stones and rolled them together now
[45:27] there's a lot that was staying in that
[45:29] particular quote that over time we're
[45:32] gonna try to work and get it all out a
[45:34] man but but I just want to just kind of
[45:37] go look at this desk that's the let me
[45:39] just put that that's the foundation of
[45:41] my thought that particular quote is the
[45:43] foundation of my thought but let's go on
[45:45] a little further we're talking about
[45:47] rejecting the work in your day now let's
[45:49] go to this next quote out of the
[45:50] unpardonable sin hey hallelujah glory
[45:54] glory glory glory since now we know one
[45:58] thing now look here he says here's the
[46:01] whole captain off of every verse in the
[46:05] Bible we'll just take it in a few
[46:07] minutes to show to show you that every
[46:10] place it was spoke of of the
[46:12] unpardonable unpardonable sin it says
[46:16] the power comes over here to cap it off
[46:19] percent if we sin willfully after we
[46:24] have received the knowledge of the truth
[46:27] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[46:29] sin now you need to understand that that
[46:31] that verse that brother branham's
[46:33] quoting here Paul said if we sin
[46:35] willfully after receiving knowledge of
[46:39] the truth now we got it we got to inject
[46:42] here you don't even have to receive the
[46:45] truth
[47:01] watch in onesearch read to say the
[47:06] profits a knowledge of the truth and if
[47:11] you reject that you're in a dangerous
[47:15] position all right let's keep going
[47:18] let's keep going
[47:19] it says if we sin willfully after we
[47:24] receive the knowledge of the truth there
[47:26] remaineth no more sacrifice for sin then
[47:29] that's got to be the unpardonable sin
[47:31] it's sinning willfully you know coz back
[47:34] then you know they would say uh you know
[47:37] if you murdered somebody if you if you
[47:39] had an abortion or something like that
[47:40] that was the part unpardonable sin but
[47:42] uh I mean my lord how some brothers put
[47:46] out a statement yesterday you know
[47:49] there's so many things that we we
[47:50] quantify as they're part of the stand
[47:52] now brothers put up some quote on on a
[47:56] baby being born out of wedlock right and
[47:59] we would say that's not a pardonable and
[48:02] brought out of us see when he had
[48:04] preached about it because the scripture
[48:06] tested a baby that's born awake for ten
[48:08] generations they not supposed to be able
[48:10] to come to the house of law can you
[48:11] imagine that
[48:11] Tim generate that child cannot come to
[48:14] the house of God there are children's
[48:16] children didn't even do anything wrong
[48:18] could come to the house of God but ten
[48:20] generations it was that way he said for
[48:23] the RAM said he didn't have nothing to
[48:24] get rid of that scene he said by the
[48:27] blood of Jesus Christ don't don't leave
[48:30] us in that conditioning more that's why
[48:32] don't transfer it on this blood that's
[48:33] right you don't realize how this black
[48:35] this black this black second generations
[48:38] free
[48:39] right to the races been set free by the
[48:42] blood
[48:43] one mistake has a Pentecost in
[48:46] generations not to be able to come a
[48:48] church right but the blood crisis that
[48:51] set us free from there I say well I what
[48:53] a blessing when we really begin to think
[48:55] about this you know but they was going
[48:57] on trying to find out what was the the
[48:59] sin that was done partible right but
[49:01] brother Branham say the sinners are
[49:03] partners when we sin wilfully they met
[49:05] after receiving miles of the truth and
[49:08] then we turn it down we stand in
[49:10] willfully now watch this he comes over
[49:12] says it says then that's got to be an
[49:15] honorable standard sitting willfully is
[49:17] that right he next steps will flee now
[49:19] what is then the next thing you have to
[49:22] find out what sin is look at what they
[49:24] say sin is disobedience sin is rejecting
[49:31] I love that you know I am I am watched
[49:36] people walk away from the words amen but
[49:39] even in there and I want to put a
[49:42] dismemberment I want to use this term in
[49:44] their so-called sinful condition amen
[49:49] they weren't going to church they was
[49:50] doing whatever they want to do they
[49:52] so-called sinful condition but yet on
[49:55] the inside of them they still have a
[49:57] respect for the message
[50:02] [Music]
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:13] [Music]
[50:20] [Music]
[50:21] [Applause]
[50:37] I'll bring them out of their conditions
[50:39] - hallelujah you're gonna be surprised
[50:41] what God does watch this he says sin is
[50:44] disobedience sin is rejecting now
[50:47] looking at a person now here's because
[50:49] normally says since I have a place here
[50:51] I want to show you the first place of
[50:54] this Scofield here when he wrote in the
[50:56] footnote here
[50:57] I believe it's found in Romans the third
[50:58] chapter and this verse that he's
[51:02] referring to a Roma Street says all have
[51:04] sinned and come short of the glory of
[51:07] God right all have sinned and come short
[51:10] of the glory of God that I nobody can
[51:13] point a finger and nobody else amen
[51:15] every one of us have sinned and come
[51:17] short of the glory of God and that is
[51:21] the descripton as he that is referring
[51:22] to it and if Scofield knows he says I
[51:25] believe miss found in Romans 1/3 Chapman
[51:28] he said here as he interpreted through
[51:30] western course in the footnotes he said
[51:32] sin sin is rejecting the revealed will
[51:39] of God Oh glory to God sin is rejecting
[51:45] the revealed will of God when we're
[51:49] seeing is in its initial form if to
[51:52] reject the revealed Word of God Oh will
[51:57] of God when God has revealed something
[51:59] as his will and to reject that is to
[52:04] blaspheme or to reject God do you
[52:09] understand
[52:10] you got nothing to the truth you got
[52:12] knowledge that God to the Prophet but
[52:14] you men you
[52:15] own determination to reject it that's
[52:18] blasphemy
[52:19] now you know and I'm gonna go a little
[52:21] further you can still keep going to
[52:23] church you can steal amen jicama side
[52:28] hallelujah you can still come outside I
[52:31] wanna see all right amen so so so
[52:41] Vincent this is very serious what we're
[52:43] talking about here says you might even
[52:46] have signs and wonders for your ministry
[52:48] but you still have black speaking
[52:53] rejected his revealed wheel and rejected
[52:56] his revealed word now watch this it says
[52:58] what was the first scene let's look at
[53:01] it says you go back here in Genesis 3
[53:03] you may read it when you get home if you
[53:05] want to Genesis 3 when God with the
[53:08] Garden of Eden but Adam and Eve in there
[53:10] he told them things that that was his
[53:13] word that they could do with things they
[53:15] could not do so it's now watch when
[53:18] Satan come to Eve he said God hath said
[53:21] thou shalt not eat thereof but surely
[53:24] thou shall not die see ya then Eve
[53:27] willfully you can eat willfully doing
[53:30] something that she knew God said not to
[53:33] do is that right now look at it when Eve
[53:36] willfully the first sin that was ever
[53:38] committed is that right he willfully
[53:41] knowing the will of God and review sir
[53:44] doing is that right that's the first
[53:48] scene now you know I just I just kind of
[53:51] wanted to just stop there on that
[53:53] particular quote because brother Branham
[53:55] has laid it out the first sin that has
[53:58] actually hit the earth is when Eve
[54:00] willfully disobeys the revealed Word of
[54:04] God God says don't eat up this tree
[54:07] don't do this don't do that it's saying
[54:09] the very time that eat actually when I
[54:12] guess the reveal Word of God this was
[54:15] not this one this one
[54:16] mr. e can I put it that way this was not
[54:19] something that was hard for her to
[54:21] follow what happened is that Eve took
[54:23] another revelation read except that
[54:27] somebody else's interpretation and if I
[54:30] can Amen we can just be honest many
[54:32] folks today have accepted somebody
[54:36] else's interpretation of the world Oh
[54:39] hallelujah
[54:40] man I was I was looking at a scripture
[54:43] just yesterday just kind of meditating
[54:46] on this you know when Jesus died and
[54:49] rose again there was two stories that
[54:52] went out amen
[54:55] one was through the disciples that Jesus
[54:57] was risen a man and they began to go
[55:00] from disciple to disciple expressing
[55:03] that Jesus was risen and he would appear
[55:06] to those that had believed he was risen
[55:08] but you know they are the leaders
[55:10] religious leaders of that day the
[55:13] Pharisees the Sadducees they came up
[55:16] with a story and not only did they come
[55:18] over the story they paid soldiers to
[55:21] tell the story
[55:25] disciples stole the body from the - and
[55:28] we know secured you with that story
[55:46] [Music]
[55:54] [Applause]
[56:10] [Music]
[56:26] [Music]
[56:31] people like that influence and I'm
[56:36] keeping my eye on the Word of God the
[56:39] reveal worked
[56:51] Eve got mixed up because she walked away
[56:54] from the revealed Word she made a
[56:56] decision based on somebody else's
[56:58] interpretation hallelujah and so you can
[57:02] get our mixed up if you listen to
[57:03] somebody else's interpretation can
[57:06] actually question what has God shown you
[57:09] si si si si si can you do one mixed up
[57:12] only everybody else interpretation when
[57:15] Jesus asked him a question specifically
[57:17] he said first a good question who do men
[57:20] say that I am a son of man him now
[57:23] though Jesus student been talking about
[57:25] Jesus to death the disciples were
[57:28] hearing against some other reports in
[57:30] the length
[57:31] jesus knew all that he said who wouldn't
[57:33] mean say Oh some say Jeremiah no no
[57:36] imagine this if you if they're in
[57:38] conversation they hear one person say he
[57:40] chair your mind they heard somebody say
[57:42] he is a witch somebody that they got all
[57:46] types of conversations going I saw it
[57:49] wasn't say forget about what they said
[57:51] who do you say that son of man and when
[57:55] it got down to a personal question they
[57:57] had to give a personal answer Peters say
[57:59] that what the Christ the Son of God is
[58:03] saying let's start last time on my own
[58:04] flesh and blood your conversations
[58:07] didn't reveal this to you what you've
[58:10] been talking about a man in the chat
[58:12] room reveal this to you
[58:17] [Music]
[58:23] [Music]
[58:24] no can take it from glory glory stay
[58:32] with me here glory to God
[58:35] watch this now I want you to understand
[58:37] something since the beginning of
[58:41] creation the revealed word has been
[58:45] presented and people have an opportunity
[58:48] to accept it or reject it now remember
[58:52] amen my scripture my foundation is here
[58:55] on the first Kings 19 because in that
[58:58] day when God said the property lines on
[59:01] the scene they had no they had the
[59:03] opportunity to accept the revealed word
[59:05] or to reject the revealed word now I
[59:08] want you to understand something this is
[59:11] really bad for these people because uh
[59:15] I'm read to you out of first King 19 but
[59:18] to understand how they got that you need
[59:20] to understand first Kings 18 and the
[59:23] first James 18 there was a mighty
[59:26] demonstration where God answered by fire
[59:30] enlightened champion he said God answers
[59:34] by fire let hear me God
[59:38] they challenged the search
[1:01:23] Oh God glory to God but I mean this
[1:02:14] right between to peace when we say look
[1:02:18] we top of this young server would turn
[1:02:21] to bring our back to the one true Living

[1:02:44] that what you got is nothing I want to

[1:03:43] thing he got 12 stones brother Ed say he
[1:03:45] repented the Bible say he he he he
[1:03:47] repaired the altar and took a stone for
[1:03:50] each tribe and he put he put the halter
[1:03:52] back together to say now now he said I
[1:03:54] put some water down there grit to it
[1:03:57] water say put water down there game do
[1:04:01] it a third time make sure that by
[1:04:03] getting up I mean if I you getting extra
[1:04:06] water usually water gonna put it out but
[1:04:08] I said do it a third time I'll show
[1:04:09] y'all that my dog and say Lord now I've
[1:04:11] done things at your work it's my vision
[1:04:14] you showed me to come here do this now
[1:04:16] that you work now God show them that you
[1:04:20] are the God of Israel and I mean it when
[1:04:23] he said a man fire King and consume not
[1:04:26] only evil actions altar but it also
[1:04:29] consumed their all time it was proven
[1:04:36] that this was a God of Israel but you
[1:04:39] know other people even after agreeing
[1:04:41] turned and walked away I want to destroy
[1:04:47] you some I'm coming back to all that
[1:04:48] destiny with me that's our that's our
[1:04:50] foundation the revealed Word of God has
[1:04:53] been given to man since the very
[1:04:56] creation of man Adam had it he had it he
[1:05:01] projected it the reveal
[1:05:03] wheel and word of God he projected it a
[1:05:06] man Adam himself took on what you gave
[1:05:09] him
[1:05:09] and
[1:05:10] protected it and it created all the
[1:05:12] problem that's why we're dealing with
[1:05:13] Kovac right now a little bit because of
[1:05:16] what they need at the beginning but we
[1:05:17] can't just leave it on our leave we also
[1:05:19] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:05:22] glory of God so we all have something to
[1:05:24] do with this right now now that revealed
[1:05:26] word was given to Adam revealed Word was
[1:05:29] given to Eve I even looked at the days
[1:05:31] of Noah the revealed Word was given a
[1:05:33] man here they had the opportunity to get
[1:05:36] into the ark God God giving it and I
[1:05:39] want to tell you I've got a little hole
[1:05:41] here that I was sharing you know God
[1:05:42] brought Noah after 120 years of
[1:05:45] preaching the revealed word hallelujah
[1:05:48] and then the will of God for that day
[1:05:50] was get in this boat because Amen
[1:05:54] hallelujah and if you don't get it
[1:05:58] destruction is coming if you're not in
[1:05:59] the book everybody outside of the boat
[1:06:02] go die so the review of God get in the
[1:06:06] boat 120 years of preaching the same
[1:06:09] sermon over and over and over again now
[1:06:12] you know when Noah this famine finally
[1:06:15] got above God sealed it up now at that
[1:06:17] time it took seven more days before the
[1:06:20] rain came now what we call that is a
[1:06:23] lapse of time and then the lapse of time
[1:06:26] what God is doing is still trying to
[1:06:28] give grace to somebody do you realize
[1:06:32] the rapture it's already past I mean it
[1:06:35] should have happened a long time ago for
[1:06:36] the relative but the reason that has not
[1:06:39] because God is trying to give crazy to
[1:06:42] somebody I said Lord let it be one of my
[1:06:45] family members walked away from from the
[1:06:51] Word of God Jim Gray sokar's
[1:06:53] Amen if there's ever a time to pray that
[1:06:57] time is right now Church the revealed
[1:07:00] Word was given in North State they had
[1:07:02] it they rejected it they tried the
[1:07:05] revealed Word was given in Moses day and
[1:07:08] those that did not apply the blood amen
[1:07:11] the way the Prophet told them to apply
[1:07:14] it I want to make sure we got that now
[1:07:16] you know what and Moses takes somebody
[1:07:19] else coulda came up and said you know I
[1:07:21] know Moses said put it on the on the top
[1:07:25] of the door ain't man on the size of the
[1:07:27] door it on the top of the door but the
[1:07:29] Lord showed me just put a bucket at my
[1:07:32] door hallelujah and not now now if it
[1:07:36] was not according to what the Prophet
[1:07:38] said you don't listen to it I hope you
[1:07:59] church and the revealed Word came in
[1:08:02] Moses day they had to do it exactly the
[1:08:04] way homes are said do it otherwise there
[1:08:05] was gonna be death to the firstborn son
[1:08:07] how the revealed word came in John the
[1:08:11] Baptist day how where he's calling the
[1:08:14] people to repentance amen and what they
[1:08:17] need to do is be obedient to what John's
[1:08:19] message was and if they were being here
[1:08:22] can I put it this way if they will beat
[1:08:24] into John's message it was gonna be very
[1:08:26] easy for them to receive Jesus if they
[1:08:30] disobeyed it could not receive John's
[1:08:33] message how would they be able to
[1:08:35] receive Jesus can I go a little further
[1:08:37] how you gonna make a rapture itacare
[1:08:42] receive the message for this thing
[1:08:44] Oh hallelujah somebody the reveal word
[1:08:48] has been given and every day the
[1:08:50] revealed word was presented in Paul's
[1:08:52] day Paul was trying to get the people to
[1:08:55] see this Jesus was a manifestation of
[1:08:57] Old Testament scripture the things that
[1:08:59] they have been holding on to for year
[1:09:01] after year after year the sprinklers
[1:09:04] that they were problem hearing Jesus has
[1:09:06] manifested he's living out the
[1:09:08] scriptures and Paul trying to bring them
[1:09:10] to the revealed Word for their name they
[1:09:12] rejected it Paul said we call to the
[1:09:14] Gentiles
[1:09:15] can we go a little further the revealed
[1:09:18] Word was given an Iranian state the
[1:09:21] revealed Word was given in mark's dan
[1:09:23] colombo luther wesley and the revealed
[1:09:27] word has been given in our date the
[1:09:30] legacy in church ain't hallelujah people
[1:09:33] and every age have had the opportunity
[1:09:36] to either inject the reveal work i
[1:09:39] didn't say the word I said the reveal
[1:09:42] worked there's a difference there
[1:09:45] because see their search scriptures that
[1:09:47] I promise for your day hallelujah in the
[1:09:50] days of Jesus there were certain
[1:09:51] scriptures that Jesus was fulfilling but
[1:09:54] the Pharisees and Sadducees was missing
[1:09:55] the fulfillment but but history has a
[1:09:58] strange way of repeating itself because
[1:10:01] people are still missing scripture for
[1:10:04] their day Oh glory glory glory people
[1:10:09] have the opportunity either reject it or
[1:10:11] accept it now let's let's go a little
[1:10:12] further here I want to say Eve but the
[1:10:18] Prophet just told us that Eve willfully
[1:10:20] no wonder whether God refused to do it
[1:10:22] she rejected she fell in scene now she
[1:10:26] rejected the revealing word
[1:10:27] the Lord just kind of gave me this no
[1:10:30] thought the spirit of rejecting revealed
[1:10:34] word passed from Eve to her son
[1:10:41] because Cain was not Adams son I hope
[1:10:47] you whip in church the spirit that II
[1:10:51] manifested extra passed down to us on
[1:10:54] the Bible say she was the mother of all
[1:10:56] living but it did say that about Alan
[1:10:58] now there's so much more we can say that
[1:11:00] hallelujah they did not eat a banana
[1:11:02] they do not eat an apple and get
[1:11:04] pregnant
[1:11:05] Cragen's the Lord somebody a man I don't
[1:11:08] know what after you eating that got
[1:11:09] people pray amen
[1:11:11] so let's stop teaching that in the
[1:11:13] church hallelujah Amen we know how
[1:11:16] people get pregnant
[1:11:17] glory to God thank God he sent us a
[1:11:19] prophet to share the truth with a man
[1:11:44] you better hear now was not an apple and
[1:11:46] man it was a toll tree that adultery
[1:11:50] occur with the serpent and with Eve the
[1:11:54] surface stood on two feet praise God a
[1:11:57] man before he was Kirsten but on his
[1:11:59] belly he stood on two feet and when you
[1:12:01] read Genesis 3 you can see the star
[1:12:03] would have the ability to reason
[1:12:12] but yet he existed and cops what we had
[1:12:14] happened in the beginning that's why God
[1:12:17] gave out the punishments the chakra was
[1:12:20] included yes you think God just peaked
[1:12:22] on the surface no he was included Satan
[1:12:25] I know I didn't the serpent to do what
[1:12:27] he needs
[1:12:28] hey man all right praise the Lord and
[1:12:32] that's why the Bible said Cain was up
[1:12:34] that wicked one first job 3:12 who was
[1:12:37] the wicked one it was Satan in the
[1:12:39] serpent serving to have a serpent even
[1:12:48] Jesus Jesus
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:22] [Applause]
[1:13:25] Oh give me the desires of my heart
[1:13:40] hallelujah but then pigs did not even
[1:13:44] have a choice was that they're doing
[1:13:45] that matter the old business no no no
[1:13:47] did an actual don't know don't know
[1:13:50] possession or nothing but here they got
[1:13:52] possessed by demons and women jumped off
[1:13:55] a cliff so the devil take over whatever
[1:13:58] he came you're getting a dog you're
[1:14:02] getting a cat sometimes you got to find
[1:14:05] praise the Lord somebody you got to bind
[1:14:08] the enemy you don't know how to double
[1:14:10] jump into that Hanuman did they're
[1:14:11] trying to bring home to you as a son of
[1:14:15] God you got authority over the
[1:14:18] environment that you eaten Oh stay with
[1:14:23] me please look at look at this I want to
[1:14:30] see this I want to see this so the
[1:14:34] spirit of radicular be a word passed
[1:14:36] from E to us Thunder came it went the
[1:14:40] can a man and we see it clearly because
[1:14:44] Cain had the opportunity when he was
[1:14:46] bringing his sacrifice to the Lord and I
[1:14:49] got some things here I can read it for
[1:14:52] you but maybe I'm trying to just share
[1:14:53] it brother Graham said Cain was a
[1:14:55] believer I got a call on him y'all need
[1:14:58] me to read I read it's been the message
[1:15:00] fellowship through reconciliation Cain
[1:15:02] he said was not an infidel give a give
[1:15:07] me a paragraph he 35 then he 35 I'll
[1:15:10] make sure that because somebody might
[1:15:11] say
[1:15:15] yeah he was a believer Oh hallelujah
[1:15:20] there's a lot that can be said look at
[1:15:22] this with the prophecy he says right
[1:15:30] there
[1:15:30] if only belonging the church is all God
[1:15:33] requires of a sinner to do penance
[1:15:37] belonging to the church God would be
[1:15:40] unjust to receive Abel and to reject
[1:15:43] King so see your worship ain't it
[1:15:45] discs of man we got a we got a powerful
[1:15:49] worship experience what about the word
[1:15:57] glory said to receive Anglin to reject
[1:16:00] cain both of them had a church came and
[1:16:03] ate my hat searches look at this it says
[1:16:05] then I'm not only that but can come and
[1:16:08] offer the sacrifice if sacrifice was all
[1:16:12] that God required us see that means
[1:16:15] you'll say well I'm gonna pay my tithes
[1:16:16] with my often required spirits it says
[1:16:27] I've sacrificed with all the other parts
[1:16:29] he'd be unjust to condemn Cain not only
[1:16:33] that but Cain was not a infidel Cain was
[1:16:37] a believer he says he was trying to find
[1:16:41] a reconciliation witness and Cain now
[1:16:45] honey you got to get this in your mind
[1:16:47] and then came to sit that is all to
[1:16:50] kneel down humbly trying to get God to
[1:16:53] come on the scene he wanna feel the
[1:16:54] Spirit of God came into him everything
[1:16:57] that he needs to do look at this now
[1:16:59] there I'm humbly raised up his hands oh
[1:17:01] yeah
[1:17:05] it sprays sincerely wrong churches amen
[1:17:26] it might be sincere but it sincerely
[1:17:29] wrong God look at people sincere he does
[1:17:34] he certainly does and you know what if
[1:17:36] you'd really that sincere God will bring
[1:17:38] him out of that situation not only not
[1:17:41] just bring you out he will present truth
[1:17:44] to you now here's another thing God
[1:17:47] ain't gonna force you to accept truth
[1:17:50] all he does is present it to you and you
[1:17:54] have to be the one to see that I'm gonna
[1:17:56] take it i'ma reject it
[1:17:58] now Canaan all this in Syria rejected
[1:18:01] truth since it leaked out he was trying
[1:18:10] to find wreckage this came down humbly
[1:18:12] raised up his hands and worship the Lord
[1:18:15] he was not a communist neither was he an
[1:18:18] infidel he was a believer but he didn't
[1:18:21] have the spiritual revelation look at
[1:18:25] that look at that says it when Abel I
[1:18:28] can imagine seeing Cain decorate the
[1:18:29] altar fine little isn't making it pretty
[1:18:31] all dolled up as we call it that's the
[1:18:34] way people think to think if they can
[1:18:35] build a great big church that I outshine
[1:18:39] the rest of them plus the seats put a
[1:18:41] $10,000 pipe organ in it and a crucifix
[1:18:44] all around it all over it they think
[1:18:46] that God will be pleased with that God
[1:18:48] ain't pleased with the works of the
[1:18:49] hands of man they're shifting sands now
[1:18:53] here Cain had the opportunity at this
[1:18:56] time because you know when he realized
[1:18:58] God was not accepting the sacrifice I
[1:19:00] mean audience with God direct
[1:19:04] communication with God God coming up
[1:19:06] said King you know how everything like
[1:19:08] this is not what I'm looking for King
[1:19:09] but maybe just give me the same
[1:19:11] thing your brother just gave me I'll
[1:19:13] take that king
[1:19:15] okay I'll be so happy with that all I
[1:19:17] need you to just keep in the same thing
[1:19:19] your brother this game rather than King
[1:19:21] just get up and give the same thing his
[1:19:23] brother game man blood all over me
[1:19:28] you're gonna take these proof these
[1:19:31] vegetables I know how can you accept my
[1:19:37] offering you know I'm gonna get you to
[1:19:40] accept my offer
[1:19:40] my brother will not be going to church
[1:19:42] anymore
[1:19:44] what I'm gonna do is kill his church so
[1:19:53] so that spirit still exists because you
[1:19:56] know your arcade what he did was rise up
[1:19:58] and actually killed his brother
[1:20:00] physically but today you ain't gotta
[1:20:01] kill physically brother branham said you
[1:20:04] can take a knife and stabbed in your
[1:20:07] brother's back just by talking about him
[1:20:10] if you kill his character you guilty of
[1:20:16] murder
[1:20:18] Laura my god right hey man we gotta be
[1:20:22] careful you know we can't we can't lose
[1:20:25] respect for how God has sent his
[1:20:28] foreigner can I put it that way
[1:20:30] we can't lose respect for that you know
[1:20:32] in the days of Elijah you want to know
[1:20:35] why children died she bears coming ate
[1:20:38] them up then we're calling the Elijah
[1:20:41] Oh ball head going up yeah your master
[1:20:44] winner why don't you go on up relevant
[1:20:45] upset and reasonable kids was in this
[1:20:47] condition is because of what they
[1:20:49] parents was saying in the house now you
[1:20:52] don't read that in the Bible but it is
[1:20:58] houses welcome to them kids they were
[1:21:01] under the influence of their parents can
[1:21:04] I tell you something some kids right now
[1:21:06] all messed up because of their parents
[1:21:11] parent delete a lot of the young people
[1:21:22] that's messed up today if you first if
[1:21:24] you really see them talking of them
[1:21:26] young people they have problems with
[1:21:27] their parents that's where the issue was
[1:21:32] it wasn't the message there wasn't a
[1:21:35] message they having a problem to message
[1:21:36] now they blame it on the message but
[1:21:38] they had a problem with their parents
[1:21:40] sometimes you know things are not
[1:21:42] explained properly I know many of people
[1:21:47] that's been told brother ran up said
[1:21:49] that's why we do it can you show me
[1:21:52] where he said it and then they got
[1:21:54] nowhere to produce where you said it
[1:21:56] they just heard a preacher say it so
[1:21:58] you're not listening to the message for
[1:21:59] yourself but if your parent a big cookie
[1:22:02] somewhere said we're right here where he
[1:22:03] said that's why we do it right here is
[1:22:06] where the Bible said that's why we do it
[1:22:07] right if you can if you can do that with
[1:22:09] my kids they don't have a problem
[1:22:11] receiving them
[1:22:12] well you just kind of making it up as
[1:22:14] you go see now you what you're doing is
[1:22:19] using the message as a tool to put
[1:22:23] somebody under your thumb
[1:22:25] and you just quote things and they ain't
[1:22:29] even gotta be there brother Adam said
[1:22:30] just show me where soon you see it's a
[1:22:34] whole bunch of men just either show me
[1:22:44] where it said I'll just play me to take
[1:22:46] anything give me anything but what
[1:22:49] happened is that we don't use that so
[1:22:51] long then the kids will not see n say
[1:22:53] what you say before he ain't saying the
[1:22:55] way you say rise up with rebellion
[1:23:00] can I tell y'all my god every billion
[1:23:03] caused it and reject even even wider
[1:23:09] worship even one day they going to
[1:23:12] church they doing all kind of stuff it
[1:23:14] is a lot of helpless say they get to a
[1:23:17] spot where they they just don't know
[1:23:18] where to go and I'll start because
[1:23:20] parent delinquency alright so let me go
[1:23:24] a little further here you know the word
[1:23:28] was given in everything we look at was
[1:23:30] we could see the revealed word was given
[1:23:32] every day and you had the opportunity to
[1:23:34] accept or reject a king did not accept
[1:23:37] the reveal where he rejected it and that
[1:23:39] created more problems for him a man a
[1:23:42] man
[1:23:42] but even then came rejected it I mean
[1:23:45] the grace of God just some powerful okay
[1:23:49] so you know when I leave the garden I
[1:23:50] got this mark on me and everybody
[1:23:53] I mean I said they say no you say
[1:23:55] everybody don't know what I did and they
[1:23:57] go they gonna come and kill me now put a
[1:23:59] mark on them so that they wouldn't kill
[1:24:01] that Greece was still covering pain
[1:24:06] y'all can now get this grace was
[1:24:09] covering a serpent seat
[1:24:16] if grace can come up a serpent's
[1:24:23] seat don't you think grace don't coming
[1:24:27] up I don't care what they've done grace
[1:24:35] can pull them out of wherever they are
[1:24:37] oh she uses let's go on let's go a
[1:24:44] little bit more in history Israel
[1:24:46] rejected the message for their day they
[1:24:50] rejected their messenger and they had to
[1:24:53] wait for deliverance and what brother
[1:24:55] Brett was saying says you know and I
[1:24:57] want to read this this coming up out of
[1:24:58] water from the rock but what he was
[1:25:00] saying is that when Moses came on the
[1:25:02] scene and Moses killed at one Egyptian
[1:25:04] it was time for deliverance at that time
[1:25:07] God was ready to deliver but because
[1:25:10] when Moses stepped out the Nexen killing
[1:25:11] Egyptian next to each son brothers
[1:25:13] argued and frightened and maybe one was
[1:25:15] given Killian Tracy say brothers don't
[1:25:17] do that the fella that was get rid of
[1:25:19] killing his partner he say uh-oh
[1:25:21] you're gonna kill me like you did the
[1:25:22] Egyptian he say who who made you God all
[1:25:25] of us and they take they begin to reject
[1:25:27] Moses at that time which caused Moses to
[1:25:29] leave Egypt and they had to wait 40
[1:25:32] years because of rejection I wonder if
[1:25:36] we've been waiting because of protection
[1:25:41] look at what the prophets say here water
[1:25:44] from the rock it says so Moses this
[1:25:47] great warrior in the time now that God
[1:25:51] had promised Abraham that in this great
[1:25:53] long-suffering that somebody the people
[1:25:55] would search on for 400 years of
[1:25:58] strength left so when Moses was born he
[1:26:00] was actually stepping into a vision God
[1:26:02] gave Abraham the vision gave him the
[1:26:05] promise Moses was born to fulfill that
[1:26:08] promise
[1:26:09] glory amen the people was so drunk for
[1:26:12] 400 years in a strange land and during
[1:26:14] this time remember there there was a
[1:26:17] lapse of time listen right close a
[1:26:19] minute there was a lapse of time it
[1:26:22] wasn't exactly 400 years it was 420
[1:26:26] years because
[1:26:27] the condition of the people Moses came
[1:26:31] in the right time to bring the people
[1:26:34] out but they rejected the messenger I
[1:26:39] love this I love this quote I love the
[1:26:42] thought behind it they rejected the
[1:26:44] messenger but you know what that's a
[1:26:45] message that they rejected came right
[1:26:48] back around for them to receive can I
[1:26:50] say it like this
[1:26:51] there's many to think that I rejected
[1:26:53] the message but that message is coming
[1:26:55] right back for them to receive oh so I
[1:27:04] tell you another 40 is a lapse of time
[1:27:06] which made it run over four hundred and
[1:27:08] twenty years the same thing it was in an
[1:27:10] antediluvian world the time was already
[1:27:13] set in hand but through the
[1:27:14] long-suffering some of Noah got into
[1:27:16] that art in them seven days was there
[1:27:18] that was the long-suffering of God went
[1:27:20] to somebody all they had to do is come
[1:27:22] knock on the door they waited too late
[1:27:24] they waited for the rain to fall before
[1:27:26] they came but if they just came before
[1:27:28] the rain for I believe God would open
[1:27:30] the door the lone suffering amen God's
[1:27:34] not willing that any should perish but
[1:27:36] that all might come to repentance see
[1:27:38] the lapse of time in the end of them
[1:27:40] enter the Libyan destruction see the
[1:27:41] lapse of time in the delivering of the
[1:27:43] children Israel so I want you to catch
[1:27:45] it close down listen now give him a
[1:27:48] worse treat don't say brother Branham
[1:27:49] said Jesus should have come but I
[1:27:51] believe that the coming of the Lord
[1:27:53] Christ the Lord the coming of Christ is
[1:27:56] past dude way past due after all the
[1:27:59] theologians and everything knowing it
[1:28:01] must be in a certain time I think well
[1:28:03] after the prophets could set and say
[1:28:05] it'll be sometime within within that
[1:28:07] period of time and they missed it the
[1:28:09] reason that they missed it it's because
[1:28:11] of the long-suffering of God rather
[1:28:13] random said in 1977 he says I predict
[1:28:18] not prophesy 1977 and people say the
[1:28:22] message is wrong because brother
[1:28:23] predicting their coming past no no this
[1:28:25] is not wrong it's the long-suffering of
[1:28:28] God y'all didn't catch that imma have to
[1:28:35] say it a different way
[1:28:36] i'ma have to say it a different way it
[1:28:39] may look like a prophecy didn't come to
[1:28:41] pass and the reason it looked like a
[1:28:45] prophecy didn't come to pass is because
[1:28:47] of the long-suffering of God
[1:28:52] i'ma just inject this before I read this
[1:28:56] quote I read to use some scripture out
[1:29:00] of first Kings 19 let's go back and just
[1:29:05] read it because those that have a
[1:29:09] problem with looking at the message that
[1:29:13] God sent through his prophet wait
[1:29:15] umbrella as the weather some things he
[1:29:17] said came to pass tonight if you have a
[1:29:19] problem with that then you also
[1:29:22] shouldn't have a problem with the
[1:29:25] scripture that I'm reading look at this
[1:29:30] first Kings 19 verse 15 and the Lord
[1:29:33] said unto him now who said go return on
[1:29:40] our way to the wilderness of Damascus
[1:29:43] now got called into the wilderness right
[1:29:45] and when thou comest I know it has
[1:29:49] yelled to be king of Assyria now I need
[1:29:52] you to understand that that Elijah was
[1:29:56] told by God to North has yelled to me
[1:29:59] king of Assyria but when it came time
[1:30:01] for has he other receivers of Norton
[1:30:04] Elijah did not he like jump
[1:30:12] how come this prophet listening
[1:30:15] I see it's a way that you look at it if
[1:30:19] you've got an intellectual understanding
[1:30:21] you're saying this was the Bible's wrong
[1:30:23] but we got a spirit to understand he see
[1:30:25] the anointing that was only like Jo
[1:30:30] carried over to Elijah it takes
[1:30:49] spiritual revelation to understand
[1:30:50] I see Scripture not a choice questions
[1:30:55] with it see I'm just I don't have time
[1:30:59] to read it all but you can go read it
[1:31:01] just just take these scriptures and
[1:31:02] trace them you'll find that has he yell
[1:31:04] it he can t like shot
[1:31:06] he likes shut told him I was give it
[1:31:08] half not only when I launched October
[1:31:10] said say you know it was it was it was
[1:31:12] something they like she was there and
[1:31:14] then a king of Syria I believe at the
[1:31:16] time sent to your life to say I'm not
[1:31:18] gonna get over this disease they knew
[1:31:20] where God was they came here I should
[1:31:22] say I am I gonna get over the seas and
[1:31:24] say uh said yeah he don't get over you
[1:31:28] like to say yeah he doesn't get over
[1:31:30] they'd like to just start crying and
[1:31:32] then I believe his name was I think
[1:31:36] that's what it's name I'll forgive and
[1:31:38] get all that I but you can get it his
[1:31:40] name he come he say stay up so why are
[1:31:42] you crying because I know what you'd be
[1:31:44] ready to do to the children of Israel
[1:31:46] how
[1:31:50] did I do something like that man Emma
[1:31:54] you say I know what you get ready to do
[1:31:56] they say God showed me that you're gonna
[1:31:58] be king of Syria when he first sent in
[1:32:02] my dog don't do something like that and
[1:32:05] he'd make it right back to the king of
[1:32:07] Syria
[1:32:08] he said What did he say did the prophecy
[1:32:09] ever get wasted yeah you don't get well
[1:32:11] the Prophet said you're gonna get with
[1:32:13] that broth do it to the man but you know
[1:32:15] what this man did when he found out he
[1:32:17] was gonna be king
[1:32:18] he helped God out he actually took a rag
[1:32:22] and put it on the Kings faithless mother
[1:32:24] the man to death so he could he could
[1:32:27] take over the kingdom
[1:32:28] if you got to get it like that you ain't
[1:32:29] gonna keep it long but it was Elijah
[1:32:35] that I'm going to have you not Elijah
[1:32:38] Elisha is already dead
[1:32:43] it's another one in there it's another
[1:32:46] one let's keep reading because if
[1:32:48] anybody tell you that brother Branham
[1:32:50] did fulfill at all let's go back to the
[1:32:52] life of a light can we go here's another
[1:33:02] and Jehu verse 16 and jehu the son of
[1:33:07] nimshi
[1:33:07] shall valinor to be king over israel now
[1:33:10] who told him to anoint table if you read
[1:33:15] your mama you realize that he lied jump
[1:33:18] did not anoint Jingu guess what Eli shut
[1:33:22] did not anoint Jehu but he like sure had
[1:33:25] one of the sons of the prophets
[1:33:27] wonderful one of the boys in school if
[1:33:30] they take this oil and go down there and
[1:33:32] North jinwu so see us how we look at
[1:33:37] things
[1:33:38] hallelujah amen when I see this message
[1:33:41] I see Christ and what I also see is the
[1:33:46] revealed word for my day and I'm just
[1:33:49] walking in the revealed Word for my day
[1:33:51] I refuse to reject the revealed Word I
[1:33:54] malunion all right I'm gonna leave that
[1:33:58] there y'all go back and read it yourself
[1:34:00] and you'll see exactly what I just said
[1:34:02] but I'm saying to this I'm sent to this
[1:34:04] point because there many people have
[1:34:05] want to know but brother Branham seemed
[1:34:07] like some things didn't come and come to
[1:34:08] pass if you can still believe the Bible
[1:34:12] after what I've just read then you ought
[1:34:14] to be able to leave a message
[1:34:15] praise the Lord because God told you to
[1:34:18] do two things and they were never done
[1:34:20] by the Elijah all right now I would say
[1:34:23] if that throw you if that throw you then
[1:34:26] though you have to start questioning
[1:34:27] yourself because Cain was thrown God
[1:34:33] gave them specific word and it just
[1:34:35] threw him time to grow these things I
[1:34:43] have a sincere heart and grunt I will
[1:34:45] stand on myself when these come to a
[1:34:48] fruition I am going to give these to the
[1:34:51] Lord I'm taking in the church I'm gonna
[1:34:52] dedicate them to the Lord just what I'm
[1:34:54] gonna do get dipped to the Church of
[1:34:56] God's I don't want after all the time
[1:35:00] and effort and energy that put it you
[1:35:02] know what I don't want it and what would
[1:35:05] your brother game brother coming up here
[1:35:07] with a plea deal and look at the way
[1:35:09] look at the way he's dressed for the
[1:35:11] church I don't want to dress like that
[1:35:18] cover the church hey man Casey would do
[1:35:21] the same thing I don't want to wear a
[1:35:23] dress going to church I want to wear
[1:35:27] pants furniture too used to be time they
[1:35:28] didn't think about wearing no pants in
[1:35:30] the church sister's a truth in their
[1:35:35] brothers put on your pants
[1:35:38] sisters put on your dress a man but here
[1:35:42] at Kings Island God gave him exactly
[1:35:44] what the Duke but he rejected the reveal
[1:35:46] word but his day he thought he killed
[1:35:49] his brother they did not come down with
[1:35:51] safe see that's what happened you start
[1:36:00] you killed you started lying and I mean
[1:36:03] everything come up right I don't know
[1:36:05] with you see your brother's blood is
[1:36:07] crying up to me from the ground
[1:36:09] you know I kill your brother and all I
[1:36:12] told you to do and this was all over
[1:36:14] worship worship the revelation that he
[1:36:20] had he end up dying for his revelation
[1:36:22] God came rejected never feel worse now
[1:36:29] look at this it's rail rejected the word
[1:36:33] in their day and they rejected not only
[1:36:38] when Moses was coming to them God in the
[1:36:40] late time but even when they got to the
[1:36:41] wilderness they rejected the revealed
[1:36:44] word for their day now let me I got a
[1:36:46] couple more quotes that I think I want
[1:36:47] to read here and then I'll bring this
[1:36:49] home I tell you I'm not going to get all
[1:36:51] the way through this I got motive to
[1:36:53] share but we'll go as far as what want
[1:36:56] us to go for the day in the wilderness
[1:37:00] God had given them the opportunity to go
[1:37:04] into the land see the land that they
[1:37:08] went for forty days and here they come
[1:37:13] back with this report and I mean they're
[1:37:16] carrying evidence from the land on these
[1:37:19] shoulders coming back into the camp with
[1:37:22] evidence showing the people that this is
[1:37:25] a bit like the people saw them grapes
[1:37:28] never seen grapes that big start
[1:37:31] plucking them Greeks giving some
[1:37:33] whatever and it was so big two brothers
[1:37:34] had to carry a cluster put it on I mean
[1:37:37] it was dishes them this was some serious
[1:37:40] bling in so so so here the people not
[1:37:43] anything enjoying the blessings of the
[1:37:45] land they see the fruit of the land
[1:37:47] they're hearing the report of the land
[1:37:49] but went went off the to the two spots
[1:37:51] come with a negative report yeah we got
[1:37:54] evidence but we got this but we got back
[1:37:58] but yeah brother branham did this but
[1:38:03] yeah he said that but no we don't want
[1:38:06] any of that
[1:38:07] amen judges I mean give us what God
[1:38:10] promises that's why I say this comes out
[1:38:13] I'm gonna say it again
[1:38:14] I don't believe the message just because
[1:38:17] it was william branham that came on the
[1:38:20] scene
[1:38:21] now I'm not probably message just
[1:38:23] becomes blinking friendly I'm following
[1:38:25] the message because in scripture I see
[1:38:29] that God said here we've got city lights
[1:38:32] of the Prophet before the coming of the
[1:38:36] dreadful day Lord
[1:38:37] so I'm gonna get that also seeing
[1:38:39] scripture revelation team that the
[1:38:41] mistress of God would be revealed
[1:38:43] amen by the second angel I see that I
[1:38:46] can see a man revelation 3:14 in the
[1:38:49] condition of church as it as a potential
[1:38:51] innocent I see no say so according to
[1:38:55] the scripture God private something I
[1:38:57] believe God from my question isn't from
[1:39:00] the brand was not the wonderful feel
[1:39:01] that you need to give me the person that
[1:39:05] revealed and let me tell you something I
[1:39:07] told you I am rainbow trout I need to
[1:39:10] know that I ain't even know that dinner
[1:39:13] proper told me that you know a rainbow
[1:39:14] trout is they do not go after signs
[1:39:17] wonders and miracles y'all didn't get it
[1:39:22] rainbow trout are not moved that gets
[1:39:26] their attention but they ain't coming
[1:39:28] out the water for that
[1:39:32] you can't catch rainbow trout just for
[1:39:35] the side 1 the me otherwise I'd be gone
[1:39:38] from this church to that truck this one
[1:39:39] for the sign that word is that ain't
[1:39:42] doing none of that
[1:39:43] I said praise God they got him to judge
[1:39:46] the praise God
[1:39:46] what church what what's the name of your
[1:39:48] denomination think I praise God because
[1:39:52] a rainbow no Justin unjust what move
[1:39:55] rainbow trout word review word get the
[1:40:06] rainbow trout every time if you ever
[1:40:08] want to invoke an aid man did you ever
[1:40:12] need 110 give me the words you're gonna
[1:40:14] get to a mess the revealed word just
[1:40:19] give it to now you're gonna get a man
[1:40:21] for me I must a man what I need alright
[1:40:29] alright alright this they think they had
[1:40:32] the opportunity they rejected it and
[1:40:35] here so here's the problem when they
[1:40:38] realized they rejected it they tried to
[1:40:40] make it right
[1:40:41] by going up the next day oh god we'll go
[1:40:44] what we sorry are you presuming that
[1:40:46] you're going up that you're gonna do
[1:40:47] gonna die and they went chasing them
[1:40:50] chasing up the mountain they end up down
[1:40:52] because they went in the wrong time you
[1:40:54] can't go in your time right you have to
[1:40:57] go in God's time can I just read this
[1:41:00] let's try to bring it home here this is
[1:41:02] our message speak to the rock and it
[1:41:04] shall give forth its water so then when
[1:41:09] when they come back they brought this
[1:41:11] brief bunch of grapes and they all
[1:41:12] gather before the congregation of the
[1:41:14] Lord and they brought a report
[1:41:15] Oh God has told the truth
[1:41:19] the land is flowing milk and honey it's
[1:41:21] a good land as the land of seed and
[1:41:22] it'll it'll grow anything I've been
[1:41:25] there and I know what the promise that
[1:41:27] he is exactly right I saw I saw
[1:41:30] palm trees growing in in the desert I
[1:41:34] mean like a whole
[1:41:35] like like a you know I have these these
[1:41:40] nurseries a nursery date-palms in the
[1:41:43] desert desert layin it was almost like
[1:41:47] hi in the word they get that to grow
[1:41:49] like that but they got some type of way
[1:41:50] they've done the aeration irrigation
[1:41:52] system and they have made things grow in
[1:41:54] the middle of nowhere it didn't look
[1:41:56] like a land flowing looking honey but
[1:41:57] they made it that way
[1:41:59] look at this says the neighbor on the
[1:42:02] report says a good land
[1:42:06] it's Atlanta C it'll grow anything oh
[1:42:07] it's a wonderful place we got plenty of
[1:42:09] water and rivers and irrigation and
[1:42:10] everything to make a great nation but oh
[1:42:13] the amorite and the hittite all the
[1:42:16] others are there some of them are giants
[1:42:19] and we we look like little grasshoppers
[1:42:22] is what you how do you perceive yourself
[1:42:24] right God see you as a mighty warrior
[1:42:27] you see yourself as a little grasshopper
[1:42:31] amen amen and when they begin to say
[1:42:35] that oh the strength left the children
[1:42:37] of Israel they begin to cry and the
[1:42:39] stream so you got to watch what report
[1:42:41] you give it you know any little negative
[1:42:43] things will just send some people to
[1:42:45] downwards that's why some people don't
[1:42:48] need to watch the news on the news that
[1:42:53] will just have you in misery all they
[1:42:56] talked about is death do you know no
[1:42:59] people have been have gone home from the
[1:43:02] hospital than actually died in the
[1:43:04] hospital with this thing more people
[1:43:07] have recovered the next day they do not
[1:43:09] talk about their recoveries they only
[1:43:11] talk about the deaths they don't talk
[1:43:14] about the miracles amen
[1:43:16] that's where I got to be so careful
[1:43:18] which is what your life is feared to get
[1:43:20] faith in it it says we look like little
[1:43:22] grasshoppers when they begin to say that
[1:43:24] oh the strength left it to me
[1:43:26] vivianne the crime screen they left
[1:43:28] Egypt and come up and all these things
[1:43:29] that have taken place but there was two
[1:43:32] out of the hobo
[1:43:33] I don't know whole 12 of them there
[1:43:36] where two had that that had confidence
[1:43:39] rest of them said we can't do it just we
[1:43:41] just can't go in further it's impossible
[1:43:43] for us to meet that kind of people like
[1:43:45] Kingdom and Joshua said we got more than
[1:43:48] able to take it why what was it the
[1:43:51] other ones with the intellectual park
[1:43:53] was looking at what the Giants look like
[1:43:56] but Caleb and Joshua was looking at the
[1:43:58] promise that God had given not all
[1:44:01] depends on what you're looking at
[1:44:04] I'm still looking at this word all right
[1:44:07] this last Pope that will will in here
[1:44:11] out of where has that strength going
[1:44:13] Simpson and will stop for the day here
[1:44:16] but I will come back and finish this a
[1:44:18] man and do die a man he says oh my in
[1:44:23] Israel when they got settled down and
[1:44:25] here's the problem praying when they I
[1:44:27] set it down when they was on the move
[1:44:29] all right as long as they on the move is
[1:44:31] all right it was all right as long as
[1:44:33] they were moving but when they got to
[1:44:35] Palestine and got settled down then they
[1:44:37] begin to want to act like the
[1:44:39] Philistines and the Gentile world get
[1:44:45] ahead of myself yeah I'll just I'll say
[1:44:50] this because this meatman to my next
[1:44:51] point but I'll just I have to stop it
[1:44:53] here they begin to want to act like the
[1:44:56] villas two times in the Gentile world so
[1:44:58] yes that's when people get a little bit
[1:44:59] too stuck on yourself god bless them a
[1:45:03] man you got this you got that you
[1:45:07] getting spiritually fact now you get
[1:45:11] settled and when you do that you just
[1:45:13] dude ever stay in a place where the
[1:45:14] devil you just kind of
[1:45:15] anything that you watch it says they
[1:45:18] want to act like the film stars in the
[1:45:20] Gentile world they've wanted a king and
[1:45:22] when they accepted solids at King they
[1:45:24] deny God as their king and when we
[1:45:27] accept denominational barriers and
[1:45:29] handshakes and classical things instead
[1:45:31] of the Holy Ghost well then we're
[1:45:33] denying God our kingdom what happened to
[1:45:36] finally led them to an a half to a total
[1:45:38] backslide and they failed to recognize
[1:45:40] their real king when he come and that's
[1:45:43] the thing the churches have done today
[1:45:45] they've accepted all this father
[1:45:47] philosophy and doctrine and psychology
[1:45:51] and all these different things and
[1:45:53] instead of receiving the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:54] now the king is in the mists of the
[1:45:56] church and they don't know it they
[1:45:58] rejected it just exactly the way they
[1:46:01] rejected Jesus their source of church
[1:46:03] rejected him today why because they
[1:46:05] accepted an earthly king you're
[1:46:08] accepting preaches with education
[1:46:10] instead of man who knows God to Pastor
[1:46:13] the churches I'd rather have my family
[1:46:16] go to hear preaching that didn't know
[1:46:19] his ABCs if he know Christ amen then
[1:46:23] they have them with all their education
[1:46:25] they go to school to get that but the
[1:46:27] church is not in an educational program
[1:46:30] that mean the church is not competing
[1:46:32] from an educational perspective for it
[1:46:34] is for the power and demonstrations of
[1:46:36] the Holy Ghost that's what the church
[1:46:38] needs tonight that's right get away from
[1:46:40] these things
[1:46:41] but hold on Delilah first thing you know
[1:46:43] steps and ought to have made steps Epson
[1:46:46] oughtn't to have made his first stop
[1:46:49] when Delilah Firth and her eyes at him
[1:46:52] he ought to have turned his head and
[1:46:53] walked on can I just inject this when we
[1:46:56] go to that their web sites believe it's
[1:47:00] time now don't believe it's time and all
[1:47:02] that speak you the truth we go to the
[1:47:04] websites
[1:47:04] we're flirting with Delilah Sampson got
[1:47:10] in trouble for flirting with the latter
[1:47:12] there you go and now you got to go to a
[1:47:15] website maybe go sit around people

[1:48:44] not any what he really meant that's what
[1:48:47] we got rejecting the word let me keep
[1:48:49] going
[1:48:49] when Delilah fertilizer him he ought to
[1:48:52] have never turned his head and walked on
[1:48:54] e stop just for a moment and she got in
[1:48:58] trouble
[1:48:59] Sampson stop for a moment and got in

[1:49:04] something to the church or individual
[1:49:08] don't stop Church don't stop keep moving
[1:49:14] on that's what the church needs to
[1:49:16] tonight is don't stop of these
[1:49:18] intellectual classical prize is keep
[1:49:20] moving on and only those two just keep
[1:49:22] pressing on going on I encourage you to
[1:49:26] do that
[1:49:27] don't don't don't put yourself position
[1:49:30] where you could end up rejecting the
[1:49:32] word for your name and each day it was
[1:49:37] rejected Kanan rejected the children of
[1:49:40] Israel rejected no one they rejected
[1:49:43] Moses day they rejected
[1:49:45] hey man just I did you just mean it day
[1:49:47] after day after day people have found
[1:49:49] themselves rejecting God's reveal work
[1:49:52] we don't want to be in that position
[1:49:53] today I'm gonna stop there but I'm gonna
[1:49:56] pick this up a man the next time I come
[1:49:59] before you trust that up the what we're
[1:50:02] just kind of curious we can go back and
[1:50:03] pull out that quote a little bit more
[1:50:05] than we started out on but I pray this
[1:50:07] would just help us on our journey
[1:50:08] amen the Lord bless you let's pray
[1:50:11] father we're appreciative the Word of
[1:50:17] God that has been given to us Lord and
[1:50:22] it's so so precious so precious we look
[1:50:28] at it it's one thing to read scripture
[1:50:31] the Lord and just kind of see something
[1:50:34] in history but oh god help us to apply
[1:50:39] it for where we are right now that
[1:50:41] that's that's what's most important if
[1:50:44] we get this fire on the examples and
[1:50:46] look at it study all of the examples in
[1:50:49] Scripture but what people have done Lord
[1:50:53] we can avoid the same mistakes and the
[1:50:56] Lord the same errors we can avoid the
[1:50:59] same outcomes this is why you sent
[1:51:03] through your prophet that there will be
[1:51:06] a second Eve that a common she is
[1:51:08] ordained not to follow that that's who
[1:51:14] we are we are that second
[1:51:16] eyes on the words as it has been reveal
[1:51:19] we're giving you exactly what you have
[1:51:22] asked for we're not questioning and
[1:51:24] wondering and Lord just trying to figure
[1:51:27] out a better way to do these things
[1:51:28] we're doing what you have access to do
[1:51:30] so lord help us just to continue to give
[1:51:33] ourselves to your perfect plan and
[1:51:36] perfect wheel and then you get glory and
[1:51:38] honor out of our lives Lord our prayer
[1:51:40] is even for those that may be consoled
[1:51:43] by this spirit that's all it is it's a
[1:51:46] spirit just like a person could be
[1:51:48] consuming the spirit of lust or a spirit
[1:51:51] of alcohol or drugs or anything of that
[1:51:55] nature Lord and they can become sulphide
[1:51:58] but Lord they can be delivered as well
[1:52:00] and Lord of Tears one that may be their
[1:52:03] eyes have kind of gotten off the word
