[28:26] bosom. That's your word. It's your
[28:27] promise, Lord. And Father, we have
[28:30] nothing to do with bringing it to pass.
[28:32] It's all about you, Father. So, we
[28:33] commit these things to you in the
[28:35] precious and lovely name of Jesus
[28:37] Christ, our Lord and Savior. We pray.

[29:52] but I don't believe
[29:54] he brought me this far
[29:57] to leave me.
[29:59] [Music]
[30:03] I
[30:05] don't feel no way tired.
[30:13] I come too far from where I started
[30:18] from.
[30:22] Nobody told me that the road would be
[30:29] there. But I don't believe he brought me
[30:34] this far to lead me.
[30:41] I
[30:44] just can't give up now.
[30:51] I come too far from where I started
[30:56] from.
[31:00] Nobody told me that the road would be
[31:05] easy, but I don't believe he brought me
[31:10] this far to leave me.
[31:13] [Music]
[31:16] I
[31:18] don't feel no waste tired,
[31:24] Lord.
[31:25] I've come too far from where I've
[31:29] started from.
[31:32] [Music]
[31:34] Nobody told me that the road would be
[31:39] easy, but I don't believe he brought me
[31:44] this far. I don't believe he brought me
[31:48] this far. I don't believe he brought me
[31:52] this far. I don't believe he brought me
[31:56] this far. I don't believe he brought me
[32:00] his heart and he never leave me or
[32:04] forsake me. Always be with me, even in
[32:08] me till the end of the world. I don't
[32:12] believe he brought me this far.
[32:17] Don't believe he brought me this far. I
[32:21] don't believe he brought me this. I
[32:25] don't believe he brought me this. I
[32:29] don't believe he brought me this.
[32:33] Said he never leave me. Save me. Always
[32:37] in me and with me until the end of the
[32:42] world.
[32:45] [Music]
[32:47] To the end of the world.
[32:51] End of the world.
[32:55] End of the world.
[32:58] End of the world.
[33:02] It was the word
[33:05] brought me here. The word that brought
[33:09] me here. The word that brought me here.
[33:13] It was the word that brought me here. I
[33:18] was an eagle
[33:21] right from the start.
[33:23] [Music]
[33:25] But then I heard
[33:28] that eagle call.
[33:32] It was a word that brought me here. It
[33:36] was a word that brought me here. It was
[33:40] a word that brought me here. It was a
[33:44] word that brought me here. I was an

[39:53] good to be back in the house of the
[39:56] Lord.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; And um I just want to just kind of
[40:00] reiterate
[40:02] um the meeting with the the sisters
[40:04] after service.
[40:06] Some of you all may not be aware, but
[40:08] brother Troy lost his uncle um a couple
[40:12] weeks ago and they're doing the funeral
[40:14] on Saturday, which I'll be um uh
[40:18] preaching the funeral. And um so the
[40:22] family just needs our support with food
[40:24] and and things like that. brothers, we
[40:26] may need your help also with meat uh for
[40:29] this, but we'll just try to rally around
[40:32] the family to support them uh during
[40:35] this time of their loss. So, sisters, if
[40:37] y'all don't mind, uh please um see
[40:40] Sister Tina. They'll have a little
[40:41] meeting outside. You know, we kind of
[40:44] have to move out of the way, but we can
[40:46] do it outside. So, just make sure you
[40:48] you see her and and let's do all we can
[40:51] to support our deacon. Amen.
[40:54] um in in his loss. Praise the Lord. Um
[40:59] let me uh I think I think that's all I
[41:03] need to say. Let me let's go to the
[41:05] scripture and um we're going back to the
[41:09] book of Hosea
[41:13] and uh we'll read that chapter. And then
[41:16] there's a couple other passages that I'd
[41:19] like to read um after this, but I'll
[41:22] have you be seated and then we'll we'll
[41:25] we'll we'll navigate Amen. our way
[41:27] through this today. Hosea 14 is where
[41:31] I'm reading from.
[41:34] Amen.
[41:36] It says,
[41:38] "Oh Israel,
[41:41] return unto the Lord thy God, for thou
[41:45] hast fallen by thine iniquity."
[41:49] Uh take with you words and turn to the
[41:52] Lord, saying unto him, "Take away all my
[41:55] all iniquity." Say unto him, "Take away
[41:59] all iniquity."
[42:02] And receive us graciously. So will we
[42:05] render the cows of our lips. Asher shall
[42:11] not save us. We will not ride upon
[42:14] horses. Neither will we say anymore to
[42:17] the work of our hands. Ye are our gods.
[42:22] For in thee the fatherless findeth
[42:24] mercy.
[42:26] I love this. I will heal
[42:29] their backsliding.
[42:32] I will love them freely.
[42:37] Amen. For my anger is turned away from
[42:40] him.
[42:41] I will be as the dew um unto Israel. He
[42:46] shall grow as the lily and cast forth
[42:50] his roots as Lebanon.
[42:52] Uh his branches shall spread and his
[42:56] beauty shall be as the olive tree and
[43:00] his smell as Lebanon.
[43:02] They that dwell under his shadow
[43:06] uh shall return. They shall revive as
[43:10] the corn and grow as the vine. The scent
[43:14] thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
[43:17] Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do
[43:20] anymore with idols? I have heard him and
[43:25] observed him. I am like a green fur
[43:28] tree. from me is thy fruit found. Who is
[43:32] wise and he shall understand these
[43:36] things? Uh prudent and he shall know
[43:39] them. For the ways of the Lord are
[43:42] right, and the just shall walk in them,
[43:44] but the transgressors shall fall
[43:48] therein. Let's have a brief word of
[43:50] prayer. Father, we thank you for the
[43:52] reading of the word. We trust, oh God,
[43:54] that the Holy Spirit would uh help us,
[43:57] Lord, to to hear what the spirit is
[44:01] trying to say to us through this on
[44:03] today. That we would apply it and that
[44:05] our lives, oh God, would be pleasing uh
[44:08] unto thee. We thank you for all that has
[44:11] happened thus far in the service. What a
[44:13] wonderful anointing uh is here. And the
[44:16] anointing comes to destroy yolks. So,
[44:20] Father, we pray uh that you would do
[44:22] exactly what your word said that you
[44:24] would do. Take control of every thought,
[44:26] those that are being presented as well
[44:28] as those that are being received. And
[44:31] God, may you get all the glory, all the
[44:33] honor, and all the praise in this
[44:35] portion of the service. In Jesus' name
[44:38] we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated.
[44:42] Um the title, Amen. again
[44:48] uh is the restoration of Ephraim. Amen.
[44:51] The restoration of Ephraim. And um we
[44:59] started last week and um just kind of
[45:04] showing how Ephraim had gotten so um
[45:09] uh bound up in idols
[45:15] that in this book of Hosea
[45:18] um chapter 4 and verse 17 made a
[45:22] statement Ephraim is joined
[45:25] to idols let him alone and um and the
[45:30] previous verse talked about how Israel
[45:32] was backslitting and everything and you
[45:35] know
[45:37] it's it's it's it's
[45:39] you know just something to see and my
[45:41] thought was that you never want to get
[45:43] yourself to a spot uh with God where he
[45:46] say you join so much to the idols just
[45:49] leave them alone I I don't even want to
[45:51] deal with them no more you you never
[45:54] want to get to a spot like that. And and
[45:56] we tried to just uh as as I was, you
[45:59] know, um looking at this, I went and
[46:02] just looked at different um uh things
[46:07] that Brother Brandham identified as
[46:09] idols in our life and even in the
[46:11] dictionary. So, we we we brought all of
[46:12] that out on last week. But the other
[46:15] thing that that I didn't do last week, I
[46:17] I was I found that as I was bringing the
[46:19] sermon, even our daily Bible readings
[46:24] uh were actually dealing with Ephraim.
[46:26] So, I want to go back and read uh some
[46:29] of that this morning. We're going to go
[46:30] and just and catch um 2 Coronicles
[46:34] chapter 15
[46:37] uh verse 1-9. Let's just kind of catch
[46:39] that. And you know, this is just where
[46:43] Ephraim was at the time that God said
[46:46] this. However, he did make them a
[46:48] promise that I'm going to heal their
[46:50] backsliding.
[46:52] Oh, what a promise. Oh, what a promise.
[46:55] Thank God for that. Amen. But 2
[46:58] Chronicles chapter 15, let's just kind
[47:00] of pick this up and we'll see um
[47:05] a few things here. All right. Verse one,
[47:08] it says, "And the spirit of God came
[47:11] upon Azeriah the son of Oded,
[47:15] and he went out to meet Assa, and said
[47:18] unto him, hear ye me, a Assassa, and all
[47:22] Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you
[47:26] while you be with him." Now, that's
[47:28] that's that's the that's the that's the
[47:30] that's the critical part there. The Lord
[47:32] is with you while you be with him.
[47:35] Right? And it says, "And if ye seek him,
[47:38] he will be found of you, but if ye
[47:41] forsake him, he will forsake you." Now
[47:45] for as long season Israel hath been
[47:49] without the true God, and without a
[47:51] teaching priest, and without law.
[47:55] Uh but when they in their trouble did
[47:58] turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and
[48:00] sought him, he was found of them. Amen.
[48:05] Uh verse 5 says, "And in those times
[48:08] there was no peace to him that went out,
[48:11] nor to him that came in, but great
[48:14] vexations were upon all the inhabitants
[48:16] of the countries. And the nation was
[48:19] destroy and nation was destroyed of
[48:21] nation and city of city, for God did vex
[48:24] them with all adversity.
[48:28] Be ye strong, therefore, and let not
[48:30] your hands be weak, for your work shall
[48:34] be rewarded. I want to encourage you
[48:37] with that. Amen. Right out of the word
[48:39] of God. Be be strong. Don't let your
[48:42] hands be weak. Your work will be
[48:45] rewarded.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Sometimes it's just
[48:52] good read a promise from God. My work
[48:55] will be rewarded. That's right.
[48:58] Hallelujah. I'm reminded of a little
[49:00] candy bar that I received. Amen. Uh from
[49:03] one of the sisters here in the church
[49:04] and and she she she she uh bought a a
[49:08] Payday uh candy bar. That's a old candy
[49:12] bar. Not not not too many people
[49:14] remember them anymore, but she she she
[49:16] bought the Payday candy bar and she made
[49:18] a little note. She say, "Uh, brother
[49:20] Jack, keep on going because payday is
[49:24] coming
[49:25] after a while.
[49:27] That that's what we used to say in the
[49:29] old times. Payday is coming after a
[49:32] while. And that simply means your work
[49:33] going to be rewarded.
[49:35] God ain't forgot about nothing you have
[49:37] done. Your work shall be rewarded. Mama,
[49:41] your praying going to be rewarded.
[49:43] Daddy, your praying and your fasting
[49:45] going to be rewarded.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God ain't forgot about his
[49:50] promises to you. Amen. Be ye strong,
[49:52] therefore, and let not your hands be
[49:54] weak, for your works shall be rewarded.
[49:57] Verse 8. And when Asa heard these words
[50:00] in the prophecy of Od uh the prophet, he
[50:03] took courage and put away the abominable
[50:06] idols out of all the land of Judah and
[50:09] Benjamin and out of the cities which he
[50:12] had taken from Mount Ephraim. So look at
[50:16] where these idols were um that they had
[50:19] to get get rid of them out of the land
[50:21] of Israel. They were found in Mount
[50:23] Ephraim where the tribe of Ephraim was
[50:25] dwelling. All right. It says uh uh uh
[50:27] take had taken from Mount Ephraim and
[50:30] renew the altar of the Lord that was
[50:32] before the porch of the Lord. Let's skip
[50:35] here. We're going to go to 2 Chronicles
[50:37] chapter 25. This verse I mean 2
[50:40] Chronicles 15 we just read. That was a
[50:42] scripture in our daily Bible reading
[50:44] that was on last Sunday. So I know we're
[50:46] in the right channel. Amen. And also uh
[50:49] 2 Chronicles 25. I think if it's not
[50:52] today, then it's going to be in
[50:53] tomorrow's weing reading. Uh but uh we
[50:56] find this over in 2 Chronicles 25:5.
[51:00] Amen. It says this. Moreover,
[51:04] um Amaziah gathered Judah together and
[51:06] made them captains over thousands.
[51:10] captains over hundreds according to the
[51:13] houses of their fathers throughout all
[51:15] Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them
[51:18] from 20 years old and above and found
[51:20] them 300,000 choice men able to go forth
[51:23] to war uh that could handle spear and
[51:27] shield. Verse 6 says, "He hired also a
[51:32] 100,000 mighty men of valor out of
[51:36] Israel for 100 talents of silver." Uh,
[51:40] but there came a man of God to him,
[51:42] saying, "Oh king, let not the army of
[51:46] Israel go with thee, for the Lord is not
[51:50] with Israel
[51:52] to wit with all the children of
[51:56] Ephraim."
[51:57] So this man has hired this army from the
[52:00] children of Israel to go with him to
[52:02] battle. And a prophet has to come tell
[52:04] him say, "You better send Israel back."
[52:06] And the reason God is not with Israel is
[52:08] because of Ephraim.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Oo Lord have mercy.
[52:14] that you wouldn't want that to be your
[52:16] story.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; That God had to tell people you need to
[52:18] separate from this one because you you
[52:23] about to be defeated in battle because
[52:25] this one's on your side.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; This is how bad Ephraim got
[52:30] &gt;&gt; that God had to send prophets to say you
[52:32] better you better not go to war with
[52:34] them because you going to lose if
[52:36] Ephraim show up.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Ephraim was
[52:39] bringing Amen. almost uh tragedy to amen
[52:44] to to the whole nation because of the
[52:46] sins that they were involved in. You
[52:48] know, we can go back and look at uh uh
[52:50] the story of um um the fell in the book
[52:54] of Joshua. Uh I can't think it Achen.
[52:58] Achen, you know, same story because
[53:01] Israel started losing men in battle
[53:03] because Achen had idol gods in his
[53:05] midst,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, he took money. He took
[53:07] Babylonian garments. He he had all these
[53:09] things that he was doing and it caused
[53:11] men to die,
[53:13] &gt;&gt; right? So, so we never want to find
[53:15] ourselves in a position like this with
[53:17] God.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's not frustrate his
[53:20] grace
[53:21] &gt;&gt; and make his grace a disgrace.
[53:23] [Music]
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Let us go further here. Amen. Verse um
[53:28] verse 7. But there came a man of God to
[53:31] him saying, "Oh, oh, oh king, let not
[53:33] the army of Israel go with thee, for the
[53:35] for the Lord is not with Israel to wit
[53:37] with all the children of Ephraim." It
[53:39] says, "But if thou wil go do it, be
[53:43] strong for the battle God shall make
[53:47] thee, God shall make thee fall before
[53:49] the enemy, for God hath power to help
[53:51] and to cast down." And Amaziah said to
[53:55] the man of God, "But what shall we do
[53:58] for the hundred talents which I have
[54:00] given to the army of Israel?" So, he
[54:01] done paid this money to get uh the army
[54:04] of Israel and and see maybe what he
[54:06] should have did was got some advice
[54:08] before he paid that money.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, his money lost because
[54:13] you done joined up with
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Ephraim. Yes, sir.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Right. And he said he says and and
[54:18] Amziah said to the man of God, "But but
[54:20] what shall we do for the 100 talents
[54:22] which I have given to the army of
[54:23] Israel?" And the man of God answered,
[54:25] "The Lord is able to give thee much more
[54:27] than this."
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Woo. Woo. Maybe you got some money tied
[54:33] up with Ephraim.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; And and that's the reason you want to
[54:37] let go certain things because you got
[54:38] money tied up somewhere. But God is God
[54:42] is able to give you more than the money
[54:43] that you got tied up with Ephraim.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just let Ephraim go.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Ephraim is represented in
[54:52] so many things, right? I mean these idol
[54:56] worship it's it's represented. So
[54:57] sometimes it can be in a relationship.
[54:59] Sometime people can't go further in God
[55:01] because they tied to something that they
[55:03] shouldn't be tied to.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Let go of Ephraim. What more do I have
[55:08] to do with these idols?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; All right. Here verse verse 10 says uh
[55:16] then Amziah
[55:18] separated them. And this is where God
[55:20] wants us to come to a place of
[55:22] separation. Then Amziah separated them
[55:24] to whip the army that was come to him
[55:26] out of out of Ephraim to go home again.
[55:30] Wherefore their anger was greatly
[55:31] kindled against Judah and they returned
[55:34] home in great anger. Mhm. Mhm. When you
[55:37] separating from some stuff, folk going
[55:40] to get upset with you.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; You can expect that. Well, I don't want
[55:43] to make them upset when you don't make
[55:45] God upset.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; You understand? God is so upset. He said
[55:50] he says, "Ephim to his idols.
[55:53] got nothing to do with him no more.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; You don't want God to get upset with
[55:57] you. I rather for man to be upset with
[55:58] me than God to be upset with me any day.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But this just kind of paints
[56:03] the picture for us to help us
[56:06] understand, you know, what happened here
[56:08] and how Ephraim got in this condition.
[56:10] And and today I'm going back and I I as
[56:14] we talk about the restoration of Ephraim
[56:16] because that's the title. But but in
[56:18] order to understand the restoration, you
[56:20] got to understand how far people had
[56:22] fallen, how far Ephraim had fallen. And
[56:26] um and we want to just take our time
[56:28] here today and look at uh I am going to
[56:32] slide
[56:33] 10. Uh we want to take our time and just
[56:36] look at something here. Praise the Lord.
[56:40] I want to go back and give some history
[56:42] here to to Ephraim.
[56:45] All right.
[56:46] The scripture said, "Ephraim shall
[56:48] say,"What
[56:51] have I to do anymore with idols? Is this
[56:54] restoration's going to happen?" And and
[56:55] and this was a scripture that I I was
[56:58] reading and I was I I don't know. I I've
[57:00] uh many people that I've talked to. I
[57:03] have read the Bible through and through
[57:05] uh for many years. I I don't I can't
[57:07] even count how many years it's been. Uh
[57:10] but uh I can tell you this much. No
[57:12] matter how much you read the Bible
[57:14] through and through, God gonna always
[57:15] have something that you ain't seen
[57:18] before.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And and and it happened to me just a few
[57:22] weeks ago when I was reading here in
[57:23] Hosea, and I was like, "Oh, wait a
[57:25] minute. I've always known Ephraim to
[57:27] kind of be uh in a situation where they
[57:29] were isolated and separated, but I never
[57:31] saw the restoration side of it."
[57:34] Hallelujah. And what we want to look at
[57:36] here is just this frustration side
[57:38] because Hosea 14:8, Ephraim shall say,
[57:42] hallelujah. What have I to do anymore
[57:45] with idols? I have heard him. I've heard
[57:48] the Lord speak to me. I've heard his
[57:49] voice. And it and it says, I've heard
[57:51] him and observed him. I am like a green
[57:54] fur tree. From me is thy fruit found. So
[57:59] Ephraim comes to a spot where, you know,
[58:01] I don't want anything more to do with
[58:03] idols. Now, when we're looking at
[58:04] Ephraim in this particular passage of
[58:06] scripture, we're not looking at a
[58:09] individual,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; but we're looking at a tribe. Yes, sir.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's very important that we
[58:14] understand that. Now, I'm going to take
[58:16] you back and show you because I got the
[58:17] question, who is Ephraim? Who is
[58:20] Ephraim? Let's go back and see this
[58:22] tribe. The tribe comes from an
[58:24] individual.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. But, but when we're looking at in
[58:27] Hosea, the the the individual is already
[58:30] long gone. But now, this is the tribe
[58:32] that came at them. and how they got in
[58:33] and and just engulfed in idol worship.
[58:36] Hallelujah. Let's go hit next on that on
[58:39] that slide for me. Uh here is the the
[58:41] beginning of Ephraim. It's uh the story
[58:44] of Joseph found in Genesis 41 verse 51
[58:48] and 52. And Joseph called the name of
[58:50] the firstborn Manasseh. The God said,
[58:54] "He hath made me forget all my toil and
[58:57] all my father's house." Now, I mean, we
[59:00] got under just just a quick review.
[59:03] Amen. Joseph was sold by his brothers
[59:05] into slavery. Uh, ended up down there in
[59:08] Egypt and and as he's there in Egypt,
[59:11] uh, he, uh, he's working for this guy,
[59:13] Piper. And, uh, and Piper's wife decides
[59:16] to try to frame Joseph. Amen. Because
[59:19] she could not get him to, uh, to sleep
[59:22] with her. Hallelujah. Amen. and and and
[59:25] when uh when when when when when this
[59:26] happened, she frames him and and comes
[59:28] up with this lie and Joseph get thrown
[59:30] into prison, the man never did one thing
[59:33] wrong and all these seem to be bad
[59:35] things were happening to him. The thing
[59:37] I love about the scripture is that with
[59:39] all the bad stuff that happened to
[59:41] Joseph, y'all better hear me on this
[59:43] one.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; I said every bad thing that happened to
[59:46] Joseph, anybody got some bad stuff
[59:48] happening to them? But I got good news
[59:51] for you because this is what this is
[59:52] what the Bible say. With all the bad
[59:54] things sold into slavery, lied on by
[59:57] Piper's wife, ends up in prison, but all
[1:00:00] the bad things that happened to Joseph,
[1:00:01] the Bible says the Lord was with Joseph.
[1:00:06] [Applause]
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even when it look like your
[1:00:10] life is being turned upside down, I'm
[1:00:13] here to tell you this morning, the Lord
[1:00:16] is still with you.
[1:00:19] Yes, sir.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. But Joseph ends up in
[1:00:26] this situation and and and finally uh he
[1:00:29] he meets the butler and the baker in
[1:00:30] prison and he and he interprets dreams
[1:00:32] for them and he tells the the baker what
[1:00:34] would happen and tells the butler what
[1:00:36] would happen and and uh and the butler
[1:00:38] was going to be restored to his
[1:00:39] position, but the baker was going to
[1:00:40] lose his life. But he tells the butler
[1:00:42] say, "Don't forget me down here now.
[1:00:44] Tell tell them tell them where you you
[1:00:45] know tell them about me down here. I'm
[1:00:47] not supposed to be here in this jail.
[1:00:48] Two years go by before this man
[1:00:50] remembers that Joseph is in the prison.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Joseph comes out of the prison when
[1:00:57] Pharaoh has some dreams that he cannot
[1:01:00] interpret. And then Butler says, "You
[1:01:02] know what? Forgive me. I remember a guy
[1:01:04] down in prison
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; that interpreted my dreams
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; and everything he told me happened.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And everything he told a baker happened.
[1:01:14] I believe whatever this man tell you is
[1:01:15] going to happen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; He down there in the prison. You better
[1:01:18] go get him out. And Joseph comes to
[1:01:20] Pharaoh's court and uh and he begins to
[1:01:23] uh they share the dreams. And Jo Joseph
[1:01:25] begins to interpret the dreams. And then
[1:01:28] he gave him some advice. After he
[1:01:29] interpreted the dreams, he said, "Now
[1:01:31] look, I would advise you to find
[1:01:32] yourself a wise man to prepare for this
[1:01:35] great famine that's about to hit the
[1:01:36] land. You're going to have seven years
[1:01:38] of plenty and then you're going to have
[1:01:40] seven years of famine. And the famine
[1:01:42] going to be so bad that the years of
[1:01:44] plenty going to look like it never even
[1:01:45] happened.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; So you going to need yourself a wise man
[1:01:49] to help sustain the entire country
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; during this famine time.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; It says okay. And Joseph's on his way
[1:01:59] back to prison
[1:02:02] taking his walk
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; and and Pharaoh said, "Hold up, hold up,
[1:02:05] hold up, hold up, hold up. Wait before
[1:02:07] you go. Before you go, it says there in
[1:02:09] the man said we need a wise man
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; that can help us. Amen. Uh uh sustain
[1:02:16] during this famine time. He's telling us
[1:02:18] what's going to happen. Say now is there
[1:02:20] anybody
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; in this kingdom more wise
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; than this this prisoner
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; now? And now they was in a tough spot.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz if somebody would have stood up and
[1:02:35] say, "Well, yeah,
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; I'm more qualified than him."
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; If they would have stood up and said
[1:02:42] that, then the next question would have
[1:02:43] been, "How come you didn't give me the
[1:02:45] interpretation of the dreams?"
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; See, God know how to fix it
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; that you the only one that's qualified
[1:02:58] to do the job.
[1:02:59] [Applause]
[1:03:02] He eliminate all the other resumes.
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; So since nobody stood up to say I'm more
[1:03:10] wise than this man, he say well this
[1:03:12] fell ain't going back to prison.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; He just went from prison to vice
[1:03:17] president.
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Boy, God bypass processes.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Just got to let God do it
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; because he he got a great way of doing
[1:03:37] it. And and and when he does it, he did
[1:03:38] it in front of everybody. So they knew
[1:03:40] what his title was, what his position
[1:03:42] was. You better not try to come against
[1:03:44] him. You better not try to set him up
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; cuz Pharaoh be coming after you.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; God used Joseph during that time to help
[1:03:53] sustain. And and not only that, but
[1:03:55] Joseph was given a wife. She was a a
[1:03:57] priest's uh daughter and and when he was
[1:04:01] given his wife, this is where he has his
[1:04:03] children born and um the firstborn is by
[1:04:06] the name of Manasseh.
[1:04:09] Uh the Bible tells us Joseph called the
[1:04:11] name of the firstborn Manasseh. For God
[1:04:14] said, "He has made me forget all my
[1:04:16] toil,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; everything I went through."
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; See, and can I tell you something? Even
[1:04:22] when you when you gave your child a
[1:04:25] name,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; the name had a significance.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; When when when see when Joseph looks at
[1:04:34] Manasseh and even when he calls his
[1:04:36] name,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; what what what what Joseph saying,
[1:04:40] Manasseh, God made me forget about
[1:04:42] everything I went through.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Now, at this point in time, Joseph is
[1:04:46] not looking at his he's not he doesn't
[1:04:48] know if his father's still alive. He
[1:04:50] don't know if his brother's still alive.
[1:04:51] He don't know nothing, right? But he but
[1:04:53] but when he looks at Manasseh,
[1:04:56] Manasseh, you tell me that God has
[1:04:58] caused me, Amen, to just for forget
[1:05:01] about all my toils.
[1:05:03] If
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; if I could just sit down and and talk to
[1:05:05] you, Manasse, and tell you how I even
[1:05:07] got to Egypt.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God has made me forget
[1:05:12] about all because he gave me you,
[1:05:14] Manasse.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:20] my firstborn. The name of the firstborn,
[1:05:22] Manasse, for God said, "He hath made me
[1:05:24] forget all my toil and and my father's
[1:05:27] house and all my father's house."
[1:05:30] The next verse says, "In the name of the
[1:05:32] second, call he
[1:05:35] Ephraim.
[1:05:37] For God have caused me to be fruitful
[1:05:40] in the land of my affliction."
[1:05:44] Now, now, now, now I have it on the
[1:05:46] screen there. Go back and look at Hosea
[1:05:48] 14:8 there on the screen. Because
[1:05:50] Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do
[1:05:53] anymore with idols? I have heard him and
[1:05:58] observed him.
[1:06:00] I am like a green fur tree.
[1:06:06] From me is thy fruit found." Now
[1:06:10] remember his name. Amen. meant that God
[1:06:13] caused me to be fruitful
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; in the land of my affliction.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Well, what is going on here is Ephraim
[1:06:24] is recognizing, Amen. are coming into
[1:06:27] Amen. a full understanding of his
[1:06:29] identity.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And as brothers and sisters in Christ,
[1:06:34] when we get away from the Lord, it's
[1:06:36] it's it's a good thing to come, amen,
[1:06:38] into our understanding of who we really
[1:06:40] are.
[1:06:42] Even the prodigal son had to come to
[1:06:45] that understanding.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That no I can live better in my
[1:06:50] father's house as a servant
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; than I can live out here with these
[1:06:54] pigs. But when it comes to a a grip,
[1:06:57] amen, within himself that I'm better
[1:06:59] than this,
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; God may made me for more than this.
[1:07:04] That's right.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; It's then that God can begin to move
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; and bring you back into a place
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; of restoration.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Ephraim Ephraim says that there the the
[1:07:16] tribe of Ephraim recognize their their
[1:07:19] their their their
[1:07:22] orin.
[1:07:25] Hallelujah. And they can say, I've heard
[1:07:27] him and observed him. I am like a green
[1:07:30] fur tree.
[1:07:32] for me is thy fruit found. We also find
[1:07:37] we pray uh uh next
[1:07:40] Genesis 48 and5
[1:07:43] this is where Joseph's father has come
[1:07:48] and back into his life. the the famine
[1:07:50] has come and famine has driven uh people
[1:07:53] from even outside of Egypt back into
[1:07:58] uh back down into Egypt because they
[1:07:59] they people found out, you know, now
[1:08:01] look, there's famine all around, but but
[1:08:03] we found that they they had food down
[1:08:05] there in Egypt and and and and Jacob's
[1:08:08] boys come to him and say, "Now, now
[1:08:09] look, we're going to have to go down to
[1:08:10] Egypt to get some food." Say, "Okay, go
[1:08:13] on down there and get yourself some food
[1:08:14] and and bring it back to the family."
[1:08:16] And when he get down there, oh my,
[1:08:20] Joseph thought he had forgotten all his
[1:08:22] toil
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; and that he had forgot about his
[1:08:25] father's house. But his brothers show up
[1:08:28] on one day
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; and when he looks to see his brothers,
[1:08:31] he start counting and he knew he knew
[1:08:33] it. Now, now here's the other beautiful
[1:08:34] thing about all of this is that Joseph
[1:08:37] was in a different place
[1:08:40] at the time that his brothers showed up.
[1:08:41] He was at a different place in his
[1:08:43] heart,
[1:08:45] sir. Right? And and this is what need to
[1:08:47] happen to you. You you got to be in a
[1:08:49] different place when God is bringing
[1:08:51] restoration to somebody. You got to be
[1:08:54] in a different place where you can
[1:08:55] receive them.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Now, Joseph had the power and Joseph had
[1:09:02] the authority to go here and try to
[1:09:05] Amen. and try to uh uh uh I mean, he
[1:09:08] could have wre some real havoc amongst
[1:09:10] his brothers.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:09:13] But but we can see that God had changed
[1:09:15] something on the inside of Joseph where
[1:09:17] he did not want to do these things.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; But he had to do things in a certain way
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; that it would prove where these brothers
[1:09:25] were.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; So he began to ask him questions. Just
[1:09:30] talk to him a little bit and tell me a
[1:09:32] little bit about your daddy and tell me
[1:09:34] about your your family history and all
[1:09:36] of that and give me give me some give me
[1:09:38] give me something to work with here. We
[1:09:40] got this many brothers and our daddy is
[1:09:42] still alive and this that and the other
[1:09:44] and said we got one brother that died.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:09:51] How did he die
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; and he just working it and and
[1:09:57] everything and then he finally get them
[1:09:58] to the end and he says, "I tell you
[1:10:01] what, y'all going to have to prove to me
[1:10:03] whether y'all daddy's still alive and
[1:10:04] this other younger brother that you say
[1:10:06] is at the house. Y'all going to have to
[1:10:07] bring that younger brother here." And it
[1:10:10] was Joseph's physically blood brother.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; They had the same father and the same
[1:10:15] mother. Now these other brothers had the
[1:10:17] same father but not the same mother. But
[1:10:19] Benjamin was the brother that was the
[1:10:21] same father and same mother and and his
[1:10:23] mother had died.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; So here you know uh he said I'm going to
[1:10:30] have to keep one of y'all back. And and
[1:10:31] I I I didn't I didn't get all this
[1:10:33] together but I I believe it was
[1:10:37] Simeon. Okay. All right. Simeon had to
[1:10:39] stay back and uh and when he stays back,
[1:10:42] you know, it say now now if if y'all
[1:10:44] want y'all this brother, y'all going to
[1:10:46] have to come back.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Well, the brothers leave, camel's loaded
[1:10:51] with all this all the goods and to get
[1:10:53] back down there to the daddy and the
[1:10:54] daddy say, "Um,
[1:10:57] uh, I'm happy to have all the food, but
[1:11:01] I'm missing another son.
[1:11:06] Yeah,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; I'm missing another son.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Every time y'all boys get together to do
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; things just I don't know what it is with
[1:11:17] y'all, but why do I miss miss children?
[1:11:21] Y'all take off.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; They say, "Daddy, we he asked this
[1:11:26] question. He asked that question. We
[1:11:27] told him this. We told him that." Said,
[1:11:28] "Why did you even tell him that?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Why did you tell him you had another
[1:11:32] brother? Why did you say these things?"
[1:11:34] said, "Dad," and the man asked us
[1:11:35] questions. We just We didn't know he was
[1:11:37] going to do this. And I believe now they
[1:11:40] kept Simeon, but now I think it's Judah
[1:11:43] that steps up and says, "You know, now
[1:11:46] uh he says now, you know, we going to
[1:11:50] have to go back when we run out of food,
[1:11:52] Dad. We got to go back down there." Say,
[1:11:53] "No, I don't." And and we got to take
[1:11:55] Benjamin with us. And I believe Judah
[1:11:57] steps up and he says, "Now, Daddy, you
[1:11:59] can take my sons,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; right?" I believe it's Judah, right? And
[1:12:04] he says, "You can take my sons if we
[1:12:05] don't bring Benjamin back." He's like,
[1:12:07] like, "No, I ain't. Uhuh. I I ain't
[1:12:08] sending Benjamin. No, I ain't sending
[1:12:10] Benjamin. I No. Uhuh. Uhuh. No. Y'all
[1:12:11] could just forget about it. Daddy, the
[1:12:13] whole all of us are dying here. We got
[1:12:15] no more food. We got to take Benjamin."
[1:12:18] He finally agrees. Y'all let Benjamin
[1:12:19] say, "But y'all don't let me go down to
[1:12:21] my grave with with I done lost three
[1:12:24] sons."
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; And and blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:12:28] Benjamin shows up
[1:12:31] with his brothers back into Egypt and
[1:12:36] Joseph sees them.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And and when Joseph seized them, Joseph,
[1:12:45] he's about to lose it.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; This is this is my blood.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; You know, he thought that with Manasses
[1:12:54] first born again, I forget all my toil.
[1:12:58] at all my father's house. I'll forget
[1:13:00] all that. But but but now all this is
[1:13:02] being rehearsed in his mind of all that
[1:13:05] has happened. But but but but for some
[1:13:07] reason he can see through this exchange
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; that these brothers have also changed
[1:13:12] from the time that they told the daddy
[1:13:14] that he was dead. They they've changed
[1:13:16] because they're they're willing now to
[1:13:18] put their lives out. Amen. On behalf of
[1:13:21] their brother Simeon.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And also bring Benjamin. Not
[1:13:25] knowing what would happen with Benjamin.
[1:13:28] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; They come down there and Joseph prepares
[1:13:33] them a meal
[1:13:35] and when he sits them up at the table,
[1:13:38] he puts them all from the oldest to the
[1:13:40] youngest. And they looking like, "No,
[1:13:43] no, no, no, no, no, no. Uh, why you got
[1:13:46] us sitting like this?" The brothers are
[1:13:47] blind to the fact that this is their
[1:13:49] brother.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; They still in their mind following that
[1:13:53] lie
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; that he was dead.
[1:13:56] Yes, sir.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; That's what they going with in their
[1:13:59] mind. But not even realize our brothers
[1:14:01] right here. And Joseph was always using
[1:14:02] an interpreter to kind of talk to them.
[1:14:04] He would never even let him know that I
[1:14:06] understand everything y'all saying. I
[1:14:08] hear everything you're saying and I can
[1:14:10] talk your language, but I'm just not
[1:14:11] going to do that just yet.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; They're going through and he just
[1:14:18] setting them all up and he gives
[1:14:20] Benjamin a greater portion than the rest
[1:14:21] of them. Like, why would he get a
[1:14:23] greater portion? What is going on around
[1:14:24] here? And finally it comes out. Joseph
[1:14:28] had to put every way put everybody out
[1:14:30] as he was breaking down in tears.
[1:14:35] I'm Joseph
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; your brother
[1:14:42] you who
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I'm Joseph
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; your brother. And then he says come near
[1:14:54] me.
[1:14:57] It's oh my goodness. And then they
[1:14:58] began, oh, what is this? They didn't
[1:15:00] know what the this man is in this much
[1:15:03] power
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; and he can do whatever he want to do
[1:15:08] against us right now. But no, he didn't
[1:15:09] do none of that.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm going to send you back
[1:15:12] home to your daddy and tell daddy to
[1:15:13] come down here and see me. Tell him you
[1:15:15] tell him his son liveth."
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Tell him his son liveth.
[1:15:21] and and see that dream that he had way
[1:15:23] back when he saw the the moon and the
[1:15:25] stars bowing down and and and and he say
[1:15:28] said now they when they interpreted you
[1:15:30] mean your mama and your me and your mama
[1:15:32] going to bow down to your brothers.
[1:15:33] Well, here it's happening right here.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; The dream was coming to pass. God has
[1:15:38] given you dreams and they shall come to
[1:15:41] pass.
[1:15:48] Hallelujah.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Joseph
[1:15:51] said, "Go get daddy and bring him." He
[1:15:53] said, "I'mma do something else."
[1:15:57] Boy, this restoration is deep.
[1:16:00] They thought they paid the money for all
[1:16:02] the food and and all the other things as
[1:16:04] they're going back on the second trip.
[1:16:05] And Joseph restored their money and put
[1:16:09] it in their sacks.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Now, he did that for a reason.
[1:16:16] and he puts it in the sack and and then
[1:16:19] he puts a a a cup inside Benjamin's bag.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And and then he he he he says, "Now let
[1:16:26] him leave." He tells his servants, "Let
[1:16:28] him leave and go out the the city for a
[1:16:30] little bit. But then I want you to
[1:16:32] follow them. And when you follow them,
[1:16:35] find the one that got the cup and say he
[1:16:37] got to come back."
[1:16:39] Well,
[1:16:41] they out running away
[1:16:44] and uh going back to going back home,
[1:16:46] they surround them, come chase them
[1:16:47] down. Who stole my master's cup? We
[1:16:50] didn't steal no cup. We wouldn't do
[1:16:52] nothing like that.
[1:16:54] The one that we found the cup with,
[1:16:56] that's the one that's coming back. Well,
[1:16:59] they went from the oldest to the
[1:17:00] youngest.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Got down to Benjamin. And here's the cup
[1:17:05] in Benjamin's bag. And actually this is
[1:17:08] where Judah stood up.
[1:17:11] Judah says, Judah says,
[1:17:15] "Please don't take my younger brother.
[1:17:18] My daddy would die if you take my
[1:17:21] younger brother, but take me." Why is it
[1:17:25] that Judah stands up?
[1:17:29] H.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus Christ
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; is the lion
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; from the tribe
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; of Judah.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And he took your place.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You should have died for the sins that
[1:17:44] you committed, but he took your place.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; When he found that you were in trouble,
[1:17:52] he took your place when you couldn't
[1:17:55] help yourself. He took your place.
[1:18:03] [Applause]
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Here they finally get back down there to
[1:18:10] daddy and they tell daddy everything
[1:18:11] that happened. And the best news that
[1:18:14] daddy could find or hear is that Joseph
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; is alive.
[1:18:21] And and here's here's here's the other
[1:18:23] thing that that that the scripture says
[1:18:27] when when they told
[1:18:30] Israel or Jacob when they told him that
[1:18:33] the that Joseph was still alive, Joseph
[1:18:35] said, "Now, daddy, when you I'm I'm
[1:18:38] sinning for you, but regard not your
[1:18:41] stuff.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't worry about how much stuff
[1:18:45] you got. and and I got this and I got
[1:18:48] that and I've accumulated this and I've
[1:18:50] accumulated. No, regard not your stuff.
[1:18:54] When it's time to forsake your idols,
[1:18:57] forget about them business relationships
[1:18:59] you done made and you done did this and
[1:19:00] you done did that. God can bless you
[1:19:02] with more if you would just be obedient.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Here comes
[1:19:12] Israel down there to Egypt. Jacob.
[1:19:17] He sees his son Joseph and he's just
[1:19:19] elated
[1:19:20] with what he sees and
[1:19:23] can't believe that my boy has risen to
[1:19:26] this level of power in this country at a
[1:19:30] time of this great famine. I I just man
[1:19:33] this is unbelievable. My family done
[1:19:35] made it to this level. My family my son
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; oh my did something for him. So, so, so,
[1:19:43] so when Joseph gets there and his
[1:19:46] daddy's there,
[1:19:48] I'm talking about who is who is Ephraim.
[1:19:51] And he gets there, verse five and and
[1:19:53] and and um I'm sorry, go back to uh to
[1:19:57] the last slide. Genesis 48:5 says, "And
[1:20:00] now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh,
[1:20:04] which were born unto thee in the land of
[1:20:06] Egypt,
[1:20:07] before I came unto thee into Egypt, are
[1:20:11] mine, as Reuben and Simeon,
[1:20:15] they shall be mine." So, Jacob lays
[1:20:17] claims on these two boys. Now, notice in
[1:20:19] that scripture in verse five, he says,
[1:20:21] "Ephraim and Manasseh are mine."
[1:20:26] Now really it probably should have been
[1:20:30] Manasseh and Ephraim are mine,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; but he said Ephraim and Manasseh are
[1:20:40] mine. And the reason it should have been
[1:20:42] Manasseh and Ephraim because over there
[1:20:46] in in Genesis 41,
[1:20:49] Manasseh was firstborn.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Ephraim was second born.
[1:20:56] So it should have been Manasseh and
[1:20:59] Ephraim is mine.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; It shows a respect
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; to the firstborn.
[1:21:05] But Jacob says, Ephraim and Manasseh
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; which are born unto thee in the land of
[1:21:12] Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt
[1:21:16] are mine.
[1:21:18] H. Now, I don't want to dig too deep
[1:21:21] into that,
[1:21:23] but I don't believe it was any
[1:21:25] favoritism or anything going on, but
[1:21:29] there was something deeper there.
[1:21:34] Something similar to predestination.
[1:21:38] Oh, the power of it. The power of
[1:21:42] predestination.
[1:21:47] Because
[1:21:51] Ephraim was second born, there was
[1:21:54] there's a there's a there's a a a what
[1:21:56] we call a birthright and a blessing that
[1:21:59] goes to the firstborn.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But Eve from being secondborn should not
[1:22:04] have been involved in any of this. But
[1:22:06] look, look at what the scripture says.
[1:22:08] Let's go on to the next slide. Genesis
[1:22:10] 48:9.
[1:22:12] This was time for Jacob to finally
[1:22:15] leave.
[1:22:16] Well, not not leave, but he he actually
[1:22:18] wanted to pray
[1:22:20] over
[1:22:23] um Joseph's sons. Look at this. Joseph
[1:22:26] said unto his father, "They are my sons
[1:22:31] whom God hath given me in this place."
[1:22:34] And he said, "Bring them, I pray thee,
[1:22:36] unto me, and I will bless them." Now,
[1:22:38] notice notice this this verse in verse
[1:22:41] 10.
[1:22:44] Uh it says, "Now the eyes of Israel were
[1:22:47] dim for age so he could not see and he
[1:22:51] brought them near unto him and he kissed
[1:22:53] them and embraced them." Now there's
[1:22:55] something I want you to catch there in
[1:22:56] that dim for dim uh for age. Now there
[1:22:59] was a
[1:23:01] uh hereditary issue happening in this
[1:23:06] family
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; because uh Isaac
[1:23:10] also begin to lose his eyesight
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; and his eyesight was so bad
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; that when it was time to bless his sons,
[1:23:20] you know, Jacob stole that birthright
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; and the blessing,
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; right? And uh and when it was and and
[1:23:27] and when he stole the blessing, he
[1:23:29] tricked his daddy by getting dressed up
[1:23:32] in some Halloween costume, if I can just
[1:23:36] put it that way. Hallelujah. But
[1:23:39] actually, the mama helped him just kind
[1:23:41] of put on these certain clothes and amen
[1:23:44] certain skins so to make it seem like
[1:23:46] you're a hairy child because your
[1:23:48] brother got a bunch of hair and you
[1:23:49] ain't got no hair.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; But we going to trick your daddy. And
[1:23:53] the only way they could trick him is
[1:23:54] through feeling and thing like that
[1:23:56] because the man could not see.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Even even when when when Jacob shows up,
[1:24:03] he say uh it it's it it sound like it
[1:24:07] feel like uh Esau's skin, but it sound
[1:24:10] like Jacob voice.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; So something ain't right about this man.
[1:24:15] I I know I can't see, but it just say,
[1:24:18] "Are you really? Are you really Are you
[1:24:21] really really Esau? Yeah. How did you
[1:24:24] get the food so fast? How'd you bring
[1:24:26] this this this venison to me? How did
[1:24:28] you do that so fast? Well, the Lord
[1:24:29] blessed me. You just lying.
[1:24:37] It's all right. And he gave that boy a
[1:24:39] blessing.
[1:24:40] When he got the blessing,
[1:24:43] Esau come running in with the venison.
[1:24:44] Daddy, I got the venison. I said, "Son,
[1:24:46] well, who is that I just blessed?
[1:24:49] My brother done stole my blessing as
[1:24:52] well as he stole my birthright over over
[1:24:54] pottage or or or or
[1:24:58] uh lentils
[1:25:00] a pot of lentils. The man lost his whole
[1:25:02] birthight over a pot of lentils. He he
[1:25:04] was just too hungry.
[1:25:06] He just didn't care.
[1:25:08] So what we see here is this there's a uh
[1:25:12] both uh Isaac had this problem with his
[1:25:14] eyes and then we also see that uh Jacob
[1:25:17] uh is now having this problem with his
[1:25:19] eyes because the Bible says now the eyes
[1:25:21] of Israel were dimmed for age so that he
[1:25:23] could not see and he brought them near
[1:25:26] unto him and he kissed them and embraced
[1:25:27] them and Israel said unse
[1:25:30] I have I had not thought to see thy face
[1:25:34] I didn't think I'd ever see you again
[1:25:36] and lo God have showed me also thy seed.
[1:25:39] Not just you, but I see my
[1:25:41] grandchildren.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; This meant something.
[1:25:45] This is the the the history of Ephraim.
[1:25:48] Man, he's connected to some great
[1:25:50] people, right? But but but here in verse
[1:25:53] verse 13, and Joseph brought them out
[1:25:55] from between his knees and he bowed
[1:25:58] himself with his face to the earth. So
[1:26:00] Joseph has his face to the face to the
[1:26:02] earth and he brings the his sons to his
[1:26:04] daddy for the blessing. And look at this
[1:26:07] now. And and this I'm I'm going just say
[1:26:09] something here before I go further than
[1:26:11] that. Um back in back in those times,
[1:26:14] the fathers would always give a
[1:26:15] blessing. And I still believe that's
[1:26:17] something that's that's I think fathers
[1:26:19] should bless their children.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, let me I got a couple things
[1:26:23] I'm getting ready to say here. Y'all
[1:26:25] just bear with me.
[1:26:27] um few
[1:26:29] Christmases ago, we were all gathered
[1:26:31] there in um in in um Indiana at my
[1:26:37] daughter's uh for Christmas and all my
[1:26:39] children there showing up and
[1:26:40] grandchildren, everything.
[1:26:42] And um so at that moment it was a very
[1:26:46] special moment I felt for me because um
[1:26:49] my wife said something to the to to my
[1:26:52] girls and said something about how she
[1:26:54] was proud of them and uh my daughter's
[1:26:57] like well uh if you're proud of us
[1:27:01] uh can you be more specific about why
[1:27:05] you proud of us? I said boy that's
[1:27:07] something. and they set their mom up
[1:27:10] and uh they was playing with her but but
[1:27:12] I thought it was it was just one of
[1:27:13] those moments and uh and and my wife
[1:27:16] said, "Yeah, I I can be more specific on
[1:27:18] that." And so she began to go kid by kid
[1:27:22] why she was proud.
[1:27:24] Now, as a father and I'm sitting there
[1:27:26] listening to that, ain't no way I'mma
[1:27:29] let this moment pass without me saying
[1:27:32] something.
[1:27:34] So I went from each daughter saying how
[1:27:37] I was proud of them. Then I also brought
[1:27:39] in my son-in-laws and told them how I
[1:27:41] was proud of them.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; And we spoke blessings over our children
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; in that moment.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Now when my father was passing, we did
[1:27:51] something a little different. My daddy
[1:27:53] was in the hospital
[1:27:55] and all of us kids happened to be there
[1:27:58] at the same time. And I said, you know,
[1:28:00] if all of us being here at the same
[1:28:02] time, we going to bless daddy. They say
[1:28:06] when a person is passing, the last thing
[1:28:08] to leave is actually hearing. So I
[1:28:12] wanted daddy to hear. All of us bless
[1:28:14] him. So we all gathered around that bed.
[1:28:17] And I think we started from the youngest
[1:28:19] and went to the oldest. My brother Troy
[1:28:21] being the oldest, he was the last one to
[1:28:22] speak. But each one had a chance to tell
[1:28:25] daddy how grateful we was for him. We
[1:28:28] blessed our daddy before he left here.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Joseph took them both. Ephraim in his
[1:28:39] right hand toward Israel's left hand and
[1:28:42] Manasseh in his left hand toward
[1:28:44] Israel's right hand. So Ephraim,
[1:28:48] it says, was in his right hand and he
[1:28:52] was moving it towards Israel's left
[1:28:54] hand. Okay. So, and then he takes
[1:28:57] Manasseh in his left hand and he's
[1:29:00] moving them towards the right hand
[1:29:03] and he brought them near unto him. Now,
[1:29:05] this was the proper way to do things,
[1:29:07] right? Because Manasseh is firstborn.
[1:29:12] However, verse 14 says, "Israel
[1:29:15] stretched out
[1:29:17] his right hand and laid it upon
[1:29:20] Ephraim's head,
[1:29:25] who was the younger,
[1:29:27] and his left hand,
[1:29:30] praise God, upon Manass's head, guiding
[1:29:33] his hands willingly, for Manasseh was
[1:29:36] the firstborn." So rather than pray for
[1:29:38] these boys like this,
[1:29:41] he prays like this.
[1:29:45] And his right hand right signifies power
[1:29:48] and authority.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; So the right hand ends up over on
[1:29:52] Ephraim.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the left hand ends up on
[1:29:57] Manasseh. Now the um the issue, let's go
[1:30:02] on to the next slide. Verse verse 15
[1:30:04] says, "And he blessed Joseph and said,
[1:30:08] God before whom my fathers Abraham and
[1:30:10] Isaac walked, the God which fed me all
[1:30:14] my life unto this day, the angel which
[1:30:18] redeemed me from all evil, bless the
[1:30:21] lads,
[1:30:24] and let my name
[1:30:27] be named
[1:30:29] on them."
[1:30:32] This is important. This is really
[1:30:34] important. I don't know if we're going
[1:30:35] to get to it today, but this is very
[1:30:38] important. I'mma just I'mma just go get
[1:30:41] get way ahead of myself. Let my name be
[1:30:43] named upon them. It allow Ephraim to be
[1:30:48] a part of the 12 tribes.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Lord help us Jesus. I don't know if we
[1:30:56] can get all that today, but it allowed
[1:30:58] Ephraim to become part of the 12 tribes.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Let my name be named among them.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Named on them, named on them, and the
[1:31:10] name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,
[1:31:14] and let them grow into a multitude in
[1:31:17] the midst of the earth. And when Joseph
[1:31:19] saw that his father laid his right hand
[1:31:21] upon the head of Ephraim, now Joseph's
[1:31:23] head was down to the ground, but he
[1:31:25] happened to look up and he said, "Wait a
[1:31:28] minute." He say he said he he saw he saw
[1:31:30] saw that this as father laid his hand uh
[1:31:33] right hand upon the head of Ephraim. It
[1:31:35] it displeased him and he held up his
[1:31:38] father's hand in the middle of a prayer.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Daddy, take your hand off of Ephraim.
[1:31:43] No, don't don't do this, daddy. No,
[1:31:45] that's not the way it's supposed to be
[1:31:47] done. had his hands crossed.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; It says he and he held up his father's
[1:31:52] hand to remove it from Ephraim unto
[1:31:54] Manass's head. Oh my my my. The next
[1:31:58] verse says, "And Joseph said unto his
[1:32:00] father, not so, my father, for this is
[1:32:04] the firstborn.
[1:32:05] Put thy right hand upon his head."
[1:32:09] Remember,
[1:32:11] his eyes are dim,
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; but he still knows what he's doing,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; but it's all for a purpose. He
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He does it this way. This is This is
[1:32:23] This is Ephraim's history.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. Sometimes when you can go
[1:32:29] back and look at where a person come
[1:32:30] from.
[1:32:32] Yes,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And and I like to say like this. it it I
[1:32:35] mean it you're going from point A to
[1:32:38] point B.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things that happen in
[1:32:42] between those points,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; but you going to get to where you
[1:32:44] supposed to go,
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; especially when it comes to God.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; And it's and and look at this verse.
[1:32:51] First verse verse 19 says, "And his
[1:32:54] father refused and said, I know it, my
[1:32:58] son. I know it. He also shall become a
[1:33:00] people, and he also shall be great." And
[1:33:04] he just uh Can you just this old daddy?
[1:33:07] Uh-uh. Don't don't don't move my hands.
[1:33:10] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:33:12] Imm
[1:33:14] No. I I got to do it this way. And I
[1:33:16] know he the firstborn son. And yeah, he
[1:33:18] going to be blessed, too. Oh my my. He
[1:33:21] also shall become a people, and he shall
[1:33:22] also be great. But truly his younger
[1:33:26] brother shall be greater than he and his
[1:33:29] seed shall become a multitude of nations
[1:33:32] which mean he'll be fruitful.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 20 says and he blessed him that
[1:33:40] day saying
[1:33:42] and thee shall Israel bless saying God
[1:33:46] make thee as Ephraim
[1:33:49] and as Manasseh.
[1:33:52] And he said he from
[1:33:54] before Manasseh
[1:34:04] that let my name be named on them. It
[1:34:07] brought a future blessing over Ephraim
[1:34:09] because he was a part of the 12 tribes
[1:34:11] of Israel. And also that showed that
[1:34:13] there would be a restoration because
[1:34:16] Ephraim got to a spot, that tribe got to
[1:34:18] a spot in their journey where God said
[1:34:22] Ephraim to his idols. I got no more to
[1:34:25] do with them.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; All from this to now God don't want
[1:34:30] nothing to do with you.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; You better We got to watch what steps we
[1:34:35] take.
[1:34:38] I mean, you can be blessed at the
[1:34:39] beginning, but it's what you're doing in
[1:34:42] between.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Don't be a one hit wonder.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Be consistent in your walk with Christ.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And how many We done had so many them
[1:34:55] testimonies throughout the years. We
[1:34:57] used to sing that song all the time.
[1:34:58] Restoration is finally come.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; And we But we sung it over and over
[1:35:03] again. Restoration has finally come for
[1:35:04] the same people. And like, uh, if if
[1:35:08] it's finally come, it should stay.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; They should only have to sing that song
[1:35:15] one time for you.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; But don't don't get so don't get so so
[1:35:21] so so engulfed in in in your idols and
[1:35:25] your sins and all that that you come on
[1:35:27] now.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; You ought to do things that get you
[1:35:30] closer to God.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say this to all my
[1:35:33] young people. We got we got Sunday
[1:35:35] school on Sunday mornings at 8:45. Get
[1:35:38] yourself in that Sunday school class. Uh
[1:35:40] get to learning these church ages.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Do the homework assignments
[1:35:45] so that you can spend time with God.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; There's not just no Sunday morning,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; you know, thing that we do.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; This is going to be something that we do
[1:35:55] throughout the week.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; All right. So, uh,
[1:36:02] here we we we we see we see this, but
[1:36:04] let let's just kind of go cuz I could
[1:36:05] have just stopped and preached there,
[1:36:07] but I'm going to just read it to you
[1:36:08] from the prophet. This next slide,
[1:36:12] remember Joseph, I mean, Jacob crossed
[1:36:14] his hands while he was praying for
[1:36:15] Ephraim. And from Nasse, he should have
[1:36:17] prayed for Manasseh. He should have had
[1:36:20] his right hand over that first that
[1:36:22] firstborn son, but he had it on
[1:36:24] Ephraim's head. Now the reason that that
[1:36:26] was because it was symbolic.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; This was the only time in scripture that
[1:36:32] we see the crossing of the hands like
[1:36:34] that.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; But this was very symbolic of something
[1:36:37] that was happening for our day.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells it to us.
[1:36:47] He says, "But notice
[1:36:50] another glorious revelation
[1:36:53] in this typing of Joseph.
[1:36:56] Joseph while in Egypt was given a
[1:37:00] gentile bride.
[1:37:02] And through her he received a family of
[1:37:06] two sons, Ephraim
[1:37:09] and Manasseh." Even the prophet puts the
[1:37:11] names the same way Jacob did.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; All right? Ephraim and Manasseh. Joseph
[1:37:17] asked his father to bless the two boys.
[1:37:19] He placed them in front of Jacob so that
[1:37:21] Manasseh, the firstborn would be on
[1:37:23] Jacob's right hand and Ephraim to the
[1:37:25] left. As Jacob was about to bless him,
[1:37:29] he crossed his hands. So that the right
[1:37:32] hand fell upon the younger, Joseph cried
[1:37:34] out, "Not so, father. This is the
[1:37:36] firstborn to your right." But Jacob
[1:37:38] said, "God has crossed my hands."
[1:37:44] Yes sir.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Here in type
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; we see that the blessing which belonged
[1:37:50] to the firstborn the Jew hallelujah was
[1:37:54] given over to the younger the gentile
[1:37:58] and through the cross.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:03] Hey, through the cross, through Jesus
[1:38:06] dying on a cross and the Jews rejecting
[1:38:10] him and putting him on the cross, that's
[1:38:12] how the blessing came to us, the
[1:38:14] Gentiles. It was through the cross.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. Amen.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Here in type we see the blessing which
[1:38:25] belonged to the firstborn, the Jew was
[1:38:28] given over to the younger of the Gentile
[1:38:30] through the cross cross hands of the
[1:38:32] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; The blessing comes through the cross.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; And it says Galatians 3:13-14,
[1:38:42] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[1:38:44] of the law, being made a curse for us.
[1:38:46] It is written, "Cursed is everyone that
[1:38:48] hangeth on a tree, that the blessing of
[1:38:50] Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[1:38:51] through Jesus Christ that we might
[1:38:53] receive the promise of the of the spirit
[1:38:55] through faith." The blessing of Abraham
[1:38:58] came through the cross to the Gentile.
[1:39:00] The Jews rejected the cross. Therefore,
[1:39:03] Jesus got the Gentile bride. Can you I
[1:39:07] mean, Brother Brandham told us that when
[1:39:08] we're when we're reading scripture, we
[1:39:11] ought to look in there, we have to see
[1:39:12] Christ in every scripture. in this whole
[1:39:16] story of Jacob actually crossing his
[1:39:18] hands
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; while praying for Ephraim, the younger
[1:39:22] son,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my my. And can you can you what what
[1:39:26] he's saying? Ephraim would have
[1:39:28] represented the Gentiles.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And he's exactly right because we
[1:39:32] Gentiles were worshiping idol gods. Yes,
[1:39:35] sir.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Before we came to Christ,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; we we were idol worshippers before
[1:39:41] before we knew anything about God. We
[1:39:43] were idol worshippers.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and see that that here's
[1:39:47] the thing that that idol worship if the
[1:39:50] Gentiles kind of grew up that way, that
[1:39:51] thing would be in your nature.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; And only the blood of Jesus Christ can
[1:39:56] get that stuff out of your nature.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's easy to go back to what you
[1:40:00] always was.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why you need the Holy
[1:40:05] Ghost to keep you out of them places.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's easy to get back into idol
[1:40:09] worship. Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; We got to fight daily.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen, church.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Thank God for this blessing that came
[1:40:19] through the cross.
[1:40:21] Amen. Let me see where I'm at. All
[1:40:24] right. I got I got a lot more to give
[1:40:27] y'all. And I I don't have a lot of time.
[1:40:32] So, I I got
[1:40:35] 15 more slides.
[1:40:43] and um Lord help me Jesus.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to rush through it.
[1:40:48] I'mma tell you that much. So I'm going
[1:40:50] just I'mma find I'mma find a place to to
[1:40:52] get out and um and it'll be a part
[1:40:55] three.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Let me um let me just um come back to
[1:41:01] this next slide.
[1:41:04] So
[1:41:08] Ephraim just say what have I to do
[1:41:10] anymore with idols?
[1:41:13] I have heard him and observed him. I'm
[1:41:17] like a green fur tree.
[1:41:20] For me is thy fruit found.
[1:41:24] Now, um, in the Bible, the green fur
[1:41:29] tree or simply the green tree often
[1:41:32] symbolizes life,
[1:41:35] vitality,
[1:41:37] uh, the enduring presence of God. So,
[1:41:40] I'm like a green fur tree. It's like it
[1:41:41] it symbolizes life, vitality, enduring
[1:41:43] presence of God. And also, it's a
[1:41:46] metaphor for resilience.
[1:41:48] Oh my,
[1:41:50] I I I like that. And see as as a
[1:41:53] believer sometimes you have to
[1:41:55] demonstrate resilience.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Random preached a message
[1:41:59] perseverance,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; right? And I'm talking about when
[1:42:02] everything is against you,
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; I mean the devil done threw the devil
[1:42:08] done threw the kitchen sink at you.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Right? Throwing everything he can at
[1:42:12] you. But but but when you can when you
[1:42:14] can look the devil in the eye
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; and say I am like a green fur tree.
[1:42:22] Amen.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; You got to understand these metaphors.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; I'm like a green fur tree. That mean I'm
[1:42:27] resilient.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Quit ain't in me.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Giving up. I don't even taught that kind
[1:42:33] of language.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It It's something in me that
[1:42:36] tell me to go ahead
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; and I'mma keep pressing through
[1:42:39] everything. Like mama say I'm still
[1:42:42] still
[1:42:43] pressing my battle.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; I'm bound and determined to go on all
[1:42:49] the way. That's right.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; And and like auntie say, it's going to
[1:42:52] take a stronger wind than that,
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, devil can throw
[1:42:56] everything at you,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; but I'm like a green fur tree.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; It's a metaphor for resilience,
[1:43:07] especially
[1:43:09] in the face of adversity,
[1:43:12] and can rep and and being like a green
[1:43:14] virtue can represent hope, divine
[1:43:17] blessing. And I like this one. And
[1:43:20] restoration.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Right. And and and look at it says the
[1:43:24] evergreen nature of the fur tree also
[1:43:28] connects it to the concept of eternal
[1:43:30] life and God's unchanging nature. So so
[1:43:34] you know and we all are familiar with
[1:43:36] this the the next uh thing. The
[1:43:38] evergreen trees are cor characterized by
[1:43:40] their year round foliage meaning they
[1:43:43] retain their leaves and needles
[1:43:45] throughout all seasons.
[1:43:47] and and and a evergreen tree.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I'm like a green fur tree, which means
[1:43:53] I'm I'm an evergreen. Oh, come on,
[1:43:55] y'all. Y'all got it.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; I'm an evergreen.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If I had to be tight to a
[1:44:02] tree, you know, they ask these
[1:44:03] questions. If if you could be, amen, a a
[1:44:07] tree, what tree would you be? If you can
[1:44:09] be this and what what would you be? If
[1:44:11] you could be an animal, what animal
[1:44:12] would you be? They ask all these kind of
[1:44:14] question. But but me, I'm going to tell
[1:44:15] you, I'm a evergreen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; I'm like a green fur tree.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; You understand what a evergreen? The
[1:44:24] reason I choose to be evergreen is
[1:44:25] because I'm always green.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; In the summer,
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; I'm green.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Huh? In the spring,
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; I'm green.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; When the leaves are falling off the
[1:44:38] other trees in the fall,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I'm still green,
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; brother. when the sap is going down and
[1:44:46] to the leaves of the other trees.
[1:44:49] Hallelujah. To try to preserve them
[1:44:52] during the winter season. I don't need
[1:44:55] that process because I'm green.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:00] [Applause]
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not just green. I'm evergreen.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; This is what this is what the scriptur
[1:45:11] is telling us. He says, "I'm he says I I
[1:45:14] am like a green fern tree."
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; When you begin to recognize who you are,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, it's No, no, no, no. I
[1:45:24] I've been through this. I've been
[1:45:26] through that. And this what this why
[1:45:27] they said Ephraim should say, "What have
[1:45:29] I to do anymore with idols?
[1:45:35] I've heard them. God, I heard you
[1:45:37] speaking to me.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; I hear your voice. That ain't just the
[1:45:41] voice of brother Jack, but Lord, that
[1:45:43] that's you speaking to me.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; And since I I heard you,
[1:45:49] not only did I hear you, but I observed,
[1:45:54] I mean, I'm really involved in this. And
[1:45:56] and and and I don't know about you, but
[1:45:58] as a God speaking to me something like
[1:46:00] this, I'm going to try to find ways
[1:46:03] to get rid of idols.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; I mean, I just start thinking in my
[1:46:08] mind, what what can I do,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Lord? What can I do? I I like I told
[1:46:13] y'all when I I read the read the
[1:46:16] definition, they talk about idols can be
[1:46:18] like soccer and celebrities and stuff
[1:46:20] like this, but but uh for me, football
[1:46:23] is my it's a it's a problem. Basketball,
[1:46:28] it's a problem. That those are things
[1:46:30] that I really enjoy. And I'mma be
[1:46:33] honest,
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; you know, you know, before um before I
[1:46:37] got to this age, I used to play all
[1:46:39] these sports,
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; right? But uh but now I I can't play. So
[1:46:43] So you know, some you just sit around
[1:46:44] and you watch other people if you I I
[1:46:46] had to get rid of I had to get rid of my
[1:46:48] TV
[1:46:50] because I know what I what it would do
[1:46:52] to me.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; And and then then not not only that, uh
[1:46:57] we brought the TVs back, but disconnect
[1:46:59] the cable.
[1:47:01] That TV can't do nothing without no
[1:47:03] cable connection to it.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; So, I disconnected the cable in my house
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; on my TV.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's to protect me.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; It's to protect me from me.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; N I'm I'mma go a little further. I'm
[1:47:26] going just tell tell the truth and shame
[1:47:27] the devil. I ain't got no cable
[1:47:29] connected, but now I got a telephone.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; And the devil just keep overriding
[1:47:34] everything you trying every every road
[1:47:37] block you put up.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; The devil got something else. And on my
[1:47:42] phone, soon as football season come,
[1:47:43] they just start sending me uh messages.
[1:47:46] This game and this game and and this
[1:47:49] game and and and this happened to this
[1:47:51] person and what happened? What? What?
[1:47:53] And as soon as you click on one thing,
[1:47:55] they gonna keep sending you more and
[1:47:57] more and more.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; You ain't got no cable, but you got a
[1:48:04] Hulu account.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; And you got you got a a ESPN account.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Sunday Ticket account.
[1:48:17] You you you you don't go to the movies,
[1:48:19] but you got Hallelujah. a Netflix
[1:48:22] account.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; You got uh Disney.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, how the church know about
[1:48:36] Abram and his idols.
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; It's time to do an inventory.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; God, how do I get myself wrapped up in
[1:48:49] all this type of stuff? Yeah.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Why don't you uh fasted for 30 days?
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Cut off your account for 30 days.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; You know what they say after 21 days,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; something become a habit to you.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; You can break a habit if you just a
[1:49:12] 30-day fast. I don't want no none of
[1:49:13] this for 30 days.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; And do it in the middle of the season.
[1:49:26] I know I'm asking something hard,
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; but I think what the Lord Jesus did when
[1:49:32] he went to the cross
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; was a lot,
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; a lot harder,
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; but we got to do our own personal
[1:49:40] inventories. And I might not have called
[1:49:42] out something that you you deal with,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; But come on, let the Holy Ghost deal
[1:49:46] with you and and and help you through
[1:49:48] these things. Amen. Maybe you might
[1:49:51] maybe you might might need to fast
[1:49:52] Amazon.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, that hurt somebody. Lord, that hurt
[1:49:57] them.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Packages showing up at your house every
[1:50:01] day.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; You You know the delivery people by
[1:50:06] name.
[1:50:09] You shop too much.
[1:50:13] And hey, it's the same technology when
[1:50:16] you shop. Have you ever noticed that
[1:50:18] when you click on buy,
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; you might be interested in
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; and they they have a way of persuading
[1:50:27] you and suggesting to you and before you
[1:50:29] know it, you clicking over here and you
[1:50:31] clicking over there and yeah, you bought
[1:50:33] this skirt and this dress. Guess what?
[1:50:35] This so and so got the same dress and
[1:50:37] now you're on their site for hours
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; trying to get home before your husband
[1:50:44] get home to get the packages.
[1:50:49] and get them all unpacked and throw out
[1:50:50] them boxes because you don't want him to
[1:50:52] see all this stuff that you done bought.
[1:50:54] Can I tell you something? Some of us
[1:50:55] shop more on Amazon than we did just
[1:50:57] going to a regular store.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; You would have never even went to a
[1:51:01] regular store and did that. Now, some
[1:51:02] sisters used to do that and they would
[1:51:04] hide that stuff in their trunk and and
[1:51:07] give it to their sister and keep this
[1:51:09] until I
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Okay, I think we in there.
[1:51:16] We're doing all kind of things. But now
[1:51:18] Amazon done made this thing so so easy
[1:51:20] and just one package after the next
[1:51:22] package and the next package. Maybe just
[1:51:24] fast for about 30 days cuz you know in
[1:51:27] 21 days you can break a habit.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; I got to come out.
[1:51:45] this um
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; this um
[1:51:52] I was looking at this and and and this
[1:51:55] when you hit next about this this
[1:51:58] evergreen tree and I put this this AI
[1:52:01] summary in a Google search. These are
[1:52:03] notes. I want y'all to also just be
[1:52:07] careful because when you go to Google
[1:52:09] and search out stuff and they give you
[1:52:10] the AI summaries, it's not all the time
[1:52:12] are they right.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; AI is pulling information from whoever
[1:52:17] put it out there.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; And it just presents to you what what it
[1:52:21] thinks everybody else is expecting. So
[1:52:23] don't don't don't ne you have to
[1:52:25] continue to do your research. Right? So
[1:52:27] here it says uh evergreens often
[1:52:29] symbolize immortality and eternal life
[1:52:31] because they retain their leaves through
[1:52:33] throughout the winter. It also
[1:52:36] symbolizes eternal life and the promise
[1:52:38] of ultimate restoration in scriptures.
[1:52:40] Look at that. This is what AI said that
[1:52:44] uh and the reason I'm saying that the
[1:52:45] scripture says
[1:52:47] Ephraim shall say what have I to do
[1:52:49] anymore with idols? I have heard him and
[1:52:53] observed him. I am like a green fur tree
[1:52:57] which means an evergreen tree. From me
[1:53:00] is thy fruit found. And it's saying this
[1:53:03] now. Now this is what Ephraim, the tribe
[1:53:05] of Ephraim is saying in the book of
[1:53:07] Hosea. But notice what the AI church
[1:53:09] says. It also symbolized the evergreen
[1:53:12] tree. The fur tree, the green fur tree.
[1:53:14] Evergreen tree. It's a symbol of a
[1:53:17] promise of ultimate restoration.
[1:53:23] So when he says this,
[1:53:27] he's turning from his idols and he says
[1:53:30] he says, "I'm like a green fur tree.
[1:53:32] From me is thy fruit found." It's it's
[1:53:36] man, I don't change with the seasons.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; I'm resilient.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; And and especially when it comes to
[1:53:45] adversity, that's when you see my true
[1:53:48] colors.
[1:53:50] But but when he when he when he
[1:53:52] identifies himself in this manner, it
[1:53:53] also says that there's a promise of
[1:53:56] ultimate
[1:53:59] restoration
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; because remember
[1:54:03] when we looked at uh Hosea 4, I believe
[1:54:06] it was and and just kind of he was he
[1:54:10] God got God to God away with Let me go
[1:54:14] back to this slide and I'm I'mma end
[1:54:15] right here. Let me give you the slide
[1:54:17] here, sis. I think it's going to be
[1:54:20] slide five.
[1:54:22] Yeah, slide five. Let me just read that
[1:54:24] and I'm I'mma I'm I'mma just cut off
[1:54:25] right here. We'll come back and pick it
[1:54:27] up. Um I thank God for uh our full band
[1:54:33] this morning.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:40] But this got to be put up.
[1:54:44] So, um I'll I'll cut off and that way we
[1:54:47] have time to do all we need to do and
[1:54:48] sisters can see sister Tina, you know,
[1:54:51] after and then I'll come back and pick
[1:54:53] this up. Um not next week cuz brother
[1:54:55] Caleb will be with us next week, but
[1:54:57] I'll pick it up. Amen. A little bit. But
[1:54:59] this scripture here
[1:55:01] when it's I'm a green fur tree. I'm a
[1:55:03] green fur tree.
[1:55:05] But go just go back one please.
[1:55:11] He um said here in Hosea 4, I mean
[1:55:14] before we got to Hosea 14, he said,
[1:55:17] "Israel slideth back as a backsliding
[1:55:20] hea."
[1:55:24] Now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in
[1:55:26] a large place.
[1:55:28] Ephraim
[1:55:30] is joined to idols.
[1:55:34] Let him alone. But
[1:55:38] Ephraim, how'd you get there? What
[1:55:40] happened in your life that got you to a
[1:55:43] spot where God had to say, "Just leave
[1:55:46] him alone.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Don't even work with them no more."
[1:55:52] That's bad.
[1:55:54] That's bad. That's crossing the line.
[1:55:57] But in in in all of that, still God say,
[1:56:01] "I'm going to restore backsliding
[1:56:04] Israel." And when he says that he going
[1:56:06] to restore them, um, he sees himself as
[1:56:10] a green fur tree
[1:56:12] still bearing fruit.
[1:56:16] Remember that definition I just gave
[1:56:18] you? It says it that evergreen tree also
[1:56:21] meant ultimate restoration.
[1:56:26] That's one to write down because we're
[1:56:28] coming back to that
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; ultimate
[1:56:33] restoration.
[1:56:36] cuz we're going to see something in
[1:56:37] scripture where it seemed like they were
[1:56:38] lost, but then we're going to pick up
[1:56:41] something else in scripture because uh
[1:56:43] Jacob said, I mean uh um yeah, Jacob
[1:56:46] said, "Let let their name be named. Let
[1:56:50] my name be named on them." Well, we're
[1:56:53] going to find in scripture where his
[1:56:56] name was named on them.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got we got a little ways to go.
[1:57:02] Let's stop there.
[1:57:04] Let's pray. Musicians, y'all can come.
[1:57:08] Father, we are grateful
[1:57:11] for the word.
[1:57:15] Thank you for
[1:57:18] God, your truth.
[1:57:24] Thank you for a prophet that helps us to
[1:57:26] be able to to navigate the scriptures,
[1:57:31] helps us to end up in the right place
[1:57:33] with the things that we see. But it's
[1:57:35] not just about seeing,
[1:57:38] but it's about doing.
[1:57:40] And Lord, uh, this is just a journey
[1:57:42] that we we trust that the Holy Spirit
[1:57:44] would just continue to take us through
[1:57:45] and that you would
[1:57:49] you would speak to us, that you would um
[1:57:51] help us, Lord, just to shine the light
[1:57:55] on the inside of us that we could find
[1:57:57] those areas that we we need to we need
[1:58:00] to just
[1:58:02] get better in. The scripture tells us to
[1:58:06] to lay aside
[1:58:08] every sin and every weight that so
[1:58:12] easily possesses us.
[1:58:15] And Lord, there are things that in our
[1:58:17] life, they might not be sins, but they
[1:58:20] are weights. So help us, oh God, to
[1:58:24] to hear the voice of the Lord. And as as
[1:58:27] as Ephraim said, "What more have I to do
[1:58:31] with idols?" God, let us have that same
[1:58:34] question.
[1:58:36] What more have I to do with it? I want
[1:58:39] to be free from that.
[1:58:42] And I believe the word of God is here to
[1:58:44] bring liberty.
[1:58:46] So I pray Lord for every heart that and
[1:58:49] every ear that has heard the word. Trust
[1:58:52] oh God that you uh will get glory from
[1:58:55] the words that have been spoken.
[1:58:58] It's in Jesus name
[1:59:01] that we pray.
[1:59:03] Amen.
[1:59:06] Let's stand to our feet and Amen. sing a
[1:59:08] song of worship. Brother Solomon, I'll
[1:59:11] turn the service back over to you. Amen.
[1:59:16] Heavenly Father,
[1:59:18] I appreciate
[1:59:23] you.
[1:59:26] Come on, tell the Lord. Oh heavenly
[1:59:29] father
[1:59:31] I appreciate
[1:59:35] you.

[2:00:03] before you heavenly father.
[2:00:07] I
[2:00:09] appreciate
[2:00:12] you.
[2:00:14] Son of God, I appreciate you. Oh, son of
[2:00:18] God.
[2:00:23] G you.
[2:00:27] Oh,
[2:00:30] son of God.
[2:00:33] I appreciate
[2:00:37] you.
[2:00:39] Say, I love you. Oh,
[2:00:43] I love you.
[2:00:46] Adore you.
[2:00:49] I bow down
[2:00:52] before you son of God.
[2:00:57] I appreciate
[2:01:01] you. Come on. Heavenly father. Oh,
[2:01:07] heavenly father
[2:01:10] I appreciate
[2:01:13] you.
[2:01:16] Heavenly Father,
[2:01:19] Heavenly Father,
[2:01:22] I am free.
[2:01:24] She
[2:01:28] Oh, I love you, Lord. I love you.
[2:01:34] Adore you.
[2:01:37] I bow down
[2:01:40] before you, heavenly father.
[2:01:46] I appreciate
[2:01:50] you.
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:55] Can he reach
[2:01:58] down his hand
[2:02:01] for me
[2:02:07] when he reach
[2:02:10] way down
[2:02:13] for me.
[2:02:19] I was lost
[2:02:22] and undone
[2:02:25] without God
[2:02:28] for his son.
[2:02:31] When he reached
[2:02:34] down his hand
[2:02:37] for me
[2:02:41] one more time.
[2:02:43] Oh, he reached
[2:02:46] down his hand
[2:02:49] for me.
[2:02:55] Oh, when he reached
[2:02:58] down his hand
[2:03:01] for me.
[2:03:07] I was lost
[2:03:10] and undone all
[2:03:13] without God
[2:03:16] for his son.
[2:03:19] When he reached
[2:03:22] down his hand
[2:03:25] for me.
[2:03:31] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:33] Hallelujah.
[2:03:35] Amen. Can we bow our heads? Heavenly
[2:03:37] Father,
[2:03:39] we're so grateful, Lord God,
[2:03:42] that by the cross of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:44] Christ, you could reach down your hand
[2:03:46] to us. Even as Israel crossed his hand,
[2:03:50] Lord, the blessing went from the Jews,
[2:03:52] Lord, to the Gentiles and you reached
[2:03:54] down your hands to us, Lord. Father, we
[2:03:58] were wrapped up in our idols and
[2:04:00] worshiping all kind of false gods, Lord
[2:04:02] Jesus. But Lord God, some way, somehow,
[2:04:07] you sent forth a message, Lord Jesus,
[2:04:10] that searched us out where we were and
[2:04:12] found us, Lord Jesus. You found a way to
[2:04:15] restore your truth to your people,
[2:04:18] Father. We are the beneficiaries, Lord
[2:04:20] God, of the cross of Calvary. We're
[2:04:22] beneficiaries of the resurrection of our
[2:04:25] Lord Jesus Christ. We are beneficiaries,
[2:04:29] Lord, of the message of the hour. Lord,
[2:04:32] thank you so much, Father. Thank you for
[2:04:34] using our pastor, Lord, to speak to us,
[2:04:37] Lord. We heard you, Lord. We recognize
[2:04:40] your voice, Lord. We're so grateful,
[2:04:42] Lord God, that Lord, you will step out
[2:04:44] of eternity and use the vessel, Lord
[2:04:46] Jesus, to come and speak to your people.
[2:04:50] We pray, almighty God, that your people,
[2:04:52] as they have heard, that they receive it
[2:04:54] and recognize who each one is. Lord, get
[2:04:57] all the idols out of our lives, Lord.
[2:05:00] all the false gods, Lord. And let's just
[2:05:02] worship you, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:05:04] Father, we pray your blessings upon our
[2:05:06] pastor, Lord God. Father, he came, Lord,
[2:05:10] and he gave of himself, Lord. He got
[2:05:12] himself out of the way used vessel the
[2:05:15] strength that he has lost. Lord, restore
[2:05:17] to him 100fold, Lord. Bless them for his
[2:05:20] service, Lord. Bless these musicians,
[2:05:22] Lord, for their service, Lord. All that
[2:05:25] they put out, Lord God. Father, they
[2:05:27] work to perfect their gifts, Lord, to to
[2:05:29] bring it, to create an atmosphere where
[2:05:31] God and man can have fellowship around
[2:05:34] the word. Father, bless them, each one,
[2:05:36] Lord. Every song that was sung, your
[2:05:40] people, Lord God, attentive hearts,
[2:05:42] believing hearts, believing your word,
[2:05:45] Lord, bless them, Lord, for receiving
[2:05:47] what you have given to them. Father, as
[2:05:50] we leave this place, Lord, may you ever
[2:05:52] abide in us, Lord Jesus, that we may
[2:05:55] bring forth your truth to the people of
[2:05:57] the world that will receive it, Lord.
[2:05:59] You still have children, Lord, out
[2:06:01] there, Lord, worshiping idols, Lord God,
[2:06:04] worshiping false gods, Lord Jesus. They
[2:06:06] need to hear what we've heard, Lord
[2:06:08] Jesus. So use us, Lord God, to minister
[2:06:11] to your people, Lord, to fulfill the
[2:06:13] great commission, Lord, that you gave
[2:06:15] your saints, Lord, when you were
[2:06:17] ascending. We love you, Father. Keep
[2:06:19] your people. Bless each one. Prosper
[2:06:21] them on their way, Lord Jesus. Protect
[2:06:24] them from all harm and all danger. We
[2:06:26] ask in the blessed and lovely and all
[2:06:28] powerful name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:06:31] Amen and amen. Amen. God bless you
[2:06:33] saints, our brothers and sist brothers
[2:06:36] who come and dismiss you at this time.
[2:06:38] God bless you.

[2:06:47] out his hand
[2:06:50] for me
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:59] down his hand
[2:07:02] for me.
[2:07:06] [Applause]
[2:07:08] Oh, I was lost
[2:07:11] and undone
[2:07:14] without God
[2:07:17] for his son.
[2:07:20] And he reach
[2:07:23] down his hand
[2:07:26] for me.
[2:07:32] He reach

[2:07:37] for me.
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:44] He reach
[2:07:46] way down
[2:07:49] for me.
[2:07:53] [Music]
[2:07:55] Oh, I was lost
[2:07:58] and undone
[2:08:01] without God
[2:08:04] for his son.
[2:08:07] And he reached
[2:08:09] down his hand
[2:08:12] for me.
