grant peace to the minds of the weary oh Father we ask these many blessings oh father in Jesus name we pray church say amen amen musicians you may be dismissed amen thank you amen if you grab your Bibles this morning amen it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord amen we're going to read from John 3:16 very familiar passage of scripture uh I don't know if it's possible to overuse the scripture but this scripture has been used at football games and all kind of things and and uh but we're going to just look at this scripture a little bit deeper amen it says it reads on this wise for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen it's been a while since I've had the opportunity to be before you amen the last time I ministered was at my mother's eulogy and the last time I ministered here was the day she took ill I uh just kind of needed time but God has a way Amen to get you past these things and it's time to move on yes amen even now little choked up but uh God is good he am he is certainly good and uh it's a blessing to be here amen amen I want to this message this morning and I it's going to be a little different from what you usually see of me brother Willie last week he kind of say you know ministers will get up and we try to amen we get into a rhythm get into a flow but the Lord has just laid on my heart to just come at just a little bit different amen I'm G to preach on the transformative power of love amen amen amen the transformative power of love and I'm going to try not to do too much reading but there's a lot of quotes and different things from the prophet and a lot of scriptures and different things that help me to get out of the way I just want you to uh hear what the Lord is saying the prophet said this message came from the message called love he preached it in 1958 ironically on March 14th which is my wife's birthday he says here he says uh reading John 3:16 tonight although small in its portion holds enough value to save the world it's got enough value in it to heal every sick person that's on the Earth today it's a pardon to every sinner it's Joy to every weary person it's hope for the Hopeless it's food for the saint it's healing for the sick it's pardon to those who are troubled it's all these things to you if you receive it as that it's talking about love if you receive it as that now the prophet in this message was talking about uh the pardon the man that had done the crime and he was guilty of doing a crime and uh he was supposed to go before a firing squad but uh it says in here that he had had a friend who cared for him and that friend uh went to the President Abraham Lincoln and pleaded on his behalf to be [Music] pardoned I wonder how many of us in here this morning would go through those measures for the another brother or sister that we would go before and plead for one another one that might be going through something yes yes yes and go before the Lord and asked the Lord to just pardon my brother right or my sister but this man had such love in his heart for this fellow he went to the president and pleaded for his pardon he stood in the gap for his friend amen now the prophet preached that message standing in the Gap I don't want to get ahead of myself but he says in order to stand in the Gap there has to be a love there to be qualified to stand in the gap it was the love of Christ amen the love of God I should say that produced Christ to stand in the Gap yes sir for the human race you see when perfect Love Takes Over It produces amen Grace yes sir Christ is Grace the love of God to us word produced Christ to Pardon our sins are you with me this morning amen however we see in this little story here the man didn't receive it right why because it came so simple this can't be from the president it's just something scribbled on some paper and he didn't believe it and he had to go before the firing Squad but he had the pardon yes he did in his hand all he had to do was receive the pardon I'll say this morning that we here today all we have to do is receive the pardon I don't care what you're going through what you might have done what you might do in the future that blood never loses its power amen hallelujah some 2,000 years ago on Calvary Hill amen it was shed for you and I to buy paron amen the prophet says said now there's two different types of love I think brother Willie hit on this last week or week before when you preach last week week before one of them he was talking about that filio love and that agapy love said that filio love is that one that uh had the one you have for your wife it'll make a man flirt with her or insult her you shoot his brains out over her filing your love accompanies jealousy and it'll make you do all kind of things unseemly but that agapy love would make you pray for his sinful Soul the difference between the two loves God loves God's love is the beginning of love it's the Fountain of love and the church today is lacking that that real agape love that makes you have love for your enemy I ain't even talking about your brother and sister but your enemy he goes on and he says if we only had that kind of love there'd be a Revival this nation from coast to coast and from north to south and the reason that we don't have that love that is the main reason the church is not progressing like it should he said we don't need theology we only need real love to go with the theology he say We'll argue about many things whether that we should be baptized backwards or forward or whatever more but that don't make any difference how we're baptized or what church you belong to or what evidences that you might that you have you're a Christian if you haven't got love you haven't got God he said you haven't got love you haven't got God see you see we we we we we got see the devil's sneaking love produces we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're in between we're we're we're traveling from one place to another and as our pastor would would would would would describe it we're in the hallway but I just believe that he's waiting on us yes sir yeah amen can you hear me amen I believe because the church is not the building right the church the beauty of the church is the character of the people what good would it do us to go into a building stained glass windows plush peels steeple fresh paint on the wall and we don't have love for one [Music] another what good are we to anybody to the community at large to all of our individual families yes to one another there are real problems before us we come to this building and we we we come and we worship together we we we sing together we pray together but in many cases we don't have real love for one another love would produce things yes sir it would cause the supernatural to be in our midst when you have love one for the other it'll when you have love for one another it causes God to move we look at this young fell honor Von Winkler for many that many familiar with the story yes but for those of you who are not I'll bring you up to speed he lived in Switzerland many years ago Switzerland a little group had pulled away from from Germany and started a little economy to themselves up in the mountains Switzerland they wasn't a Waring people the prophet called them a peaceful people but all of a sudden there came a war against him and the Swiss they got their old rocks and sickles things like that they wasn't a fighting people they didn't they didn't even have have an army and uh they were standing there this great army machine of Germany came uh marching up on them coming like a brick wall this is description of the Prophet they didn't have a chance but there was one this anavan Winkler kissed his wife and his babies goodbye a few hours before he went to battle he loved his home he loved his Nation therefore his love constrained him to do something about it he said to the rest of the army he said come follow me he says uh get your your your your your your your your your arms and things and just follow me what are you going to do and he threw up his arms and he looked towards the deepest of the Spears and he marched on like this great big they marched on like this great big wall and found the deepest Spear and he screamed Make Way for Liberty and he started running with his hands in the air and screamed again Make Way for liberty before he left his life he said across the mountain Yonder is a little white home and two little children and a sweet wife that I'll never see no more take care of them but I'll give my life to defend them amen sir amen love makes you do things and when the church gets the real love of God in their hearts they'll do things they'll not be ashamed Christ don't want you to be it isn't so much to be loyal he doesn't want your patronage he wants your fellowship yes amen amen amen that's what God wants is to have fellowship with you now aror Von Winkler he stood in the Gap yes he did for the nation in which he lived in the people uhh uh to finish the story they got so much courage after they saw what he did oh my they came in with the sickles and rocks and anything else they can find and they beat that Army back but he stood in the Gap sir amen and sacrificed his life amen for the love of that Nation Amen brother brandom was talking about that Maniac in uh Portland there and he gave the testimony about how uh the big maniac the guy was wanted to kill him and he would do it because he had killed before and he rushed out uh to the platform and brother Brandon was preaching there and he let out a big great big screen and he set his seat together his eyes pushed back and he started walking towards me and he said you hypocrite you snake in the grass upon this platform posing yourself as a servant of God you're nothing but a hypocrite everyone kept still about that time two policemen that I had led the Christ back in the dressing room run out to grab them and I mentioned to them I said this is not a Flesh and Blood Affair but the strange thing was that when the man went up there I wasn't afraid now perfect love cast out all fear the reason that people won't take God at his word for healing they don't love him well enough because you're scared he won't keep his word that's the reason the people fear somebody else will say something against them if they receive the Holy Spirit they're afraid somebody will laugh at me and make fun but when love comes in Joel 25 amen is sort of the theme of this year I will restore the years that the Locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and they shall eat plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God and hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never never be ashamed shall never be ashamed so the prophet is going on and he is describing this issue he said the man got real close to me and the people just hushed and he draw back his great Hulk and he spit all over my face now I remember a while ago when uh brother Jack was sort of preaching on the same thing and I I can remember I was sitting back there and I say oh no Lord wait a minute I ain't ready cuz that fell spit on me he probably would have beat me down but see that's the difference when the Holy Ghost takes over yes sir exactly right see and see brother brandom he he was a boxer yes sir now he was no pushover right what no pushover but something that came over him in that moment that he was able to love that fell yes sir despite whatever he do now let's just look at this and look continue here he's the man uh uh let's see here lost my spot now it's got to be real no here we go okay he says you snake in the grass I'm going to show you how much servant of God you are I'm going to knock you into the middle of that audience he was well aable to do it too but he didn't know God that's what the the main thing I kept real still never said a thing and my heart was going out to him now you just can't imagine that it's got to be real the people have seen so much put on till they're sick and tired of it amen but what you are if you're a Christian be one God's grace will make you one and the man walked closer to me and I loved him CUA that I knew he didn't mean that I thought it's the devil that makes him makes that man say that those things he's a man who would love his family like I do mine he would like to eat and drink and fellowship but the thing of it is because the devil has possessed him he's a human being the same as I am those kinds of thoughts and you can't do that unless God does it for you and when he got close to me he drew back his arms and he said I'm going to knock you into the middle of that audience and break every bone in your little old frail body of yours I never opened my mouth and said a word but then all of a sudden something be to speak and the Holy Ghost began to speak and said because you have challenged the spirit of God tonight you'll fall over my feet there was both threats and prophecy and he said I'm going to knock you out into the middle of the audience the spirit of God said you'll fall over my feet and he said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over and he drew back his arm to strike me and still there was no fear I wasn't there I I wasn't there because I wanted to be seen I was there with a Comm commission from God to the people and when he started to strike something appeared he said Satan leave the man and when he did his great eyes seemed to push back his teeth set together and he turned around and fell over my feet till the policeman had to come roll him off he said what was it love conquered the mightiest enemy amen there is on the face of the earth is love what a little inside now of life here the next testimony I have was the prophet in Mexico standing amen there uh 20,000 came to Christ that night uh there was Catholic and evangelicals he saysi want you uh uh I want people who has never received Christ and they tagged 20,000 but there was a little woman down there screaming with a blanket amen and uh Billy was out there and they gave out the prayer cards and the people around 100 300 ushers and the ushers couldn't keep that little woman out she was climbing over their backs many were familiar with the story her baby was dead in her arms but she had to get to the prophet see love will make you do things even when the child was dead the love of that mother wouldn't give up see love produces Supernatural I don't want to continue to be labeled just with all of these testimonies but I have many when my wife uh showed me what was going on with uh the tumors in the head and we seen them and she went on to the doctor and uh to get him biopsy and uh again we remember this from last time we had to wait for the diagnosis wait for the doctor's report I can remember the last time it was seven years ago and and uh waiting was it's it's it's I I can't say fear but you're just praying constantly Lord let it be negative but it came back positive well Lord we'll go from here and a lot of times when hear my wife's testimony and it just probably went all over and but they never hear the testimony of the husband what is he going through at this time so I sit there and I Lord how the devil is attacking my home how does that devil come in and attack my bride Lord what is this I begin to question why why Lord must she go through this again we had overcome the first time and we was still rejoicing and here come the Old Devil again but as I studied the scripture I knew I had to stand in the Gap amen I told l i you know said why her and not me why must she go through this maybe she handle it better than me but it it's a you know you have to continue to go about life's daily tasks but in your mind you're constantly Lord then you constantly ask are you okay you feel all right yeah I'm all right leave me alone all right I'm just checking just checking but you're concerned and in your mind you begin to go back and you think on life all of the different things the arguments the time where you say I'm not speaking and you say well Lord I didn't mean it I need a here Lord what would I do so you just begin to pray and ask God to touch your body you know when we was going through some things in my family and I read that story about aror Von Winkler and I can remember when I was going through and there was turmoil in the home the wife was upset the children was upset and it seemed like all of the guns was turned on the husband all of this is your fault you you you you did this you didn't do that you you you well wait a minute now I got up every morning I went to work I provided you had shoes on your feet clothes on your back refrigerator stayed full Transportation you had this you had that D but you you you and naturally you would want to defend yourself no you I'm not going to keep but I had to be there was a war going on and I had to be on oon Winkler I had to fall on the sword stop defending yourself you see when this Maniac came up to the prophet he loved him he never said a word and when I got that revelation we were talking brother Jack and I we were talking and it hit me say he said now you got it quit defending yourself cuz see now you defend yourself and then they defend their self and be see all you doing is stirring up the devil and he sit back they'll never come together but as being the stronger vessel the man Christ in the family you got to take that walk to calary for the sake of those that are saying you you you amen I had to fall on the sword not knowing what was coming I may have been right I'm sure in a lot of cases I wasn't right but I I I Lord whatever I have to do I take it to the children I'll take it what did I not do right what did I not do I'll take it I'll take it I'll take it I'll take it then I'll take it to the Lord in prayer am amen amen and we'll keep moving on reminded of a testimony with a prophet there was this man and his wife that the little girl was dying she was on the machine the machine was breathing for and they was trying to get the prophet please come pray for her and uh the prophet says well I I I don't know if uh I'll be able to make it he he he he he was they had to fly him in but he said when he finally got there the man if I'm not mistaken right the man was a minister and he said the church and all the man's friends was at the hospital entrance praying for this for this little girl and he said such a outpouring of Love such an outpouring of love touched him so he went in and they uh the nurses was in there with the little girl and they were uh had them oxygen on they said well you can come on in and he hadn't got anything from the Lord but while he was in there he had a vision and he saw a little girl playing and he goes on and says that the love of the people touched the heart of God Amen and Rose that little girl up off that sick bed there was another story where uh this man was ill and the wife uh was calling for brother brandham but the Lord told brother brandham he was praying for the man said tell him that he's going to die to get his life in order and there was he had another close friend and the close friend was talking to brother Brandon and he says there's nothing I can do do I I'm not a Healer I just I can I pray but we I've already gotten a word from the Lord and the man began to just weep and he said my buddy oh my buddy and brother brandom was off ministering and he was in his room and he had had woke waken up out of his sleep and he saw this lady sitting in the room and she had on very particular garment and he looked over and there was another man had on a very particular garment white suit with red tie this that and the other and she had on maybe a brown dress with a certain kind of coat and he said how did these people get in my room my door was locked so he said he bid himself to say ah this is a vision so the vision went for and the woman just looked over at him and smiled and the man looked over at him and smiled and it goes on and he woke up and he called and said uh is the people there is the wife there he says yes the man is he he he he'll be he'll be gone in a minute uh you won't be able to make it so he said put the wife is the wife wearing this they describe what she was wearing and the man does he wear says well you you described them to the tea and he said put the wife on the phone and he told her your husband shall live as thus saith the Lord right naturally the woman's confused cuz you said a while ago that he was going to die that to make ready she says but the love hello of his friend yes sir touch the heart of God and the Lord answered the prayer the message standing in the Gap the Prophet this was a few months after the seals and the prophet was like of a better word upset because the people wouldn't believe they didn't see it they didn't quite grasp what was going on and he kind of got to a point where he said I'm just going to go out into the woods and be a uh a guide ready to leave the field and I if I have the story all quite right I don't want to just keep reading it and uh said I want to go off into the field and there was came a situation he they wanted him to pray for somebody says I can't pray for the people because I don't have the love for the people he say and I'll be a hypocrite see he needed love restored the prophet yes sir because see love is what do it yes it does Amen that transformative Power of Love so he said I I can't and in this message here it goes on to talk about different ones uh uh Jonah Jonah was a prophet sent to Nineveh but Jonah didn't want to go to Nineveh he didn't like them people he didn't he didn't like them people he afraid of them but as he was running down to Tar he own the ship and the ship because he disobeyed God everybody on the ship was going to die Jonah love for the people on the ship see he had a change of heart see he went through all of that going the opposite direction ction going to tares and on the ship and in the midst of that God gave him a heart transplant he said these people shouldn't die because of some I did bind my hands and feet and throw me overboard see he stood in the gap for those men on the ship that were strangers but he said Lord take I I was wrong throw me overboard and and and and that was that was death and the people were saved we know the story went on to Nineveh and did what God had told him to do there many other testimonies and situations in the scripture that I have here but I I I I I want to bring it bring it home we we ain't going to be before you long going to be before you long on that morning my we we we we we we got the results my wife got the results of the biopsy and I happen to have them right here with me this morning y'all know these medical terms are are tricky but this the uh samples were collected on 411 2024 they were received at the lab on 4:15 and reported on 422 at the lab it says here that the right ocial scalp was shaved and the left frontal scalp shaved it was a and b samples and sent to the lab and this report says that basically the lymphatic history infiltrate vague nodal collections of the cd20 plus b cells favor clonial B cell Loma disorder both sections were biopsy and came back as positive cases was forwarded to the lab we were notified or I say notified the the dermatologist doctor was still kind of making sure so my wife ended up having to go and get in touch with her and say what's going on I knew it was taking a long time and generally you know you're sitting and you're waiting and when it's week two week 3 week you begin the oh Lord what are they doing so my wife contacted me she said well it came back positive so we had to deal with this so we set up appointments to a uh oncologist um to see how to proceed and uh you know when we were going through our talk to brother Jack and he encouraged me they say God did it before he can do it again and he said to me he say go back and and read the book called healing thoughts this keep your faith up which is where a lot of these came from that I have here today I don't want to bore you and just be reading to you this morning and uh so I I I I did that and uh we're say sitting there at at the house and one evening I just kind of got on my knees and she's sitting on the couch or laying on the couch rather and I just kind of laid my head in a lap and I begin to just pray and I turn my head away from her because see being the spouse of someone who's going through that see they say you got to be strong for for the person you got to be strong so I'm not allowed to show emotion I have to go into the backyard and and I just weep and said Lord what's going on so I I lay my head on a on her lap there and I turned my face away from her and the tears are just flowing and she can tell that I'm crying she said you're thinking about your mother I said no no she said your dad I said no she says no I said no I'm thinking about you and she just got quiet and I just slay there and prayed and prayed and wept and prayed says Lord we need you and again we need you and uh we set up the appointment to go see the oncologist it was that morning on Monday morning we went to see the oncologist and uh I was

listened and she said God you're speaking this is you speaking so she called uh sent back to me and uh the song and she told me what happened and when I heard the song I just be I I just began to weak so to move forward we went on to the oncologist and he said well the first thing that we have to do is get a pet scan to make sure that it's nowhere else in the body we have to make sure that what is positive here for non hodkin Bell inform former in your head has not spread to any other organs or anywhere else in your body that we can't physically see so we said okay they set the appointment and
