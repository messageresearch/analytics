[47:38] wasn't here I wouldn't be here amen and
[47:42] I just thank God for her she's been a
[47:45] real real
[47:47] mother glory to God in every sense of
[47:50] the
[47:53] word you know and uh she just she's one
[47:57] that just has a way of loving us um and
[48:00] when I was coming up just as a young man
[48:02] and I I I won holy all my
[48:05] life amen all my little life I won the
[48:09] best child all My Little Life uh but she
[48:13] knew how to bear with us how to pray for
[48:15] us how to encourage us how to strengthen
[48:17] us and and uh you know just just I think
[48:21] I've learned that um the next love to
[48:26] God's love is the love of a mother amen
[48:31] and and and and i' I've learned this so
[48:33] this why I always try to encourage
[48:34] Brothers don't don't try to come between
[48:37] that a love that a a mother has for a
[48:40] child just don't do that you create more
[48:43] problems for yourself right but you got
[48:46] to understand there's no love like a
[48:48] mother's love you you did not carry that
[48:51] child the way Mama carried that child
[48:55] you then get the connection that Mama
[49:00] got y'all ain't going to say Amen but
[49:03] it's the truth in how you didn't get
[49:05] that God didn't give that to
[49:08] you amen why you think the Bible say
[49:11] fathers provoke not your children why
[49:14] don't say that about
[49:15] mam oh my right that's
[49:19] good we got a preacher today y'all don't
[49:22] want me to preach y'all don't want me to
[49:25] preach
[49:26] [Music]
[49:28] but there's there's a reason that the
[49:30] scripture says that right and uh we got
[49:33] to understand that we don't come between
[49:35] that but we try to support that and we
[49:37] try to you know we try to nourish that
[49:39] relationship amen amen amen praise the
[49:43] Lord so we thank God for Mama today and
[49:45] we wish her a happy birthday um uh take

[55:20] to refer to

[55:30] together I was really enjoying brother

[56:05] refer to a couple others
[56:08] amen Exodus
[56:12] 3429 and it came to pass oh I'm sorry
[56:16] I'd wait for you to find it
[56:20] amen and it came to pass when Moses came
[56:24] down from Mount
[56:25] Si with the two tables of testimony in
[56:29] Moses's hand when he came down from the
[56:32] mouth that Moses whis not that the skin
[56:37] of his face Shone while he talked with
[56:40] him and when Aaron and all the children
[56:43] of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of
[56:47] his face Shone they were afraid to come
[56:51] nigh him amen the Lord out his blessed L

[56:57] seated and thank you very
[56:59] much amen I'm not much of a speaker amen

[57:19] title I'd like to call
[57:22] it in the presence of his glory

[57:44] prayer and he you know in praying he
[57:48] said Lord your mercies are new every
[57:51] morning great is thy faithfulness I when
[57:55] there those words just struck me and
[57:57] stuck with me since
[58:00] then
[58:02] yes yeah

[58:12] amen
[58:15] hallelujah glory to
[58:18] God sir amen and amen I'd also like to
[58:23] refer to
[58:25] Matthew chapter 17 I'd read it amen
[58:28] Jesus had taken Peter James and John his
[58:31] brother and bringeth them up into an
[58:33] high mountain and was transfigured
[58:35] before them and his face did shine as
[58:38] the sun and his reignment was white as
[58:42] light
[58:46] amen and Corinthians 2 Corinthians
[58:50] chapter 3 sorry I've got a really big
[58:53] Bible because you know
[58:56] as you get
[58:59] [Laughter]
[59:03] older
[59:05] Glory now the Lord is that Spirit yeah
[59:08] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[59:10] there is Liberty oh Hallelujah Lord amen
[59:13] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[59:15] Liberty yes sir Glory but we all with
[59:19] open face beholding as in a glass the
[59:22] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[59:26] same image from glory to glory even as
[59:32] by the spirit of the Lord amen amen yes

[1:00:23] recommendation
[1:00:25] when when when I was listening to
[1:00:28] brother I start to feel so broken up in
[1:00:30] the back there when I heard it because I
[1:00:33] Feel So Unworthy of that amen
[1:00:39] amen amen I'd just like to refer to a
[1:00:42] few little quotes please bear with me
[1:00:45] amen amen you know there was a time
[1:00:49] when in the Garden of
[1:00:52] Eden man living in the presence of the
[1:00:55] Lord they were so
[1:00:59] conscious of his presence constantly yes
[1:01:03] sir amen amen they were so conscious of
[1:01:05] his presence amen
[1:01:07] constantly and they were in such
[1:01:09] fellowship and harmony with
[1:01:13] God that they were conscious of his
[1:01:16] omnipotence right amen amen yeah I just
[1:01:20] like to read just a little
[1:01:23] bit
[1:01:25] in the beginning when God I'm reading
[1:01:26] from fellowship by Redemption
[1:01:29] 955 now in the beginning when God made
[1:01:32] the man to worship Him and live God
[1:01:35] taking care of them fed him man had a
[1:01:38] perfect fellowship with
[1:01:40] God now before the prophet says that he
[1:01:43] said that when God ever takes his
[1:01:46] position in the human heart all the
[1:01:49] reasonings Fade Out God becomes
[1:01:53] first amen you you just heard
[1:01:58] brother God becomes first Hallelujah
[1:02:02] when he takes that position in our heart
[1:02:04] God becomes first and as brother Jackie
[1:02:08] said others become
[1:02:10] second and will you become last
[1:02:14] am
[1:02:16] amen at brother Jean Jason Tuesday I was
[1:02:19] in the office and uh just as a little
[1:02:21] testimony all right and I'm not a very
[1:02:25] good singer I get my words all mixed up
[1:02:28] and and I sometimes sing on the wrong
[1:02:30] key and stuff like that and I was there
[1:02:33] and I was wondering I said I wonder if
[1:02:35] they have the words to the
[1:02:38] song the more that I
[1:02:42] Surrender and I was just wondering if
[1:02:44] they had those words
[1:02:46] and while they in the room I heard the
[1:02:49] song leader beginning to sing the more
[1:02:51] that I Surrender the light of the Lord
[1:02:54] and then I heard a knock on the door
[1:02:55] because I wanted to sing that song
[1:02:57] before I started
[1:03:00] preaching and they introduced me with
[1:03:03] that song God well you can imagine how I
[1:03:05] felt
[1:03:07] amen yes sir and on on
[1:03:13] Thursday while studying about a couple
[1:03:16] hours before I just I just felt led to
[1:03:18] change the whole
[1:03:21] sermon and I
[1:03:22] started St in something a in a different
[1:03:27] way and well the presence of the Lord
[1:03:30] came down so greatly and and he really
[1:03:32] blessed our hearts and it's just the
[1:03:35] grace of God Amen and at the end of the
[1:03:39] service brother Anie I think is his name
[1:03:43] he had preached on the Sunday me before
[1:03:46] and he said did you realize that brother
[1:03:47] Paul preach the same sermon I preached
[1:03:51] on Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon
[1:03:54] wow I was like oh
[1:03:58] my yes I I felt a change to to change
[1:04:02] the service and preach on something on a
[1:04:04] different angle amen and was exactly
[1:04:07] just
[1:04:09] confirming the same spirit amen and at
[1:04:12] brother Simmons is he he said after the
[1:04:15] two Services he said brother Paul have
[1:04:17] you been listening to my sermons for the
[1:04:19] last month I said no I haven't he said
[1:04:22] well you preach exactly what I've been
[1:04:24] preaching for the last
[1:04:26] month amen so I feel blessed in my heart
[1:04:30] because when I came back you know
[1:04:33] brother Jackie took me outside and when
[1:04:35] I came back in the song that you all
[1:04:37] started with was there is nothing like
[1:04:40] the presence of the
[1:04:42] Lord and I was like oh God because yeah
[1:04:45] I was a little bit
[1:04:47] nervous wonder what do I say you know
[1:04:51] and so I just feel a little blessed
[1:04:54] amen hallelujah amen
[1:04:59] GL now when God takes his p position
[1:05:03] right in the human heart then we can
[1:05:05] find our position amen he's got to have
[1:05:09] the right position in our heart for we
[1:05:12] can find our right position amen yes sir
[1:05:15] now in the beginning man was in the
[1:05:17] right position God was in the right
[1:05:19] position and man was in the right
[1:05:21] position so there was a fellowship there
[1:05:25] and and man had power within himself
[1:05:28] that he can speak to the wind it'll obey
[1:05:31] him amen he can speak to the trees and
[1:05:33] that tree you be plucked up and planted
[1:05:36] over there and you have to obey him
[1:05:38] because man had perfect fellowship with
[1:05:42] God
[1:05:44] Amen the word Reigns Supreme in his
[1:05:47] heart amen amen amen yes sir the the
[1:05:51] word of God reigned Supreme in the heart
[1:05:54] of
[1:05:55] man now when man
[1:05:58] fell
[1:06:00] amen they lost their
[1:06:02] position yes
[1:06:04] sir they lost that that position that
[1:06:08] they had with Christ for they had
[1:06:10] dominion over the Earth right and
[1:06:12] everything obeyed them right amen that's
[1:06:15] right but they lost that why did they
[1:06:18] lose it because they came out from
[1:06:20] behind the word of God so the word of
[1:06:23] God is our strength amen
[1:06:27] amen amen the word of God ought to reign
[1:06:30] supreme in our hearts yes
[1:06:33] sir amen the prophet said they didn't
[1:06:36] know sickness what sickness was they
[1:06:40] didn't know what old age was they didn't
[1:06:42] know what hurt was they couldn't be hurt
[1:06:45] they were in the presence of the
[1:06:47] omnipotent powers of God which held them
[1:06:51] in control and guided them by his spirit
[1:06:56] amen that held them and guided them amen
[1:06:59] they were always Guided by the spirit of
[1:07:01] God
[1:07:03] Amen
[1:07:04] now the prophet says he continues I
[1:07:07] believe if this little group of
[1:07:08] Believers this morning and that doesn't
[1:07:11] only refer to the Tabernacle back there
[1:07:14] for this is God's Eternal word amen it
[1:07:16] applies to this little group here this
[1:07:18] morning also amen
[1:07:20] amen if everyone could lay aside every
[1:07:24] thought and get down to the fact to know
[1:07:28] that the great Jehovah that created you
[1:07:30] in the beginning is in his position God
[1:07:33] didn't lose his position it's man lost
[1:07:36] his position not God the word of God
[1:07:38] didn't lose its strength it didn't lose
[1:07:40] its position amen it's man that lost it
[1:07:43] right and God is still in his position
[1:07:46] so for us to get back there we've got to
[1:07:49] get back to our position yes sir and
[1:07:52] there's got to be a way to get back back
[1:07:54] to that position amen exactly right yes
[1:07:57] sir Amen to know that the great Jehovah
[1:08:00] God that created you in the beginning is
[1:08:01] in his position placed today here in
[1:08:04] this
[1:08:05] Tabernacle yeah that's right that he's
[1:08:09] bringing it right down to our day at the
[1:08:12] heart of every
[1:08:15] believer that's his position right it's
[1:08:18] not way out somewhere far out and it's
[1:08:22] right here right
[1:08:24] that's his
[1:08:25] position
[1:08:27] amen he says you believe it I know you
[1:08:30] believe it right now in the beginning
[1:08:32] when God come down in the evening and
[1:08:33] talked to Adam and Eve in the cool of
[1:08:35] the day and his great voice whispered to
[1:08:37] them they had Fellowship loved one
[1:08:40] another that's another thing Hallelujah
[1:08:43] when you're in a real position with God
[1:08:45] your perfect position with God you just
[1:08:48] can't help but love everybody
[1:08:51] yes amen amen amen by this shall all men
[1:08:56] know he are my disciples when he have
[1:08:58] love one for another when you're

[1:09:02] everybody you love your very enemies
[1:09:04] also amen
[1:09:07] amen they had Fellowship loved one
[1:09:10] another how the moving of the spirit
[1:09:12] went through the
[1:09:15] bushes the lions come up the Tigers all
[1:09:18] of them and they worshiped the Lord man
[1:09:20] was
[1:09:21] conscious at all times
[1:09:24] not just sometime but at all times that
[1:09:29] his presence was with
[1:09:31] him now that's where we lose a little
[1:09:34] bit at times we lose the Consciousness
[1:09:37] that he's still
[1:09:38] there and we get a little loose at times
[1:09:41] yes we get a little loose with our
[1:09:44] thoughts and when we begin to get a
[1:09:45] little loose with our thoughts we going
[1:09:47] to get a little loose with our tongues
[1:09:49] we're going to get a little loose with
[1:09:50] our actions but we got to be aware of
[1:09:53] that presence all the time amen amen so

[1:32:34] amen here is the secret the word is in
[1:32:38] the
[1:32:39] bride and the mind of Christ all right
[1:32:43] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:32:47] you see Moses knew what he wanted done
[1:32:48] with the
[1:32:50] word the prophet knew what he want done
[1:32:52] with the word
[1:32:55] amen the Lord Jesus knew what God the
[1:32:58] Father the Holy Spirit wanted him to do
[1:33:01] because Jesus was just the flesh the
[1:33:03] body in which the
[1:33:04] fullness of God dwelt in amen amen not
[1:33:09] three Gods you know one God it's just
[1:33:11] God manifesting himself amen unveiling
[1:33:14] himself tabernacled in human flesh
[1:33:18] veiled behind human
[1:33:20] flesh he was veiled in
[1:33:24] Moses he was veiled in the Lord Jesus
[1:33:27] and here he is veiled in the
[1:33:30] bride
[1:33:34] amen they
[1:33:36] do sorry let me the word is in the bride
[1:33:39] and the mind of Christ to know what he
[1:33:42] wants done with the word and she does it
[1:33:44] in his name she has thus said the Lord
[1:33:48] then it is germatize so the Holy Spirit
[1:33:50] Waters it un until it is grown and
[1:33:52] serves its
[1:33:54] purpose they will do they do only his
[1:34:01] will remember in the beginning Adam did
[1:34:03] only the will of
[1:34:05] God yeah they were led by the spirit and
[1:34:08] were doing only the will of God before
[1:34:10] the fall well we restored right back now
[1:34:14] to the blood of Jesus Christ and all
[1:34:17] that Adam had lost has been restored
[1:34:20] Lord oh we're living way below our
[1:34:24] privileges amen we ought to come up a
[1:34:27] little
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:29] higher
[1:34:31] hallelujah
[1:34:34] amen then they will do the works of God
[1:34:37] for it is himself in them continuing his
[1:34:40] word to fulfill as he as he did complete
[1:34:44] in his days all things when he was here
[1:34:46] he did not complete all when he was here
[1:34:49] for it was not time yet amen amen there
[1:34:51] was a little bit a lot of Through the
[1:34:53] Ages it was he fulfilling his word
[1:34:56] Through the
[1:34:57] Ages amen but there's
[1:35:00] something special for this
[1:35:06] day you're a special group of people you
[1:35:10] know amen now we know better than nobody
[1:35:13] right it's the love of God towards us
[1:35:18] amen now what that ought to do to us it
[1:35:21] ought to make us more humble yes
[1:35:35] sir I think we've been living I have
[1:35:38] been living way below my privilege as a
[1:35:41] Son of
[1:35:43] God and what I'm thinking is that what I
[1:35:47] believe is that the holy spirit's trying
[1:35:49] to get us into a rightful position
[1:35:54] Moses in that presence under the blood
[1:35:56] of bulls and goats could come out and
[1:35:59] shine with the glory of God that he has
[1:36:02] to throw a veil over his
[1:36:05] face that's under the blood of bulls and
[1:36:09] goats the Lord Jesus the fullness of the
[1:36:11] word he had perfect Faith because he was
[1:36:14] the perfect word amen
[1:36:17] amen and he can do all these things and
[1:36:20] now he's saying you can do
[1:36:22] it but it's allotted for a certain time
[1:36:25] and a season and I believe that's the
[1:36:28] season in which we living in because
[1:36:31] we've already seen it manifested in the
[1:36:33] prophet's life and the bride has to be
[1:36:35] at a certain place for the Rapture to
[1:36:38] take
[1:36:39] place and I believe what what I believe
[1:36:42] is taking place is it's waves of
[1:36:46] glory and the spirit is taking the
[1:36:48] people Higher and Higher and they
[1:36:51] Faith's getting
[1:36:55] perfected now I ain't what I I ought to
[1:36:58] be all right I ain't what I'm supposed
[1:37:01] to be all right but one thing I know I
[1:37:04] ain't what I used to be Lord and you
[1:37:07] know what did that was faith in his word
[1:37:10] that did that that's what brought me out
[1:37:12] of the a life of
[1:37:14] sin amen and then he took me a little
[1:37:17] higher and he's taking you higher and
[1:37:20] higher and higher
[1:37:22] but now he's calling us to a fully
[1:37:25] surrendered life remember this man that
[1:37:28] could do that and speak and these things
[1:37:31] happen they were fully surrendered in
[1:37:33] the hands of the Lord he said that a man
[1:37:36] fully surrendered in the hand of God it
[1:37:39] won't be that man
[1:37:41] anymore so what is it taking he said in
[1:37:44] present stage of my
[1:37:47] Ministry sorry speak to this mountain he
[1:37:50] said this is this is the hour of divine
[1:37:53] consecrations now it's divine
[1:37:55] consecrations right you know sometime
[1:37:57] you feel of yourself or the church kind
[1:37:59] of woo the people no but this is Jesus
[1:38:03] pulling you now calling you aside to
[1:38:05] himself remember is he called up Moses
[1:38:07] up on that mountain and he was pulling
[1:38:10] the prophet aside come you got to go
[1:38:12] west now
[1:38:15] amen it's a holy spirit it's divine
[1:38:18] consecrations not just I get a feeling
[1:38:20] on my
[1:38:22] self no sir Divine consecrations he said
[1:38:26] if you can believe the Lord God requires
[1:38:30] a
[1:38:31] consecration it's in speak to this
[1:38:34] mountain he said he cannot break forth
[1:38:36] upon us until we've been so surrendered
[1:38:39] to his
[1:38:44] will Adam did nothing but the will of
[1:38:47] God before the fall amen remember it's
[1:38:50] eve that fell right she did wrong she
[1:38:54] was deceived right and Adam loving his
[1:38:58] wife he willfully did that
[1:39:03] right he said he cannot break forth upon
[1:39:07] us until we've been so surrendered to
[1:39:09] his will to his power he cannot break
[1:39:12] forth until we have our hearts so
[1:39:15] cleansed from sin and things of the
[1:39:18] world so there's things in my
[1:39:23] now my greatest enemy is
[1:39:27] me I need to empty myself of
[1:39:33] myself yeah and let him fill in there so
[1:39:37] he'll no longer be me but

[1:39:43] Ghost can ride upon us and so surround
[1:39:45] us now as he has me right now while he's

[1:45:15] sacredness the thing we ought to have in
[1:45:18] our
[1:45:19] midst
[1:45:21] we need to have this in our
[1:45:24] midst to know that the spirit of the
[1:45:27] Living God moving in his word and
[1:45:30] showing us the
[1:45:32] things yeah we've seen it we've heard it
[1:45:36] we've listened to it we've read
[1:45:40] it but I think we need to lay in that
[1:45:43] presence in the presence of his glory to
[1:45:47] be mellowed up to be sweetened up in
[1:45:51] spirit because perfect love and perfect
[1:45:54] Faith goes together
[1:45:58] yeah love and faith are kin
[1:46:02] folks faith is based on
[1:46:05] love yes perfect forgiveness he said
[1:46:09] faith is based on forgiveness if you
[1:46:11] follow the scripture and read it down or
[1:46:13] further if you said it this morning he
[1:46:15] said if you have ought in your heart
[1:46:18] against that's right need to mow
[1:46:22] up yeah we got too much greenness in
[1:46:27] us there's no problem with the word
[1:46:30] that's right there's no problem with God
[1:46:33] the problem is me I'm the problem
[1:46:38] today I ain't going to say you're the
[1:46:40] problem I'm the problem I'm the problem
[1:46:44] Hallelujah
[1:46:48] GL I need to to
[1:46:53] mow I need to sweeten up some
[1:46:56] more so I'm so full of his sweetness it
[1:47:00] ain't me
[1:47:01] anymore it's his love flowing through
[1:47:04] freely through
[1:47:08] me
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:17] hallelujah I know it's the truth
[1:47:23] I ain't got words to explain it you got
[1:47:25] to experience it
[1:47:28] yourself I know the holy spirit's
[1:47:30] calling us
[1:47:33] today to lay in his
[1:47:37] presence
[1:47:41] hallu Hallelujah we ought to be such a
[1:47:43] great big bundle of
[1:47:45] love you know there was a time when the
[1:47:48] church you couldn't leave each other
[1:47:51] yes
[1:47:53] sir you'd Fellowship out there in the
[1:47:55] courtyard so long you just couldn't
[1:47:57] leave each other service go on and on
[1:47:59] and on and on that's right
[1:48:02] yeah and you so loved one another you
[1:48:04] couldn't wait for those doors to open to
[1:48:06] come back and fellowship again around
[1:48:08] the
[1:48:12] word I remember those days when I was
[1:48:15] really young and we'd end with that song
[1:48:17] we really would end with that song
[1:48:19] blessed be the ties That binds and you
[1:48:21] so loved one
[1:48:24] another
[1:48:26] yeah we ought to be so much further down
[1:48:29] there's nothing wrong with the
[1:48:33] word he's calling us to Divine
[1:48:36] consecration come on get into the
[1:48:38] presence of his glory till we shine with
[1:48:42] his glory we shine with his
[1:48:46] sweetness the gospel glows you it's not
[1:48:48] it's it's it's not glittery and no it
[1:48:51] glows in humility we become so
[1:48:56] humble sweet towards one another usually
[1:48:59] when you come into the
[1:49:02] Pinnacle yes of the ministry because the
[1:49:05] Way Up Is
[1:49:08] Down look at the Lord Jesus just a
[1:49:11] minute
[1:49:13] again the same priest that he called you
[1:49:15] wided
[1:49:18] walls you Hypocrites Snakes in the
[1:49:22] Grass here he stands before them
[1:49:26] now and every false accusation that
[1:49:29] could throw against
[1:49:34] him stood there like a
[1:49:37] lamb not a word he'd
[1:49:41] say he humbled himself to the death of
[1:49:43] the
[1:49:45] Cross he could have defended
[1:49:49] himself
[1:49:51] he had all rights to defend himself many
[1:49:54] of times we want to defend
[1:49:57] ourselves and we have rights to defend
[1:49:59] ourselves but when you become a
[1:50:02] prisoner and you love him so much
[1:50:05] Hallelujah you give up all your
[1:50:08] rights you know that my
[1:50:13] reaction to what you've
[1:50:15] done your Soul's
[1:50:18] destination may depend on it my soul
[1:50:22] destination depending on how he reacted
[1:50:25] to those false accusations that's
[1:50:28] right my soul's
[1:50:32] destination depending on how he
[1:50:36] reacted it's the same thing
[1:50:39] today but what how could he do that if
[1:50:42] you go back a little bit in the Garden
[1:50:44] of Gethsemane there is where he won the
[1:50:48] victory so God's calling us to a
[1:50:52] place it's a time for divine
[1:50:56] consecration
[1:50:57] amen time of complete emptying of
[1:51:05] ourselves power is the man who can
[1:51:07] conquer himself That's The Power of his
[1:51:10] power that he saw That's The Power of
[1:51:12] his power when he said when he sees that
[1:51:14] bride and says power of my
[1:51:17] power that's what he saw
[1:51:20] someone who could conquer
[1:51:25] themselves amen yield it to the perfect
[1:51:28] will of
[1:51:32] God many of us want to speak to the
[1:51:34] storm right I'd love to I'm honest with
[1:51:38] you
[1:51:39] right I'm being
[1:51:41] honest but there's something that goes
[1:51:44] with
[1:51:45] that there's something that goes with
[1:51:48] that power God character is satanic
[1:51:51] there's a character that goes with it
[1:51:53] and that's what he's looking for that's
[1:51:56] what he's looking for that's what he's
[1:51:58] coming back for amen hallelujah he's
[1:52:03] calling us to Mellow up a little bit
[1:52:06] amen hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:52:08] Hallelujah and the invisible Union of
[1:52:11] the bride of Christ it's an invisible

[1:52:19] say I'm asking the
[1:52:21] bride bride of Jesus
[1:52:24] Christ I'm asking the bride tonight the
[1:52:28] ones that I feel has pulled away and
[1:52:31] waiting may they separate themselves
[1:52:34] from everything in the world they must
[1:52:37] lay in the presence of the warm sun
[1:52:40] light of the Son of God bathing in his
[1:52:44] word amen in love he says granted dear
[1:52:48] Lord praise
[1:52:51] God that was a prayer he was

[1:53:48] word and lay stay in that presence
[1:53:53] there and here he is just revealing it
[1:53:56] just seemed like something just flicked
[1:53:58] on in my life

[1:54:03] privileges for far too long I said no no
[1:54:07] I couldn't flick that switch
[1:54:09] on I couldn't do that somebody did
[1:54:14] it because I was willing to yield myself
[1:54:18] more
[1:54:20] cast all my cares on
[1:54:23] him with carrying along too many things
[1:54:25] trying to solve too many problems of
[1:54:28] myself not realizing that I was the big
[1:54:31] problem to begin
[1:54:33] with you see sometime we think we become
[1:54:35] a Christian you're saved you're filled
[1:54:37] with the Holy Ghost you already made it
[1:54:39] we're in a battlefield

[1:54:51] you got to learn to surrender to his
[1:54:53] will you got to learn to surrender his
[1:54:55] every word and you got to realize this
[1:54:58] is the guy you're fighting with the
[1:55:02] most when I realize that this is the guy
[1:55:05] I've been fighting with the most
[1:55:07] thinking I'm so right when I'm so
[1:55:13] wrong and you know something even when
[1:55:16] you're right you got to take wrong
[1:55:22] that's one of the hardest things to
[1:55:25] do especially us man oh
[1:55:31] my I'm
[1:55:35] honest
[1:55:37] glory to stay quiet and
[1:55:43] silent but if you really get down on
[1:55:45] your knees
[1:55:46] friends and get into that presence with
[1:55:49] God
[1:55:50] amen and a to empty yourself there yes

[2:06:40] hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you
[2:06:43] certainly appreciate brother Paul just
[2:06:47] getting himself out of away and allowing
[2:06:49] the Lord to use him to speak to our
[2:06:52] hearts um I pray church that we don't
[2:06:54] allow sermons like this just to kind of
[2:06:56] go over our heads God is coming to speak
[2:07:00] right where we right where we're
[2:07:02] living and uh just the the quotes that
[2:07:05] he was using um just I felt like the
[2:07:09] Holy Spirit just really orchestrated and
[2:07:11] directed all of that especially that
[2:07:13] this we got the mellow out it's talking
[2:07:17] about how we just get you know
[2:07:19] and he he never pointed his finger at
[2:07:21] anybody he kept pointing himself
[2:07:22] pointing it at himself like I got to do
[2:07:25] this and if a minister can come behind
[2:07:27] the pull pit and say this is what I got
[2:07:29] to do what about the rest of the
[2:07:32] congregation our righteousness is as
[2:07:34] filthy rags before
[2:07:35] God and how we need more and more and
[2:07:38] more of him and you know just even my my
[2:07:41] own thoughts this week one of the
[2:07:43] thoughts that came to me was um you know
[2:07:47] uh beloved let us love one another amen
[2:07:51] for love is of
[2:07:53] God and everyone that loveth is born of
[2:07:57] God he that loveth not knoweth not God
[2:08:01] for God is love and see when I talk
[2:08:04] about the basics of Christianity these
[2:08:06] are the things that we used to hear in
[2:08:08] church years ago and it kept us
[2:08:11] mellow sometimes we done got way ahead
[2:08:14] so we need these deep things to inspire
[2:08:17] you know just
[2:08:19] intellect but we missing just everyday
[2:08:23] life I I just appreciate the word of the
[2:08:26] Lord today and I'm so glad that God
[2:08:29] could come and just cleanse us and wash
[2:08:31] us and and this is a sermon you can go
[2:08:33] back and just listen to over and over
[2:08:34] again and amen we we need to come to
[2:08:37] this place of divine
[2:08:40] consecration Divine
[2:08:42] consecration Lord don't let this just go
[2:08:45] over our heads but let us really
[2:08:46] meditate on what is being spoken to us
[2:08:50] what we heard here today yeah I I I'm
[2:08:52] grateful brother Paul God bless you
[2:08:54] thank you so much for coming Amen to
[2:08:56] speak to
[2:08:57] [Music]
[2:08:59] us blessed be the name of the
[2:09:03] Lord amen and as you were sharing about
[2:09:06] the testimony going there to brother
[2:09:08] jeans and wanting to sing that song the
[2:09:10] more I Surrender uh Our Song leader was
[2:09:13] telling me said that's the song he had
[2:09:14] in heart to bring me out on today the
[2:09:16] more that I Surrender so God knew
[2:09:19] exactly amen what he was doing this this
[2:09:22] was orchestrated and ordained by God
[2:09:25] Amen praise the Lord praise the Lord
[2:09:28] amen good to see sister Melissa and the
[2:09:31] kids amen God bless you amen praise the
[2:09:34] Lord continue to keep her in prayer amen
[2:09:39] um they they certainly are need in our
[2:09:43] prayers and like I said just we just
[2:09:45] seemed like we had a little wave here
[2:09:47] hit the church uh back in
[2:09:50] 2015 uh we went through a situation
[2:09:53] where a wave of saints that we lost amen
[2:09:56] actually in the
[2:09:58] church uh but um you know this time
[2:10:01] we've lost a couple in and then a couple
[2:10:03] on the outside but nonetheless everybody
[2:10:06] seem to be going through this season of
[2:10:09] grieving amen at the same time but God
[2:10:12] uh I am convinced because I've seen him
[2:10:14] do it is able to take your
[2:10:17] morning and turn it into dancing amen I
[2:10:21] I that's the god that we serve so amen
[2:10:24] I'm just believing that he's going to
[2:10:25] bring confidence strength amen uh to
[2:10:28] each and every one of us through this
[2:10:29] season amen I know it's not easy amen
[2:10:32] but I know God is faithful and I know
[2:10:35] that I know that he's able I lost uh my
[2:10:37] biological father and um you know the
[2:10:41] the man that I called daddy amen he was
[2:10:43] my stepdad but I I didn't know nothing
[2:10:46] else but Daddy because that's what he
[2:10:48] treated me like was a son uh but I
[2:10:50] remember losing them both in a in a
[2:10:52] matter of 30 days 30 days they were both
[2:10:55] gone and uh and my B my my uh my my
[2:10:59] stepdad uh uh brother bur amen that's
[2:11:02] dad to me uh losing him right in the
[2:11:06] heart of December right before the
[2:11:07] holidays it was a little difficult for
[2:11:09] us but God gave us strength and and one
