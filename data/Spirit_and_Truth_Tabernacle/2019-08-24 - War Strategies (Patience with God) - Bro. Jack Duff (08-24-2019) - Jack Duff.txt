it's me [Music] they're evasive Amen let's give them a hand Thank You musicians I appreciate you all on today we have a another little song that we practice but I want to save that for later date and it's true to me a blessing thank God for the choir y'all sound real good man Joe appreciate shower and then it's this morning and appreciate both brothers Jeffrey M assist the burgers as well I was just listening to that guitars I appreciate that brother Jeffrey just think of how the Lord is just blessing you a man in that we'll try to get right to the scriptures here I want to also thank the Lord for the Funderburk's they bless the church with the monitors man and we were grateful grateful for that I was just kind of sharing a little something a man we were just just just talking just nothing nothing you know just just kind of sharing about different things that we can do to improve and I wrote Stephen and even tell me just showed up the church on Wednesday night with these big boxes in his hands I will praise the Lord so I tell you I just appreciate it it's just always meaningful when you know the Lord just puts know somebody's heart to do something like that and and I was telling I said man these these massive you know this is full you know like like birla West Coast Church and Isis the West Coast say I'm sorry sister Rachel say we gonna need it I said Amen that's I I received that we got to get our language around this all right you gotta start talking about you leaving a man get ready for your new church oh my god somebody get ready for ya so I'm under expectation I'm very grateful man for the blessing here a man this morning let's um turn a couple scriptures here 2nd Peter chapter 1 and verse 3 we have we're still in our journey here of war strategies and I believe the Lord blesses last last week I want to thank God for brother Troy a man last week just continuing I thought on worship and you know I just I just appreciate it I was uh I was telling Justin was in my spirit I was kind of going through some things cuz you know being away from from church you know when you get back maybe you just wanna you just want to just do all you can and we had you know we had a pretty long trip coming back home and I kind of fell just not not necessarily ill but just wasn't feeling my best and two things came across my head like you know you we got help so let's use to help right and the second thing that came across my my mind is that I was very appreciative her brother Troy being very faithful to coming on Wednesday nights and Sharon start because we in tonight it's always a smaller crowd right and I say well you know if you faithful like that to come on the win tonight and shares thought well let him come on a Sunday morning as well a man and share with the Saints and I was just so grateful for a man just coming on last week we appreciate that and as you all heard we got a tremendous amount of people that are going to Indiana so we just don't have that many brothers that are actually going to be left behind so we had to not have service here but that don't mean stay home right we want to encourage you that's a perfect time to go visit a man maybe show up at by the West coach or brother smiley Church brother gene church you know or if you have somebody been pulling on you like hey I want you to come visit my truck you come visit me I'll come visit you now you know they tell you that they be lying because they don't never come here right but but you can try it you know if you want to you can try it but that would be a perfect time to take them up on that off you know why we waste so but but I want to encourage everyone try to go somewhere a man and worship the Lord amen worship the Lord so keep that in mind let's uh let's look here 2nd Peter chapter 1 stop it starting at verse 3 and man all right let's praise the Lord we'll get through it hey man give me a second Peter chapter 1 verse 3 says according as his divine power have given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue we're ever given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now please as we read this understand that what the scriptures that I'm presenting to you are this is God's objective for us as Christians to come to a man a perfect place in him right this is his objective and there are certain qualities or certain things that he's expecting of us and we're reading about this divine nature here so this is a perfect place for us to do a self-evaluation right as to where we are you know when we look in the mirror of the Word of God Lord how do I measure up right so let's let's let's let's look at this sort of reverse forces whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and we talked about temperance the last time we preached on this brother branham temper is of the devil right and I love the way that kind of slipped right into brother Troy's thought he was talking about King he was like one of the first people we saw display a temper and that temper actually calls him to kill his brother amen so if we have a prop without a temper that's something we need deliverance from right because that's that's of the devil that's not of God a man all right so he says here into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience to patience Scotland's to countless brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity if these things being you and abound they should make you that you should neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather of brethren give diligence to make you a call the election show for if you do these things you shall never fall alright let's look at another passage over here in Joshua chapter 5 and I'll have a word of Prayer and I'll let you be seated Amen Joshua chapter 5 praise the Lord here verse 13 in Joshua chapter 5 ma'am it reads as follows says and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto Him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the hosts of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and set an EM what saith my lord unto his servant and I love this right because as as Joshua is in the presence of the Lord the captain of the Lord's hosts Joshua is actually receiving a war strategy a man right and the captain Alaura so sailing to Joshua loose tie shoe for both a foot for the place where thou standest is holy and Joshua did so a man you got to be able to read between the lines to see that Joshua's getting a war strategy amen at this moment let's pray Amen over the word father we thank you for the ability to read scripture and God we trust that you would now take what we have read and Lord just quicken it about hearts and oh god may we receive amen from the word of the Lord today may we leave encouraged and strengthened by your word and thought we just pray that you have your way and this portion of service would take every spirit that is against the Spirit of God underneath control of the Holy Spirit even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated praise the Lord so on today that we have this topic of war strategies patience but we have to preach this in two parts Amen this this particular strategy has to be preached in two parts and and I've been certainly just kind of trying to work through which way to go today because I feel like both of them are necessary both parts are necessary but brother branham brings to our attention when you're listening to the message statute of a perfect man when he starts talking about patience he says there's there's talks about two different kind of says we have to have patience with God and then we also have to have patience with one another a man so which I again I think both of those are very important for us and on today what I want to do is just dwell on the topic patience with God they men war strategies patience with God the Prophet gave us seven different examples in the sermon stature of a perfect man he gives us seven different seven different examples of patience of people that or group of people that displayed patience he talked about Abraham he talked about Noah we've talked about Moses he talked about the Hebrew boys he talked about Daniel he talked about Paul and and the one thing that I love about when they talked about Paul he only brought in one sentence about Paul one or two sentences but he said Paul had patience right so I'm like I said well that that's something and then he talked about the believers on the day of Pentecost how they also demonstrated patience by waiting on God waiting in the upper room until God did something a man I um I don't want it just to be a song a man I want it to be a reality in my life right there's a song that they sing I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting on the Lord but but really really when the trial comes Amen I think sometimes we do mind waiting right we get ahead of guard we get in front of God we we want to beat caught to it we actually want to tell God how to do it come on somebody right but but but but we got to learn how to just wait on the Lord's a man the scriptures say wait on the Lord and be of good courage he will strengthen that heart and man did anyway don't to say it again wait I say on the Lord right so so we got to learn amen as believers to just wait you got to learn amen understand that sometimes amen it might not be your season just yet come on somebody you might see somebody else get blessed praise the Lord just because God bless so-and-so with a car don't mean you supposed to run out there get one hello somebody you got to learn to wait on the Lord now you do what you need to do is rejoice with them in a car and if you need a car god bless you at one but you got to wait on God don't don't don't get in our hurry and get in front of God don't don't pray and didn't expect the answer that happened just like that sometimes it does but not all the time hallelujah we got to learn to wait on the Lord Amen be patient with God the Prophet makes this statement amen in this message the Statue of a perfect man I'm at paragraph 233 says patients with what he says what kind of patients first thing is have patience with God if you got real genuine faith you'll have a real genuine patience because faith worketh patience hey man faith worketh patience that that she oughta be a good indicator to you it meant that to do have faith the devil will tell you oh you ain't got no faith you think I'm afraid but if you're waiting for God to actually Vindicator God to manifest himself in your situation it at your shows that you do have faith you got faith to wait on gods hallelujah that no matter what come your way I'm a just wait you know when God made the way and you also know what you made the way come on somebody ain't glory to God but when God open up door came no man shut it somebody an answer so if so me so stop so that they ought to be indicated to you that I got faith because I'm able to wait alright glory to God said says faith worketh patience when God says anything you believe it that's all glory to God you got patience say well I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience that that's that's not even patience right she said action last night and I'm just a sickness one no my what patience God told Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign huh those here this man got a promise and 25 years later there's not even one side of this promise coming forth and notice what the prophets saying he would still believe him he was patient with God uh-huh can we just pause that just for a moment just reach over to your closest neighbor and say I'm still believing I'm still believing I'm still believing I know I told you about it I testified about it last year but I'm still believing come on somebody admit I'm still believing no matter how long I gotta wait I'm still believing praise God seem like everything that turned against me but I'm still believing let be the name of Lord hallelujah the doctor trauma put me on low medicine but I still believe come on somebody I'm still expecting God to touch me I'm still expecting my healing come on somebody hallelujah Amen what no matter how long we have to wait you keep your faith and just be patient and wait on the Lord it says they say says put them always before you let him be the next crossing thing if you can't cross him so just keep him before you said so and it's going to happen that's it brother Geoffrey it's going to happen do you know that job you've been waiting on it's going to happen how that that house whatever is going to happen glory God somebody my family coming in is going to happen man i'ma just wait Oh God I'm gonna quit in the process that's not even an option I just I just do it always so I come in to worship and praise them in the midst of whatever I'm going through hallelujah it's going to happen see keeping it for you that's right so here you know the Prophet uses Abraham in this example and we know the scripture talks about how Abraham a man waited 25 years for the promise that God gave him to come to pass and here we are the seed of Abraham we have to have the same faith we have to have the same patience a man we have to have the same resolve the scripture tells us in in Luke 21 19 its impatience in in your patience possess your souls in your patience possession your souls and let's look at a statement here out of Philadelphia Church H the Prophet gives us something here that a man we want to just bring out says revelation 3:10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation glory to God which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth it says what does he mean by the word of his patience Hebrews 6 verse 13 through 15 but when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing our Blessed II and multiplying our multiply V and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the Spirit is speaking about the Word of God which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of that word required patience hallelujah somebody to wait for the fulfillment of whatever God has promised you is gonna require patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endure as seeing him who is invisible he was patient oh I loved that he was patient and then the word was well the word finally was fulfilled now the first thing has to happen is you have to demonstrate your patience to wait on the Lord oh my don't get in early with God don't do that amen you know one of the biggest problem that God had with us it's just being able to wait on him hallelujah glory to God and I mean think about the the Hebrew boys they had to get in the before God showed up right I mean not not right before the fire because we'll see the fire be light well Lord I can't do that God I can't go in there no Lord I can't I quit what are you talking about hey man you gonna miss your blessing if you don't get inside the fire now you're gonna miss a man seeing the fourth man they did not see him before the they saw him in the fire hallelujah church going to garden and I'm here to encourage you amen you might be going from one fiery trial to the next fiery trial but I'm hearing courser he is able to take you through the fire again it'll carry you through Church glory to God don't don't don't give up don't don't don't quit don't worry about it God got this thing under control see I'm stealing your Romans 8:28 bucket I'm still in there I'm telling you when you go back and really read that all things work together all things I mean no matter what it is all things it's working together for your good Amen it may not feel good I'm tired of my boss I'm tired of this no no no no no no no it's working together it's working together hallelujah but God wants you to be patient my god go fulfill his work but you got to be patient oh my god don't take it in your hands don't do that hallelujah when you do that then God got away bringing that thing right back around Loreena God you learn patience as you wait on the Lord amen glory to God he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience look at it look at what he says why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed and and all of us want prayers like that I'll be honest with ya I just had one answered last night just like that I prayed and I needed a particular person that called me so the Lord I need them to reach out to me I ain't want to necessarily reach out to them but I need them to reach out to me and when I prayed I said Lord I just you know what I need and and within about about 40 minutes they got a text I say praise God praise God this is exactly what need it right and then that open up the door for me to share some things hallelujah but I couldn't go before God I had to wait now sometimes God will do that but not all the time there's some times that I needed God to Lord I need this done by this time can I tell them myself I need this done by this time and me I'm talking about me I give it away of God God if you don't do it by this time that's really what I'm saying in my prayer I got a plan B God told them that with my words but God knew my heart and he let me go right on with Plan B Plan B we'll put you more in depth somebody's saying man in here Plan B will delay the promise for being manifested Halloween to somebody plan B is a temporary satisfaction you need to stay and wait for plan a but I'm not gonna take Plan B hallelujah glory to God God is a good god hey man he know exactly what you need and when you need it you don't tell God you got no deadlines like he didn't see you get that notice God you see it God God know exactly but all about it amen you just learned to wait on God you present it and wait alright hello hello hello my God my God my God help us Lord Jesus amen this is the way God teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled this word and physical manifestations are very instant you pray you will never learn patience hallelujah but you become even more impatient with life that has all of life I mean you think about it you know your your your waiting on God learn how to be patient cause you to be patient with other people right hey man right so you become more even more impatient with life let me show you I don't know if I didn't bring that here it's gonna come back around and in the second part of the sermon let's just keep going since I let me show you this truth even more fully set forth Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham when he was tried off a deposit and he that had received the and he that had received the promise promises the Word of God offered up his only begotten Son there it is Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise so that this is key after you get a word from the Lord then you're gonna be tried on that word alright after you receive the word of promise most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus name glory to God over the good promises of God that there could not be a trial but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph and in Psalm 105 19 until that time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him look God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will I believe that I believe that but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patients into our souls si si si si patience is working at a deeper level Amen it's not just your flesh being satisfied quickly but God what God wants to do something down at the soul level listen he says we receive we must learn to receive patience it's our souls for only in patience do we possess life may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the 6th age learned patience we read the history of the lives of these great Christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome and over in patience and haste we're overcome by over impatience and haste we want things to happen real fast you know I mean oh yeah yeah yeah I saw that happen for you but now I gotta get me one too and you get in debt like that right you're getting debt when you when you destroy when you when you trying to capitalize on somebody else blessing that ain't your blessing that's their blessing praise the Lord you got to wait for your blessing hallelujah and you'll know when God's done it you'll know when God if God in terms it's gonna be all kind of opposition all kind of opposite and then you just keep treading through just and you think you actually moving by faith you actually think you moving by faith but God just keep sending you warning after one that no no no no no just wait wait for me wait wait don't get ahead of me and that's in anything in life glory to God hallelujah glory to God all right he talked about Noah a man he made a statement here and see Noah preached for 120 years and this brother Branham said that's plenty of patience this man preaching for 120 years and not even do from heaven know do anywhere from heaven but yet he's still waiting on God he still believes that what God told him think about this I mean let this really sink in what the man is a hundred and twenty years later and he believed that what God told him 120 years ago it's still gonna be fulfilled now think about think about where we're at we got a man we got a promise that we've been waiting on for a hundred and twenty minutes by two hours we've been waiting on this thing to be fulfilled and we get ahead of God because if that thing won't happen I'm gonna give you a chance who we working with here right God God is not a minion a man that he should lie if he promised it it's gonna come to pass we don't we don't put stipulations on God God that's not operate by our time he is an eternal being Lord I'm gonna give you a chance now I'm gonna need you to do it like this and like that no you don't do God that way amen amen you just learn to wait them and however he decide to do it that's that's that's that's up that's his prerogative glory to God Church he said no wait 120 years Amen no no sign of rain from nowhere but yeah he would still believe said just as dusty as it ever was for a hundred and twenty years but he was patient now I want to read this statement here from the Prophet because I think this would be real real good this is out of paragraph 237 in the statute of a perfect man he says Noah had patience yeah Noah had real godly patience God said I'm going to destroy this world with rain and Nora preached 120 years yet plenty of patience not even do from heaven not even do fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever was for 120 years but he was patient and I look at this then God tries your patience that's right God tries them I want you to think about that you can take it down I want to stop right there the brother branham say here here here no one's waiting 120 years and then he tries the spaces now not now now when I when I when I and I think about that just waiting 120 years is trial enough but that's that's trial enough but but when brother Branham makes this statement he's going a little deeper when he say God will try your patience Oh y'all gotta stay with me on this one now now it's one thing when Amen north's preaching and only people seem to agree with his message is his family and only people that he can get him votes at the preacher for 120 years the only amount of people you can get inside our bow is 8 and everybody that's in the bow is related to him now that's very discouraging that I can do all this preaching and not touch nobody's life a hundred and twenty years of preaching and nobody a man nobody's impacted by it but when he said that that that God will try your patience he was going a little deeper than that because when they finally got on the ark hallelujah brother Branham said that you got mad at Oh No go get everybody in the ark because I'm gonna sit in the rain tomorrow hallelujah and know about faith look go and get him right in the art and then no rain come on the next day oh Jesus and he say at that time maybe the first thing happened is his wife the closest thing to him begins to come next to him and this is how God begins to try his patience he lets his wife come and begin to doubt what he was saying no are you sure God told you this after hundred twenty years the boat is complete animals are coming and now God tries his patience by sending his wife to question everything he believed and God knows how to try you huh because the white fish the closest thing to you and you don't want to disappoint her right so God will try your patience by letting us say something and you gotta watch what you say back you gotta watch how you respond because God is trying your patience and all I can say is it's gonna rain here God told me a hundred and twenty years ago and I still believe it got a ring another trial to the patients I'm preaching all this right from a man's touch of a perfect man if you go back and listen to just that section you'll see I got this from there another tribes rapacious maybe though I say I can't get through to him and the kids go to mama and the kids say mama Hugh what you thought just daddy look daddy say it's gonna rain and here come the boys now the boys say daddy my mom have been acting this question you really gay no ask daddy we own this boat we got we got animals here we get debt and you said it was gonna rain yesterday it ain't rain yet it ain't rain yet daddy what daddy are you sure and he cried look at his boys say after 120 years of preaching and you all get down to the wire the boat is complete the animals have come it's going to rain now that God you saw God close the door you saw these things and now you get this they in art doubt him in New York not outside that's not a trial with the ones that's outside we told I was happening on the inside these people are in the casting down god close the door even if I wanted to I could get out hey it's time to tell the devil that we're all to doubt that you bring even if I wanted to I could get out of this [Applause] tangled up in this promise they own the arc in the arc doubting that's heavy and that did this now this is this is this is North Church this is North family this is what noir produced after 120 years of preaching this is what Noah got and he looks at and say oh my I mean all I can only words he has from God told me it's gonna rain and what you do is you find yourself as the only believer oh y'all in with me you find yourself standing alone you find yourself standing there by yourself you expected this one to be with you you expected that wouldn't be with you but no you standing alone and God want to know do you still believe you still gonna be patient you're still gonna wait you know the good thing about this is even you know like I say even if Noah try to leave he couldn't leave but you know the other good thing about that even if his family I don't care how much you doubt even if they try the leaf they could leave and eventually it settles him that we're in this together but what you got to do is let it settle in and don't argue it him don't force it in don't push it in eventually revelation I hate that we're in this thing together and then orchid that say son if you was going down you should have been on the other side of the door but not if you were to hear God gonna make a believer out of you God tries your patience that's right God tries them look at this oh my my I like this one here brother Adam said Moses had pieces Moses knew that he had to just wait on the Lord and and what happened with Moses is that he he got this you know this this startling Amen thing that happened to him on the backside of the desert and he's there and God has it he has a rod that's hand aghast a throw down on the rod and the rod turns into a snake now according to the scripture Moses began to run from that snake he was afraid of snakes so so as he's running from the snake then God challenges him hallelujah because so you can either be moved by fear or you can be moved by faith and what God has to do is actually challenge the faith caused that to rise up on the inside and he said not now I told you to throw down that snake I didn't tell you what was gonna happen I just told you to throw it down he threw it down by faith it turned into snake he run from he said now go back and pick up the snake now that's challenging your faith where you have to overcome your fear nobody is there with Moses no children no wife no other shepherds it's only Moses in a snake and I can imagine that snake would not move not move one going anywhere and Moses had to reach down by faith pick it up not knowing what was gonna happen and when they reaches down and picks us up mix it up it turns back to steam this just just just taken Moses to another level and there didn't say now most I want you to do something I know you know you don't you don't reach tell me a bosom for years now I want you to do it again reach down in your bosom and put your hand out he thought is just doing something like it like when it come out a white ass lepers he says oh my goodness now he's probably wondering in his mind what was in there if my hand went in there touched it what's in there that caused my hand to do saying I put your hand back in there wait a minute if it wasn't anything in there then imma cause the rest of my body to become contaminated by faith he takes his hand puts it right back down and brings her back out he's here hallelujah then Moses takes this down to Egypt he was that he was encouraged he was inspired and he goes down to Egypt and when it gets to Egypt he thought he had himself something Pharaoh let my people go and he's just sitting there discounting you know he got this confidence and it takes it and throws down his rod I told you Pharaoh let my people go it turns into a snake and Moses thought like everybody's gonna be like him running like he ran but that that would that won the case when he threw it down Pharaoh looked at Moses that's all you got say Moses you know that's a cheap magician trick now now now now now my question is what are these magicians practicing that Pharaoh would say that's a cheap magician trick hallelujah I love this look look at this statement I'm gonna just read the statement like I want to read the whole quote brother branham say when you've done exactly what he said do seem like it went wrong stand still and be patient I want to say that again when you're done exactly what he said - seemed like it went wrong stand still and be patient any all in some situations where it seemed like those are key words went wrong well I got an answer for this morning stand still be patient Jesus Moses stood there and when he see a cheap magician trick he just stood there patient waiting on God he didn't know what God God never even told him now Moses you gonna throw down your rod and they come through it on a rod and it's gonna become snakes and then I'm gonna take your snake and I'm eat he didn't tell Moses none of that Moses had to stand there by faith and wait for God to do what God was gonna do and before you know it Moses snake devoured the first one Moses snake devout the second one and then he reached down and picked up his his his his uh the rod again by the snake the snake's tail picked it up again now the question is now where are your snakes if you throw some mold down here we're gonna take them up - I'll come on somebody but that didn't happen until Moses demonstrated patience Moses then get up and get upset with God and run out in the room like Lord you you didn't tell me that was gonna happen he ain't got to tell you everything that's gonna happen he just wants you to be patient the Hebrew boys show patience by waiting on God to in the fire furnace Daniel show patience by waiting in the lion's den and and and and and it's just a real quick statement that the Prophet makes here in the statute of program and says Paul had patient said certainly did look what Paul had to do talk about patient let ask all the prophets said about Paul but never went into any detail you say Paul had patient glory to God certainly did look what Paul had to do talk about patient I might I say Lord well what did how did Paul have patience I went back to acts 23 11 let's read this real quick acts 23 11 hallelujah all glory it says and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem so much style bear witness also at Rome now Paul was going through some trials there in Jerusalem and you know I mean there were people that were threatening that they wouldn't kill Paul they were they were gonna do everything they could it just so happened that Paul had a nephew that kind of led him in on some of the secrets they were waiting on Paul to come through a certain certain path and they were gonna they were just going they were they gonna take Paul out my god but but somehow God you know responded and he and he brought Paul through that situation glory to God the same way that he'll bring you through whatever situation that the devil has planned against you and here he gives Paul a promise he says you know as you know Paul you as you testified of me and Jerusalem I also want you to bear witness of me in Rome and and I need you gonna testify of me and Rome now he's in Jerusalem but pretty much it's saying you're going to Rome you're gonna make it their own now now God is God God's ways are not our ways and God's thoughts are not our thoughts we think going to Rome maybe get in a plane and just go to Rome get in the boat at that time and just go to Rome God had other ideas of how he was gonna get Paul to Rome hallelujah amen and and I'm here to tell you don't matter how you get to Rome just long as you get to Rome Oh glory to God now as I start I just ran out of Acts 23 a man that Paul was on his way to Rome and it's a it's only in acts 28 that we find Paul in Rome hallelujah so there's some things that happened from Acts 23 amen to acts 28 it meant only his way to Rome now now the first thing is in acts 24 he was taken to Felix who prolong judgment for two years Amen the man should have been released from prison but this man prolonged judgment until he was actually pushed out of office my god he was hoping that Paul would give him some money to buy his freedom Paul stay right in jail and didn't give a man nothing hallelujah the man ended up losing a man it's placing in the next governor comes in my god and we found him in acts 25 his name is Festus glory to God he replaced Felix and here Paul is appealing to stand before Caesar amen my God he's talking to Fester's but he said I appeal I want to go to Caesar where is Caesar sees us in Rome hallelujah but he's stuck over here amen for two years and now he's coming underneath to the next rule and he said I want to go to Caesar oh my God my God my God because he remembers the prophecy that he's the bear witness also in Rome why he's there underneath a Festus King Agrippa comes hallelujah and I love this part right here he stood before King Agrippa and he began to give his personal testimony King as he spent in that before King Agrippa now Paul is a man that wrote two thirds of the New Testament but when he will he stands before King get this when he stands before King rather than talk about all the deep revelations that God gave him Paul just begin to share his personal testimony and I want you to know by Paul's personal testimony King Agrippa says thou almost persuaded me to be a Christian not with his deep revelations not with his deep understanding but with his personal testimony he almost persuades King Agrippa to become a Christian I love that all you need is your personal testimony and so some people need to hear just how God did this for you how you getting away you at right now it's a personal testimony hallelujah be willing to share your personal testimony listen at this finally in acts 20:7 because he has asked to go to sit before Caesar acts for the seventh day finally loosed and they set sail for Rome but in the midst of selling to Rome the Bible says that they get caught by in tempestuous wind call euro-crime so this is what I get from this is that if acts 23 say you're going to Rome and in the midst of going the Rome I got to go through your Clyde on I am still in the will of God and I'm going to Rome I hope y'all get that the devil might be attacking you with the tempestuous wind and all the times when we have real serious trials we begin to doubt whether we're the will of God or not I'm here to tell the devil he's a liar even in your Oh Clyde time I am in the perfect will of God and I'm doing the role that see all things are working together for good I don't care about your old client you got another name for the storm because I'm gonna make it through your Clyde ah Jesus hallelujah glory to God Church not only not only is Paul gonna make it through the tempestuous wind but but in this trial God tells Paul that everybody that's with you gonna be spared but there's only one one thing they need to do stay on the boat and and Noah's day that had to get in the boat now and Paul's that you got to stay on the boat if you're gonna be spared hallelujah don't jump ship I just like telling y'all that don't jump sit well whatever you do don't jump ship don't don't don't jump sit God got this thing under control Holly in your marriage don't jump ship and your relationship don't jump ship on your job don't jump ship don't jump don't dopes I can't take no more this I mean you're a client I'm I'm being I'm being hit from all sides don't jump ship you're still in the will of God everybody that's selling with him gonna be spared they couldn't get out of the boat if they were gonna survive and then eventually the ship became stuck and the soldiers desire to kill some of the prisoners because they were thinking that they're gonna escape now now here's the thing when you read the scripture the the captain of the soldiers because Paul was on board the ship and he even though he was a captive a man because Paul was there that man say I'm not gonna kill a man the kill these prisons because powerless in the myths now I will tell you some there's some people being spared oh there there's some people being spared death because she would fall Oh hallelujah Church glory the reason that job is blessed and because she needs a blessing amen Paul was on board even though he was a prison sister citerior refused the request of the soldiers now look at this when when the ship was stuck the front end was stuck but the back end was in the water just being beat up against you know the water waves just beating it and just knocking boards and everything off now you got some people on the ship that I'm a prisoner but I don't know how to swim so you ain't got to worry about me running nowhere I'm goin wherever y'all going by this time they didn't cut all the boots all the safety wraps have been cut from the ship so so all they got now is a man is just some boards hallelujah and what when they were encouraged to say those that can swim go ahead and swim to shore but those that can't swim just grab ahold of one of the broken pieces and you just begin to float up to shore on broken pieces I'm here to tell you this morning you can make it broken pieces [Music] and even though you floated up down broken pieces you still in the will of God because you got to go to Rome hallelujah you can make it on broken pieces if if everything around you seem like it's falling apart you can still make it I'm broken pieces god help me Jesus oh you're still in the perfect will of God even when you were enduring euro Qaeda when you've done exactly what he said for you to do and it seemed like everything went wrong stand still be patient they get to shore they're not in Rome yet they just I'm sure they just made it up the show Paul it's cold Paul wants to stand by fire Paul reaches out in the fire to fix some wood and gets bit by a snake and when the people saw what kind of snake it was I say immediate death immediate and they just looked at him just with it no doctor could help him nothing this man gonna die right now everybody was expecting death but there was a promise Paul was wrapped in a promise all the way in acts 23 that say you gonna stand in Rome and you gonna be a witness so let me tell you something every trial that poll went through on his way to Rome became witness material I can stand to say I was bit by a snake but I'm still here I face euro climbing but I'm still here whatever the devil has tried has failed because I'm still loved this everything you tried everything you've tried you've done exactly what he said do seem like it went wrong you just stand still and be patient watch God do what he gonna do oh I just believe this I believe this a man a man it was only in acts 28 he bit by the snake but he just shook it off and I want to encourage you shake it off whatever the devil throwing just just that brother West Greece is singing the song shake shake shake shake the devil off in the name of Jesus shake it off it talked about that that uh that uh the mule that got trapped a man in the whale and they could figure out how to get the mule out so they just begin to throw dirt in the whale and when they throw dirt in the whale they would hit the back of the mule and when the beautiful on his back then he'll just shake and then they throw some old dirt and he shake and they throw some odor and he just shake but every time he shake the dirt was going down to his feet building up the foundation huh amen and every every time he's sick he actually raised him higher they throw mo down and he shake me raise a little bit higher glory to God and they didn't before you know it they put enough dirt in there where the mule was able to come out on his own glory to God the devil may be throwing dirt you just shake you gonna come out this thing you've got overcome this thing glory to God you just be patient and wait on God watch him bring you through shake the devil off in the name of Jesus shake of all my gods the Prophet also said the Pentecostal believers had to wait until they were in dude with power from on high and let me just give you a scripture on that Hebrews 10 verse 35 through 38 oh god help us Jesus it's a man he says this in the scripture cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and ye that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure him I want to tell you just wait on God you have need of patience after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise Amen are just are gonna live by faith just keep waiting Church whatever you do just just keep waiting hallelujah there's a little testimony here that I just want to share with you and we'll we'll slip over a man to this war strategy the the Prophet says this in a message the hours come it says recently she had sent one of those handkerchiefs to her sister for her little baby that had a clubfoot and she told a lady she said you tie the handkerchief on its foot and the Lord is going to heal it so she left the handkerchief on about two weeks and it got so dirty and she said you can wash it and then put it back on oh my god my god my god like dogs you can wash it and then put it back on so she did and the handkerchief getting kind of old and warm she said well there's no difference in the baby's foot that I guess I might as well take it off and she said oh don't you do that said if it comes to pieces you tie it with strings then tie it back on there she said because I know that it will get well she seems so many things done in the meetings and the woman did that oh she just had a few strings of that handkerchief tied on the baby's foot and one morning she went to get the baby and the Lord had been there that night come on somebody that I love the scripture say weeping me and do it for a night but joy coming tomorrow do you know when we wouldn't heard the quote where the angel the Lord passed through the neighborhood but this time the prophecy the Lord Himself showed up that night hallelujah somebody all we waiting on him wait we just waiting on God to show up this situation gonna change listen say say she brought he said said where my women and she brought the baby I'm sorry and the woman did that just a few stream through streams of the ankle of table read foot one morning she went to get the baby the Lord had been there that night and the baby's foot was straight and she brought the baby to the meeting to show and brought the strings that was left on the handkerchief and hand had the baby's picture before and where it was then how the little baby's foot was clubbed in like that a little baby about eight or ten months old and there was the little baby's foot just as normal any other baby now what if she just throw the handkerchief away and say well that's that's where we missed the blessings don't throw it away don't throw the promise away that's where we miss the blessings we're afraid to wait on God hallelujah we're afraid to wait on God just a little bit so you see you heard that only wait again I hear that whisper only wait it won't be very long even now the father's hand is pleading soon with Jesus we will sing the victory song that's right just wait on God believe it confess it stay with it and God will bring it to pass for you believe it confess it stay with it God will bring it to pass for you I love that I want to just kind of slip over here I'll kind of cut back on some of my notes but you know as we talk about this war strategy a man and we're just going back we're taking what we see here in what we see here through the church ages and I'm sorry through through the seven virtues and and what we're doing is applying these different virtues to different things that happen in Scripture different wars that might have happened in Scripture and when I thought about this there were a couple of them that came to mind but the one that I wanted to use today was a man the war strategy found in Joshua because as we as we talked about Josh was there having a conversation with the captain of the Lord's host he went approaching the captain of Laura's home said nine and noticed Johnson went standing back waiting look look I know God gave us this land and God already told me as I was with Moses so will I be with you say not even not one man to be able to stand before you so Joshua did not have any fear Joshua would approach him a man the captain hoses that are you Forrest or are you against us right because I need to know this I need to know and they say I'm neither you say but I'm the captain of the Lord's hostess and when Josh will recognize that this was the of God Joshua bowed himself to our own owners on his face and he began to worship Lord ah the same experience where Moses was told to take off his shoes in the presence of God now Joshua's been told the same thing so nothing and brother branham say that pillar fire that Moses saw in the bush had now become a man and josh was standing here before this man joshua receives or a man has a download to his system a man he receives strategy for war hallelujah and then you go into joshua 6 and you see what his strategy is his strategies he tells the people say now we're gonna put a jericho it's our first battle and what we're gonna have to do is march around the walls 7 days one time hallelujah the strategy strategy is just a march around the world now i understand it requires patience glory to God to just do exactly what I say March around this world seven times and then on the seventh day we're gonna march seven times on the seventh day now this requires a lot of patience not only this Josh will have to have patience to wait on God but Joshua has to have patience with the people yes I have patience with the people in and not only does Josh will have to have patience with the people but the people have to have patience with each other for seven days we can't talk for seven days we can't sing but we all gotta March hallelujah we got a March the way that the word tells us to March maybe you got somebody that's in the camp let's say we don't March for four days and ain't nothing happened and they telling you in the camp we don't March is for raisin and pastor Joshua wants to march again say say I'm not going out there to March and they bill you gotta go and work with your brother you gotta go work with this know God gave this commandment to all of us Amen and if you don't March sugar into everybody I know you don't feel like marching but you guys that get yourself up and you got to march with us hallelujah glory to God if you gonna rejoice with us then you better be marching with us hallelujah somebody you gotta encourage your brother you gotta have patience you gotta wait amen wait on the Lord and wait on them hallelujah while you're waiting saying I'm and you finally get him to the seventh day so now we gonna this is gonna be it now and they taste it now you know what today is the other day it's Victory Day no no you realize what today is yeah the day we that the wall is going down no you realize we got the mark you know how hard it's been just to march one time per day 99 seven times seven times you know that's gonna be very difficult and you got to have somebody that's in the camp that got it like a a real bubbly spirit come on somebody that can that can just kind of just like I know it's gonna seem like it's tougher but maybe if we just kind of get a little cadence in our mind huh because they say that about my soldiers Amen the way sometime they forget about how they feel they just starts singing them them songs huh now we can't say a word we can't shout we can't do nothing but let's just get something in our mind Oh God cuz God did said he could have that but maybe if everybody's singing the same song in their mind it gives them strength that gives them courage just to kind of keep marching and as they march they go around one time they go around two times they go around three all the way to seven times and they finally maybe somebody's just ready to just give up now they think they think of themselves ain't no way I'm gonna be ready for a battle after doing all this walking well I got good news you don't have to fight anyway hallelujah God just needed you to be patient and God was gonna fulfill his word once you did exactly what he asks you to do now Joshua said now give me the gimmick give me give me that seven priests he said we gotta blow the trumpet and when I bid to shout just let out that the the greatest shout and I can't you imagine how tired they were oh come on church can you imagine how weak they were but here their weakest moment God is asking for the greatest shout Oh God when you when you try out of your finances when everything coming to get you that's when God asks you to give I mean when you just whoa I can't give no mo God said not give her now try tell me you tried me anything this week it's Alan what but not God world the greatest shout you got him by faith Josh was healing count of three I want y'all to shout like you ain't never shot it before one two three hallelujah and as they begin to worship even when they didn't feel like worshiping the walls begin to come down it was a battle that they did not have to fight all they did was wait on God and God prove this word you've been waiting on God now God is gonna prove his word glory to God this is a war strategy hallelujah enemies already defeated glory to God Church glory glory glory hallelujah to God I believe this I believe we just gone through these services to go through sermons God is good ready to bring manifestation entire life because we're planning strategy not only are we getting victory in the natural but our soul is being changed to look like Jesus to act like Jesus to talk like Jesus it's happening on the inside manifesting itself on the outside every virtue will be applied hallelujah glory to God oh I believe this I believe this when they were tired when they were weary weak God said give me your best shot give me your best shot and they gave it a God you watch what God do some y'all situation changing right now why you in here things are changing right now [Applause] IIIi believe we serve the same God remember I can't think of the brother's name right now but brother branham told her brothers say I give you your children what was his name anybody remember his name I say I give you your children in the name of the Lord the man was in church worshipping praising I give you by the time the man got home brother don't and by the time brother Dalton got home the children were calling him saying daddy I want to be saved you think God loved brother Dalton more than he loved you no he don't love God either he loved you equally and if he's able to give it oh my god I God don't give gifts a man that are not equal to everybody huh hey man he wants to show that hey I love him just as much he pray for his kids you praying for your kids and I give you your kids Oh glory to God glory to God glory to God thank you Jesus I believe that I believe that I believe that this war strategy I got patients with carts a Manny Manny Manny Manny man thank you Lord Jesus glory glory glory glory glory glory to God a man a man a couple things here we wind this up out of the message we would see Jesus the Prophet says now I believe that all Scripture is given by inspiration and the scripture has got to be right or all of it right or there might be that if we could say some of its right and some of its not right then we get we get ourselves all mixed up I just believe that it's all the truth now I may not be able to have faith to make it all manifest it it's promised and so forth to bring them to pass but I will never stand in somebody's way that does have faith to do it amen I might not climb where Enoch did and take an afternoon walk with God and go home with her I might not have that much faith and I might not have enough faith to shout like Joshua that knocked the walls down but I certainly not stand in anyone's way who does have that type of faith a Manny Manny Manny man yeah I just made the comment I said if God God would show give up if God before God be with us then where is all his miracles get that one next I just said that just the way brother Dalton receive and you know in the Holy Spirit through the Prophet st. I give you your children well I just said it here this this morning the Holy Spirit now through me has said the same thing I'd give you your children we got it we got a catch when God speaking right
