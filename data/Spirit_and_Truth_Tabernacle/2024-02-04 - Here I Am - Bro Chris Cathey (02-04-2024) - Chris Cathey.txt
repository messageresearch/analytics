out these things so now she can get in the car and ride and and um um we we know it's nothing but the Lord Jesus that is bringing healing to her body you know I am um um I was recently listening to a a a tape and actually brother shared the quote with me and then I happened to be listening to the tape and brother brandom said it on there uh it saying you know when we get sick it says your first Duty y'all want to know what your first duty is are y'all ready for this I can pull it up now if you want me to your first duty is to go to your doctor a man that pray for the sick told us your first duty is go to the doctor that's what the quote say now he say your first Duty go to the doctor say if the doctor can't help you then it's your right as a Believer it's your right to have prayer over you he said but the first Duty go to the doctor so you can use a chiropractor yes sir they they they help I know I they help me I'm I'm a little witness I'm telling you God uses chiropract to bring healing to me I used to been couldn't been this thumb I wasn't able to been that thumb I would go and try to just take my gas cap off and have just so much pain just trying to take a gas cap off and I said I got to do something and I went to the chiropractor and I say um you know they say y'all can work things and joints and all that so I I want y'all to work on this cuz I can't do nothing with this it's just solid just stuck and they say okay give us a little time and um they put me under some type of little laser treatment and um and and as they start doing that and and working on me next thing you know I mean it was taking a little time actually taking a little longer than I wanted because uh cuz I went I went and told the chiropract I'm going just be honest I went and told the chiropract I I I said look uh I've been paying monthly and weekly and I ain't seeing no results and and if if y'all don't y'all don't get this fixed soon I'mma I'mma have to find something else so you know he's a you know I'mma call him a message believer I'mma just call them that because I know they know the message and uh and and and they uh he he say now wait Pastor wait wait wait wait now hold on I say uh he he said now when you go to church and you speak to the people people about faith and when they don't see results right away what you tell them to do Pastor I say good point I'll be back next week and I'm glad I stayed with it because it brought healing to my body I can pin that finger now God uses doctors come on somebody but we thank the Lord amen for our precious sister she feeling so much better and uh and I just I just thank God because you know he he he promised that he would be a Healer and when he told us that uh it was his will for us to prosper and to be in good health even as our soul prospers when God said that he did not put a age limit he didn't say you got to be 16 to be healed he didn't say you got to be five to be healed 50 to be healed he if you reach 80 he's still gave you that same promise so no matter where in the journey like I told you last week these promises that we have the past tense they future tense and they present tense it's an eternal

you know the book's been open before you amen from Genesis to Revelation yes sir you know we just got off a cruise ship we on this gospel cruise ship and I thought man if I could ever just get on Solid Ground we were coming back it was great going out but coming back it got a little rough the whole boat was shaking we were praising the Lord every night having good old gospel singing and I tell you I still feel it I feel like the whole world is just doing like this right now yeah but I tell you you got to have a solid Foundation all right and your solid foundation we got to build upon his faith glory and it's a sick it's a sense it's that super sense brother BR talks about is that something on the inside that you see things that other people don't see you know you wanton your body obeys your confession so if you're sick this morning let your body just keep saying I'm well if you need another job just say Lord you're going to be my provider hallelujah oh we got to claim that this morning I don't how far we're going to get brother Jack with this presence but you know we might not give him any notes in but praise God praise God he has a plan and we know that so let's turn this morning to uh Isaiah as brother Jack we're sitting eating last night and here he go start started preaching my sermon a little bit I said Brother come on brother so you got to you got to think about Isaiah 58 this morning I just kind of paraphrasing for time but uh but at the writing Isaiah he had a very hard task prach it a very very hard task because the people that once was with God was in captivity and bondage now come on you know I believe that's the condition of this world all right you know I once serve God abrah uh throughout Generations he could you could put all the presidents our forefathers on every corner and it still wouldn't be close to God I'm paraphrasing that today but but think about how far away the world has got from God everywhere you go it it it's corrupt everywhere you look but there's a bride in the house tonight there's a there's a bride that he's coming for that I'm speaking to this morning and I'm telling you young old mother age you are I tell you get the holy spirit because he said you're sealed until the day of redemption you know what you might backslide but you know what you're still a child of God don't let Satan tell you any other way there might be somebody that came to the altar one day gave the heart was filled up and they might bu in the world they might be backslid but God will not lose one of them you keep praying for you keep believing I don't know what it is about this message but I tell you what it's called us out hallelujah it's an exodus is fixed in the F place and you and me are fixing to get out of here and when your brother and sisters out in the world or Solomon said pray for this family or I tell you we need to pray for one another we need to uplift people that that are in this word I was sitting at the table last night and I told Brother Jack I said you know I'm tired of this message box all right on I'm tired of living in a message box that we have all the gold we have everything we have need of but we're not sharing it with anybody how can you not share the share what God's gave you to somebody else because once more there was a Chris Kathy in a Baptist Church that one day God came my way and they say why don't you listen to this tape or you know they didn't even say a few words all they said was listen to this tape or you don't have to go out there and preach a big Sermon Just live a life but I'm telling you this we're still here all right we're still here today and I'm telling you you might be the very person on your job all right might be the person at the gas station wherever it's h hey it might be somebody at this church over here they just going the wrong way there's two ways you got the right way and the left way and brother Jack said just follow the sign for the church I said well we going to the bride church but what it's Grace that passed your away it's Grace that you got eyes to see today hallelujah praise God I'm sorry I see how far we get but in Isaiah 58 we we're going paraphrase a little bit but but he was in a very difficult time he was sitting here that once wor worship God but now worshiping idols and and and came to a place it was a very hard task that they were in bondage they were in bondage but I want I want to go through Isaiah 58 uh verse 9 first 58 ver9 he says then shall they call on the Lord and shall answer they shall cry and they shall say hear I if thou take away from the midst of the Oak and putting forth off the finger and speaking vanity and verse 10 it says and if thou draw out thy soul to the hunger and satisfy The Afflicted Soul then shall thy light rise obscurity and thy Darkness be as a noon Day verse 11 and the Lord shall guide thee continually can we say that the Lord shall cond guide us continually oh thank you Lord and satisfy thy soul and drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like watered garden and like a spring of water whose Waters fell not verse 12 and they shall they that they that shall be they shall build the old PL old waste places and thou shall raise up foundations of many generations and thou shall be called the repairer of the breach and the restorer of pass to dwell in oh I believe I'm speaking to restorers today that he had to come by your way and restore something to dwell in why don't you think that He restored you one day he came by your house hey I tell you maybe he didn't give you a message book maybe he didn't tell a message quote he just stopped on your way and said hey if you'll print of your sins and be baptized with the Holy Ghost I'll fill you yes oh think about that one today you may be seated so I want to speak on a few minutes this this morning here am I amen here am I of this scripture it says verse n it says and then shall calling the Lord they shall answer and they shall cry I tell you be doing some good to do some crying to the Lord sometimes just to speak to the Lord and cry out to the Lord and you know I I brother Jack we were driving 15 16 hours and we stopped by a church and I walked slipping in the back door and brother Josh B said man he slipped through and I said praise God and I'm telling you what I had Revival at the altar I said Lord if you I'm going be the first one in that place to get to that altar today I don't care what anybody says I don't care what anybody looks like I'm just going to go talk to Jesus and I tell you sometimes we got to get in our life where we just don't care what the next person thinks or what the next Pro whoever it is and just say Lord I'm coming to get a blessing I'm coming to receive mine this morning and I tell you you got to get to a place where you you say Lord I cry out to you my God we're in a dry and thirsty land as Isaiah was but he said he said you cry and you shall you shall answer and thou shalt cry and you shall say here am I here I am right I tell you that's how God is today we are worshiping The Great I Am amen and he's here to tell you today if you're going through trials and heartaches and you know what just keep pressing amen just keep pressing because your reward is right here amen I tell you we were so close we were we were on this ship and amongst uh uh you know it it was a blessing I told Rachel we were sitting there on the deck and all these people were just fully dressed I was blown away all right nominal Christians yeah and I said but you know what I'm great I had these CDs and I had these little things brother Jack and these artists and I said God bless you I just want to give you this and it's got a little website on it and Rachel said Chris they they you know they we we know singers compared to them I said I'm not doing it for the singing I'm doing it maybe they read one little thing on their website and maybe maybe it' be one of them that we get out of here I'm not worried about a position today I'm not worried about how far they think they've got in life you know what you've got the best thing that ever hit the planet and that God has gave you eyes to see and ears to hear the truth I you got something to praise the Lord about if you came not feeling well I tell you just get up and say Lord thank you for your blessings oh walk into your blessings this morning oh I tell you what he'll say here am I here am I I tell you that's how Isaiah was he you know he's at a time and he kind of told the people he said just get back to God and I tell you why he'll come come for you brother brother BR says he he says this quote I like what he says he said if you want to get somewhere with god let's listen to this never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around I tell you last night I said praise God help me Lord amen don't let No Malice come oh this will do us some good this morning yes he said no matter what anybody says if you're if you're all wrong he said don't let don't never build up a complex against that person he say see he said you be sweet and kind yes oh I think we brother Jack I think we've not listened to these messages today or read the Bible sometimes oh I tell you Lord help me get out of the message bubble God he said you be sweet and kind remember God loves you when you were in sin oh you he says and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's been wrong all right oh my I tell you we can stop there and preach on all that all day I tell you love him when he's been wrong oh he didn't say oh well he he's got to have everything in line come on no all the clothes all right I tell you the devil knows all the quotes he knows all the scriptures but it's the life behind the name oh it's the life behind the name that makes the devil tremble glory to God oh but he says and if the spirit of God is in you you love you love the other person when he's been wrong see he said just pray for him and love one another amen he said above everything love God and love one another amen oh and be humble with God and around one another amen oh wow brother Jack we stay on this all day prach and God will bless it right and it's it's hard telling what he will do usually when churches begin to get numbers uhoh and get to getting a little big or something like that he said then they get away from the real thing the real thing so don't focus on numbers today Lord help me not to focus on numbers I told someone the other day I said Rachel said well why' you do this why'd you post that I said because I want to just shat a light to the world right I said I don't care if that I'm not going for the money I'm not I'm just going for another soul and just the shine a light for Jesus Christ I said God's blessed me I was sitting there with brother Jack last night I said God has blessed me with a great job and a beautiful family and I tell you what I just want to serve God and shine a light and you today should shine a light for Jesus sh right glory to God hallelujah oh it says I think about Job the same situation and he lost everything think about it he lost all his family he had sickness all his health all his riches hey no matter what you got he can take it tomorrow oh my you can build up a fortune I'm telling you and I'm telling you I've been in a situation where you build things up and all of a sudden things starting to get just get starting to lose because God says hey let me have it back let me see what you'll do for have it back let me see if you pay your tires every Sunday even when you don't have a job oh let me see if you're going to be faithful with the little things so I can bless you with many things I tell you he says I was thinking the other day they said Chris why are you so blessed I said because the word says seek first the kingdom and then everything will be added I tell you I think we forget that today you got to seek the kingdom first don't s it second don't s it third sing it first I tell you God will be in it yes he will God will be in it but I thought about job job 23 verse 8-10 job 23 8-10 he says I love what he says here he said behold I go forward but he is not there listen have you ever had a place in your life and maybe I'm the only one but you place in your life you feel like God's A Million Miles Away all right oh you don't hear your prayer all right oh I'm just going to speak really honestly today yeah he comes to my life sometimes to brother Jack I'll be praying I don't feel him I don't I know he's there all right but I don't see him there's days I get up I don't even feel like getting out of the bed all right but I still get out yes and I said God I know you're still listening I know you're still there think about job he they God took they stripped everything from him he said but go Satan you can't take his life but you know what Satan had to do he had to ask permission TR brother yes sir did you know that Satan has to ask permission to test you he has to come to the commander and say brother Jack let me test him he says he but brother Solomon oh brother Troy think about it oh he says he believes a message he says he preaches this but let me let a sickness come on his body and let me see if he's going to trust me through this or trust me through that amen I tell you what and then here's job 23 he says behold I go forward he said but he is not there listen and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he said where he doeth work he said but I cannot Behold Him He hided himself on the right hand that I cannot see him he said but he knoweth the way yes that I take when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold oh Church you might not see him on the right hand you might not see him on the left hand but he's working something for your good oh he's working you out oh he's working you out this morning you I tell you what it's time to praise them more in our trials and our things we go through in life I tell you it's hard to praise them sometimes than you're going through the midst of the the the valley but he's still worthy of Our Praise no matter how far we go or how much we get on our back he's still worthy of our praise that's right I thought about Chronicles 15:2 he said the Lord is with the with you while you be with him and if you seek Him He will be found of you but if you forsake Him He will forsake you oh my help us to never forsake the Lord help us to make a stand for I tell you what so many people are falling away we're driving all over brother Jack and I this person that person but you be the one to not fall away all right all right you have a solid foundation today you have a a great pastor in a great solid church and I'm not just saying that I'm telling you you're blessed you're a blessed people today you're blessed people to have a foundation on the they everybody that wants to be evil I tell you even in the message when you're traveling around you see it more and more that people you'll hear oh this person's fall away this person's but you know what the children of God will not fall away God my God it's a true calling out today we are coming down to the finish line am and I tell you the true soldiers are going to stand if it's just me and brother Solomon brother Jack some of y'all if it's just a couple of us we're going to stand that's right you're going to keep standing and you you'll be the very one that your children get in today all right think about walking into the ark and when the door starting to close brother Jack and you got a grandbaby or somebody out there and they say well you know what not just you but your whole house comes in hallelujah oh your whole house th just because you stood in this day Hallelujah your family got saved your whole house got saved stop worrying about your kids pray for them but stop worrying about them because he says hey if you can be saved he said that whole house could be saved it's time it's time to get back to the basics of the Bible all right now the foundation the prophet said he said don't make any difference something down in his heart he's talking about the healing of J's daughter he said don't make any difference something down in his heart told him get to Jesus amen he said he he had a need and every man that feels that a tongue of the holy spirit will lay aside everything else and run to him he said if you really get to needing it bad enough he said if it becomes between death and life he said you'll move no matter what anybody says that's right yes he said yes he must get to Jesus it's between death and life and I'm telling you today it's between death and life you get the Holy Spirit Holy says he must find him right quick he said and it might be later than you think he said go go hunting quickly I'm telling you I'm hunting today Glory we're hunting for the last seed not for my Ministry but for his ministry amen he said the day that you seek me with you all your heart that's the day I found of you when you seek me with all your heart amen oh I think we need to get back to the basics of seeking him with all our hearts seeking him with everything that's within us amen boy said one time we were at a b a baseball game and I somewhere and now we were pray we were jumping on shouting I tell you what I like to get some of y'all in a big old baseball game football game and just watch your reaction I like to sit beside you and just see how you you you you you H for for a for a bucket of air for for a leatherbound leather bound uh football that's got some air in it and then you come to church and you walk through the door and you bring Satan with you and you sit him beside you and you say it's going to be okay today and we comeing frowning and disappointed but I tell you what we have something to shout about the children of God have something to praise God about you got the very keys they unlock that door God's gave you the very keys of the hour if these people could have it they would want it but he's gave he's he's put eyes have on your eyes today because he said here am I here am I I come in your day I walked in your house and gave you the truth amen oh but I tell you what don't just share it with the Believers share it with the non-believers because there's someone El there in these churches on the streets in these food banks wherever they are I tell you they need to hear about Jesus yes sir I tell you we put it on the shelf or but the Jack we just we just say we got 1,200 messages just mine oh my Lord no it's for the whole world that will receive them yes sir amen and if they don't see it you move to the next one you move to the next one you tell the next at the gas pump right and I'm not saying you got to go in there and preach a whole sermon to just be salty right just say hey God bless you today hey you know what pay for the person behind you all right all right all right pay for the whole entire hour behind you and tell them hey every time they come get that coffee you tell them we Jesus loves them and God bless themall amen oh before you know they'll be following you all right where's he going Sunday you probably have 10 cars out here just cuz you paid for the coffee I tell you what let us get back to Jesus it first Kings 8:57 the Lord Our God be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us I'm speaking about here am I today all right oh let us not forsake Him Deuteronomy 316 he says be strong and of good courage fear not or why are we fearing today all right nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he is that thou doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake Thee I tell you that do some good to put that down in our in our in our notes today he said he will not fail thee nor forsake thee that's your God that's my god oh verse seven he says and Moses called un Joshua he says and he said unto him in thy sight of isra and all of Israel be strong and of good courage for thou must go with this with the with this people unto the land which the Lord has SW sworn unto th fathers their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it verse eight and the Lord and the Lord he is that doeth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee he said fear not neither be dismayed oh he's already prepared a way he's already made the way before they even even you even get there whatever trials in your life today he's already made a way of Escape amen you just got to keep walking forward you might not feel like it but you got to keep pressing forward Psalms 1 1388 the Lord will Pro will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy oh Lord endureth forever I'm talking about I with thee forsake not thy works of thy own hands Oh I thought about this uh Nehemiah 9:31 nevertheless for thy great Mercy sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful god Hallelujah aren't you thankful he's a gracious God and I believe we're all in Isaiah's time at one time we were scattered about just in sin in this world seeking God and you know what God came by your place Glory he came by your house and knocked on your door and said you know what brother Solomon here's the truth oh my here's the eyes to see yes sir oh but I tell you what it's worth it all no matter what we go through in life no matter it's worth it all to keep pressing forward but I tell you John 10:10 this is what I think the thief is doing today the thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and destroy but I like he didn't end it there he says but I come that they might have life and not just have life but have it more abundantly oh church I want to see some life in you today I want to see some life in you today no no matter what you feel taste hear smell there something on the inside that's bubbling there's something on the inside that that brother Solomon was saying just y'all keep moving forward don't look through the rearview mirror right keep looking through the windshield amen you know how big that windshield is out here keep looking through it keep pressing forward amen but I like God that he's here am I but verse go back to Isaiah 59 ver 59 I like what brother the the what he says in 59 he's talking to him he says behold he said but I like what he says the Lord's hand is not shortened all right he said that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear oh Church don't forget that his that his hand is not shortened today but his ear is still listening for a Cry he's listen for a child of God to say Lord fill me today touch my body today amen then he goes to verse two he said oh but listen to this but your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins have hid his face from you that we that he will not hear so you know what maybe we need to make some repentance today GL to God maybe there's something in our life that we think we know what it's the preacher's fault oh he said this or he said that maybe he's speaking to you today amen have you ever thought about that maybe he's speaking through more as of Cl telling you know what take this out of my life take this iniquity out of my life things you know that you shouldn't do we still do think about it think about it today amen oh Lord help me Lord help us all to get the trash out right that boat was coming down there and you could just see the trash as we were were coming in the bank coming in the park you can see the trash going on to the curb cuz the waves were pushing them out oh let the Holy Spirit wash the trash out Hallelujah wash the trash out of our lives and clean the vessel and you know what no father how far you've got back or feel like you've got backslid God's still waiting to hear that's what he says he said his hand is not too shortened that he can't hear you today praise God oh that's his grace that's his grace reaching out you today saying you know what maybe there's someone that sound of my voice today is coming to church says I'm too far from God maybe the devil's telling you I'm not a child of God my God maybe the devil's telling you today that you know what I've been doing this but you know maybe I should leave I tell you that's nothing but the Satan in the pits of hell because I tell you what there's nothing that nothing that world want to offer you that you should you'd want he'll leave you on the side of the Road all wrecked up Sir he'll leave you on the side of thead Interstate like a buzzard that I hit that one time coming here I thought I couldn't hit and I just kept on going faster and I felt like a bowling ball hit the top of the hood and baby said honey that's a rid car I said well we PID we got insurance but Glory but I tell you where I tell WEA we're feasting on Mana today oh my we're feasting on the Eternal Word of God we are and your eyes have been seen from Genesis to Revelation the book has been open to you we were on that cruise brother Jack and the brother with this guy was preaching and I we were sitting there he was preaching and he started saying you know in the garden they were eating apple I literally about got up and started running and they probably thought I was running over an apple but I was going about to to take off run and say you know what he got it wrong but he gave his eyes to see yes sir we know it's not an apple in the beginning brother said it was pass them out right pass them out but we know it's the original sin that he slept with Satan that she slept with Satan and had two kids and they bured off uh a good generation and a bad generation oh but you know what we would be in the same shape as these people on that b people in the world these people in these churches trying to do a good thing if it wasn't for grace and mercy if the if the if the here I am didn't step in your life and stopped by your house you would be in the same condition today thank you Jesus but you know what there's still going to be them there's still going to be them faithful ones that that's all they saw and all they could walk in and they're still going to be in the outside of that City but you know what the bride of Christ I'm speaking to a bride today that's going to be on the inner city where the lamb is the light think about it today you talking about shouting brother Solomon brother Jack I'm coming to find you because I know we going to be singing and you know what he said Make a Joyful Noise and I'm tell you what y'all just do the singing I'll do the dancing because if he said hey you'll be like you were like you were known I guess I won't be still singing but I'll be dancing Hallelujah I'll be praising the Lord I don't know where to go I said brother Jack just just keep singing it brother Solomon keep singing it all right I'll be down by the river brother said singing he said in a little cabin singing Amazing Grace oh praise God oh my I tell you I'm looking for that day yes sir that's what we we should all be striving for amen no matter what trial and what I want to just really bring out this morning is you know God is God is with you amen you might not see him today amen you might not feel them you might think you're going through the hardest trial but God is right there yes sir God is right there amen so I want to bring something out in Genesis that that really stood out to me I want to bring this home in Genesis he said God test Abram Abraham all right and you know I read that scripture in Isaiah where it says here am I here I am and I want to bring this out and it just really hit me last night about had Revival in the in the house it says and it came to pass after these things verse one that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham he said behold here's another one here I am all right so there's like six or seven different places throughout the Bible I didn't realize that he said Here I Am the importance of here I am and he says verse two he said and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mora and it says and offer him there a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young going somewhere with it two of his young men and and with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went into the place which of God had told him and then in the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham I love this AB Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass he tells his servants abide your ass and I will go with that lad and go Yonder and worship and come again to you so he's like hey but Solomon and but Troy is like Hey Y'all stand here we're going just I I'm not even going to tell you you know he he didn't even tell his wife brother said she was nervous she was a nervous person and he didn't want to even tell her wow I read that last night he said the lad I will go up Y and worship and come up again to you Abraham took the word off the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son he took the fire in his hand and a knife and there went both of them together and I just want to bring this out uh to today and he goes verse 7 and Isaac spoke un Abraham his father and said my father and he said here am I my son I tell you it would do a some good just to just to get quiet with God and say here I am here am I it would do some good just to get in a car or wherever at and just say Lord wherever you want me to be here am I he would doing some good just to say Lord whatever you want us to do too many times we want to do what we want to do or we go ahead and pre-plan our life and say you know we got our house and we got our cars and we got everything situated but God might be saying hey here am I just listen to me I want to send you here I want you to do this but so many times we crowd it out with things of life and we don't sit here and say Lord what's your will what's your will for my life sir but I want you to catch this on verse five he says and Abraham said unto his young men abide here with me in the ask and I will go let I will go Yonder and worship and come again to you do you understand that he said in worship come on yes sir come on I literally about had Revival last night all right because what worship to you might look like might not be the worship you think it is you might have to worship through a child you might have to worship when you lost your job all right you might have to pay your bills and don't know how you're going to pay your NE check but you still worshiping you might put your money in the offering plate but you're still worshiping God you might have 10 cents to your name and a check come in the mail all right oh but he said hey we're going to worship God I tell you if he told his wife we're going to worship brother Jack she would have thought it was worship but he said I'm going to worship Hallelujah so what you call worship today might be trial that he's fixing to turn into a blessing oh think about it today oh think about it and verse seven and Isaac spoke un Abraham here am I my son and he said behold the fire in the wood he said but the but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for the burnt offering oh think about it he came verse n he said he came to a place which God had told of him and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood excuse me in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him at the altar of the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand to take the knif to slay his son oh think about it you know things were going through his mind oh yeah you know for three days as he was traveling but Jack you know the devil was on his shoulder believe oh yeah yeah even though he said I'm going to worship come on now he might you I tell you you come in this church today you might say I got cancer but you keep worshiping God you keep moving forward and I tell you your reward is right there oh you might not feel like it you but just keep on worshiping God yes sir but he got there he got there laid him up before the Altar and and and think about it three days goes by you think about what the devil was telling him oh your God's not going to show up think about it oh you know Abraham you really believe God you're message believer you believe my word you believe this message of the hour in your day and he said you know what devil I'm going to worship my God he provide it think about it and the angel of the Lord is called upon him out of heaven and said Abraham here he goes again and he said here am I and that's what we're speaking on today here am I amen oh that's the god you serve of Abraham today saying here am I listen to me listen to the Lord amen and he said lay not thy hand upon the L neither do anything unto him for now I know that th fearest God seeing that you not will thy son thy only son from me think about 25 years waiting on a promise glory to God 25 years and they're and they're older and their body well stricken in age 25 years wait for a promise and have to give thy only son up oh lord well what is he telling us to do oh my what is he telling you to do in your life yes sir is he saying get get rid of this or or get rid of this do it do this and hey follow me whatever he's telling you you follow him amen he said he laid it a hand and he said neither lay lay unto him verse 13 and Abraham lifted his eyes and looked and behold him a ram called in the thicket by the by the horns and Abraham went and took the the RAM and offered him the burnt offering to his son and you know what this types Jesus Christ today that he sent his only son from the portals of Glory didn't have a bad delay his head in but he came down for a bride today without spot a wrinkle today think about it the same thing is the same as Jesus Christ it types Jesus Christ how he took his only son and then he took the word offering and Jesus Christ had to carry the wood the cross on his back for me and you today because because he had children on his mind you know what the Bible said he didn't even speak he kept his mouth closed right thank about it I tell you it we do us good sometimes just just when we're going through a trial or someone's coming against us yes sir not even to speak that's all right and just sit there in the presence of God and just let God do the speaking in you and say he my Lord you give me the words to say or watch what we're about to say to some somebody that could really hurt somebody they could leave or do something I tell you they be doing some good just to just to say hey I'm not going to speak amen you know what I love the brother I love the sister but I'm just going to be quiet all right brother I don't know how many times I've done that in situations where I could say something and I say Lord right I'm unworthy all right that's a brother that's a sister I'll pray for him amen but I tell you I tell you his worship think about it it didn't look like worship brother Bram says he says when it looks like everything's gone wrong he's talking about this he saids God's given you a trial all right he said he's got confidence in you Hallelujah think about that this morning he said he don't have to baby you around you're not he said you're not a hot hot bed plant a hybrid you're a real Christian God's giving you a test to see what you're going to do about it amen he said that's the king of a person that's what I want to be he said love God regardless of what takes place stay your hand give you a trial he said where it's even against your own thinking he said but as long as the word said so do it anyhow amen he said stay your hand he said I know that your love you love me because you you've not even withheld your only son from me amen he said said blessings I'll bless you and he said his seed shall stand at the Gate of the enemy he'll conquer Oh my he said he did that he did too a little later we're going to get to that seat of Abraham there all right he said what did doubts had to go from Abraham when he had heard the real word doubts left when he seen God vindicate the word doubt slept he said look he said it took its place he said I he said he said um he said I know you love me Abraham he said you don't doubt me a bit no matter how long you had to wait you still believed oh Church no matter how long you have to wait for his promise to go in you still believe he said I ask you to destroy the very evidence I give you give you the evidence then ask you to destroy it he said and you'll love me so well you'll keep my word regardless what it is amen that's a real vday for God praise the Lord think about that this morning oh the very evidence that he produced he wanted him to get rid of wow oh I tell you can we be there in our lives and say Lord here am I send me send me here let me be a witness to somebody uh in in in a few scriptures I thought about Jacob 31 you don't have to turn there but 3111 when God appeared to Jacob in a dream Jacob said here am I here I am sorry here I am Moses Exodus 3:4 when Moses heard God to call him from the burning bush he responded what did he say Here I Am amen I tell you it just takes any of us not just the preacher but all of us just to say Here I Am hallelujah oh this action begins The Exodus he says in Samuel 1 Samuel 3:4 then God Called to Samuel as a child while he was living with Eli he said he said here I am think about I'm just going through someone the some of these in the Bible that said here I am that's right that here I am that's right amen the prophet said he said he said he'll do he said he will do but he will try to figure it all out he said we got to figure it out he said what if Peter stopped that night to figure it out talks about on the water now Lord you told me to walk on the water he said now let me see now I'm strictly a scientist he said I know the formula of the water oh don't you know some of them I know the formula brother Solomon I know how I I've read the book and I know this way I tell you what you ain't know nothing he said just stick your hand in a thing of water and pull it out and see where it's at that's right that's how we are today even me today amen we need God he said why no man can walk on hydrogen or oxygen he said there's no need of me trying that he said you asked me something in possible then Peter never never would have walked on the water the only thing he never figured out how it was he just took God at his word and went walking on that's what we got to do he said don't try to figure it out how God is going to do is doing these things just accept it and go on Hallelujah so if you're going through a trial today just accept it and go on amen he says what if Moses turned aside and see the burning bush he said say wait he said let me take some of these leaves off I'm going to take them down to the laboratory I thought was great to find out why the chemical on this Leaf it that it doesn't burn haven't you met someone like that brother Jack right he said there's for this the the fire is the fire is all right he said now he never approached God but he took off his shoes and he humbly and sat down and God spoke to him right out out the b of the burning bush he said that's the way you got to approach God he said humbly taking his word no matter what it looks like he said there's God you said so I believe it and that settles it I brother Nathan he greets you in the name of the Lord and he said something the other day brother Jack I almost literally took off running hanky came out and I said brother I I almost took off I probably would have scared half this church out of this place he said something I want to I want to just share it and rep repeat it oh my but I want you think about the message and where you've came out of maybe you've been in the Baptist Church in the world maybe you haven't been to church but I want to share something I hope it encourages you that he said that really blessed me you think about all these people falling away and falling away to the message you know maybe maybe there a raise of hands that can say hey who was in the Baptist or Catholic any the nomination raise your hand okay quite a few probably half okay came out of the nomin maybe you're raised in the message God bless you praise the Lord you should be thankful today that's right but have you ever thought about writing the book about all the wrongs that you came out of do you ever just like when I came out of the Baptist Church did I make a website about about the wrongs that the the the Baptist Church did I hope you understand where I'm going oh I'm telling you this is good amen think about it for a minute have you ever thought about writing brother Troy writing a book about the mess you came out of but then they but then they write a message they write a whole website about the message of the wrongs that is made so there's something right about this message there's something right about this message oh if they going to make a whole website they going to put literature out there I tell you you didn't come out the Baptist Church and write a book oh so I need to tell you there's power in this message it did it for right it'll do it for you it'll save your family it'll save your kids and just say Here I Am Lord hallelujah Glory oh I don't know why I went there today it was not even in my notes but I thought about it I hope that'll do you some good God when you think about reading the message think about hey they didn't make no books about it they made a bunch of books about this right because all their life they got to find the faults they got to spend their whole life finding faults I tell you he was still just a man amen but man was still a man that's right he still made mistakes but I'll tell you what I'm so thankful for him glory to God hallelu I'm still thankful for him I'm thankful for him brother Jack thankful for the truth yes but Isaiah 68 he said also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who shall go with go for us and he and he said I here am I send me oh I'm telling you throughout the Bible I thought about ananas acts 910 he said and there was a certain disciple in the Damascus named ananas and he said unto the Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I am here Lord how are we answering to the Lord today when he calls on you and I thought about you know paraphrasing for time but I thought about the uh the the widow woman where Elijah come up and asked her for a meal think about it she had everything she all had was enough for one cake to bank all she had didn't he have water for them her and her son to even get by but he said you know what your Barrel won't go dry but Elijah walked in the room he says here am I all right just believe this truth praise God just believe my message and that's what the prophet of God's done in our day he's came and brought a message for you to say here am I here's the whole book here's the whole word of God what are you doing with it oh you you sharing it with your loved ones are you are you being a light in this Dark Age amen I thought about like he was speaking on when Elijah and G Gesa was there and second Kings and First Kings and they were they were there and and he prayed and he he couldn't see he said you know how does the king of Sierra how how does Elisha know uh what I what I'm talking about in my bed chamber think about it amen because he met the he met The Great I Am he knew who his father was he met him one day praise God and he's sitting there and he's all feared up Gaz is all feared up because he doesn't see all the Chariots around him and he says Lord open young man's eyes GL oh I tell you what if he would just come by your way and open your eyes one day and real is what you got on your shelf what you got on these tapes it's Heavenly Mana but Solon said who listening to that tape and blessing his heart is because it's spiritual food in due season it's something that that's on the inside that you got to feed and I tell you what when you feed it with the right things the right things come out the right things come out I thought about Daniel and the three Hebrew children as the musicians come I thought about Daniel they met that they met they met met the same God that Moses did all through Daniel the Lions the Lions did he met the her he met he made the greatest The Great I Am amen think about it they get to the fiery furnace we all know the story and I just love what they say in Daniel 3:17 verse he says he Heats for paraphrasing he Heats it seven times harder he says you know you Worship You worship these golden images and he comes down to the burning fiery furnace in verse 16 Shadrach mesach and the bito answer said of the king old Nebuchadnezzar he said we are not careful to answer thee in this man it would be good to to answer that way sometimes in our life he said but if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace he will deliver us out of thy hand O King he said but I like verse 18 but if not oh I tell you can we get that way in our life but if not if I'm the only one standing if everybody walks away but if not all right that's my heart today brother Jack if it's just me and you standing brother Sal whatever it is but if not I'm going to still stand sir because guess what I'm going to get on that day I told somebody the other day I said you believe what you want to believe I said but we'll see at the end amen amen he said the Saints will judge the earth I can't explain it the Saints will judge the Earth he said we line up with our pastor and then with the prophet of our day and the prophet will present us to Jesus Christ all right all right all right I tell you what there's a lot of people that's got keys in their hand that doesn't realize the power you have right yes the power that you've got laid before you today I tell you I was I heard a testimony other day I'll have to share it maybe they play something softly but they were they were sharing the oh I met a met a brother at the at the nursing home we dropped him off and he W I was walking through the door and this 95-year-old rolls in the door and we open the door and walk through and he looks at me I just brother Jack I can feel the presence of God I looked at Rachel I said this is going to be very special I said just let him talk he started talking I didn't know he was a Believer I just knew it was something you ever just had that moment where you said there's something in this place so the doors are closed and we're in the main lobby it's like he just met us there and he sits to say he goes you know what he said are you a Believer I said why we are we believe the the message of the hour and we just started talking he goes I was in brother bram's treasure for 12 years 95 years old he said here am I still pressing on and he looked at me and he said brother he looked at the boys and he started telling testimonies after testimonies and he basically said hey you keep pressing on am but Jack 95 years old he's sharp as attack he said I was a treasure under brother other brother brandom saw this and saw these Miracles and saw this he said

hallelujah certainly appreciate the word of the lord lord Jesus on today and um just so much that brother Chris shared there and I love that a little statement kind of at the end couple things one um quote that he read was when Abraham was willing to offer Isaac destroy the evidence that God had given him of fulfilling the promise the the statement that was made in there is that that was a real vday for God often times in our lives we're looking to have Victory after Victory after Victory but there's sometimes in our life God wants to experience a victory Hallelujah and and you have to be willing to go through some things in order for God to experience a victory in your life Hallelujah and as Abraham went through what he went through the great sacrifice that he was making that is when God had Victory that's when God could smile come on think about it that's when that's when God got happy that made God want to shout look at what my son is going through look at what my daughter's going through but yet they worshiping and praising me in the midst of [Music] itall Abraham say I'm going to worship that's the very first time that the word worship is used in the Bible is in that story right there sometimes worship requires a [Music] sacrifice y'all y'all making me feel like I want to sing say say Here's My Worship take joy in make it up I want to put a smile I want to a smile come on say I present my heart to you heart to you I present I right to you to you all right stop right there stop right there I just love the Lord I just love the Lord Brother Chris was saying you know we um have a lot of people coming up and you know if if you if you if you you search Google you find out so many things that people saying about um the message and and all of that and just a beautiful point when people left Pentecost when they left Baptist when they left Presbyterian when they left Methodist you can find no websites about any of that but why is it that people want to come against this message anytime you find people that are fighting the message then it lets you know there's probably something there Hallelujah cuz I learned a story I learned something a long time ago people don't throw rocks they don't throw bottles and they don't pick up sticks to hit trees that don't have no [Music] fruit when mango season came and we were going to look for mangoes all over the city cuz we didn't have a tree in our yard at the time we go look for them all over the city we took our rocks we took our bottles we only look for trees that had fruits cuz if they didn't have no fruit we were just wasting our time come on somebody evidently the fruit must be pretty good if it's getting hit so [Applause] hard you got something I fight for here's my worship smile say here is my smile come on tell the Lord he is My Worship hey my smile there My Worship oh tell the Lord smile here's my life Lord hey come on sing it one more time oh is My Worship come on want to make you smile he is my life Lord [Music] smile but is one day in your court say but is one day hey better is than a thousand oh better [Music] is oh better is better is yeah better is better is a [Music] thousand better is a one day is better is a one day better is day better is one day better in one day better in one day is oh better is one day in your course better is yes one than a thousand Hallelujah better so glad I came to church this morning I want to dwell in the courts of God and a [Music] thousand oh say he is My Worship here's my life Lord [Music] He's My Worship smile and he is my life Lord he is my life Lord [Music] [Applause] smile praise the Lord father we thank you for hallu this wonderful word that we heard on today God uh we simply have to respond with an act of surrender God here am I Lord Jes we s saw it there and just thr so many scriptures but there with Abraham when he heard you calling multiple times first to even take his son to a place where you would show him he said here here here I am here am I and God the the other thing that I caught there in the scriptures brother Chris was reading that Abraham's response triggered down to his son hallelujah hallelujah because was time for the sacrifice the some was able to say the exact same thing here am I then an angel would called out of heaven and say Abraham stay your hand I know I know you love me I know I I I I you have proven it to me and and even at that moment when he when you called him twice he said here am I God we want to be able to surrender ourselves maybe there's someone here that has not come to that place of complete and total surrender I pray father this would be a message that would that would trigger the depths of their heart God that they would say the same thing that Abraham and Isaac and so many said here am I we surrender to you Jesus we want you to have our lives we want you to have our hearts we want you to have our homes we want you to have our businesses we want you to have our careers God we we want you to have our cars everything that belongs to us we know you gave it to us we want you to have it God and we want you to enjoy it and Lord the lives that we live don't don't don't don't let us complain about anything any trial or tribulation but to rejoice in all things knowing that sometimes in our trials not only are we getting the victory Hallelujah but you also get Victory we want you to smile we want you to have confidence that the same way Satan could come and before your presence ask you on behalf of let me just strike Abraham let me you say have you considered my servant joob have you considered them Lord maybe have you considered spirit and Truth Tabernacle maybe that's why we're going through what we're going through Lord but God we're determin to give you the glory in the midst of [Applause] it thank you Lord reminded of the quote that brother Quinton was sharing with me Faith can never be defeated Hallelujah no matter what faith goes through it can never never be defeated we stand strong on the word of God knowing that every promise that you have spoken it will come to pass bless your servant Lord Brother Kathy think of him yielding himself Lord this morning we ask oh God that you would bless him and his wife and his sons and Lord that we uh ask us to just give them a wonderful time while they're here just visiting in Florida and all the other the churches that he'll go to while it's here use them for your glory and for your honor and father just pray that you bless the the the Saints Lord that as they leave this place may they go meditating and thanking Lord on the word of God as it was spoke to them this today bring us back at the appointed time on Wednesday night as we come for our communion feet Washing Service pray that you would meet us here God in a very special way we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise in Jesus name amen amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise CU he is truly

more days to go I don't care what come up the devil trying to make you say something we we we we we heard him say it today sometimes it's just best not to say nothing and just and and yeah if you can't say nothing just quote a promise that's all qu quote what God Said but don't don't say nothing don't say don't say nothing negative and another beautiful thing about this that I didn't realize how the Holy Spirit did that on last Sunday that was not part of my notes he just by inspiration uh he gave us that and um but the the 40 day is actually going to come to the end on March 9th which is the same day that our 21-day fast is going to come to an end so I'm going the expectation of God to do something all us get in one mind and one Accord it's unlimited what God can do amen if we're not trying to manufacture nothing we just following what God telling us to do and we'll let God do what he promised to do but don't say nothing negative I don't care what it look like amen amen amen amen
