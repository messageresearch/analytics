our Bibles to Luke 2 and we'll read verses 8 to verse 20 amen I was listening to the message why it had to be Shepherds and the scripture reading just struck me amen we'll start at verse 8 and says and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy and shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be assigned unto you you shall find a babe wrapped in swaden clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was a there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass that as the Angels were going away from from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us know let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see and that word sort of struck me said and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the same which was told them concerning the child and all they that heard pardon me and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen and it was told as it was told unto them amen so the Lord God brought it to pass amen I thought it was a marvelous thing just reading over this little portion of scripture how the Lord had first told them then they saw the manifestation of it and they rejoiced and when it told others and it meant nothing to others so

and when you hear this kind of word coming forth amen it's just natural to just kind of jump in the jump in the fire amen we're going to start at verse 23 amen be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the the former rain and the latter rain now I want you to just pay attention to the words he says he will cause to come down for you the rain the latter rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the FL the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil a amen now we know that the wine amen brings a stimulation of the Revelation amen and the oil represents the holy spirit amen that I just keep those things in mine and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten and the cankerworm and the calill and the Palmer worm my great Army which I send among you and you shall eat plent in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you see the this is personal okay now um um and my people there it is again my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel now that's one conjunction and the Lord and that I am the Lord SE y I just have a lot of heart my my brain is just all over the place and uh just pray the Lord settle my spirit so that uh he can speak through me this morning cuz I know the Lord has something in store for someone special because the devil's been fighting keep me in prayer this morning um I don't know if it was this morning or yesterday I there was a set of keys at work very important set of keys and I can't seem to find them and uh so I knew immediately I said this is nothing but the devil trying to distract me from what I have to do this morning so immedi I prayed and I just gave it over to the Lord I said Lord you know where those keys are at so I'm going to pray and I'm going to leave it right there and I believe those keys will turn up and I'm going to go on and do what must be done amen now um I want to say Merry Christmas to everyone and uh I'm sure I Pastor would have a real nice Christmas message amen but this morning I don't have a Christmas message you can take it as a Christmas message if you like amen but uh I kind of toiled with it well should I do I said well just go with what you what you what you what's on your heart amen and uh um I just want to begin uh recently we just uh had the home going of our dear precious brother Wesco and uh you know during that time uh a gallant Soldier gone home and uh and I tell you what we sent them home right didn't we one of the most beautiful hom goings I've ever had the pleasure of attending and uh when we started there with brother Wesco we started in a school much like this and uh I appreciate him for being a true Christian and there was had to be something in brother Wesco that said there's has to be more and see he came from New York the original name of the church was Tabernacle of Prayer for all people absolutely and some years later well we'll get to that later but he had a sincerity there was a the unnoticeable sincerity about the word of God more of a Holiness type church amen and brother Wesco was very charismatic amen uh people being slayed in the spirit here and there oh we had a wonderful time in the Lord church was probably some like I say little B maybe 200 or so people it was held in the cafeteria and we pretty much filled up the cafeteria and with brother Westco in his heart couldn't have been settled that there's more and one Sunday he wasn't there that's all I can remember I was a little child I didn't know what was going on where he was I just all I knew the pastor wasn't here and uh when he came back the next service we saw all of these boards white man on the board Fire coming from his head and what is this so we sat there and during that service and you know as The Story Goes On the very next service there was only a handful of us the church had pretty much emptied out out now I got to give special thanks at this time to my mother your pastor brother Jack and I sister Tina was there sister Erica was there and a few others if I miss anyone forgive me because you know we we were we were still children following our parents but our parents came back they didn't leave thank you Lord amen amen well we're going to stay and see what this is all about never heard these things before what is this about a prophet what is this about a pillowy what is this message so there was just a handful probably less than 20 out of 200 that let you know so that you know just come back and just a handful said Lord have mercy but we we were there and we begin to just listen and we brother Wesco preached all he knew because remember he was new in it as well so he he he took what he knew from the word and and and with what he was learning and he delivered it as best he knew how amen so we stayed there and we listened attentively and then we began to uh go on the little trips and fellowship with other message Believers and lo and behold before you knew it think things begin to change we begin to to to to to uh uh uh Elevate our understanding now we had been uh from a Pentecostal background one grandmother was a Pentecostal Church of God in Christ and the other grandmother was a Baptist so we had this uh Foundation of what we figured church was supposed to be like right and when we we we we sort of begin to get uh affiliated with this thing called the message amen we we we we we we knew that there was something different see because we had seen a lot of foolishness and and things that we even as a child we was like this this ain't right folks fighting in the church and bickering and then you know uh uh get up and I like nothing happen and then on the other hand we uh on the Pentecostal side oh we we there was there was really there was wor there but the the the the the the the whole consensus was get down on the floor and say Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jes until you start frosting that the mouth when you begin to fro at the mouth you got it so that didn't set well with us cuz we had to clean up after everybody frosting at the mouth my grandma would have us pick that up boy that's oh Grandma yes ma'am but we had what a testimony see see me me me and and I'mma get to it I don't want to get ahead of myself but my even as a young man my life had took a series of sometime painful turns a direction and and and and and to put me in the right place at the right time even though I didn't know it I was just following my mother we we we we we went to Sunday school regular we come from a religious family but things begin to change once we were introduced to the message we begin to slowly tear away from what we call religion and begin to get an understanding even as children of what was going on that things was happening recently I went to the had to go to the mall I got this new iPad iPhone and I didn't know nothing about how to use these things I'm an Android man I see we have some Android people in here today so I was blessed to receive this iPhone and I didn't know nothing about it couldn't even I couldn't do nothing so I decide I said well I'm gonna go to the Apple store and see if I can get some help understanding this iPhone so in doing so I looked up where the nearest one and the only one was in the Wellington mall now I know my way around Home Depot Lowe's Bass Pro Shop Harbor Freight amen I I I know my way Publix I know what they say I know I know my way around but the Wellington mall is a little big for me so now I pull in the parking lot and it doesn't help that you know they have different the heels you can park on the second level and be and and it's it's just so I just parked I didn't know where the store was in the mall I just parked and went in now I'm going to I was a little distracted on the way in because as I'm going in I have to use the restroom so I said well I got to find a restroom so in looking for the first thing I have to do is for I get to a I got to get to a restroom so I'm walking around the mall looking for the restroom instead of looking for the Apple Store oh I finally find the restroom come out now I got to find the Apple Store so I'm walking looking around aimlessly looking look like stores all over the place upstairs I didn't know if it was upstairs downstairs I'm just walking all around this mall finally find the Apple Store get the information that I need now I'm trying to leave y'all know I am thoroughly lost I don't know what exit I came in I don't know how to get back there I'm just walking after you walk around the store and you pass the Apple store again for the third time I don't went upstairs downstairs I am lost and don't know how to get out of here so I call my wife and I said honey I'm in the mall and I'm lost she say what how you lost in the mall she says where are you and I said I don't know I'm in the mall and I start naming stores that I see and she couldn't help me because she didn't know where I was in the mall she said well where did you come in at I don't know why didn't you look well I wasn't paying attention because all I needed to do is find a bathroom so I wasn't really paying attention to the stores at the exit where I came in so generally you they find a a little box thing and it has directions and and it has a map of of the mall and in there you got to look for the place and it says there you go you are here so that brought me to this conclusion that and even in life on you have to know where you're at in order to be able to get out of here now we're going to read here a little bit from uh the church ages here the resume of the ages amen and uh I forget the page name of sister I uh guess you can look up this age started just after the turn of the 20th century something along those lines you should get you there okay now this age I'll read that again started just after the turn of the 20th century now that is around 1906 and we know that this is when uh the Revival or the movement of pinic cost hey man took off isusa Street uh as it was to be it says here I'm reading as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost now this is where things get a little bit confusing I would love to keep this song but I don't think the Al and uh uh okay this is where things get a little confusing because in in in in at the turn of the 20th century 1906 we had a Pentecostal movement to isusu Street and we also had at the beginning of the first century amen what is called Pentecost and sometime people confuse the two these are two different dispensations of time amen and what happened is uhh uh we begin to have a movement here uh uh uh this brother uh Seymour amen begin to to to to pray amen and he wasn't alone there was a there was something happening so what happened was it was time amen for a restoration amen so the anointing began to move on certain people amen but I'll read on and what happened we know that there must be a necessity of Return of dynamic power this is what the prophet said okay we knew that there must be a necessity of a return to Dynamic power the Believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century okay they knew that there was more just like brother Wesco just they knew that that that there had to be more amen so in that time there in the turn of the 20th century 1909 or 7 around that time they began to pray amen for a restoration amen they knew that there was something supposed to be happening we seen okay he says here uh the spirit began they uh and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as it was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit now listen to the wording here he said what seemed to be amen gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring rain or the teaching rain the latter rain then is the Harvest rain and in another place he said that is rapturing Faith so there was the confusion that this is that that was uh uh and and and and and this movement and the next thing to happen is the rapture sincere people they just didn't know where they were in the mall there was still more you had to there was a see but they felt they knew that there was a turn there was a change happening sir but you weren't at the exit yet you were still lost in the mall of life amen the prophet Amen Let me see I don't want to lose my place teaching rain the latter rain and the Harvest rain how be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers Malachi 4 and six amen Pentecostal fathers had not come yet thus what was taught to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come yet amen th what was thought to be the restoration I'm sorry come come come in in it was a mixture now catch this in it was a mixture of righteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was devil power as men were under the control of of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before the second generation of that movement began to organize and wrote their unscriptural Doctrine and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did Lord so they begin to to uh uh take the movement and begin to say things such as that this speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost and they begin to build a Doctrine around that and they begin to say this is that this is it so they Clos they off to what was coming now not long after this he talk about that second generation it was around that second generation where the Prophet was born are you with me this morning but they had already muddied the water yes sir see then they begin to build these fences you have uh Church of God Four Square uh Assemblies of God one had this belief and another one had this belief and another one and they built these fences and the fellowship see when they was all there in the soua street everybody came everybody was praying everybody was believing and the spirit of God moved mightily among them but they organized and the spirit left them now what's happening is because because like I said I had a grandmother one was Pentecost one was Baptist so they and sincere sincere now wasn't playing every time the church doors open she there encouraging you to go to church believing in the Lord uh uh get saved children but under a movement that of a day gone by but I still to this day believe it was her prayers amen that kept us amen until that faithful day brother Wesco came with the Billboards in the right place at the right time season just right tender T mine is still tender yes not bogged down with all kind of foolishness of religion and we had parents who knew that there had to be something more we had a pastor that knew that there had to be something more so it led us to that point amen so so we see here in the mall of life amen there I found myself walking around in this mall and there distractions well there's a store here maybe I'll just go into this store I'm trying to find my way out of here though I end up in the in in in in this store and I'm looking at stuff I don't know why cuz I ain't F to buy nothing I'm in the mall and I'm walking and here's another store I'm looking at this store see all of these distractions as I'm trying to find the ex now the Lord has flashing red lights sign of his coming that is leading me to the right exit but what happens and what the devil does he'll put other flashing lights to confuse you on the light that God has already set so now with so many lights so that he set a pair of Lights a set of Lights to lead me to where I'm supposed to be going but now I'm confused because there's lights everywhere that's just how the devil does things he confuse you by you he's gled you to a word but now there's so many distraction cuz there's a church on every corner saying this is right and that church saying this is right and the other Church saying this is right just to confuse the issue because see what the devil is trying to do amen is he is trying to pull worship from the Lord the Bible says that he he he wants to be worshiped as God amen so he uh try to confuse the issue to get you to worship on a false Doctrine when started out true but the minute they organized amen the devil got in amen and begin to sway the people in the wrong direction and they still shouting right on Dancing right on Triple clapping but you going the wrong direction that route is going to lead you to the pits of hell yes sir amen but you let me get to that I'll get to that part later so we're walking in this mall and there's distractions everywhere but we're trying to find the exit see when I come into the parking lot there I was in the mind of God see and this is what brother Smiley was talking about a few weeks ago we we in the mind of God perfect he had the right Doctrine we d that's right in the mind of God but once we got in the mall we begin to get distracted see because the mall is full of all kind of people there's Believers there's make Believers and there's unbelievers people are some are dress for the world and some are even some of them make Believers are dressed for the world Amen so now this confusion sets in we had to be first the prophet said first I got to clean them up how can I teach you algebra when you don't know your ABCs and they say well it's not about what's on the outside it's about what's on the inside now I've watched a few dishes in my life and when I have a dirty cup and I have to clean it on the inside I put it down in the solution so that the water and the the chemical get on the inside and as I'm scrubbing the inside and once the inside is clean and I bring it out the water the outside is automatically clean because it was submerged in the solution so to say well he's not looking at on the outside he's looking at just on the inside if your inside is clean your outside will be automatically clean if your outside is still false and dirty and take it all up with the world we need to go and get another we need to get rid of that soft sponge and get something a little harder got some scrubbing that need to be done you don't let that stuff set up so long it's all Caked Up and it done got stuck in places now we need to get that fork and dig in the corners and scrap and scrap cuz we can't pull the good wine in that dirty cup sir cannot do it it won't mix amen so you you you you don't get angry with the preacher for stying to [Music] scrub and has to be clean on the inside and the outside so we in this mall amen and we're going on and we're trying to find amen our way back to where we came from where were you when the sons of God shouted for Glory you were a thought in the mind of God Perfect Clean holy and we're trying to get back to the parking lot but we're lost we're lost in the mall and there's you you I'm walking on in this mall and there's a store and there's a store oh Lord I done found the food court well we going to be heal while think I sit down and rest that's what we sit down and rest amen so we begin to partake amen and eat of the food amen that the mall has to offer amen and what happened is we we we take in more ideas is and idolatry and uh uh uh now we we good we think we know something but we still don't know where we at but we're feeding Fe and then after a while we know we happy in the mall everything you need is in the mall now everything you need is in the mall this mall called life I can get a job in the mall I can buy a bed or mattress in the mall I'm safe in the mall rain is not falling on my head in the mall what a blessing in the mall but the goal is not to stay in the mall the goal is to get get out of the mall in the Rapture I don't want to stay here in the mall cuz the mall going to [Applause] close you don't want to be stuck here in the mall when it closed and see now I'm in this morning and it's getting late it's getting late in the hour and I'm still lost I don't know where I came in that so I'm still walking walking around in the mall trying to find a way out let's go to the word amen now remember I said the devil is trying to get you to worship let's look at Revelations the 13th chapter 3 and 8 amen starting at the third verse it says and I saw one of his heads as it was wounded to death and his dead wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast you see and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who was able to make war with him see this is the devil's plan this is his goal all along amen the dragon we know is Satan that old serpent amen and his his goal is to to get us to so confused and so despondent amen that we're trying to find our way out of the mall but here he comes I know the way come come follow me now you can't blame the people they trying to get out of the mall see so they they they have themselves in a real precarious situation because they they they they there haven't been a former rain and latter rain we'll get to that we'll get to that we'll get to that we'll get to that now five says and there was given unto him a mouth to speak great things blasphemy power was given to him to continue 40 and two months and open his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name in his Tabernacle and they that dwelt in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to over come them the power was given him over all kindreds tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life in The Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world see before the foundation the world we were in the parking lot and there was already a lamb slain who was worthy to take the book and open the book amen and to release the seals thereof that lamb that was already slain you see I don't want to get ahead of myself amen so I want us to sort of switch gears just a little bit we still lost in the mall but we know amen that there's that the exit is somewhere so our heart is yearning to find the exit amen we're walking aimlessly looking for it we know that there has to be more to life than just this mall I want to get to where God is I want to get to the place to where when he saw me in his thoughts I was perfect but we have to be led out of the m this mall of confusion uh sickness and all kind of things go on in the mall there's all kind of things to be offered to you in the mall now listen here the prophet said in the message Christ is revealed in his own word now you must not three things you must not misinterpret the word you say well I believe it mean this it means just what it says it needs no interpreter and you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word and if we would either do either of these things it throws the whole Bible into confusion and Chaos so this is what's happening in the M amen this is what happened in the beginning of this Century amen it was true but what happened is they misplaced the word they dislocated and what happened is confusion set in and they begin to organize and denominate bicker over doctrinal issues build fences and the spirit left amen so notice to misinterpret Jesus in the form of God and man in a man you would make him you would make him a god God out of three to misinterpret Jesus being the word you would make him one God out of three and you would make him the second person in the godhead and to do that you mess the whole scripture up you you'll never get nowhere so it must not be misinterpreted and if you say that a certain thing you you put an interpret interpretation on it and you apply it to another time or it's been applied to another time all you also make an incorrect interpreting if anybody misinterprets Jesus Christ in the Bible of not being God himself make him a second person or one God out of three this would upset every word in the entire Bible it would break the first commandment Thou shalt not have any other God before me all right it would make the whole it would make the whole Christian race a bunch of pagan worshippers worshiping three different gods and that kind of Bible would have then that kind of Bible you'd have then it makes us what the Jews say we are said which one of them Gods is your god see you can't you must mustn't in misinterpret the Bible amen you see down through the age we start off with the foundation from the found from the first church age when the seed went down in into the ground the complete seed then it comes out through the feet Luther now I want you to stay with because the in in the pyramid teaching it starts there at the first church and it goes all the way up into the Capstone okay now which is what the Capstone we'll get into that slow down let's just keep reading for a minute then we'll get into all of that interpret the Bible manifest the AG and part of his body being manifest uh did I go ahead of myself it will break the first commandment D and Jesus himself interpret the Bible made manifest in the Age part of his body okay I'll just take it from there part of his body is being made manifest we came out through the Lutheran age through the feet okay now what are we doing we we we're the mystical Body of Christ amen is being uh uh revealed amen starting there in the Lutheran age the feet amen uh uh and and and they went on okay it must be uh he made manifest in the age that the part of his body is being made manifest it's a hand age it must be a hand it can't be a head it if it's a voice age well it can't be a foot see and now we're at the I age I'm guaranteed I don't skipped a whole lot but what happened here let me see if I can go back because I don't want you to miss this um misinterpret Jesus if anybody misinterprets amen hold on down there the foundation at first age when the seed ground came complete it came up through the Luther come back out of the Wesley then to the Pentecost are you with me amen the tongue and the lips now see he said Luther was de feet then the Torso and the body came up to Wesley amen and then when the Pentecost came he said the tongues and the lips amen now it's in the eyes a prophet IC Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else to come but him himself step into that cause that's where the last thing is now we came up the gospel came up Luther age Wesley we building the mystical revealing the mystical Body of Christ amen and it must be it's a complete body amen get out of here and he said that they came there to a certain age their Pentecost amen and their thing was speaking in tongues why because it was the age of the time of the lips so they were saying Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jes and the tong and everything but they didn't have the eyes yet which is the the rain amen the teaching rain amen he had to send a prophet a prophet is a sear one who can fly high as an eagle anointing amen and look way down the road in front of you and look way down in the road behind you tell you where you came from amen tell you where you're going that's right amen see in the mall I needed some eyes so I needed to go to the kios amen this is where I'm at so he needed to send a prophet amen with the ability Amen to see AAR now this is when I I I called my wife what what what she don't know where to go she don't know where I'm at that's the lip age that's the lip age I can call I can ask somebody but now we're in a whole different time I have the eye you see and that's where we were as little kids we begin to see things differently and there was a I think it was Brother Willie they say they they they they most people confuse us and they say Well they're so arrogant well it's hard to be arrogant when I can see not I'm I can see I'm telling you still in your lips your lips can't see now we're not doing away with the lips we still need the lips in the church because that's what keeps the church clean but we needed teaching on how to use the lips yes sir sometime you got to keep your mouth shut see without the Li without the eyes amen the the the the the teaching amen you don't know how the lips just flying off they n then they curse don't tell me they weren doing I heard them and speak in tongues right after so we needed something more we needed intelligence so after the lips I can read it but I'mma preach it if you don't mind after the lips what is next now ain't no nose we got to the lips the nose and then the eyes we had a Prophet come on the scene a sear one that could see a far off and what was it begin to rain down teaching but we weren done yet we still lost in them all we need the intelligence notice the lips it is a movement so we had a movement but now we are we we're in a we're at a point amen where the mind of God is coming back and brother Willie pointed this out we were there with brother gild are you ready to go into the mind what happened we were was learning and the Revelation was dropping that it takes the intelligence of almighty God to lead us out of this mall of Life the lips alone won't do it because all that's going to do is you're going to ask somebody you're going to ask the wrong person how do I get out of here and they got a way for you they don't even know we need the intelligence Amen to come down amen and to lead us out of this mall yes sir so we're looking for amen the mind of God he said what intelligence amen that during the cold amen that tell that sap in that tree to go down into the roots what intelligence amen and come back up during the springtime what intelligence it's the same intelligence amen now come down amen now we were still because see the Bible was still sealed this book of redemption amen even though a prophet was on the scene at the time which gave us the eyes amen and the ability to clean ourselves up up to get ourselves ready for what the Capstone the mind of God Amen so the it came that angel amen the one that lamb that was slain I'm sorry the lamb that was slain he man came down and took the book amen and was able to loose the seals and he sent it down to that s that eight that that angel Messenger to reveal the brother told us a few weeks back he said what is a revelation something that is previously revealed that is now revealed to you it's a revelation amen and there was a stimulation to that Revelation amen that the seals were broken amen what was it the book became new the scales were ripped off it r different now we had an understanding we had a greater understanding of what a greater understanding of exactly where we are in the mall of life oh I know I'm here now amen and we just continue with the intelligence amen and he'll lead us to the right exit it's going home time it's going home time amen yes the mall is getting ready to close the mall of life amen some go by the grave but the mall of this life is getting ready to close we're at the final hour we need the intelligence of almighty God to lead us and guide us to the exit and I go back and I follow I say well Lord uh uh uh uh I came I came up through uh I

mall of Life y'all you may be sitting here up under the sound of my voice amen and there's something on the inside of you that you may not be able to explain but you know this is right I explained to you what happened there at in in at night in Pentecost and what happened they came up and they just didn't know it was not the right time they took the speaking in tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is what's going to lead you and guide you and all if they had just stayed their place and not they would have led them right to where we're at right now but they took a wrong turn sincere people now let me tell you something the people back there they did their job they were part of it but after it's organized the there's something new Happening Here we done made a turn
