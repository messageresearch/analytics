[1:12:25] and we'll chat a lot of break it down
[1:12:28] for us in Genesis 5 21 to 24 and and you
[1:12:32] know leave sixty and five years and

[1:12:49] he was not for God took him
[1:12:51] amen if a lot is to anyone that is good
[1:12:54] enough 21 to 24 let's go to first
[1:12:58] Corinthians 13 1993 13

[1:13:14] Corinthians 10 to 19 13 the Lord is good
[1:13:22] 1 corinthians 13:9 to 13 for real or in
[1:13:26] part and we prophesy in part but that
[1:13:29] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:13:31] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:13:34] away when I was a child I speak as a
[1:13:37] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:13:40] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:13:43] away childish things for now we see
[1:13:46] through a glass darkly but then face to
[1:13:49] face now I know in part but then but
[1:13:53] then shine but ash I know even as I also
[1:13:56] I am known
[1:13:57] and now abideth Faith Hope charity these
[1:14:00] three but the greatest of this is
[1:14:03] Charlie amen shall we be seated the Lord
[1:14:10] is good for his vinaigrette so our topic
[1:14:14] is be sensitive to the inner man and we
[1:14:17] just proceed as influence influence be
[1:14:22] sensitive to the inner man how can we
[1:14:24] assume abyss be sensitive to the inner
[1:14:26] man
[1:14:28] that is the professor that if you want

[1:15:04] Bible you can make it part of your
[1:15:06] program that you can even do it with in
[1:15:08] mind but let's say your schedule is try
[1:15:10] to go to video for pipe or stuff from
[1:15:11] Genesis to Revelation and you can put on
[1:15:14] part of your program right and read the
[1:15:16] Bible is gonna bless you if you want to
[1:15:18] read a message and we don't have time

[1:15:30] listening study team wherever you pick
[1:15:32] it from or youtube wave' a voice of God
[1:15:35] listens to it by bit right there's a lot
[1:15:39] of similar projects and once I don't
[1:15:41] know when he started recording it so
[1:15:42] much it's tons of them which are my
[1:15:45] interest you can go to the Holy Ghost we
[1:15:46] need you to listen to one sam or maybe
[1:15:49] wanna finish the same one the hoodie
[1:15:50] Shang where you finish keep on listening
[1:15:52] a lot of bring things to you
[1:15:55] so that is the widow of the Lord wanted
[1:15:57] to the wind a lot habits for us to be
[1:16:00] closer right because when you are
[1:16:02] interested in the things of God are you
[1:16:04] used to review more to you but then if
[1:16:06] you close the door on God
[1:16:07] you will need knock I don't know when
[1:16:09] you need when you leave you for things
[1:16:12] of the world which we needed yes we need
[1:16:14] him for houses right you for
[1:16:16] just name it I need this image even
[1:16:19] after that goodbye
[1:16:20] oh when we do maintain you come back
[1:16:22] Lord I mean I I need this I need money
[1:16:24] the Lord gives you goodbye you come back
[1:16:26] that is not that is not that is the way
[1:16:29] of the prodigal sons like we are not
[1:16:31] that be a man we are sons and daughters
[1:16:34] of God you know our position in Christ
[1:16:36] because the Lord has given us so much
[1:16:38] grease and yes implanted oh shoot his
[1:16:41] love that's right given his love we are
[1:16:43] expression of its love so we go beyond
[1:16:46] the average amen
[1:16:47] the Lord is wonderful Delores cumin now
[1:16:50] the brilliance forces and we know
[1:16:52] imparts we prophesy in part but but then
[1:16:56] when which is preference come all things
[1:16:58] that are imparts will be done away with
[1:17:00] right in other one revelation will
[1:17:02] become full in the time of for the Lord
[1:17:04] was but in a house right which house
[1:17:06] Jesus is the foundation of the house
[1:17:07] he's the Alpha and Omega Alpha means
[1:17:11] beginning Omega is the end right before
[1:17:13] the Alpha he was there he is
[1:17:16] I am amen
[1:17:17] and after the Omega he is till I am
[1:17:20] because it hasn't changed
[1:17:22] amen so Jesus was a foundation if you
[1:17:25] look at in the wealth parameter Jesus
[1:17:27] was a very fast addition when he came
[1:17:29] from Adam he was a foundation of the Old
[1:17:31] Testament and the New Testament Jesus
[1:17:33] for the foundation but any user in
[1:17:35] messengers to vote a house of God a
[1:17:37] pyramid ever was the first messenger as
[1:17:40] we know so when you started go to the
[1:17:42] house of course you've got a master plan
[1:17:44] but you don't know exactly how the house
[1:17:47] is going to be cause there may be some
[1:17:48] modifications and changes and in those
[1:17:51] messengers they were only God leave them
[1:17:54] to do their paths that they were all in
[1:17:55] to do so Paul wouldn't know what was
[1:17:58] good to be revealed at this time so
[1:18:01] their Lord could add on his hat the
[1:18:02] foundation to learn to lay the doctrines
[1:18:04] of the church Jesus Christ selling
[1:18:09] doctrines concerning all things they'll
[1:18:11] not give it to further Paul I was the
[1:18:13] Prophet most all of them to lead that
[1:18:15] masterpiece yes sir
[1:18:17] he knew that is this just a foundation
[1:18:19] there's good to be more so he said now
[1:18:22] we know in parts we see through glass
[1:18:25] dimly or darkly but one of which is
[1:18:28] perfect is come when the Lord Himself
[1:18:30] into the whole house and he chooses to
[1:18:32] review the whole thing I'm gonna see
[1:18:34] everything in one dimensional amen so
[1:18:38] the Lord put this in a savage messengers
[1:18:41] on to the day's the day of the seventh
[1:18:44] messenger which is Elijah the prophet
[1:18:47] William Branham amen in this time that
[1:18:49] was a Tom Kha chose to do every mystery
[1:18:53] the Bible and beyond beyond estate what
[1:18:57] happened in the Garden of Eden that's
[1:18:59] right what happened in heaven right
[1:19:00] what was the battle with Gingka Michael
[1:19:03] Michael is France
[1:19:04] what bad saw wasn't atomic bombs was it
[1:19:07] gasps all right battle of expression and
[1:19:10] never wanted to express himself like God
[1:19:12] but then God allowed him for the law of
[1:19:14] contrast so they're not allowed to draw
[1:19:17] into any Bible said one faith he still
[1:19:20] it's not like he's got a monkey's butt
[1:19:22] until in other ways it's influence drew
[1:19:25] and federal angels to him amen
[1:19:29] so that is the influence you great hands
[1:19:32] are praise be to God influence God give
[1:19:34] us influence what do you want your
[1:19:36] influence dude what do you want to do

[1:23:18] and diseases and evils and Deimos on
[1:23:21] earth is not coming from their physical
[1:23:23] earth it says spirit that habit it in
[1:23:26] the earth to manifest those niches on
[1:23:30] the flipside Jesus Christ has been a
[1:23:33] nature amen
[1:23:34] so when input is nature new what do you
[1:23:37] manifest you manifest Jesus Christ amen
[1:23:40] right so I wanted to I don't want to go
[1:23:44] to preach analyst lamb go into my code
[1:23:46] so this is what they're probably saying
[1:23:48] that those demons spirit who at once
[1:23:52] angels who were once part of course
[1:23:54] eternal program those demons back slate
[1:23:58] those demons with tempura demons so when
[1:24:01] there was a leadership position battle
[1:24:03] so ok citizenship or Lucifer my Danny
[1:24:06] wasn't consider it was Lucifer we don't
[1:24:09] like the leadership of Jesus Christ or
[1:24:11] Michael so now the branch themselves you
[1:24:14] know and followed sit and his influence
[1:24:17] and a lot cast them hours right and then
[1:24:19] they move into the edge and they entered
[1:24:22] into people the first person that ever
[1:24:24] entered was what king yeah you begin to
[1:24:27] sorta tell his brother people you could
[1:24:30] stand with his brother is
[1:24:31] revelation the way is what I was
[1:24:34] commissioned by the Lord
[1:24:35] you could have stopped stupid brother
[1:24:36] but then he said no I'm gonna kill my
[1:24:38] brother into the leadership so he killed
[1:24:40] his own brother and then to be a
[1:24:42] leadership so there was no no no there
[1:24:45] was no no able man
[1:24:47] and whenever in time to a person and the
[1:24:50] person become competitive person is not
[1:24:52] satisfied with what God has give it to
[1:24:53] them then they begin to fight and
[1:24:56] influence and break and divine gospel a
[1:24:59] man with habits and religious reps
[1:25:02] quality power ramps
[1:25:04] civil ramps police as the car rims in
[1:25:06] homes in families it's a demon it's a
[1:25:12] spirit that influenced me to do that man
[1:25:15] to destroy the family unit got a
[1:25:17] scripted and so if you allow yourself to
[1:25:20] be influenced that with those demons can
[1:25:22] inhabit you and destroy things
[1:25:24] amen praise be to God and you take let's
[1:25:29] see if you take a crystal you decid is a
[1:25:31] full of water River you through the
[1:25:33] crystal I wrong into the crystal it
[1:25:36] doesn't remain the same amen
[1:25:38] what one incident is that you do you
[1:25:39] might revenge but the influence is
[1:25:43] whatever rippling effects and
[1:25:48] so your action I'm not now they want to
[1:25:50] branch but your action everybody has
[1:25:55] what an influence even a child right a
[1:25:59] man take me please
[1:26:08] my baby is kicking an interest for the
[1:26:10] babies happy mothers can tell me better
[1:26:13] so if in the futures finished they will
[1:26:15] have influence when they are born as
[1:26:18] babies give much more influence right
[1:26:21] mother condense they will be pretty to
[1:26:23] sleep over there to see cooking at the
[1:26:25] kitchen and everything is what a much
[1:26:39] influenced by its mom oh my god amen
[1:26:43] so everyone has got an influence and you
[1:26:46] can't use your influence to do what you
[1:26:48] want me to branch but it's good the lot
[1:27:00] is good so let's go you know for a while
[1:27:02] and now we have a to the scripture the
[1:27:06] Holy Scriptures here
[1:27:07] whistlin did I read it already yes very
[1:27:09] and not leave 365 days Genesis that's
[1:27:13] what we read then the Prophet comes
[1:27:15] around and said I'll in only 500 years
[1:27:18] and I read for you
[1:27:21] good actually see them see praise me to
[1:27:25] get sure I think my pickup
[1:27:29] laughter would have been better I think
[1:27:34] I can use that if my office please no
[1:27:39] now help me better praise be to God
[1:27:42] so he dog leave 365 years according to
[1:27:47] the Scriptures and abiram sedan enough
[1:27:50] leave 500 years and he keep it kept
[1:27:53] making a statement before ministers to
[1:27:55] opinion and he kept making the system
[1:27:57] when this is we're hoping that's right
[1:27:59] and after this is we're open so now when
[1:28:02] we go if Lewis
[1:28:10] thank you so much jack government soon
[1:28:13] praise be to God praise be to God
[1:28:23] or can I dismiss it sometime the old
[1:28:25] type or the Oscar is better the
[1:28:35] rejecters hood becomes so the message to
[1:28:44] leadership 1965 65 4 / 7 / you have 281
[1:28:50] leadership then there's other things
[1:28:53] that did is since then look at you know
[1:28:55] he walk with God for five hundred years
[1:28:57] and then he had a testimony that he
[1:28:59] pleased God God had verified it and said
[1:29:02] there's no need for you to die there's
[1:29:04] no need of you dying
[1:29:05] just come up home this afternoon and he
[1:29:08] went amen
[1:29:10] you know didn't die physically they have
[1:29:12] a funeral ceremony for him he just broke
[1:29:15] his body into the cosmos right and he
[1:29:18] just went a rock is gone
[1:29:20] just right in eternity but in the fasted
[1:29:23] I mentioned a man is generally do you
[1:29:26] have to cry around him but he just
[1:29:28] looked into the other dimension because
[1:29:31] we walk Academy please God Amen that was
[1:29:33] 65 now let's go to go
[1:29:42] she's good
[1:29:44] so now anak did not die physically and
[1:29:49] the Prophet said he lived 500 years but
[1:29:53] then when I read my mama was a TV 365 so
[1:29:57] what do I do
[1:29:59] and this as we can be a little stumbling
[1:30:01] block for us of our precious brothers
[1:30:03] and sisters some of these statements not
[1:30:05] only this but let's go into it and see
[1:30:09] the mind of God please be together okay
[1:30:12] making their way in nineteen fifty six
[1:30:14] fifty six oh three oh four making every
[1:30:18] paragraph 112 one one two it was you
[1:30:22] know who claimed that he walk with God
[1:30:24] for five hundred years and had a
[1:30:26] testimony he pleased God had faith that
[1:30:29] wouldn't see death he could help you God
[1:30:32] do it there wasn't even a jet plane in
[1:30:34] those days to get him off his feet but
[1:30:37] God provided a way and translation not
[1:30:39] to the end of and up from the earth to
[1:30:42] glory without receiving death day may
[1:30:45] 1960 him 1960 zero three one three the
[1:30:52] time you know before translation in a
[1:30:54] walk with God for what we got five
[1:30:57] hundred years another testimony that he
[1:30:59] pleased God and was a time of the
[1:31:01] rapture change they men so now here the
[1:31:05] Prophet consistently said Enoch walked
[1:31:07] with God five hundred years before the
[1:31:10] seals after the Sims
[1:31:11] during these sills and a lot didn't cry
[1:31:14] she didn't tell me was wrong he preached
[1:31:16] it to leadership and one of the last
[1:31:17] message
[1:31:18] therefore he went to glory Wow but then
[1:31:20] when I take my Bible my King James
[1:31:22] whatever machine you take the Bible said
[1:31:25] Enoch walked with God you leave all
[1:31:27] these years it was his five years when
[1:31:28] he married a boy his friend's son and
[1:31:31] after that he lived 300 years so naive
[1:31:33] the Bible said in plain language he
[1:31:35] lived 365 years and a lot took him away
[1:31:38] so now where did this confliction you
[1:31:41] know where's this going on what's going
[1:31:43] on here right now if not before before
[1:31:47] Adam sorry live before Lord in the
[1:31:51] Western we have a because anti-alien
[1:31:56] before he not before no one I was no
[1:32:00] cloud there was no read from the sky
[1:32:03] they had water from the earth watering
[1:32:06] plants and who saw water
[1:32:08] there was nothing like great drops from
[1:32:11] Adam up to no one there was no rain
[1:32:15] drops right now in the West time we had
[1:32:19] rain drops the F was in setting position
[1:32:22] right now in the West and the earth was
[1:32:24] tilted before no one here now at the
[1:32:29] time of year is around 12:05 p.m. in
[1:32:32] Ghana is about five more hours or six
[1:32:35] more hours so probably about to 6 p.m.
[1:32:38] in Yuki I was as always yes 6 p.m.
[1:32:42] whilst we are almost in the morning over
[1:32:44] just in the afternoon they are already
[1:32:46] in the evening right
[1:32:48] probably so I'm about to go to sleep the
[1:32:50] hell is deepest because it's good Mandy
[1:32:52] if you go to Japan Japan Australia
[1:32:57] you go to a New Zealand you go to
[1:32:59] Philippines they are already into Monday
[1:33:02] it's already Monday busy working you go
[1:33:05] to China
[1:33:06] child child challenge affordances name
[1:33:08] shine shine induce bliss who I walk into
[1:33:10] wait going to wake right but then we are
[1:33:13] still in Sunday how come before no one
[1:33:16] it wasn't like that
[1:33:18] all the earth had the Sun at the same
[1:33:21] time and all the hard darkness at the
[1:33:24] same time but anti distraction the F was
[1:33:29] done at an angle we have latitude 23
[1:33:34] hard agrees and longitude 23 and 63 a
[1:33:37] half so for Andrew so this portion of
[1:33:42] the ed get the Sun while this portion is
[1:33:45] in darkness right then the Sun the earth
[1:33:47] will rotate around the Sun and then this
[1:33:50] portion will get a light what this one's
[1:33:52] in in darkness that's right so this was
[1:33:54] not the same before before no one from
[1:33:57] Adam to know what the timing was
[1:33:59] different Sultan yeah on top of that in
[1:34:04] our time we have what you called the
[1:34:07] Julian calendar we have a blue current
[1:34:12] calendar yeah the way we measure time
[1:34:15] day and night is different and let me
[1:34:17] read something for you before we move on
[1:34:18] let's go to the message for rapture
[1:34:22] rapture 1965 65 12:05 the eruption
[1:34:29] paragraph 127 the night was ocular go
[1:34:34] back a little the Bible
[1:34:36] back just to get a background now listen
[1:34:40] closely the Bible was not divided the
[1:34:44] knife was not divided in hours in the
[1:34:46] Bible time so in the Bible time did he
[1:34:50] have 12 hours 12 hours here or 24 hours
[1:34:54] system that we have or the military time
[1:34:56] it in 18 hours military time or 24 hours
[1:35:01] the night was not divided into hours in
[1:35:05] above all time 1 it was divided into
[1:35:08] watches he's not talking about the clock
[1:35:11] here no it's not talking about there
[1:35:13] watched a series people meet it's not
[1:35:15] the wristwatch that your fanciful range
[1:35:17] what every war it's not itself for
[1:35:18] watching oh this is not what she's
[1:35:20] talking about
[1:35:20] let's go on it's another fast watch
[1:35:22] study from nine until 12 does offense
[1:35:27] which doesn't night so if you bring it
[1:35:29] to our time the first what is around 9
[1:35:32] p.m. until 12 midnight that is the first
[1:35:36] watch in August and I used to Priuses an
[1:35:38] hour's right so they call it watches and
[1:35:41] they have a watchman in this time just
[1:35:43] like we have a military people I see we
[1:35:46] have a US intelligence report that I'm
[1:35:49] looking for al-qaeda people are trying
[1:35:51] to cause harm as you I am sleeping
[1:35:54] somebody saw the military watches all
[1:35:57] right cameras and binoculars and a
[1:35:59] telescope to see whether maybe what
[1:36:01] Russia is trying to do Russia is also so
[1:36:03] fine what is us trying to do that China
[1:36:06] is watching what is you isn't Russia
[1:36:07] trying to do so
[1:36:08] suffered of each other so the dishes are
[1:36:10] good Watchmen by the news time they had
[1:36:12] at our Weather Watch one will be on the
[1:36:15] tower this is the mousse so you can see
[1:36:17] it as a military person coming from
[1:36:19] let's say Miami you can call them men in
[1:36:21] West Palm Beach hey you got me
[1:36:23] I mean put on your belt let's go dance
[1:36:24] this reform is coming to take our women
[1:36:27] our wives and our our daughters
[1:36:29] we got to fight so we have a watchman
[1:36:31] who live in the towers yes they cool
[1:36:34] probably swamp them but there may be the
[1:36:36] towers and watch all around
[1:36:38] so the useful watches especially that
[1:36:40] night that is when enemies Envy right
[1:36:43] and the natural Chavez Fritz right and I
[1:36:45] turned us when they divorce we come if
[1:36:51] they take two joints watching me if I
[1:36:54] try to go get his pen is watching me but
[1:36:56] when you go to sleep I can sneak on here
[1:36:58] and just grab its pencil we are seeing
[1:37:01] and that's what the enemy does but when
[1:37:03] you are less spiritually when we are
[1:37:05] sensitive to the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:37:07] Ghost that you know that enemies can you
[1:37:10] see him from afar destroy his influence
[1:37:13] and affect before he helps you Amen
[1:37:15] praise be to God
[1:37:17] so the Watchmen tonight watches the
[1:37:20] first hour is 9:00 to 12:00 this solid
[1:37:24] is the first watch the second watch
[1:37:25] started from 12:00 to 3:00
[1:37:27] 12:00 to 3:00 in the morning is our a.m.
[1:37:30] and the Third Watch was from the Third
[1:37:33] Watch of the night was counted from 3:00
[1:37:36] to 6:00
[1:37:37] right now we've got three three which is
[1:37:40] nine in profit number then we come up to
[1:37:43] the seven for the rapture which of tea
[1:37:45] please
[1:37:46] I believe between six and seven o'clock
[1:37:48] or six and a new cloth some morning for
[1:37:50] the travel OSHA sound on the bright and
[1:37:53] cloudless model when the dead in Christ
[1:37:55] shall rise and
[1:37:56] of the relationship what is chosen wash
[1:37:58] I gather to dia homes me on the sky when
[1:38:00] the rule is called colorful yonder I'll
[1:38:02] be there we all know who leave their
[1:38:04] outer portion babe but we want to look
[1:38:06] at out night watches if the lord help us
[1:38:08] something we look at their after portion
[1:38:09] so the heart three watches the first
[1:38:12] watch second watch from nine to twelve
[1:38:15] 12 to 3 3 to 6 that is their watches so
[1:38:20] they count yet they basically from
[1:38:22] sundown and sunrise in those time they
[1:38:26] didn't have the julian calendar the
[1:38:29] gregorian calendar that we have we have
[1:38:32] certain month and in ending 28 days 7
[1:38:35] months and in 29 some 31 some 30 days
[1:38:38] they do have a stir like that they have
[1:38:40] flat 30 days they have a the sunrise
[1:38:45] that's the begin of the day so when the
[1:38:48] samples nowadays 6 out 6 p.m. our time
[1:38:50] or 7 p.m. or whenever the Sun Goes Down
[1:38:53] it's night
[1:38:54] that is the way they counted time amen
[1:38:58] because of our intellectual civilization
[1:39:00] actually the Julian calendar the
[1:39:02] Gregorian calendar was a poke at leepu
[1:39:07] x13 yeah gregory 1580 there about he
[1:39:12] brought that calendar of counting uses a
[1:39:16] 24-hour system so we shifted from what
[1:39:18] nature gave it to us from sunrise to
[1:39:21] sundown and if you want to read further
[1:39:23] they say they lose on this they are set
[1:39:25] in this we've got a juniors with a
[1:39:27] counterfeited the Julian calendar before
[1:39:29] they we have what we call the 8
[1:39:31] anno domini unaccompanied is a Latin
[1:39:33] word means the e of our Lord
[1:39:34] right so they use it poverty or the
[1:39:36] birth of Jesus Christ to count time BC
[1:39:40] before Christ and AD after Christ so
[1:39:44] they use it so now when this Gregorian
[1:39:46] and the same can be changed the color
[1:39:48] from the natural we survive this in the
[1:39:51] time of a lot before the flood of no one
[1:39:54] when you bring it to our time is already
[1:39:58] been three to five this is different so
[1:40:00] being a prophet a lot reason into this
[1:40:02] the social dimension and this is as I
[1:40:05] mentioned and it bring the dimensional
[1:40:07] time and bring it to your time for us to
[1:40:10] understand amen we live a different era
[1:40:15] is different to God when I was in Texas
[1:40:22] I took a course in US history and before
[1:40:26] the professor started he also give us a
[1:40:28] briefing that this topic is very
[1:40:30] sensitive so yeah also kind of brief
[1:40:32] everybody to make sure that you could
[1:40:34] hear something now shock you subtle
[1:40:36] engines and humana understand so he said
[1:40:38] the ladies don't be judgmental because
[1:40:41] in those time women could even pawn
[1:40:42] properties they were about twenty years
[1:40:45] or whenever they can't no properties is
[1:40:47] that don't change them if you gentlemen
[1:40:49] they rise do they wanna change us
[1:40:51] because in that time women didn't wear
[1:40:53] shorts the dress line women the way for
[1:40:58] dress so if you are good in general now
[1:41:00] why can't a man for property you're
[1:41:02] gonna rise and tell you that why you
[1:41:03] ain't shows
[1:41:05] and the course was in summer when of
[1:41:08] course went so I know how people dress
[1:41:09] and she was talking about induced time
[1:41:12] they had what you call convention
[1:41:13] experience I said Wow they had a lot of
[1:41:16] things before we convert it and so forth
[1:41:19] so that is what people were looking out
[1:41:20] to get to the convention experience
[1:41:22] getting born again right so dispensation
[1:41:26] changes and when the specific changes
[1:41:28] just like in deepening in u.s. about 300
[1:41:31] years time is different if you bring the
[1:41:34] people from let's say a prevalence time
[1:41:36] they'll get lost
[1:41:37] they'll be wondering what's going on
[1:41:39] here this is not America because America
[1:41:40] is that America we live in now in the
[1:41:46] Bible time the windy major night and day
[1:41:49] this is different from our measurement
[1:41:52] so we appropriate that's what God I so
[1:41:54] did my prophetic and came to dimension
[1:41:56] become the study look at your
[1:41:58] non-dimensional the local take him to
[1:42:00] the supernatural dimension and you can
[1:42:03] bring things the low show you things and
[1:42:05] go back and give it to a perfect amen so
[1:42:08] this shouldn't be an offense to us that
[1:42:10] why is the Bible saying that a not lived
[1:42:14] 365 years then William promised a nearly
[1:42:17] 500 years is the same thing amen
[1:42:20] just different disposition let's take
[1:42:23] another scripture now focus if you read
[1:42:26] Romans chapter 20 bit less really rumors
[1:42:29] 2019 Roma's 2019
[1:42:41] oh sorry Matthew 28:19 I'm sorry Matthew
[1:42:45] 28:19 about baptism the LORD commanded
[1:42:49] that is despise disciples Peter and the
[1:42:52] rest of them that go into the world
[1:42:54] preach the gospel they now believe the
[1:42:56] gospel baptize them in the name of the
[1:43:00] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[1:43:02] Spirit that is Matthew 28:19 is the word
[1:43:07] I came from the mouth of the Lord
[1:43:09] observe the law Jesus Christ now when
[1:43:11] you go to Acts chapter 2 verse 38 Peter
[1:43:14] seems to be disobedient because you want
[1:43:17] to do something contrary if you look at
[1:43:19] it in a cannot mine
[1:43:20] Vita went the day of Pentecost when able
[1:43:22] to skim Peter said men and brethren
[1:43:24] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:43:28] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:30] Hey a lot of between denominations as
[1:43:34] well I'll take what the Lord Himself
[1:43:35] said what a lot selling what Peter said
[1:43:38] is not contradictory what Peter said is
[1:43:42] a fulfillment of what Jesus said what he
[1:43:45] said was a kind of prophecy he briefly
[1:43:48] spoke in parables remember I think I am
[1:43:50] Matthew 4:4 said the disciple as him
[1:43:53] alone why do you speak in parables to
[1:43:55] the people is that for them is not given
[1:43:58] to them to do the Kindle but for you is
[1:43:59] given to you so in the open he's
[1:44:02] speaking from what their problem is so I
[1:44:03] so I went to seat then when it comes in
[1:44:06] the closed chamber the disciples he
[1:44:08] produced power this lorry did and that's
[1:44:10] not what you mean by is so I went to see
[1:44:12] then he threw sudden cedar so we came to
[1:44:15] see somewhere the best what was it and
[1:44:17] he began to regard as the seed is the
[1:44:19] word of the Lord which is preached to
[1:44:22] some people they are hardened or
[1:44:23] fertilized so they don't have that there
[1:44:25] is receiver receiving entrance in the
[1:44:27] way so
[1:44:28] goes right in and it reflects or
[1:44:31] deflects there's nothing in them there's
[1:44:33] no few funny there's no there's no a sit
[1:44:36] of presentation yeah so there what has
[1:44:38] no place in there right
[1:44:40] so receive it with joy but it doesn't
[1:44:42] keep long did the job the lost
[1:44:44] Ellington's or friend them and let them
[1:44:46] know I'm not going to come to church
[1:44:47] anymore I didn't visit me so nobody
[1:44:51] comes church anymore
[1:44:52] what does that going to do a literal
[1:44:54] life it's not a good what does it got to
[1:44:58] do something really Athens offend you
[1:45:00] that you don't want to send a lot
[1:45:02] anymore right we are human beings I mean
[1:45:05] rupture that's one it is the other
[1:45:06] sometimes but it does is not that that
[1:45:09] is not even objective yeah this is the
[1:45:12] love of Christ right the British force
[1:45:15] on the planet I did a lot of physics
[1:45:17] they have a lot of forces that tick tick
[1:45:20] the satellite from here to - to the moon
[1:45:23] there are different forces but the
[1:45:25] greatest force is the force of love love
[1:45:28] is the greatest force on the planet that
[1:45:30] is the force that God used to create
[1:45:32] everything that we see here if Britain
[1:45:35] the earth all the solar system is the
[1:45:38] love of Christ you and I we got a love
[1:45:41] of Christ and if you let that love that
[1:45:44] force projects everything the sovereign
[1:45:47] risk of kinetic of everything
[1:45:48] praise be to God so now here in Matthew
[1:45:52] the Lord said repent good day go to the
[1:45:56] world preach the gospel
[1:45:57] did I will receive the gospel but as
[1:45:59] them in the name of the Father and of
[1:46:01] the son of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:03] what is the name but an idea Pentecost
[1:46:06] in Chapter 2 38 the name was revealed
[1:46:09] Jesus was a testament a testament is not
[1:46:12] reviewed on to the test is that died so
[1:46:14] when Jesus would be that test is that
[1:46:16] died then it was time to revealed the
[1:46:19] Covenant to review the Testament it just
[1:46:22] like if your father has made a war now
[1:46:24] when he dies you should inherit his
[1:46:26] house his house one dealer in Miami it's
[1:46:30] my kitchen I mean wherever you want to
[1:46:33] wear buy this in Georgia as long as your
[1:46:35] mother's alive it can be only in those
[1:46:37] properties this mic is good to you
[1:46:44] this one should go to her this one
[1:46:46] should go to this so what is our life
[1:46:48] you can't be you can't get it you have
[1:46:51] to wait for him to time right unless you
[1:46:54] want to kill your dad or your mom
[1:46:56] it happens in UK when you go to UK some
[1:46:59] time one department to visit the
[1:47:00] apparently police have to be there
[1:47:01] because this man or this one has got
[1:47:04] some old car which was all about half a
[1:47:06] billion a billion pound sterling and you
[1:47:09] still alive so before why you silly mean
[1:47:11] that's an eternal question your father
[1:47:13] why are so why are you still alive why
[1:47:15] don't you die I was the one you leave
[1:47:17] your house is depreciating the
[1:47:19] government will take part of it when you
[1:47:20] die so you better die so that we can get
[1:47:23] this money and share the money and
[1:47:25] Google divine life it happens so certain
[1:47:29] people determined they come up to me are
[1:47:31] parents so when they are going to visit
[1:47:32] at least will be there so that they
[1:47:35] don't owe many appearance
[1:47:36] because this one hold and they have
[1:47:38] certain houses in Britain they order the
[1:47:40] house the more expensive it is so this
[1:47:42] sounds but then they want you believe in
[1:47:43] the government money value you get they
[1:47:46] will not use some - they're gonna detach
[1:47:48] it from the house so the house is going
[1:47:49] to depreciate and this is the children
[1:47:51] want to want you to die so that it can
[1:47:53] get its money and will do whatever they
[1:47:55] want to go to no chilhood if another
[1:47:57] part you know that is that is a human
[1:48:00] nature right but we are Christ remain we
[1:48:04] love life material things are not
[1:48:07] everything so if you look at it from
[1:48:09] from the Bible
[1:48:11] yeah Tom oh the wind if I the time was
[1:48:13] different yes let's look at this look a
[1:48:19] couple of other things here just one
[1:48:22] second so I don't think anybody will
[1:48:24] offended when he read by the Browns
[1:48:27] message and read that he he speaks about
[1:48:30] a not living 500 years when the Bible
[1:48:33] said he lived 365 years in the same
[1:48:35] thing one is this on our system here at
[1:48:38] one time CA 365 as the Bible times the
[1:48:42] eye recording was different and our
[1:48:43] record was even didn't have any
[1:48:45] Juliana Gregorian calendar they had
[1:48:48] sunrise
[1:48:49] there were many farmers they go to find
[1:48:51] the defense of nature sundown they come
[1:48:54] back home cook for their family go to
[1:48:56] sleep
[1:48:56] say the Lord our time we divide the time
[1:48:59] into hours 12 hours 24 hours so our
[1:49:03] timing is not the same as what Enoch and
[1:49:06] Adam and Co use so our time is different
[1:49:10] prophet that's why God give prophet
[1:49:11] that's why God sent ministers to see
[1:49:14] here from heaven and give the message to
[1:49:16] his people
[1:49:16] amen praise be to God now let's go to an
[1:49:20] the Lord is good let's do the poor not
[1:49:29] even poor let's go to a where the Bible
[1:49:31] said one third of the Angels followed
[1:49:35] the devil now perhaps that are too thin
[1:49:39] where is it whoa thank you God bless you
[1:49:42] can you read that just have a basis for
[1:49:45] that revelation 12:4 messes with Matthew
[1:49:48] so let's go to rev 12:4 thank you and he
[1:49:54] still drew the third part of the stars
[1:49:57] the stars represent angels of heaven and
[1:50:00] it cast them to the earth and the dragon
[1:50:02] stood before the woman which was ready
[1:50:04] to be delivered for to devour her child
[1:50:07] as soon as it was born
[1:50:08] now so this what about we see now Abram
[1:50:11] was in that two third of the angels were
[1:50:15] swept by Satan now who do you follow
[1:50:19] so we see I'll go to the Bible my Bible
[1:50:23] [Music]
[1:50:25] but the one we were written by prophet
[1:50:29] right above joo joong-won was with
[1:50:32] through afflictions god as the prophet
[1:50:35] do known after not reveal it to them
[1:50:37] Jim thought that when you die that's it
[1:50:42] movie morning you don't have no memory
[1:50:44] you gone you can't see your wife and
[1:50:47] your children walking around you that
[1:50:49] was a revelation he had at that time he
[1:50:52] didn't know onto the pillow fight it
[1:50:54] will boost a lot a lot Kim is a Jew
[1:50:56] no no no you view I in Venezia you don't
[1:50:59] remember because you I need you my mind
[1:51:01] your mind is limited to Eternity yeah
[1:51:06] you Jew and your family were inattentive
[1:51:10] you for the punch of the wall when the
[1:51:12] sons and daughters of your chakra for
[1:51:14] joy you your wife and your children away
[1:51:16] in eternity und have boils you didn't
[1:51:19] have cancer they are about 18 to 22
[1:51:23] years old back so it doesn't matter your
[1:51:26] three three sons and your seven sons and
[1:51:29] your three daughters who are passed away
[1:51:30] they are right here and a lot given a
[1:51:33] vision of his children and you say do
[1:51:36] this body is rotten in my flesh shall I
[1:51:40] see God what is the flesh in a few funny
[1:51:44] the truth Alicia tarisha body you see
[1:51:47] speaker amen so the prophet do not
[1:51:50] receive all the they don't know what to
[1:51:53] tell or reveal it to them so the other
[1:51:55] things that even in the Bible times the
[1:51:57] Lord has to kyrenia amen praise be to
[1:52:00] God so Eva Braun Helen doesn't
[1:52:02] that God has to be really to them they
[1:52:04] know if you take I'll come to one of
[1:52:06] them Moses and Elijah was and Elijah the
[1:52:12] prophet begin to preach that yes moe-san
[1:52:14] Elijah
[1:52:14] they said yeah ministry even up to when
[1:52:16] this is where open let's see if I can
[1:52:18] read you can read it for me praise be to
[1:52:21] God
[1:52:26] let's go to that the first seal 6303 1:8
[1:52:31] 6303 181 paragraph 124 he not time the
[1:52:37] bride you know not Wentworth went
[1:52:41] through tribulation through software
[1:52:43] they become drunk and died let's talk
[1:52:45] about Eleanor no I went through
[1:52:47] tribulation and drunk and diet but in a
[1:52:50] war before God for 500 years but that
[1:52:53] was not it one sake
[1:53:14] but to make my point on me but pretty
[1:53:16] far now really to you to me the point
[1:53:18] there was Bahrami a question that a how
[1:53:23] about Moses and Elijah and it's a well
[1:53:25] he did have the answer so he took them
[1:53:27] Salafi since the old I don't have the
[1:53:29] answer but the ability said the
[1:53:31] immediately so all so God will bring
[1:53:33] them back on earth to set their ministry
[1:53:36] again it'll only really to me I'll let
[1:53:38] you know over the years a lot me did
[1:53:40] reveal it to him so we get to now preach
[1:53:42] it differently than he before he before
[1:53:45] he preaches let's go to any future home
[1:53:48] future up city 408 or to future home of
[1:53:51] the heavenly bridegroom and Ed Lee
[1:53:53] bright para for seven form remember God
[1:53:57] took Elijah after the rapture and
[1:53:59] translated transported sorry translated
[1:54:03] trance transplanted him but among the
[1:54:07] people to take the police offer as a
[1:54:09] prophet among his people
[1:54:11] pretty strongly we do that and as kept
[1:54:13] him alive this 2500 years is to appear
[1:54:16] again it's a notice here is Moses from
[1:54:20] the dead waste Wendy's his grief can
[1:54:23] anyone find it really a book of Jude see
[1:54:27] Satan the Archangel is written with the
[1:54:29] Archangel sittin said thus the Lord with
[1:54:33] you disputing over the body of Moses and
[1:54:35] yet Peter James and John was standing
[1:54:38] there looking at him on Mount
[1:54:40] Transfiguration right there in the land
[1:54:42] where the mountain is released after all
[1:54:45] amen and he came to redeem it so now
[1:54:48] Moses and Elijah the way it's began
[1:54:51] Moses didn't die
[1:54:52] basically moisés body because in that
[1:54:55] time if you remember what is went to the
[1:54:56] mountain together together long before
[1:54:58] you could come back they were
[1:55:00] worshipping idols and taking the air
[1:55:02] rings from the ladies and they have made
[1:55:04] an idol and worship an idol right and a
[1:55:07] lot knew better hit know how the people
[1:55:09] behaved services they were the lot you
[1:55:11] see supernatural because it said Moses
[1:55:14] admit you cut to the performance right
[1:55:16] so Moses was got to the people right
[1:55:17] because God was hiding the Moses
[1:55:19] vinick's up to the people so if the Lord
[1:55:22] led him to have a funeral de gonna
[1:55:24] idolizing so Moses body was broken into
[1:55:27] pieces and there was no food right
[1:55:29] because that way is this grid it wasn't
[1:55:31] very angels Purina do you think angels
[1:55:35] cutouts his feet in the ground and Moses
[1:55:39] there and had a funeral and took
[1:55:41] offering know how do you bury him drop
[1:55:48] his body into the cosmos and move to the
[1:55:51] solution dimension amen and that is what
[1:55:55] believers is a streets before amen
[1:55:57] yeah it doesn't matter my body be there
[1:55:59] or not it doesn't matter my body drop in
[1:56:01] the ocean the few funny the true me the
[1:56:04] true you who be right on the pond on the
[1:56:06] other dimension it doesn't matter where
[1:56:08] these ghosts in the cosmos amen that is
[1:56:11] what God has to his people praise be to
[1:56:13] God so the Lord transported the law said
[1:56:19] the professor that God does not sin to
[1:56:22] profit at the same time it's a nice even
[1:56:25] contradictory to God's nature because
[1:56:27] every man has his own human nature the
[1:56:30] our human nature is not is same you
[1:56:31] don't need the same brick facade your
[1:56:33] nurses that eat you don't like the same
[1:56:36] colors like even your husband like even
[1:56:39] co-host Amano have the same opinion on
[1:56:41] certain things cause animilitia is
[1:56:44] different
[1:56:44] because the same thing is the same
[1:56:47] pricing you the same price but your
[1:56:49] human nature yeah but around was a lot
[1:56:51] of I think fourth but before was a lot
[1:56:54] of a thing shimmy so give me your admin
[1:56:57] love he might be on host who he might
[1:57:00] have a discovery my last was can library
[1:57:02] Gary
[1:57:07] so God hasn't sent to profit at the same
[1:57:09] time he uses one when it's finished is
[1:57:12] sending to glory and use the other so
[1:57:14] let's read and the evening messenger 65
[1:57:16] sorry 63 0 1 1 6 even in messenger the
[1:57:21] evening messenger 8585 now God always
[1:57:25] uses a prophet a man
[1:57:26] if you use a bunch of man you get
[1:57:28] different ideas see each month to month
[1:57:31] never did he have to measure profits on
[1:57:34] earth at one time he takes one so da da
[1:57:38] da can take its place for another day
[1:57:40] another message he never has to he also
[1:57:43] have one at a time and in and Eve and
[1:57:47] the infinite God never changes his
[1:57:48] program you must always deal with what
[1:57:51] he started with that's the reason why we
[1:57:53] can have confidence we can have
[1:57:55] confidence in what he sees you cannot
[1:57:57] change if we serve a man on the basis of
[1:57:59] faith in God the next month you have to
[1:58:02] see the same way amen
[1:58:04] so God hasn't said to me a prophet let's
[1:58:07] read let's repair our hope is in God 51
[1:58:13] or 99 there never was in any age sorry
[1:58:17] there never was in the age I need to be
[1:58:19] the Prophet on earth at one time the way
[1:58:23] my no there were many minor prophets but
[1:58:25] they were one major profit and another
[1:58:28] was a prophet also Elijah then when
[1:58:31] Elijah was taken off a portion at all
[1:58:33] portion of Elijah Elijah spirit
[1:58:35] Elijah spirit came upon Elijah so God
[1:58:38] doesn't use to make a profit at the same
[1:58:41] time all right
[1:58:42] do come in to meet a prophet one has to
[1:58:44] leave before one who began his ministry
[1:58:45] like Elijah Elijah Elijah where on earth
[1:58:48] at the same time but before Elijah was
[1:58:51] ruptured God asked him to anoint Elisha
[1:58:55] Elijah to take his place you know and no
[1:58:59] way on earth at the same time around
[1:59:01] sedan enough it was his premium further
[1:59:03] and establish you live long so he was
[1:59:06] watching his finger father-in-law he
[1:59:07] knew inside at the moment might be
[1:59:09] prefer that lives am on the scene so
[1:59:12] when the universe ruptured the Lord
[1:59:15] commissioned him and begin to preach his
[1:59:17] message because enough was typing the
[1:59:19] rapture
[1:59:20] and Noah was typing the tribulation so
[1:59:24] he run through his time we went run
[1:59:26] through how many years on the flat after
[1:59:29] the flood they came a preset so and as
[1:59:32] we read the Quran we knew from the back
[1:59:34] we got drunk you go host you know he
[1:59:36] hasn't ran to his level type in
[1:59:38] tribulation but he was a prophet of God
[1:59:41] how can you get drunk
[1:59:43] he's a man God use this room for
[1:59:46] different purposes the main points you
[1:59:49] enter your ministry in your family your
[1:59:52] choices things that you love God has
[1:59:54] embodied coated that in you amen and not
[1:59:58] didn't get drunk but his rig ran no one
[2:00:02] who was a prophet of God got drunk so
[2:00:05] God was happy we can entire uses their
[2:00:08] lives to type God use a Abraham's life
[2:00:11] to type v Ramos and I don't watch this
[2:00:14] one but God called you from his other
[2:00:16] worshipping and was faithful to God he
[2:00:18] made mistakes sure Abram elevenses even
[2:00:21] the night his wife because he was aware
[2:00:23] of his life but God also Japanese is fee
[2:00:26] he was using feet in Hebron Hampton time
[2:00:29] how kind of feeding Abraham his son
[2:00:32] Isaac was a type of what laughs if you
[2:00:36] assume in his novels embodiment of love
[2:00:37] right Isaac son Jacob Jacob means
[2:00:41] deceiver his life was about Greece to
[2:00:44] commit a bunch of mistakes the Muslim
[2:00:47] was immense but the Lord was using is
[2:00:49] his life to win an attitude of Greece of
[2:00:52] God
[2:00:52] praise be to God his son Joseph was a
[2:00:56] time of perfection
[2:00:58] and that is the four corners of the
[2:00:59] golden covenant of unconditional love it
[2:01:02] doesn't matter how messed up you are mr.
[2:01:05] Byam just love you
[2:01:07] he's by His grace amen so input one
[2:01:10] corner fifth in Abraham another wanna
[2:01:13] love in Isaac's another Hana Greece in
[2:01:17] Jihad and a fourth corner perfection in
[2:01:20] Joseph and intervention even a mistake
[2:01:25] no let me see
[2:01:27] he took the language father right
[2:01:29] because when they went before Pharaoh
[2:01:31] family were otherwise offense although
[2:01:33] they have fever before them and they
[2:01:35] didn't want their daughters to
[2:01:36] intermingle with them because they
[2:01:38] didn't have the God of Jacob with them
[2:01:39] so how are they going to do the
[2:01:41] situation the country they kidnap your
[2:01:42] non-believer you know he other one was
[2:01:45] giving you feedback so they have to find
[2:01:47] a way to get to get sets of the
[2:01:50] different beliefs so that be done in
[2:01:51] tamari so to Prophet Kim come on I did I
[2:01:54] know what this is Egyptians they don't
[2:01:56] like I think one of something's an
[2:01:58] abomination Shepherd so when you appear
[2:02:01] before him tell entire Shepherd and so
[2:02:04] when they came before him Jacob came
[2:02:06] before Pharaoh Pharaoh Pharaoh where
[2:02:08] there were two firms presume we did know
[2:02:09] God and one who know God the one in the
[2:02:12] world through SETI he was the one who
[2:02:14] knew God who a fever before this report
[2:02:16] so he said we are we are shadows Oh

[2:02:29] their children from getting intimate
[2:02:30] with the Egyptians who were not another
[2:02:33] cognate of circumcision
[2:02:34] amen just like a time
[2:02:37] that we might to Christ is the age these
[2:02:41] circumstances circumcise our heart if
[2:02:43] you might redenomination you get what
[2:02:45] you get
[2:02:46] amen so we married to Christ and live in
[2:02:50] Goshen yes there's confusion all around
[2:02:52] but God has given you a pastor who
[2:02:54] protects you
[2:02:55] amen Alice if we tell you that it's not
[2:02:57] you'll get no the way that he preaches

[2:03:02] the world wherever your vision your
[2:03:04] houses what about you do the wedding
[2:03:06] your heart will protect you from every
[2:03:08] situation right praise be to God blessed
[2:03:11] be the name of the Lord
[2:03:12] so say God never sent to prophet to
[2:03:16] media prophet so he sent one there could
[2:03:18] be a minor prophet in the time of Paul
[2:03:22] there was one Agabus the way Adamo not
[2:03:25] preferred a good use
[2:03:27] there was Simon the prophet one who
[2:03:28] baptized for they were men of God don't
[2:03:30] use and a prophet even Graham said that
[2:03:32] the ministers are the were the prophet
[2:03:34] of the age a man so go to the same
[2:03:37] streets on on the media prophet and
[2:03:39] shake among the faithful ministry to
[2:03:42] bless the body of Christ is one and it's
[2:03:44] called the Holy Ghost amen
[2:03:46] if you read about water bottles full of
[2:03:48] Elijah what is the sort of Elijah
[2:03:50] is it something outside of God it's a
[2:03:53] speciality of God just like we are
[2:03:55] medicine we have got doctors but now you
[2:03:58] want to have an eye problem if you go to
[2:04:01] your GP the general physician is good
[2:04:03] check you out okay I'm not a specialist
[2:04:05] in eye doctor so I'm gonna send it to
[2:04:07] the ophthalmologist right to check your
[2:04:10] eye to see what's good on your eye if
[2:04:12] you say a dental problem is going to
[2:04:14] send you to the dentist
[2:04:15] he's a doctor too that is a daughter but
[2:04:17] he specialized in what dentistry yeah of
[2:04:20] the mullet is optometrist is a doctor
[2:04:22] but he checks your eyes right he doesn't
[2:04:24] have nothing to do with your foot to him
[2:04:27] that's not his area yeah so he might not
[2:04:30] he might try to give you something but
[2:04:32] that's not gonna wait for you
[2:04:33] so today what we're put for put at risk
[2:04:36] what you got it
[2:04:36] podiatrist a good actress and good
[2:04:39] actors to check your foot for you
[2:04:41] so God has got you've got diabetes
[2:04:43] they've got practice specialty so God
[2:04:45] has got specialty this timber the sort
[2:04:47] of Elisha is part of God that brings and
[2:04:51] come to bear to bring judgment and
[2:04:53] different things but of Moses it's a
[2:04:55] part of God that itself wanted it to
[2:04:58] manifest in a certain way the way he
[2:05:00] wanted Hannah and let me read a little
[2:05:03] bit here praise me to God the Lord he is
[2:05:07] good let's look at in the time of
[2:05:11] Abraham he wanted to reach us m1 v of
[2:05:16] the trumpet he has prayed about it just
[2:05:19] like he preached that there's a vintage
[2:05:22] ages and even they blow back him to draw
[2:05:24] true this is Brooke you know how this is
[2:05:28] it happened he went to Arizona
[2:05:29] Commission to go to Arizona and that's
[2:05:31] what talk about influence I want us to
[2:05:33] learn something before I go further
[2:05:34] influence this had profit for the whole
[2:05:36] generation the whole egg it was some
[2:05:40] time the Lord would tell him some when
[2:05:41] is it Marilyn Monroe when she died
[2:05:43] before she was I think s led was a
[2:05:46] populist everyone thought she wanted
[2:05:48] suicide by but everyone said no they
[2:05:51] don't a lot said that she didn't she was
[2:05:52] trying to reach a telephone to call but
[2:05:55] I think I shall attacks on playa yeah
[2:05:57] what does my ramona's like the willy
[2:05:58] Abraham because their prophet God should
[2:06:02] certain things to him amen and they said

[2:06:10] problem yes I sort of whenever your
[2:06:12] problem God want to use to bless other

[2:06:22] to speak a word of wisdom in a situation
[2:06:26] now bless them amen I don't deviate so
[2:06:30] the Lord to barabra huh if you wanted to
[2:06:33] preach it is that everything he prayed
[2:06:34] about it when you went to Arena Arizona
[2:06:36] it was a prophetic love study the church
[2:06:39] you could have done whatever you wanted
[2:06:41] to but when when he was even looking for
[2:06:43] a change to take to put his family in to
[2:06:46] put his children to have a Sunday School
[2:06:48] God didn't call in to another church god
[2:06:51] inequality we are past a church in
[2:06:53] Arizona so it was even advice and that
[2:06:55] to somebody start a change that's where
[2:06:59] ministers for with the ministry amen if
[2:07:02] you can listen to the influence of the
[2:07:04] Holy Ghost if you can use our influence
[2:07:06] wisely don't know be chaos in the
[2:07:09] kingdom of God this Rida ministry man
[2:07:13] because of the object is three I'll stop
[2:07:16] here for a while so time god bless a
[2:07:18] group of people I'm not talking about
[2:07:19] here don't worry about God
[2:07:22] John Wesley in the nest and didn't even
[2:07:24] have internet he said my word I said
[2:07:27] that what I have treated good beyond the
[2:07:28] four corners of the building you know

[2:07:34] and we are here we listened to John
[2:07:36] Wesley's messages songs
[2:07:37] Prisca so it's not about this change is
[2:07:41] that the body of Christ amen what you
[2:07:43] media can help you to advise somebody
[2:07:44] who might be going through that problem

[2:19:08] influence when I sign her heart to the
[2:19:10] Lord this is not a preacher she's a
[2:19:12] woman right it was word for word is it a
[2:19:16] lie at suport that we have in the life
[2:19:20] Tabernacle the Holy Spirit move on that
[2:19:22] one and said word for word what he said
[2:19:25] up there on the hill then they still
[2:19:27] begin to move and give it
[2:19:28] petition for telling fenced by the
[2:19:30] revelation by prophecy the things that
[2:19:32] would happen in the meetings
[2:19:34] the following night and not one time did
[2:19:36] it feel before that a little man stood
[2:19:39] up in the meeting about this human come
[2:19:42] over there not knowing what we what she
[2:19:44] do what she do she could do and she was
[2:19:47] standing in the mists of the meeting and
[2:19:48] the Holy Ghost

[2:19:58] know what she didn't know she didn't
[2:20:00] know what she said she had yes she did
[2:20:02] and then we force you to say anything
[2:20:04] the Holies will give the interpretation
[2:20:05] that said that says the Lord would
[2:20:08] implement the Vedas of Moses Elijah and
[2:20:11] Christ
[2:20:12] ministering in this tabernacle of Moses

[2:24:12] let's get the Lord though they have
[2:24:13] appraised thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed
[2:24:21] the word of the Lord today I just love
[2:24:26] the way that the Lord uses Ministers
[2:24:29] differently and I don't think I've ever
[2:24:33] heard anybody touched that 500-year
[2:24:37] quote the way that brother quick who
[2:24:40] just touched that and it just made so
[2:24:43] much sense it's very early here as to
[2:24:46] why that would be said that when you
[2:24:48] look at it from the calendar that we
[2:24:50] have we've actually added taste to our
[2:24:53] calendar you know years and everything
[2:24:55] has been added to it because it used to
[2:24:57] be at the time there was only 30 days a
[2:24:59] man up to every month but we've added a
[2:25:02] 31st day and sometimes that then taking
[2:25:05] a day away in February and you know and
[2:25:08] sometimes February I end up with 28 days
[2:25:10] until the leap year to get 29 days and
[2:25:13] you know and we don't add it so many
[2:25:15] other things our calendar that it has
[2:25:17] messed up the ears right and we forgot
[2:25:20] about that so when a prophet when a
[2:25:23] prophet says 500 years and the reason
[2:25:26] all this spirit does not correct him if
[2:25:29] because God already knows this calendar
[2:25:31] system we got us all the messed up
[2:25:33] oh my church I tell you what I am so
[2:25:37] grateful for amen revelation in this
[2:25:40] hour you know we have Revelation the
[2:25:42] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[2:25:45] that so we thank God man we really
[2:25:47] really thank God for Jesse I'm shared
[2:25:49] and it's just as his inspiration there
[2:25:52] with influences I think there's enough
[2:25:54] stay there that all of us can take
[2:25:56] something a man from that on today
[2:25:59] hallelujah glory to God glory to God
[2:26:03] amen let's just sing a song of worship a
[2:26:06] man and praise we'll do what a beautiful
