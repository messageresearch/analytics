[24:34] Lord God, we we're so grateful, Lord, to

[24:39] be in your presence this morning.
[24:42] Father, I thank you, Lord God, for these
[24:44] your children, Lord Jesus, that have all
[24:46] entered into the house of the God, house
[24:48] of God, Father, and they each one have
[24:51] brought their licks of fire, Lord Jesus.
[24:54] So, we're expecting a mighty move in our

[24:58] to deal with the hearts, Lord, and deal
[25:00] with situations, Lord God, and encourage
[25:02] us to stand as the children of God that
[25:04] you have called us to be. All creation
[25:06] is groaning and travailing until now,
[25:08] waiting for the manifestations of the
[25:10] sons of God, for us to get in our
[25:12] rightful positions, Lord Jesus. Father,
[25:14] to have dominion upon this earth, Lord,
[25:17] to speak your word, Lord, and things

[25:21] because you are the supernatural God
[25:23] that's amongst us. not only amongst us,
[25:26] but you are in us, Lord God. Father, as
[25:28] the prophet said, if we don't see the
[25:30] supernatural
[25:32] amongst us every day, we're backsliding.
[25:35] So, Father, if the supernatural God is
[25:38] within us, Lord Jesus, we expect to see
[25:41] you moving. So, Father, come and be God
[25:44] to us, Lord. Have your way in us, Lord.
[25:47] Use our vessels, Lord, to perform your
[25:49] purpose here upon the earth. Father, you
[25:52] desire to gather all your children,
[25:53] Lord. They're scattered abroad, Lord
[25:55] Jesus. And Father, what we hear here,
[25:58] Lord Jesus, we take to them there. So,
[26:01] Father God, use us, Lord. Each one of
[26:03] our vessels, Father, we pray now over
[26:05] our giving, Lord, we give according to
[26:07] your word, Lord Jesus. And Father, as we
[26:10] give according to your word, there are
[26:12] promises associated with the with the
[26:14] with the word that goes forth and us
[26:16] obeying your word. So, Father, we expect
[26:18] it, Lord. We've done our part. We're
[26:20] expecting you to do your part. Use it,
[26:22] Lord, for the upbuilding of the kingdom.
[26:24] Lord God, we'll give you the praise,
[26:26] honor, and glory. Bless our brother as
[26:27] he prepares his heart to bring the
[26:29] message. Anoint him with a fresh
[26:31] anointing. Lord, speak, Lord, to us. Oh,
[26:34] Father, our hearts are ready for the
[26:36] word, Lord. So, come and have your way.
[26:39] We commit this service into your care in
[26:41] Jesus Christ's precious and holy name.

[39:58] has somewhere else." And um I said,
[40:02] "Wow, I would have never even thought of
[40:04] anything like that. We just think about

[42:31] Amen.
[42:33] Thank you, Jesus.
[42:35] Amen.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Shall we have a word of prayer?
[42:39] Our heavenly father, we thank you this
[42:41] day. We give glory and honor to your
[42:44] name. For there's only one name elevated
[42:48] on earth, in the ocean, in the heavens,
[42:53] in all the universe, in this dimension,
[42:56] and in the eternal dimension. And that
[42:58] is the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:01] And that is the name that deserve glory
[43:03] and honor. Father, when we go to sleep,
[43:05] that is the name that goes to sleep with
[43:07] us.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; When we wake up, that is the name that
[43:10] wakes us up, Lord Jesus. When we walk,
[43:13] we walk in the name of the Lord. Father,
[43:15] we do everything, Lord, in the name of
[43:17] the Lord. For there's only one name
[43:19] given among men for salvation. That is
[43:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:24] Father, we thank you this day. We thank
[43:27] you for the breath of life. We thank you
[43:29] for the grace to be here Lord Jesus
[43:31] Christ to have conference with the
[43:34] father of love that Lord you pour your
[43:36] love upon our hearts. Father, your Lord,
[43:39] you know the needs of each and everyone.
[43:41] You know the spiritual atmosphere, the
[43:44] temperature of our hearts. Father, Lord,
[43:46] you know everything that goes on in
[43:48] every life here, Lord Jesus. Father,
[43:51] speak into every situation.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Dissolve every doubt.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Destroy unbeliefs.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Consume attacks of the enemy. And
[44:00] father, give victory unto your children.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Father Lord, is anything hard for you,
[44:04] Lord Jesus? We can see from the Bible
[44:07] Luke 1:37 when the angel of the Lord
[44:10] Gabriel met Mary and Lord the angel
[44:13] prophesied thou are highly favored.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Not just favor but the highly favored
[44:19] &gt;&gt; and Mary was confused. What kind of
[44:21] greeting is this? Who is this man?
[44:23] &gt;&gt; He said you have highly favored among
[44:25] all the women on earth
[44:26] &gt;&gt; for you bring forth the Messiah.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; And normally it's not possible for a
[44:31] virgin to bring forth a son.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; He said I know not a man. How can this
[44:35] be? And Gabriel said, for with the Lord
[44:38] nothing shall be impossible.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Or for with the Lord all things are
[44:43] possible.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Father, this is where we stand. Lord
[44:46] Jesus,
[44:47] &gt;&gt; for every brother, every family, our
[44:50] pastor, ministers, Lord Jesus, therefore
[44:52] with you all things are possible. Every
[44:54] desired church, individuals, children,
[44:57] mothers, fathers, homes, Lord Jesus, all
[45:00] things are possible. And Father, we
[45:03] believe. Not only do we believe but we
[45:05] receive with all of our hearts.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Father Lord your essence is we believing
[45:09] your word and manifesting your word on
[45:12] earth. God
[45:13] &gt;&gt; we thank you. We love you. We bless you
[45:14] till the permanence Lord Jesus Christ
[45:16] and even our brothers and sisters Lord
[45:18] streaming online in different places and
[45:20] wherever the word will reach Lord Jesus.
[45:22] May you quicken the seed and bring forth
[45:24] life. We thank you. We bless you in
[45:26] Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah to the Lord. The Lord
[45:33] is good. Amen. Uh we can take our Bible
[45:37] and just do a little bit of reading h
[45:39] before we take our seats.
[45:42] So
[45:45] we want to speak on our little God bless
[45:46] you our Saraphimson and and H those who
[45:50] change the atmosphere for us.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you for doing that for
[45:54] us. We thank you.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; So we want to speak on a lot of topic
[45:57] then change
[45:59] &gt;&gt; if you can bring it uh project it on
[46:01] there. Hallelujah.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; On on on the on on the board for us.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; But let's see. You know, the Lord will
[46:07] not let you do something that he he
[46:09] hasn't done it already.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; So before he will ask you to go through
[46:13] a change,
[46:14] &gt;&gt; it means he has gone through the change
[46:16] before.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; So we want to take a look at Luke
[46:18] chapter 22.
[46:20] Probably we can read is 4143. But let's
[46:23] read a little bit. Go back a little bit
[46:25] and read to get a background.
[46:28] Luke 22
[46:31] 41. Let's see where we can read from.
[46:36] Glory and honor be to the Lord. Luke
[46:40] 22:41.
[46:45] Let's go back to
[46:50] let's let's read it from the 30 39
[46:53] instead.
[46:55] Luke 22:39 downwards. That was Jesus
[46:59] praying in Gethsemane before his
[47:01] crucifixion. So 39 said and he came out
[47:04] and went as he was as he was want means
[47:08] that he was led to the mount of olives
[47:10] and his disciples also followed him. For
[47:13] 40 And when he was at that place he said
[47:15] unto them pray that ye enter not into
[47:18] temptation. 41 And he was within them
[47:22] about the stonecast and kneel down and
[47:24] prayed. 42 saying, "Father, if thou be
[47:28] willing, remove this cup from me.
[47:31] Nevertheless, not my will, but thine
[47:34] thine be done." Amen. And 43. And there
[47:37] appeared an angel on unto him from
[47:39] heaven strengthening him.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Means what? Jesus was what? Weak.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; For somebody to be strengthened, you
[47:46] don't strengthen a strong person.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; A weak person is that you strengthen.
[47:50] Amen. And I always believe that Jesus
[47:53] Christ was 100% almighty God
[47:56] &gt;&gt; and also 100% human being.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Baram said in one of the quotes it
[48:00] marveled me said if he chose to marry he
[48:02] could have married.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; But he chose not to. Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; So he had all the human instrumental
[48:07] instrumentalities in him.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; So here the human being was in display
[48:13] looking at the cup. It's not a physical
[48:15] cup, but it's talking about our
[48:16] suffering,
[48:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:18] &gt;&gt; The cruelty of the the the the cross
[48:20] that he was going to suffer for us,
[48:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:22] &gt;&gt; And being a human being, you could see
[48:24] in vision
[48:25] &gt;&gt; those Roman soldiers and the Jews with
[48:28] hatred. Pharisees, they have tried
[48:30] several times to kill him
[48:32] &gt;&gt; in the temple. It wasn't time. So, he
[48:34] disappeared in the theophony
[48:35] &gt;&gt; and break his body back.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; But now, this is the time for him for
[48:38] body to be broken that you and I will
[48:41] have salvation.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; And so as a human being, the human
[48:45] spirit was praying looking at the
[48:47] suffering that he was going to going
[48:48] through in a few minutes and few hours.
[48:51] He prayed the father, the pillar of fire
[48:52] in him. Abraham said that when you pray,
[48:54] you don't pray to God in the sky.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; If you're a Christian and God lives in
[48:58] your heart, you pray to Christ in you.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; So he was praying to the pillar of fire
[49:02] in him.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus is 100% human being and the Christ
[49:06] is the almighty God. 100% Christ in God
[49:08] in him. Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; So he went through that change for us.
[49:12] Amen. and you may take your seat. Glory
[49:14] hallelujah to the Lord.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; He went through that change of being
[49:17] weak and then be strengthened, being
[49:20] down and being elevated.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; So when he asked you to change, he has
[49:24] already gone through the change.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; So let's see. Let's take a look at the
[49:29] topic then change. How this topic was
[49:32] born into my heart. It was let make sure
[49:34] I have the date right. It looks like
[49:36] June.
[49:38] I will tell you in a moment. Glory.
[49:41] Hallelujah.
[49:42] The Lord does things so strange.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; That was June the 8th, 2025. I think we
[49:50] were in the old church.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; And my car broke down. So, I couldn't
[49:54] come to church that day if I remember
[49:56] correctly. So, I was just sitting on my
[49:59] bed and studying. I said, "Okay, I'll
[50:00] use the time to study." And this topic
[50:02] dropped on on my heart. Then change.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I'll go back also to
[50:10] talk a little bit about it that the
[50:12] change. Let's look at what we mean by
[50:14] change.
[50:16] Let's just break it into pieces. Let's
[50:18] look at the word.
[50:22] Let me see. Let me go to
[50:27] Okay. Then change. Let's go to then
[50:29] change. I think slide four.
[50:32] Thank you. So when then means it's an
[50:35] adverb that is used to connect a
[50:38] sentence.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; I mean the school kids can tell us the
[50:41] grammar
[50:42] &gt;&gt; which means at that time.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; H in the it could be the past tense in
[50:47] the future.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And then next in order of time something
[50:50] to happen or something that is going to
[50:52] happen subsequently or soon after.
[50:55] Right.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; An example is a simple example is Anna
[50:57] is working to save money. Then takes
[51:00] vacation to Hawaii. Takes goes to Hawaii
[51:03] for vacation.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So working to save money and then
[51:07] something following he goes on to take
[51:09] vacation in Hawaii.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; The next one is the sky was almost
[51:12] black. That was in the past and then it
[51:15] started hailing.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; So then it's connecting the two.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at change. Of course we
[51:20] all know change. Change means making
[51:22] someone or something different from what
[51:24] it used to be. Alter a material, modify
[51:29] or replace something completely with
[51:32] someone or something else of the same
[51:34] kind but newer or a better functioning
[51:36] version of that. Amen. In computers
[51:39] sometime you have to update your
[51:40] computer, replace uh certain things for
[51:43] the computer to function. So change we
[51:45] go through changes all the time. Glory
[51:48] hallelujah. So this change uh came about
[51:52] from I from a vision that a brother had
[51:56] then changed. In the vision the brother
[51:58] was in the woods and it was uh
[52:01] blistering and storms and it was white
[52:04] out snow everywhere and he was lost. So
[52:07] we begin to wonder how am I going to go
[52:09] home? And all of a sudden he saw a man
[52:11] in a hood coming and when the man drew
[52:14] closer it was Abraham. So he was happy
[52:16] said thank God the Lord sent Abraham to
[52:18] lead me and take me from this storm. And
[52:20] so Abraham came and said follow me let's
[52:22] go. And as they were going it wasn't too
[52:25] long Abraham changed into from the human
[52:27] figure into a forooted animal
[52:29] &gt;&gt; and begin to gallop at a higher speed.
[52:31] And the brother said oh my I'm lost I
[52:33] can't make it. And a voice said then
[52:36] change.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; And then he changed and swung from human
[52:40] figure into four-footed animal and took
[52:43] after Abraham. So they kept going in. It
[52:46] wasn't too long and Abraham changed
[52:47] again from 4-footed animal into an eagle
[52:50] and begin to soar into the sky. And
[52:52] said, "Oh Lord, I'm lost. There's no way
[52:55] I can make it." And the voice came by
[52:57] said, "Then change."
[52:58] &gt;&gt; And then he changed from the for-footed
[53:00] animal into an eagle and begin to soar
[53:04] high with Abraham. And as they keep So
[53:07] Abraham went directly into the sun. He
[53:09] said, "No, I can't make it. The
[53:10] intensity will blind me. I'm lost." And
[53:13] the voice said, "You have arrived here.
[53:16] Only eagles can come here."
[53:17] &gt;&gt; All right.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Only eagles can come here.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you an eagle?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Have you arrived?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Do you have the new birth?
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Only eagles can be born again.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Non eagles can go through the Broadway.
[53:34] They can go through the way of the old
[53:37] birth, the sex birth. But the new birth
[53:39] is only for the predestinated. Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Only eagles can come this way.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; And I I like to break things down. If I
[53:46] take a vision, it talks about our life
[53:50] from this earth as we were born into
[53:52] this world in sin, in unbelief, lost in
[53:54] blisters in in in the storms of this
[53:57] world. But then God sent a prophet
[54:00] &gt;&gt; to lead us. Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; To take it from the storm and from our
[54:03] lost condition
[54:05] &gt;&gt; into presence of Christ.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And we go through the stages. Everyone
[54:08] has got their stages of life that they
[54:10] go through to come to the son of God.
[54:12] Not the physical son but the son of the
[54:14] living God.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Let go back and this is not part of my
[54:19] sermon but this is something happened uh
[54:21] during the meetings and I want to talk
[54:22] about it and that is sister's testimony
[54:25] actually to be to begin with. Sister
[54:27] Erica permit me to share your testimony
[54:29] what the Lord showed you. Amen. Let's go
[54:32] to uh the picture of the moon. Praise
[54:35] the Lord. Hallelujah. This was uh 26th
[54:39] uh June I think that was no July rather.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you. I missed it. I'm not good in
[54:43] dates so forgive me. 26th July 2025th at
[54:46] Palm Beach Gardens High School when we
[54:48] were having the special meetings and I
[54:50] think it was Saturday if I'm correct. So
[54:52] I was doing ushering open doors for
[54:54] brothers and coming in and I was
[54:56] thirsty. So I said let me go get some
[54:57] water from my car and I was parked all
[54:59] the way. So I was going I step outside
[55:02] and sister was close to where the cups
[55:04] if you are coming from if you are going
[55:05] into the auditorium the cup was the cup
[55:08] used to stand on the right side but if
[55:10] you're coming from the auditorium he was
[55:11] on the left side so I think was on the
[55:14] on the side close to the cup so I came
[55:17] and passed by by by her and he said
[55:19] brother look and I turned back to
[55:23] I look at I said look at the sky I said
[55:25] wow this is what brother brothera
[55:29] was preaching
[55:30] &gt;&gt; that's
[55:30] right the time the same time.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Talking about the seven church ages and
[55:36] how the light was almost gone just a
[55:38] flick of life in the seven church age
[55:40] this year.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; And he was talking about I remember he
[55:43] talked about Esther that Esther was in
[55:46] the palace before the the the enemy even
[55:49] tried to destroy the Jewish.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And I said I like to get into details of
[55:54] thing. Amen. I like the finer details.
[55:56] And I remember sister if I'm right if
[55:59] I'm wrong correct me you were wearing
[56:00] blue dress if I'm if I'm right and I
[56:03] look at the sky and I look at blue sky
[56:05] &gt;&gt; and it was he was the first lady of the
[56:07] house the pastor's wife
[56:09] &gt;&gt; he she wasn't a preacher
[56:11] &gt;&gt; but she was the first lady
[56:12] &gt;&gt; she's Esther
[56:14] &gt;&gt; in her position
[56:15] &gt;&gt; and God eternity dealing with Esther
[56:20] &gt;&gt; and Kenosaurus is what Christ
[56:22] &gt;&gt; dealing with the wife of Christ showing
[56:24] her things
[56:25] &gt;&gt; the Lord didn't to the ministers. No,
[56:28] &gt;&gt; but he showed the woman the first lady
[56:30] of the house
[56:31] &gt;&gt; that God has positioned his bride, the
[56:34] wife of Christ in her rightful position.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; And he can know her position. She was
[56:38] wearing blue, blue dress. Blue is a
[56:41] color of the heavenlies.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Color of the sixth dimension, color of
[56:45] eternity.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Color of all the blessings come from
[56:48] blue. Amen.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; And the sky was blue. No.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; So I took a picture and later went to I
[56:54] said share with brother Jack, brother
[56:55] Quinton and me and brother Quinton. I
[56:56] think about an hour or so we went and
[56:59] the picture was still there. The moon
[57:00] was still there. We took several
[57:02] pictures at different stages.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Glory
[57:04] &gt;&gt; to show that God is with his people.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in uh Hebrews chapter 11
[57:11] verse no Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the
[57:15] same yesterday and forever.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same God with the old prophet,
[57:19] &gt;&gt; with the judges, with with with the with
[57:22] the patriarch, with the women of God,
[57:25] the same God is with you. Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; You are not lesser than Esther. No.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; You are no lesser than Hannah.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; You are no lesser than Sarah.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; You are no lesser than Elizabeth.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; In fact, you have been given more than
[57:36] Elizabeth Kat. Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; You don't have to sacrifice goats and
[57:41] lambs.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Because Christ himself is what? On the
[57:44] inside of you.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The mercy seat is not in
[57:47] some wooden somewhere animal skin. But a
[57:50] mercy seat is right in your heart.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; If you've got a new birth. Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. And the Lord show
[57:57] before he does things on earth. He shows
[58:00] it in heaven.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; And as brother was preaching, the Lord
[58:03] is already showing what is happening in
[58:05] the churches right in the skies in the
[58:07] first Bible, the zodiac.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord. So now
[58:12] let's go to the sermon. Let's go to
[58:14] slide I think six and we are not going
[58:18] to do calculus but I want to see we want
[58:20] to look at how God Okay this is that the
[58:22] next slide let me see I'm just mixing it
[58:26] up okay here we go so we're going to
[58:29] look at equation we not going to do
[58:30] calculus here so don't be scared
[58:34] you're going to say brother Jack say are
[58:36] you turning my my church into a calculus
[58:38] class no I'm not doing that we just want
[58:41] to see how God displays himself evening
[58:43] everywhere.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; We remember the story of brother Brown
[58:46] talk about a young lady. I think he
[58:49] finished high school or college and she
[58:50] wanted to party in the house and the
[58:52] father is old Pentecostal. Amen.

[59:57] Hallelujah.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; He was looking at the oceans,
[59:59] Mediterranean ocean, Pacific Ocean,
[1:00:01] Atlantic Ocean.

[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; And the young lady came, daddy, I gave
[1:00:07] you. Please, you don't have your Bible.
[1:00:09] How do you see Jesus Christ in geography
[1:00:10] book? Just read a geography. Don't don't
[1:00:12] say amen. Just we only have like 45
[1:00:14] minutes, you know. Please, daddy, don't
[1:00:16] do that. Don't disgrace me. But they
[1:00:18] say, "Oh, sweet, you don't know God is
[1:00:19] in geography. I never know." Thank you
[1:00:21] for giving the geography book.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; If God is in you, you see him wherever
[1:00:26] you are.
[1:00:31] [Applause]
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a little song. He said,
[1:00:35] "God made the sun to shine just for you.
[1:00:41] He made the desert sand, the mountains
[1:00:44] and the sea." If God is in your If God
[1:00:48] is in your heart, then you can see him
[1:00:52] too. Just God, he made it all for you
[1:00:56] and for me. Yes.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; So if God is in your heart, whether
[1:01:00] geography, whether computer, whether the
[1:01:02] skies, the moon, the sea, human beings,
[1:01:05] the building, you see God everywhere.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; You can look at the building and see
[1:01:08] God. You look at the foundation, you see
[1:01:10] the alpha.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; You look at the structure, you see the
[1:01:14] seven changes. You look at the roof and
[1:01:16] you see the capstone, the omega age.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; God is everywhere.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; So I have this equation here. Like I
[1:01:23] said, we are not going to do calculus
[1:01:25] here. when I used to when I was in Texas
[1:01:27] I used to teach and in my class before
[1:01:29] we do I used to teach a medical
[1:01:31] assistant student pharmacy text uh
[1:01:33] criminal justice so they pass through my
[1:01:35] class and they take about 3 weeks math
[1:01:37] class and of course many people don't
[1:01:38] like math so before I start teaching I
[1:01:41] do we have a wedding in our class simple
[1:01:43] wedding I love math
[1:01:46] so I get m said Jesse I love math and
[1:01:49] someone said Mr. I hate math.
[1:01:53] He said he said, "Don't even do this
[1:01:54] wedding because I'm going to divorce
[1:01:55] math right after the wedding.
[1:01:58] There's no way I love." I said, "You
[1:02:00] just say it. I love math." So, I get
[1:02:01] them to say, "I love maths." I said,
[1:02:04] "Let's let's blow up the building. Just
[1:02:06] say it as much as as loud as you can. I
[1:02:08] love maths." And then from there, I give
[1:02:10] them the basics about, for example, if
[1:02:13] you want to multiply negative number by
[1:02:15] positive, let's say -2 * -3, the answer
[1:02:18] is going to be positive. two negatives.
[1:02:20] If you divide the same thing if you add
[1:02:22] it depends on the bigger size. So -5 + 3
[1:02:26] as take it like you owe $5 and then you
[1:02:29] pay $3. So you still owe $2 and oh we
[1:02:31] never know math is so easy and after
[1:02:33] they fall in love with math. So we are
[1:02:35] not going to do math here. I'm going to
[1:02:36] use
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; some basic to see how God displays
[1:02:39] himself even in calculus.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; I have this equation here. Y is equal to
[1:02:45] X to the^ 3. Don't be disturbed. Okay,
[1:02:49] we are not in calculus class. And then I
[1:02:51] say Y stand for Yahweh.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Equals sign X. The X stand for you
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and I elected sons and daughters of God.
[1:03:02] When we were born physically on this
[1:03:04] earth, we're a variable. In other words,
[1:03:07] you could be changed. You have choices
[1:03:09] to make.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Your choice can take you to land of
[1:03:13] domination
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; or it can take you to the region of the
[1:03:16] bless.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; So you're a variable. You can you can
[1:03:19] you have that choice human choice.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; But there's a three sub supercript
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; the super god has given you a
[1:03:28] predestination
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; that you find the voice in your heart
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Yahweh which is why
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; because you are part of Yahweh
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; and he put something in you though even
[1:03:38] in our lost estate there was something
[1:03:40] in us
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; that tell you that you are not of this
[1:03:43] world.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; You are not born meant for this. You are
[1:03:47] not born to go to club. You are not born
[1:03:49] to be a womanizer.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; You are not meant to be a drunkard. You
[1:03:53] are not meant to be a boxer fighter.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; But you are meant for eternal purpose on
[1:03:56] earth.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; And that super script is always ringing
[1:04:01] in your heart.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Even when you were lost, you didn't know
[1:04:04] who you are.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; So, you go through life just like
[1:04:09] everybody else. And when the time comes,
[1:04:12] Yahweh said, "Now I want the key
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; to to to start." Like you have a car,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; push the start button.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Let the engine the the the gasoline
[1:04:22] begin to run through the the system.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; To let you know that you are not just a
[1:04:26] human being,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; but you're a son or a daughter of God.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. So the Yahweh eternal
[1:04:31] thought of God when we were born through
[1:04:33] the natural sex, you were just lying
[1:04:36] down moving about with our earthly
[1:04:38] achievement. But number two, you have to
[1:04:40] make a change. Now the change is the
[1:04:42] first one is what? Repentance.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Repent. The Bible says in Act 2:38,
[1:04:47] repent. And you don't stop at
[1:04:49] repentance. You have to go to the second
[1:04:51] stage and be baptized in the name of the
[1:04:53] Lord Jesus Christ. So the first one in
[1:04:55] calculus, they have what they call
[1:04:56] derivative or differentiation and and
[1:04:58] and uh disintegration. So you
[1:05:00] differentiate the the x to the power y
[1:05:04] the supers which is three. You bring it
[1:05:06] to become h the coefficient that is the
[1:05:09] number multiplying the x and then reduce
[1:05:11] the power by one. In other words, your
[1:05:13] eternal attribute that is in you
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; that you never knew it begin to come on
[1:05:17] earth.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Not only lying in the mind of God, but
[1:05:20] it has to come to you. Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Imagine your parents give you give you
[1:05:25] billions of dollars and it's just a
[1:05:27] check. The check doesn't do you too much
[1:05:28] good.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; But if you translate a check into cash,
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; then cash is what? King. Yeah,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; when you got the cash then you can do
[1:05:36] things that you want. You can buy
[1:05:37] mansions do whatever you need to do.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; So as long as the thought is lying the
[1:05:41] man of God not manifest manifesting on
[1:05:43] earth it doesn't do good. It's just a
[1:05:45] mental knowledge.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; But God want to become what? Flesh.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; So what he thought about brother
[1:05:51] Johnson, brother Solomon has to become
[1:05:53] manifested in brother Solomon.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Solomon can say I'm a son
[1:05:57] of God. If Christ is not on the inside,
[1:06:00] it's just a theory.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; It's just a recite recitation.
[1:06:03] But when Christ quickens brother Solomon
[1:06:06] then he becomes a son of God in display.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; So the first step is what derivative is
[1:06:13] repent and the second derivative is be
[1:06:16] baptized in the name of the lord Jesus
[1:06:18] Christ. And if you realize that as you
[1:06:21] keep changing the super becomes a part
[1:06:26] of his life it's no longer super. It
[1:06:29] reduce it by one. And here the two
[1:06:31] multiply by the three it reduce by one.
[1:06:33] So it means your potentials and your
[1:06:35] attributes the peace the love the
[1:06:38] healing the gift of God begin to
[1:06:40] manifest in your flesh in real time not
[1:06:43] just in the mind of God. Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah to the Lord. Then the
[1:06:48] the the most the utmost change is the
[1:06:51] third one. The third derivative that is
[1:06:54] when you dis disintegrate and become
[1:06:56] part of Christ. That is the new birth,
[1:06:58] the new supernatural birth. Amen. And
[1:07:00] when you are born again, you are not
[1:07:02] just just a human being walking on two
[1:07:04] feet, but you are Christ, a in a sister,
[1:07:07] in a brother walking on two feet. Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; So the new birth is what made a change.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; The atmos change is not just the
[1:07:15] repenting. You can repent and go back to
[1:07:17] drinking.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; You can be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ and you look like the devil.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; As you never you were never even born a
[1:07:25] Christian.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when the utmost change
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; of the new birth, what is the new birth?
[1:07:31] The new birth is Christ himself
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; coming into you
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; consuming the old birth
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; burning it and it completely complete an
[1:07:41] inhalation that it doesn't even exist no
[1:07:44] more.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And then Christ take your flesh and the
[1:07:47] atoms of your body and create a new
[1:07:49] person,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; a brand new man.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; As the song go says, I'm I'm a new
[1:07:54] creation.
[1:07:56] I'm a brand new man.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Old things they have passed away. I've
[1:08:01] been born again.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; And then on and on and on. So become
[1:08:05] brand new creation in Christ Jesus and
[1:08:08] nothing can change you. Amen. When you
[1:08:10] are born again,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; it's impossible
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; to go back.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; There's no way
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; a born again sister or brother
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; can go back. It's just not impossible.
[1:08:21] Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; That's why Bible said that there's no
[1:08:24] sin accounted for the one that is in
[1:08:26] Christ, the seed of God. Cuz when you're
[1:08:27] born again, the life that you live is
[1:08:30] not brother Solomon. It's not brother
[1:08:31] Jack. It's not Erica. It's not brother
[1:08:32] Joseph. It's Jesus Christ on the inside
[1:08:35] living his life outside of you. Amen.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. It's like your
[1:08:40] clothes. You control your clothes. You
[1:08:42] can wash it. You can wear it. You can
[1:08:44] put it off. You can do whatever laundry.
[1:08:46] Whatever you need. So when you born
[1:08:48] again, you become an instrument that God
[1:08:50] uses. Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Blessed. Let's go to some changes
[1:08:56] that uh we found in the Bible. Let's go
[1:08:59] to uh three women that had some changes
[1:09:02] that were not normally typically that
[1:09:04] couldn't even be possible. Let's go to
[1:09:06] the next slide. Change your belief and
[1:09:08] thinking. We have sister Sarah, sister
[1:09:11] Anna, sister Elizabeth who were baring
[1:09:14] women and we know their life story. Some
[1:09:17] were all of them were past menopause.
[1:09:19] Sarah was 99. No sorry uh 90 rather and
[1:09:23] her husband Ibraham was uh almost 99
[1:09:26] Hannah was past 70 years. Elizabeth the
[1:09:29] same thing. So in the normal life
[1:09:30] situation medically speaking anatomic
[1:09:33] anatomically physiologically it's
[1:09:36] impossible for them to give birth to
[1:09:38] children
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; because the eggs are no longer producing
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; and you need a egg and a sperm of a man
[1:09:44] to fertilize and produce a child.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; So this doesn't happen. So it's
[1:09:48] impossible. That is even the normal pro
[1:09:50] God made us.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; But with the Lord nothing shall be
[1:09:54] impossible
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; with the Lord. All things are possible.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And I want you to soak that in your
[1:10:01] heart
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; that you apply. And I'll tell you later
[1:10:03] about my situation that this applied to
[1:10:05] me. Amen.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; We are not preaching sermons from the
[1:10:08] mind but we are preaching what the Lord
[1:10:10] has done in our lives. Amen. Glory.
[1:10:12] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[1:10:14] Lord. So this account is there. I don't
[1:10:16] have time to read all the scripture.
[1:10:18] Genesis 18 9 to 9-11. You can read them
[1:10:21] when you get back home. And let's look
[1:10:23] at uh Hannah's situation. This lady was
[1:10:27] past 70. And being a child, she's being
[1:10:30] a daughter of Jehovah. Serve the Lord
[1:10:33] with all of her hearts. And there was a
[1:10:35] desire in her to have children. But she
[1:10:37] got to a place that there was no hope,
[1:10:39] humanly speaking, for Anna to have
[1:10:41] children. How can 70 70 years old
[1:10:44] grandmother have children? It's gone.
[1:10:47] But there was something in Anna that she
[1:10:50] wanted to have children but not children
[1:10:53] but children and dedicate them to the
[1:10:55] Lord.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; So one day the husband really loved
[1:10:57] Anna. They used to go to the temple to
[1:10:59] to h they go to Shiloh to sacrifice for
[1:11:03] for for service and things like that.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; And one time they went to Shiloh and
[1:11:07] there was something I'm not going back
[1:11:09] home. Told her the husband and the
[1:11:10] family can go back home. She went to the
[1:11:12] temple to pray. She prayed till her
[1:11:14] voice was gone and she was just opening
[1:11:17] her mouth. No voice was coming. And the
[1:11:19] priest Eli felt she was drunk. And he
[1:11:23] said, "No, my lord. I'm not a a daughter
[1:11:25] of Baham. I'm not a serpent seed. I'm
[1:11:28] not an ungal woman. But out of
[1:11:30] abandoned, the sorrow of my heart, I'm
[1:11:32] prayer to Jehovah."
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And he spoke. He said, "Let it be the
[1:11:36] Lord give you the desires of your
[1:11:37] heart."
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And right away there was conference in
[1:11:40] heaven. Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; As when you pray, you might not see
[1:11:44] nothing.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Abraham said that the weakest prayer of
[1:11:47] the weakest Christian is still ominant.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Anna was just sorrowful praying for the
[1:11:55] desires of her heart. But there was
[1:11:57] conference in the sixth dimension. God
[1:11:59] called a conference called all the
[1:12:01] angels. They came around said, "Do you
[1:12:03] know my daughter Anna?" Say, "Yes, we
[1:12:04] know her. She saved me all of her life
[1:12:07] and she has a desire in her heart and
[1:12:09] it's time for me to honor my daughter.
[1:12:11] Amenise.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Imagine God want to honor you.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; So the Lord had a conference. What do we
[1:12:18] do for honor? And let's say h one of the
[1:12:21] angels let's say uh Gabriel said Lord
[1:12:24] why don't she say woman why don't you
[1:12:25] give her maybe twins two lovely twins
[1:12:27] you know why don't you give a girl a
[1:12:28] girl child and this one will say Lord
[1:12:30] send me. I'll just go and speak the
[1:12:32] word. I'll just go and plant twins in a
[1:12:34] womb. Plant a son in a womb. Plant this.
[1:12:37] And the Lord said, well, she has a
[1:12:38] desire. Her desire is to get a manchild.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Not only that, she want to give that
[1:12:43] manchild to me.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; But I want to give her something more
[1:12:47] than she desire.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; I want to give her one of my prophet
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Samuel,
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; one of my greatest prophet on earth.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; I want to take Samuel and plant in the
[1:12:58] womb of Anna.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord said, "Let it be."
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; And Anna, right away when the priest
[1:13:05] said, "Let it be," Jehovah give the
[1:13:07] desires of your heart.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Right away, Anna conceived
[1:13:10] supernaturally.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And when she went to be with her
[1:13:13] husband, the natural was just just an
[1:13:14] addition.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Supernaturally, the Lord has already
[1:13:17] planted Samuel in the womb of Anna.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; And when you pray, you don't see
[1:13:22] physical. Sir, don't worry.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Just rejoice as if you have seen you
[1:13:25] have got everything in your in your
[1:13:27] hands. Amen. Don't worry about, oh, I'm
[1:13:29] praying for $1 million. I don't even
[1:13:31] have $1 in my pocket.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; You've got $1 million already.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; How is going to be in your hands? Is not
[1:13:38] your problem.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; That's why you pray to a higher power.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; And a higher power is the Lord Jesus
[1:13:44] Christ
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and he will make it happen. Yours is to
[1:13:47] believe, receive in your pocket, talk
[1:13:49] about it, testify about it.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm a millionaire. I've got 1
[1:13:53] million.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Say, bro, you you you've got 1 million.
[1:13:56] Yes, I do. Yes.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; But you don't have $1. What are you
[1:14:00] talking about?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; It's you looking at my physical pocket.
[1:14:03] But I've got a supernatural pocket.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I've got a bank of heaven.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Not a bank of America.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Not a Chase Bank. Not Wells Fargo, not a
[1:14:14] credit union, but a bank of heaven that
[1:14:18] never broke, that never filed for
[1:14:20] bankruptcy. That bank is your bank. And
[1:14:23] you can draw resources from that bank
[1:14:26] all the time. Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; As as brother Jack put it, the the
[1:14:32] resources could be cut from the earth,
[1:14:34] but the source is God.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; The source of heaven, the bank of heaven
[1:14:39] never run dry. Your resources may run
[1:14:42] dry, but the source is there to just
[1:14:44] draw from. Amen. Just go back to the
[1:14:46] resource. Sorry. Go back to the source
[1:14:49] and draw your resources. Glory.
[1:14:51] Hallelujah to the Lord.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; So the Bible said that sister Anna just
[1:15:01] left home no more sad but rejoicing. Her
[1:15:04] desires have been met.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; But then physically there was nothing.
[1:15:07] She wasn't physically. If she went for
[1:15:09] pregnancy there's nothing. Same old. You
[1:15:11] don't even menrate how you going to get
[1:15:13] pregnant.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; But God has already placed something in
[1:15:16] your womb.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Sister
[1:15:19] Elizabeth went through the same thing.
[1:15:20] Sarah for the sake of time I want us to
[1:15:22] read something regarding uh sister
[1:15:24] Mary's situation. How the Messiah
[1:15:28] had to come on earth by changing of a
[1:15:30] virgin's mind then change. Amen. Let's
[1:15:33] go to Luke chapter 1. It looks like one.
[1:15:47] Praise be to the Lord.
[1:15:52] Luke chapter 1,
[1:15:55] instead of reading the 36, let's go to
[1:15:57] verse 27. When the angel Gabriel appears
[1:16:00] to Mary
[1:16:09] so Luke 1 verse 26 and that's where it
[1:16:14] begins. And in the sixth month of in the
[1:16:17] sixth month, remember the number six is
[1:16:18] what? number of a man.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; That is natural things. In the sixth
[1:16:23] month, the angel Gabriel was sent from
[1:16:25] God unto a city of Galilee named
[1:16:28] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[1:16:30] whose name was Joseph of the house of
[1:16:33] David. And the virgin's name was Mary.
[1:16:36] 20 28 And the angel came unto him, and
[1:16:39] said, Hail, thou are highly favored. The
[1:16:42] Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
[1:16:44] among women. 29 And when she saw him,
[1:16:48] she was troubled at his saying, and cast
[1:16:51] in her mind, what manner of salutation
[1:16:53] this should be. 30 And the angel said
[1:16:56] unto Mary, unto her, Fear not, Mary, for
[1:16:59] thou hast found favor with God. And
[1:17:01] behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
[1:17:04] and bring forth a son, and shall call
[1:17:06] his name Jesus.
[1:17:08] 30 32 he said and he shall be great and
[1:17:11] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:17:13] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[1:17:15] throne of his father David and he shall
[1:17:17] reign h over the house of Jacob forever
[1:17:20] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[1:17:22] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[1:17:25] this be singing I know not a man so now
[1:17:32] God is going to bring a contrast in a
[1:17:35] man's way of life is not possible to
[1:17:37] conceive without knowing a man. So say,
[1:17:39] "How shall he be? I've never even known
[1:17:40] a man. I'm only engaged. I'm not married
[1:17:43] yet. So how am I going to I've not
[1:17:46] consumed my marriage. How am I going to
[1:17:47] get pregnant?" Let's see. 35. And and
[1:17:50] the angel And the angel said answered
[1:17:53] and said unto unto her, "The Holy Ghost
[1:17:56] shall come upon thee, and the power of
[1:17:58] the highest shall overshadow thee."
[1:17:59] Therefore, so that the holy thing which
[1:18:01] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:18:03] the son of God. And behold, thy cousin
[1:18:06] Elizabeth, she hath she has also
[1:18:08] conceived a son in her old age. And this
[1:18:11] is the sixth month with her who he she
[1:18:15] who was called barren.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Verse 37, I want you to underline,
[1:18:18] highlight, absorb, eat, chew it, believe
[1:18:21] it,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; and do whatever you can do with it.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; That's the key word that will bring the
[1:18:25] chain that you desire.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; This was for Mary, but you have your own
[1:18:29] desire. Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yours is not to conceive the
[1:18:33] Messiah, but yours to produce the
[1:18:34] Messiah from your heart. Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; So verse 37 say, "For with God,
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; nothing,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; nothing shall be impossible."
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Do you have God in your in your heart?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; If you have him, then there's nothing
[1:18:47] impossible in your life.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; And I like the 38. This is sister writes
[1:18:54] and Mary said, "Behold the handmade of
[1:18:56] the Lord." Now she got a revelation.
[1:18:58] Behold the hand handmade of the Lord
[1:19:00] beat unto me according to thy word. And
[1:19:02] the angel angel departed from her. Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; That's what he did. Wright did. He said,
[1:19:07] brother Bill, you are right. Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; When the word is preached to you, you
[1:19:12] don't have to understand it. As long as
[1:19:14] you is the word, you believe it. You say
[1:19:16] amen to it. The word has been conceived
[1:19:18] in your heart.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And that is what sister Mary got a
[1:19:21] blessing. That's what she conceived the
[1:19:22] Messiah and brought life onto the whole
[1:19:25] the whole human human race. Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord. So God
[1:19:30] has to change, sorry, Gabriel has to
[1:19:32] change Mary think Mary's thinking from
[1:19:34] the natural sex birth to the spoken word
[1:19:37] birth. Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; The spoken word doesn't need a man and a
[1:19:40] woman. It is need God and elected flesh.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Are you an elected seed of God?
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Are you seeking the Holy Ghost baptism?
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Young people, are you seeking the Holy
[1:19:49] Ghost baptism? Do you want to have your
[1:19:51] own experience like your parents have
[1:19:53] the experience or you just want to come
[1:19:54] to church and go back home? If you can't
[1:19:57] go come to church and go back home, one
[1:19:59] day you're going to find yourself
[1:20:00] wanting,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; you're going to be like the man that was
[1:20:03] invited for a wedding and then in the
[1:20:05] eastern country when you they invite
[1:20:06] you, the the the groom and the bride
[1:20:08] provide you with the wedding garment.
[1:20:10] And this guy was found in the wedding
[1:20:11] without a garment.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; And they said, "No, this is not a
[1:20:14] garment we supply,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; they cast him out into the outer
[1:20:17] darkness."
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; What's the outer darkness? If you don't
[1:20:19] have the Holy Ghost, the devil will eat
[1:20:21] you like a lion eating a lamb. Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the new birth now when
[1:20:26] you are young, you are angel, you are
[1:20:28] sweet, you are lovely, you are innocent.
[1:20:30] But as you grow, become a adolescent
[1:20:33] teenager.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; You are not always going to be sitting
[1:20:36] with your dad and your mom.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; You're going to probably find a job when
[1:20:39] you get a certain age.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; You're going to go to high school,
[1:20:42] college,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; you're going to be outside your parents.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; That is when you're going to find that
[1:20:46] you needed the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's Oh wow. I should have listened to
[1:20:51] what Braj was telling me. All right.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; I should have asked my pastor to pray
[1:20:54] for the Holy Ghost for me.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for the devil to
[1:20:57] tear you into pieces because that is his
[1:21:00] job.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; The devil comes to what? To steal your
[1:21:03] peace,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; to steal your innocency, to steal your
[1:21:06] joy,
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; to steal your blessing and to kill and
[1:21:09] to destroy you.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; But thank God there's a contrast to
[1:21:12] that.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ comes to give life
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; and give it abundantly.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; So he give you one eternal life in your
[1:21:19] heart and all the blessing. Don't rush
[1:21:22] for something that is not your time yet.
[1:21:24] Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Wait on the Lord. Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Don't rush to do what your parents do.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Your parents are legally married. They
[1:21:30] are married have been blessed of the
[1:21:32] Lord. But if you if you're not married
[1:21:33] and you want to do what your parent do,
[1:21:35] the consequences is not what you're
[1:21:36] going to like.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; It might what do you call it? It might
[1:21:40] be h what's the word? It might be um it
[1:21:43] will bring temporal
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; come again give me the word
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; satisfaction to your flesh
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; and to your human spirit. But the pain
[1:21:52] that you going to bear in this life,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; you regret it. Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; The devil will condemn you all the time.
[1:21:59] Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to You're going to
[1:22:01] bring children that you didn't plan for.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to end up being being a
[1:22:05] mother without a husband, a father
[1:22:07] without a wife.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; And you're going to go through life in a
[1:22:10] very difficult way.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; So God brought brother Jack and the
[1:22:13] ministers, your parents
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; to raise you in the fear of the Lord.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; That you walk like Esther.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; You walk like Mary. that God himself
[1:22:21] will said like he did to Anna, I've
[1:22:23] remembered my daughter, this is a time
[1:22:25] for me to bless her. Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; As a young brother, God will bless you
[1:22:28] at the appointed time.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; You have to got a decision to make
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; that I'm not going to go go in the world
[1:22:34] the way of the world.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; If you don't make that decision in your
[1:22:36] heart when the worldly things you come
[1:22:39] across them, it going to overtake you.
[1:22:41] But if you have make your own decision
[1:22:42] that I'm not going to defile my body
[1:22:44] just like Daniel, Meshach, Shadrach,
[1:22:47] Abednego did that. They were young
[1:22:49] people. They were not they didn't have
[1:22:50] church.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; They were young men who were taken as
[1:22:53] slavery to another country. The only
[1:22:55] fellowship they had was with one
[1:22:56] another.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:22:58] the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifying
[1:23:00] them.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; They were under the blood of boos and
[1:23:02] lambs and goats and things like that.
[1:23:04] But Daniel as a human being define his
[1:23:07] own life. He didn't let the world define
[1:23:09] him.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't let rock and roll define him.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; He didn't let the metallic song define
[1:23:13] him. You can hide and play your metallic
[1:23:15] song. Your parents may not know, but you
[1:23:17] are embibing demons into your life.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; You can watch pornography. Your parent
[1:23:21] may not see you.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; but the devil is destroying your life
[1:23:23] right there.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; But if you allow the Lord to baptize you
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; in your heart by the Holy Ghost baptism,
[1:23:30] my brother, my sister, young person,
[1:23:33] life will be sweet for you. Of course,
[1:23:35] life will bring challenges, but when the
[1:23:36] challenges come, you're going to be like
[1:23:37] David. Remember what David did when he
[1:23:40] came across hamping
[1:23:45] the lamb for feeding and then a lion
[1:23:48] came around a bear or whatever came
[1:23:49] around. Jehovah he he invoked the name
[1:23:52] of the lord.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; And the lord gave him a strength that
[1:23:55] naturally you cannot fight a bear.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; But he was able to tear the bear into
[1:24:00] pieces and take his lamb.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Another time a lion came around. That's
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; He just transferred the battle to what?
[1:24:06] To his deity. All right.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Because he has the dity of Christ in
[1:24:09] him.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And Jehovah came around and he was able
[1:24:11] to summount and kill the lion. So when
[1:24:14] he was faced with Golad, he didn't
[1:24:15] wasn't afraid.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; He know who he was. Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; He know who was with him. Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; He had a baptism of lamp and goat at
[1:24:23] that time.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; So when he came before Saul said, "So
[1:24:26] David, please, you're a young man, young
[1:24:27] lovely, handsome man. I don't want you
[1:24:29] to go die. Take my my helmet and things
[1:24:32] like that." He tried. He said, "No, I've
[1:24:34] not tried before. God has given you a
[1:24:35] weapon just for you, my sister,
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; to overcome your battles.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; And that weapon is what you're going to
[1:24:40] use to overcome your battles.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; You can't use my weapon. I can always
[1:24:43] use your weapon cuz you have your
[1:24:45] covenant with the Lord. I have my
[1:24:46] covenant with the Lord.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Even your family, your parents have
[1:24:49] their covenant. And you have your
[1:24:50] covenant. And you have to know the
[1:24:52] covenant the Almighty has for you
[1:24:54] personally.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Because under that covenant, oh my
[1:24:57] goodness, when you stand, the whole
[1:24:59] eternity is with you.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; You are not afraid. Let let all the
[1:25:02] demons let whatever come before your
[1:25:05] way. You just stand aloof and let the
[1:25:07] Lord do the battle for you.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So David came before Golite. Golad
[1:25:11] was had all the demons. If you read the
[1:25:13] Bible, he's got gods, demons and dities.
[1:25:16] And he was cursing David in the name of
[1:25:18] his daties. Even beside the physical
[1:25:19] strength, his physique. He was so what
[1:25:22] do you call it? Invoking his deity,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; his superpower.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; That was the demons in him. Yes, sir.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And David said, "I've got greater than
[1:25:31] your demons.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; I've got God of Jehovah."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And David prayed a little prayer in his
[1:25:37] hand and took five simple stones and
[1:25:39] begin to w them singing, singing psalms
[1:25:42] of David
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; and then singing and watching Jehovah
[1:25:45] and the voice came release it. You think
[1:25:47] David was acting as a human being? No.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; He was acting as a son of God
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; in his position. not outside his
[1:25:54] position but what the Lord made him to
[1:25:56] be to kill the demons and he got to a
[1:25:59] place heard a voice he released the
[1:26:00] stone he just released it wasn't David
[1:26:02] David's might and skills no it was a
[1:26:05] supernatural
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; and the Bible said this guy has got even
[1:26:09] armor bearers who has got sword and
[1:26:11] shield to block stones and whatever you
[1:26:14] want to throw at him and he's got helmet
[1:26:16] all around him but there was a little
[1:26:18] hole
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; little little hole here
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; and this stone go around permeated all
[1:26:24] around the the bodyguards and everything
[1:26:26] and hit his head
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; and brought him down.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; If you have Jehovah in your heart,
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; my little sister, my brother,
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; regardless of the battles, just let the
[1:26:36] slingshot,
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; a little word come, even if you can't
[1:26:39] pray
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; and I'll share my testimony. Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; I was in Texas working good, getting
[1:26:45] good good money with my work. It blessed
[1:26:47] me to take care of whatever I need to
[1:26:48] take care of, church back home, go to
[1:26:51] Mexico to preach. And one day I said,
[1:26:53] "Lord, there's more for me." I felt I
[1:26:56] began I was thinking, should I tear my
[1:26:57] certificate and license? That's the
[1:26:59] license that I used to work. I said,
[1:27:00] "No, I want to there's more for me. I
[1:27:02] don't want to get stuck here." And I
[1:27:04] said, "I'm going to pack my certificate.
[1:27:06] I'm not going to renew them. I want
[1:27:08] something more from the Lord." And I put
[1:27:10] my certificate and licenses that I work
[1:27:12] with. I said, "I'm not going to renew
[1:27:13] them. Pack them somewhere." And the Lord
[1:27:15] opened the door for me to do NBA, my
[1:27:18] MBA, and then come to pharmacy school in
[1:27:20] Florida.
[1:27:22] Then change. If the old is not working,
[1:27:24] you have to change.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; If your horse is not working, do not try
[1:27:29] to revive the old dead horse.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Don't go to Cali to learn how to ride
[1:27:34] dead horses.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; If you go to a point, you know that this
[1:27:38] horse is dead. Bury the dead horse
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; and jump up on a a lively horse. Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Don't go to Hav and say, "I'm going to
[1:27:46] Hav to learn how to ride dead horses."
[1:27:48] You can put spritz some powder on the
[1:27:50] horse and whip them. They going to they
[1:27:52] not going to do nothing. The horse is
[1:27:54] what? Dead.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; You have to belongs to the ground.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Dig somewhere and put the horse there
[1:28:00] and get a new horse. Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Who makes the horses?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Jehovah.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; God made the horses.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; There are more horses for you to ride.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Don't mourn over a dead horse. Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; God can give you blessing, finance,
[1:28:15] money, anointing. You work with it and
[1:28:17] they run dry. Say, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:20] This was for yesterday, yesterday. I
[1:28:23] need new anointing. I need new finance.
[1:28:25] I need new beginning." And God will
[1:28:27] bless you. Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Where are we? Let's go to Gabriel. Let's
[1:28:40] go to Mary, virgin, conceive, and basia.
[1:28:42] I think we read two. Let's read. Yeah.
[1:28:45] Verse two. If you I'm not going to read
[1:28:46] it for the sake of time. When you go
[1:28:48] home you can read it. Then let's talk
[1:28:50] about Jesus change the wine. Jesus one
[1:28:52] of his first or that was his first
[1:28:54] miracle. That's right.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; He was at wedding with his mother
[1:28:58] invited and his disciples with him and
[1:29:00] he ran out of wine and they brought the
[1:29:03] mother the mother knew him
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; you know and they said you know what
[1:29:06] Lord they need they need a wine said
[1:29:08] well it's not my time yet. And then he
[1:29:10] told the people whatever he says do it.
[1:29:13] I remember last week brother Jack
[1:29:14] preached was it last week that uh that's
[1:29:16] how did he put it? He said, um, believe
[1:29:19] the Lord.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Believe Believe the Lord and believe in
[1:29:24] his prophet.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Help me.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; The Lord, you'll be established.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Establish his prophets.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Believe the Lord and you'll be
[1:29:32] established. Believe in his prophet and
[1:29:35] you will prosper.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; If you want to prosper, if you want to
[1:29:39] be established, believe the Lord
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; with all of your heart.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Then don't stay right there. Don't say,
[1:29:44] "I believe the Lord. I don't believe
[1:29:45] Jack. Amen.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord. I don't believe
[1:29:48] sister Erica. No. I believe the Lord. I
[1:29:50] don't believe my parents. My parents are
[1:29:51] human beings. I believe the Lord. I
[1:29:53] believe my pastor. I don't believe the
[1:29:54] Lord.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; They have Christ in them. Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; So believe in his prophet, in his men
[1:29:59] and women of God
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; and that will bring prosperity to your
[1:30:02] life.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That will bring untored blessings that
[1:30:05] you cannot even have enough room to
[1:30:07] contain
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; and your blessing will overflow onto
[1:30:10] others. Amen.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. I remember rejack I
[1:30:13] don't I don't see your sermon but last
[1:30:14] week you was talking about h
[1:30:16] establishing your business and then
[1:30:18] employing people giving 41k but I
[1:30:21] believe there was a time when you were
[1:30:22] working and getting paycheck isn't it
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; but now God has moved you changed
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; that you don't have to go and work for
[1:30:29] somebody to give him some paycheck
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; do you know what we do when we work for
[1:30:32] paycheck I'll give you a scenario it's
[1:30:35] like a mother hen chicken right they
[1:30:37] call them hen the British English here
[1:30:38] we call everyone everything chicken
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; but the mother is called hen.
[1:30:44] Forgive me.
[1:30:46] The mother is called hen, right? So,
[1:30:48] let's say mother hen had got 10 eggs and
[1:30:51] then 10 eggs is going to need 21 days to
[1:30:53] lay on the on the eggs 21 days for it to
[1:30:55] hatch into into chicks or chicken,
[1:30:57] whatever you call it. Anyway, but then
[1:30:59] the mother chicken say, you know what, I
[1:31:00] don't have the time to know lay on this
[1:31:02] eggs for 21 days. I want to have a good
[1:31:04] time. So, rather I'm going to make a
[1:31:06] contract with another hand. Hey, sister
[1:31:09] hen, this my 10 eggs. Can you lay on
[1:31:11] them and then when they hatch just give
[1:31:12] me three chicken
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; and you can take a risk and when you
[1:31:16] work for paycheck for Caesar that's what
[1:31:18] Caesar do to us
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; regardless of how much they pay you an
[1:31:21] hour
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; you don't know how much your sweat and
[1:31:24] your blood bring to the company
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; you know how they made their millions
[1:31:28] and the billions it's your sweat but we
[1:31:30] are afraid to make a change
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; we always like oh no I need to pay my
[1:31:35] mortgage I need to pay pay my car I need
[1:31:38] to pay my children I still work for
[1:31:40] McDonald's for for 5 years and you saw
[1:31:43] my manager you are not nothing they just
[1:31:46] feeding off your sweat and your blood
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; they give you that tag you are midonas
[1:31:51] manager
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; and you get a little bit of bonus and
[1:31:54] you're happy do you know what they when
[1:31:57] you get three chicken three three chicks
[1:32:00] they get 7 10 20 from you
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; but if you can take a bow step and pray
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; and with the direction of the Lord just
[1:32:07] like in the Bible they were business
[1:32:08] women and businessmen In the times of
[1:32:10] Paul, Joanna was a businesswoman, right?
[1:32:12] The Bible say she was selling purple.
[1:32:14] That was a business in that time and
[1:32:16] even supporting Paul's ministry and the
[1:32:18] brethren. So there's nothing wrong if
[1:32:19] you become a business woman. Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; If you can have faith, pray and let the
[1:32:23] Lord direct you.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; And the Lord will show you what you can
[1:32:27] do. Amen.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; And you have time for the Lord. I was
[1:32:29] speaking with one minister and said, "We
[1:32:31] spend all the time with Caesar."
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ministers, imagine the time in
[1:32:35] Abraham where they didn't have to work
[1:32:36] for Caesar. We could do more for the
[1:32:38] Lord. We could do more for the kingdom
[1:32:39] of God. But we spend 5 days for Caesar.
[1:32:41] You come back home tired, broken,
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; and you can't even you can't do much.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; But if you have our own business as
[1:32:48] ministers of God, as daughters and sons
[1:32:50] of God, and you spend two, three hours
[1:32:52] praying, do you know how what that
[1:32:54] prayer will do?
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Not only for you, it will work in
[1:32:57] Zimbabwe. It will work in England. It
[1:32:59] will work in Mexico. It will save
[1:33:02] somebody in Puerto Rico. It will
[1:33:04] transform lives. Yeah,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; but we spend all the time getting little
[1:33:07] paycheck
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; and we happy when they give you some
[1:33:10] bonus. No, they making millions out of
[1:33:12] you.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; So we have to pray. We have to change.
[1:33:15] Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; When changes comes, changes bring
[1:33:27] blessing. I didn't even finish my
[1:33:28] calculus. I didn't put that down. In
[1:33:31] calculus, this simple equation that we
[1:33:33] did, you might not know what they use in
[1:33:35] the world. A lot of things that we do in
[1:33:36] this world is based on this this little
[1:33:38] calculations. The fundamentals ships
[1:33:42] uh if you go and go to hospital to do
[1:33:44] MRI, CT scan, those principle are based
[1:33:47] on incremental changes. If you use look
[1:33:50] at the aircraft, the forces that act on
[1:33:52] the aircraft even spacecraft NASA, it's
[1:33:55] based on calculation from from from
[1:33:57] calculus. If you go to medicine and
[1:34:00] pharmacy, if you are you take a
[1:34:03] medication, the medication stays in your
[1:34:04] body for some time. We call it change.
[1:34:06] Go through what we call half lives. How
[1:34:08] long does it stay in your body? They
[1:34:09] have to consider the toxic aspect of the
[1:34:11] body. If it's toxic, then they have to
[1:34:13] let it stay in your body for a short
[1:34:14] time. So medicine, hy and a lot of
[1:34:18] principle in the world, they use
[1:34:20] calculus. If human beings can apply
[1:34:23] science to do a lot of things, ships,
[1:34:25] different just name it, all the areas of
[1:34:27] life, all the field, they apply
[1:34:28] calculus.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; What about if you change and you get the
[1:34:31] Holy Ghost baptism?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; If you get Christ in your heart,
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; what can you do with Christ?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Number one, eternal life.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Number two, safety.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Three, peace.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Healing,
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; joy,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; good marriage, good home, children,
[1:34:47] business.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You can become a millionaire. It's not.
[1:34:50] There's nothing wrong with it. Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; As long as you use it to to bless the
[1:34:54] name of the Lord,
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; you still serve the Lord, you still
[1:34:56] humble. There's nothing wrong with being
[1:34:58] a billionaire.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the Lord made it for you. Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; But we live below our privileges.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Because we limit God.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; But God want us what? To stop limiting
[1:35:10] him.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Cuz if we limit, we don't limit. We
[1:35:12] limit ourselves. We limit our blessing.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody's believing God. Amen. And
[1:35:18] changing. But we think, "Oh Lord, I need
[1:35:20] to so ride my dead horse." No.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Good preaching, brother.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; I was I had a dead horse, too.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; My car was gone and I still wanted to
[1:35:35] like I need to do this. I need to get
[1:35:37] this. I actually pick a car Honda pilot.
[1:35:39] I like always like the eight seat and
[1:35:40] extra seat. And I took it back because
[1:35:43] there was some issue with it. But I
[1:35:44] needed another horsepower. So I think
[1:35:47] about probably 3 weeks I was driving to
[1:35:50] from Jag Road going through to Lantana
[1:35:52] for an appointment and I said in my
[1:35:54] heart I didn't pray loud. I said Lord
[1:35:56] let it be the last time I put money in
[1:35:59] this vehicle.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And I look at people driving said how
[1:36:02] people are driving brand new cars all
[1:36:03] over new cars. Why can't I drive? Why do
[1:36:07] I have to keep beating my old horse? No.
[1:36:10] No.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; What is wrong with me?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And the problem was me not not God.
[1:36:17] was my limitation. Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; And I said, I have to put this horse
[1:36:23] down. I get a new horse rider.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And thanks be to God, two weeks ago, I
[1:36:30] got a new horsepower.
[1:36:32] [Applause]
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; I've got a I've got a Volkswagen Atlas.
[1:36:39] But Quinton, God bless you. He was with
[1:36:41] me. We went to buy it. He was with me
[1:36:43] all the way. God bless you. He
[1:36:44] sacrificed a lot of time for me. God
[1:36:45] bless. Brother,
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; my brother, my sister, there's nothing
[1:36:52] difficult for the Lord to do. Let's go
[1:36:55] to the next slide quickly. What is the
[1:36:57] common denomin denominator about change?
[1:37:00] It is the sixth dimension. We don't have
[1:37:03] time to read, but let's uh let's look at
[1:37:06] the let's probably I think let's read
[1:37:07] John chapter 14. Let's see the woman of
[1:37:10] the world. The conversation between that
[1:37:11] woman and Jesus Christ. We look at how
[1:37:13] Mary said, "Let it be unto me." And
[1:37:17] let's look at the same thing that the
[1:37:18] woman at the wall when she was convinced
[1:37:21] then she become concerned.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; So, let's see if we can read a little
[1:37:26] bit from John 4 somewhere.
[1:37:31] Praise be to the Lord.
[1:37:34] The change is in you. Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; You're going to find out
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; that you already changed. We only you
[1:37:40] didn't know.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your blessings are already
[1:37:42] there for you.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Just go pick them. They are yours.
[1:37:45] Nobody Your name is written on. Nobody
[1:37:47] can take your blessing.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; No devil, no demon, no sickness,
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; no poverty,
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; no nothing can take your blessing.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing can take your hold your
[1:37:57] children.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; They are yours. Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; And you've got a dimensional power.
[1:38:02] You've got a the the six dimension is
[1:38:04] the denomin denominator, the common
[1:38:07] denominator that bring the change. And
[1:38:09] you've got a six dimension. That's the
[1:38:11] Holy Ghost in you. All things are
[1:38:13] possible.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Speak sometime. You don't need to pray.
[1:38:17] You have to think
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; because you have got Christ in you. When
[1:38:20] you think,
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; he knows your thoughts.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; When you imagine things in your heart,
[1:38:24] he knows your imagination.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And what you imagine, you don't speak
[1:38:27] out loud.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I was driving when I was just in my
[1:38:30] heart. Lord, this will be the last time
[1:38:31] I will put money on this vehicle.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I do not want it. This is the last time
[1:38:35] I don't want to work this job anymore.
[1:38:37] I'm not going to renew my certificate
[1:38:38] and license. I want to move on and the
[1:38:41] Lord will make you move on. Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; So John chapter 4,
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; let's start from
[1:38:48] where?
[1:38:50] One moment
[1:38:53] verse 13.
[1:38:58] Okay, let's start from verse 9.
[1:39:01] Let's see. I want to try the
[1:39:03] conversation between Jesus and the woman
[1:39:04] at the Samar. Okay, let's start from
[1:39:06] verse one. Let's see. Jesus talked with
[1:39:08] a woman of Samaritan. John 4:1. When
[1:39:12] therefore the Lord knew how that the
[1:39:14] Pharisee heard that Jesus was made and
[1:39:16] baptized more disciples than John,
[1:39:17] though he Jesus himself baptized not but
[1:39:20] his disciples, he left Judea and
[1:39:23] departed again into Galilee. And he must
[1:39:27] and verse four, look at form of
[1:39:29] redemption. So and he must need go
[1:39:32] through Samaria because he had an
[1:39:33] elected daughter who has been kidnapped
[1:39:35] by the devil by prostitution.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Verse five, then came he on them came
[1:39:40] then cometh he to a city of Samaria
[1:39:43] which is called Sika h near the parcel
[1:39:46] of ground that Jacob gave to his son
[1:39:48] Joseph. Verse 6. Now Jacob's well was
[1:39:50] there and Jesus was therefore being
[1:39:52] worried with his journey sat thus on the
[1:39:55] well and it was about the sixth hour.
[1:39:58] Then cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
[1:40:00] water. Jesus said unto her, "Give me to
[1:40:02] drink." No, you always have to descend.
[1:40:05] Like I said, when you want to give the
[1:40:06] gospel, be a human first.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Talk about human things.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And the Lord himself will open the door
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; for dimension. But don't bombard people
[1:40:14] right away. Hey, you repent. Hey, stop
[1:40:16] smoking. Hey, you going to go to hell.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; You're just pushing them away.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; But find common grounds that you can
[1:40:23] relate to them.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Be a human, brother.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Be a human. Talk about things human do.
[1:40:26] Then the Lord will open the door for you
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; and then things flow in the right
[1:40:30] channel
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; and it bring the desire changes. Amen.
[1:40:33] So even Jesus had had to be a human.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; He wasn't lied about the water but he
[1:40:39] want to use the water to connect with
[1:40:41] woman of Samaria. So he said give me
[1:40:42] water to drink and then let's see how
[1:40:44] the conversation proceeded. H give me
[1:40:47] water. And verse 8 for his disciples
[1:40:49] were gone away unto the city to buy
[1:40:51] meat. Then said the woman of Samaria
[1:40:53] unto him, "How is it that thou, being a
[1:40:55] Jew, ask drink of me, which I'm a woman
[1:40:58] of Samaria?" Racism didn't start today.
[1:41:02] For the Jews had no dealings with Sam
[1:41:04] Samaritans, and all of them claimed
[1:41:06] Jacob as their father. Verse 10, Jesus
[1:41:09] answered and said unto her, If thou
[1:41:10] knowest the gift of God, and who is he
[1:41:13] that speaketh to thee, give me to drink,
[1:41:16] thou would have asked of him, he would
[1:41:18] have given thee living water. Amen.
[1:41:21] The word the woman said unto her unto
[1:41:23] him, "Sir, thou hast nothing to draw
[1:41:26] with, and the well is deep? From whence
[1:41:28] then hast thou this living water? Art
[1:41:31] thou greater than our father Jacob,
[1:41:33] which gave us the world and drank the
[1:41:36] drunk thereof himself and his children
[1:41:38] and his cattle?" Jesus answered and said
[1:41:40] unto him, "Whosoever drinkketh of this
[1:41:42] water shall thirst again. But whosoever
[1:41:45] drinkketh of the water that I shall give
[1:41:47] him shall never thirst. But the woman
[1:41:50] But the water that I shall give unto him
[1:41:52] shall be in him a well of water
[1:41:55] springing up into everlasting life.
[1:41:57] Amen. Out of your belly shall flow
[1:42:00] rivers of living waters. The woman said
[1:42:02] unto unto him, sir, give me this water
[1:42:05] that I test not, neither come here to
[1:42:07] draw. Amen. Now we talking. Now she's in
[1:42:11] the same channel with Jesus. verse verse
[1:42:15] 16. Then Jesus said, "Go call thy
[1:42:16] husband and come hither." The rest is a
[1:42:19] story. Right? So now when God present
[1:42:22] the gospel, you have to come to a point
[1:42:24] now to accept full acceptance of the
[1:42:26] word of the Lord.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; For you to be born again, for a man to
[1:42:29] marry you, you have to accept a man.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; For a woman to marry you, you have to
[1:42:33] accept a woman.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; It can't happen if you can't fully
[1:42:36] accept each other.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; And it's a married relationship between
[1:42:39] you and Christ. If you can't fully
[1:42:41] accept the word of the Lord that was
[1:42:43] given to you by the prophet, God through
[1:42:45] his prophet, you will never receive the
[1:42:47] Holy Ghost baptism. You can be a good
[1:42:49] awesome religious person, go to church,
[1:42:51] whatever church you want to go, but for
[1:42:53] you to be born again,
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; to have Christ on the inside, you have
[1:42:57] to come by the way Christ has allotted
[1:42:59] for you. Amen. Sometime people don't
[1:43:01] know who the pro prophet of God is.
[1:43:03] Prophet is God in flesh. Amen. H it was
[1:43:07] said in uh back in the time of the
[1:43:10] prophet there was an African uh African
[1:43:14] president he wasn't a president then but
[1:43:16] he was a student he went to high school
[1:43:18] here in the university I think wuba
[1:43:20] force university for school in Ohio he
[1:43:23] was sponsored to go to high school here
[1:43:24] he went to college to study medicine h
[1:43:27] the man I'm trying to find his name I
[1:43:29] think it's called kamuzu
[1:43:32] uh where's brother brother Simba do you
[1:43:35] know the the president that gain
[1:43:37] independence from Malawi.
[1:43:39] Okay. Right. I I have I have his name
[1:43:42] somewhere. He's called Kamu Zubanda.
[1:43:44] It's called Hastings Kamuanda. Anyway,
[1:43:46] so this president got to be at Abraham's
[1:43:49] meetings when he was a student in the
[1:43:51] United States. He was in Ohio. He was in
[1:43:54] Indiana. He went to medical school in
[1:43:56] Tennessee. He went to college in
[1:43:58] Chicago. So he was in some of the
[1:44:00] programs meeting and later he went back
[1:44:02] to Malawi to become a president. He
[1:44:03] helped gain independence. And there was
[1:44:05] a time there was persecution against the
[1:44:07] Messi believers. When you go to Africa
[1:44:09] and most of the country they call
[1:44:10] believers braites and this is
[1:44:12] Abrahamress that's what they call they
[1:44:14] call it oh you are a Brahhamite you are
[1:44:15] bra that's what they call the believers
[1:44:17] anyway. So it came before they were in
[1:44:19] schools they have their culture just
[1:44:20] like here they do sports and the girls
[1:44:23] wear shorts and things like that. So the
[1:44:25] believer said no we're not going to
[1:44:26] allow our daughters and sons to wear
[1:44:28] dress that way to do those not just
[1:44:30] sports but culture where they have to
[1:44:32] display they have to dance certain
[1:44:34] things that is ungodly no it's not going
[1:44:35] to happen and so it became an issue with
[1:44:38] the government and things like that so
[1:44:40] it came before the president and
[1:44:42] president says no who are those people
[1:44:43] and they said those are the brahham they
[1:44:45] don't want to do sport they don't want
[1:44:46] to do do drama cultural and things like
[1:44:48] that and the president said no leave
[1:44:50] those people alone
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; don't force them to do nothing because
[1:44:56] he wasn't even a believer but the
[1:44:58] meetings in Abraham influenced his life
[1:45:00] and even his president said no for those
[1:45:02] people leave them alone don't touch them
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; they are my people don't touch them
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; leave them if they don't want to do
[1:45:08] sport they don't want to dance and strip
[1:45:10] themselves just leave them alone and it
[1:45:12] was said that the president had to
[1:45:14] censor every movie that comes to the
[1:45:16] country he doesn't even allow if there's
[1:45:18] even a kissing in the movie no
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; it has to be blank it has to be edited
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; wow
[1:45:24] It doesn't allow women to wear uh skirts
[1:45:27] below their word above their knees.
[1:45:29] Uh-huh.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; The only time women can wear skirts
[1:45:31] above their knees is when they are in
[1:45:33] club where they are not in but in public
[1:45:36] a woman is not allowed to wear shorts
[1:45:38] sorry skirts that is that is is what
[1:45:41] above the knee it should be below the
[1:45:44] knee
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; that was a present he wasn't a religious
[1:45:46] person
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; but even the meeting the prophet
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; seeing Christ not in William's
[1:45:51] personality no but seeing Christ Jesus
[1:45:54] being displayed
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; in William's ministry he saw that this
[1:45:58] man is has God a a is a man of God.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; How can you say that that man is an is a
[1:46:03] devil?
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; That man is a deceiver.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; No, you have your God has to open your
[1:46:08] eyes.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; You need a change. Then change.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; If you change, you see God as he is.
[1:46:14] Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Let me read. I have only one quote.
[1:46:17] Let's go to the quotes and read it. Oh
[1:46:20] yeah, I met some of them. Jesus changed
[1:46:22] the temple of Solomon. Let me just go
[1:46:25] back to the the six dimension. The woman
[1:46:27] at the wall. Jesus changed the harvest
[1:46:29] of corn and wine to harvest of souls of
[1:46:32] men. Amen.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus brought a drastic change in his in
[1:46:36] the ministry. The law of Moses was
[1:46:38] accomplished. But the people talk about
[1:46:40] law harvesting corn. But Jesus said that
[1:46:43] you are Peter, you're going to be the
[1:46:45] what? You are going to harvest souls.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; He changed fishing from fishes of fish
[1:46:49] to what? Fishes of men and women to
[1:46:52] catch them for the kingdom of God.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus changed the temple of Solomon to
[1:46:56] his own body. He said the time has come
[1:46:59] that they that worship God will not go
[1:47:01] to temple of Solomon but they that
[1:47:03] worship God will worship him in truth
[1:47:06] and in spirit
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; and that's where we are and that's where
[1:47:09] brother Jack God gave him the vision to
[1:47:11] call the tabernacle the spirit of truth
[1:47:13] and spirit the spirit of uh the
[1:47:14] tabernacle of truth and spirit
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; I think I'm just jumbling it up you know
[1:47:18] it
[1:47:21] so that when you are preaching your
[1:47:22] brain goes at a frequency way beyond so
[1:47:24] that that is a god we don't worship God
[1:47:27] in temple in in temples here we
[1:47:30] congregate
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; but the worship
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; is in your heart
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; the spirit of truth
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the spirit of Christ
[1:47:37] in your heart the truth of the word of
[1:47:39] the lord and the holy ghost in that
[1:47:41] truth
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; that is where we worship the lord
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; glory hallelujah Jesus met a man that
[1:47:45] was impotent and the man tried for 38
[1:47:49] years whenever God sent angel every year
[1:47:52] to come and kind of well the water and
[1:47:55] whoever jumps into the water is whatever
[1:47:57] sickness, cancer, HIV and whatever stage
[1:48:00] four cancer, it doesn't matter.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; You're going to be healed instantly.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And this man is impotent kind of
[1:48:05] wickedness in his feet. And each time
[1:48:08] the angel comes, he tries to go there.
[1:48:10] Somebody goes ahead of him for 38 years.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Will you do that? You might have given
[1:48:16] up. I would have given up. But this man
[1:48:18] kept going
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; and one day he met the man himself
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; that sent the angel every year.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Of course, he didn't know
[1:48:25] that was the man. He was an ordinary
[1:48:27] man. But Ram said he was like a he
[1:48:29] wasn't even 6 foot. He was 57, 56
[1:48:32] somewhere. A very lanky fella because he
[1:48:35] was fasting all the time. He doesn't eat
[1:48:36] much. And he met this man and he said,
[1:48:39] "Do you want to be made whole?" said,
[1:48:40] "Well," he started narrating his story.
[1:48:42] Well, for 38 years, I've tried all the
[1:48:44] time, you know, God since Jehovah sends
[1:48:47] angel to to kind of shake the water and
[1:48:49] I try to go and somebody goes ahead of
[1:48:51] me. Jesus said, "Do you want to be made
[1:48:54] whole?" I'm not interested in your past.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; God doesn't care about your past.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care about your mistakes,
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; your failures,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; then change. He want to give you the
[1:49:04] change.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; So your past because you fail. That's
[1:49:06] why he's here to give you the change.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; So you respond to the changes given to
[1:49:10] you.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Like Mary, let it be according to
[1:49:12] according to your word. Like the woman
[1:49:14] of Samaria, Lord, give me this water to
[1:49:16] drink. Like he did right. You've said
[1:49:18] the right thing. And when you say the
[1:49:20] right thing, the word will come to you.
[1:49:22] And now the man begin to cut the
[1:49:23] revelation and said I want to be made
[1:49:25] whole. Said now stand up and walk.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; You don't need to go wash us go to the
[1:49:28] poor anymore.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Sometime God will cut the processes.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; We are human beings. We reason.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; We have imaginations.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; We have memory. We have affection. And
[1:49:40] that is sometimes that that bring
[1:49:42] limitation.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; There's three kings, five kings in the
[1:49:46] flesh. Seeing, hearing, tasting,
[1:49:49] smelling, and what? Uh the fifth one I
[1:49:52] remember.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Feeling that's the five kings of the
[1:49:55] Amorite and dub side. We need to kill
[1:49:58] those five kings.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; And other five kings that is what?
[1:50:02] Memory, affection, reason, imagination,
[1:50:05] and conscience. We have to kill those
[1:50:07] five kings as well.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz that five kings will lay you where
[1:50:10] you are.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; And you're going to try whipping the
[1:50:13] dead horse. try to get a dead horse to
[1:50:15] to rise up and and and gallop with you.
[1:50:17] No, it's not going to happen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; But there's 11th king.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; That is the fifth king. That is king
[1:50:22] Jesus Christ.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; King faith, king belief,
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; king, all things are possible.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; That is the king that you have to
[1:50:29] resurrect in your heart.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; And when you believe that king, nothing
[1:50:33] shall be possible with you. Amen.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; And Jesus has to bring this man from all
[1:50:37] the 38 years of failures to know that
[1:50:40] this is another age.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; This another season. This is a blessing
[1:50:43] for you. God is doing new things in your
[1:50:45] life and the man got his his health the
[1:50:48] way he wanted begin to walk. Amen.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; What do you need in your life? My
[1:50:52] brother, my sister that the Lord can't
[1:50:54] do for you.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Let's read the last quotes. We just
[1:50:57] coming to an end. uh 19 future home of
[1:51:00] the heavenly bridegroom and earthly
[1:51:02] bride 640802
[1:51:05] paragraph 525
[1:51:07] but went through changes too in his
[1:51:09] ministry he said I rec I recognize the
[1:51:12] divine presence of the being of Christ
[1:51:13] who is the word and the bible said that
[1:51:15] the word is powerful than two-edged
[1:51:17] sword and it cuts to the marrow of the
[1:51:20] bone and descend the thought that is in
[1:51:22] the heart revealing the secret of heart
[1:51:24] look why I didn't know those things
[1:51:28] years ago go and when I said it not
[1:51:30] knowing it look like look what he's done
[1:51:33] he said now you take the people by the
[1:51:36] hand and don't think nothing
[1:51:39] just speak what attribute is told you
[1:51:43] say it it's a tumor whatever it is then
[1:51:46] said it will come to pass that you have
[1:51:49] to do that see it will discern the very
[1:51:52] thing that is in them amen and of course
[1:51:55] he talk about he said now we had all
[1:51:57] kinds of impersonations. We know that
[1:51:59] almost to deceive the elect if it's
[1:52:01] possible. Watch how the rest of the
[1:52:02] things goes with the word. Then you'll
[1:52:05] know whether it's right or not. But
[1:52:06] still Jesus Christ remains the same
[1:52:09] yesterday, today and forever more. Amen.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Abraham had to go through changes.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; What is the change? When the Lord called
[1:52:15] him, angel of the Lord told him, go and
[1:52:17] pray for the people of the world. You
[1:52:19] hold them with your hands, I think left
[1:52:21] or right hand, and you see a vibration,
[1:52:23] your hand will swell. And if it's
[1:52:25] infection, let's say bacterial
[1:52:27] infection, HIV, you'll be able to tell
[1:52:29] them what is going on in their life. But
[1:52:31] God move him to another step further. He
[1:52:34] said, "Now I'm not going to tell you
[1:52:36] nothing. Before then, you will see a
[1:52:37] vision. You see the the clothes that you
[1:52:40] wearing, a brother wearing a checker
[1:52:42] shirt, a sister wearing this dress, and
[1:52:44] everything before he goes to the
[1:52:45] meeting." That's right.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Even those who were opposing him, the
[1:52:47] Lord reveal everything to him.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And he know their names, what they were
[1:52:52] thinking. the secret meeting. They were
[1:52:53] trying to destroy his meeting. He know
[1:52:54] everything.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; But there was a time God said, "I know.
[1:52:58] I'm not going to show you no vision.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; You're just going to go there blank
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; blank slate. No vision. You don't know
[1:53:05] ahead of time." And when you go,
[1:53:07] whatever comes out of your heart.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; If it's tumor, just say tumor and bring
[1:53:11] the tumor demon out of their life. If
[1:53:13] it's HIV, if it's cancer, just say it
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Some it will tell you. In other words,
[1:53:18] the pill of fire will tell without you
[1:53:19] having a proud vision. That's right.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; And sometime the Lord will want
[1:53:22] circumstances to be dressed right,
[1:53:25] dressed right, just right. But God
[1:53:27] doesn't need circumstances. He need your
[1:53:29] faith.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Just like you run a prophet through
[1:53:32] certain things, God will place things
[1:53:34] everything for you to get it. Certain
[1:53:35] times he just want to go blank faith
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; and just believe
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; and brother that pleases the Lord more
[1:53:41] than God make things comfortable for us.
[1:53:43] Amen.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Even our ministry, the Lord brings
[1:53:46] certain things like it feels so
[1:53:48] challenging. How can I do this, Lord?
[1:53:50] But just move. And as you move, the Lord
[1:53:53] bring things to pass.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; By faith, we have the church already.
[1:53:57] Amen.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; This is also a transition. Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; And it shall come to pass. Amen.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; The church is sitting somewhere. Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Whether it's a brand new church or
[1:54:08] something going to buy and remote, it is
[1:54:11] still there. Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever you believe, speak it and just
[1:54:15] rejoice.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about circumstances. Amen.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; God is just bringing changes from today
[1:54:22] when I was driving I drove I was
[1:54:24] thinking do I go through Okchobee? I
[1:54:26] said no let me go through uh what they
[1:54:28] call the other way Jag road. So I went
[1:54:30] through he look at the old church and
[1:54:33] drove through the school look at the
[1:54:35] school and drove through here

[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; I came here when when when when closed
[1:54:43] the dollar shop right he hill
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; and now then to the school
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; and now here

[1:54:50] final final place
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; it's relaxing and comfortable thank God
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; way better than the school
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; all right
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; we don't have to park and things like
[1:54:58] that
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; but yes sir it is not our own place
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; you don't you don't have
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; the full control amen
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; when God gives something to you
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; all It's for you, brother Jack. Amen.
[1:55:11] It's for you, sister Erica. Sister
[1:55:12] Sarah, Sister Cab.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Xavier, it's for you.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somi is for you.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Nemiah is for you.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; And you said, "The Lord gave me brother
[1:55:22] Nehemiah
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; and nobody can take it from me."
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; But we can't. God didn't give it to you.
[1:55:28] You are the preacher, but God gave me
[1:55:29] better than Nehemiah. It's mine.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And it's mine and mine. Amen.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; When God gives something to you, it's
[1:55:37] for you.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil cannot take the
[1:55:39] blessing from you.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; You can even sleep and God will come and
[1:55:43] wake you up and say, "My daughter, take
[1:55:45] this your blessing."
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; You can wake up and the Lord, you check
[1:55:50] an email. Where's this email coming
[1:55:51] from? Where's this money coming from?
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; H this doesn't is not real.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; It doesn't look to be real.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; There was one time I had a amount of
[1:56:00] money in my in my account and I used to
[1:56:02] say with H Bank of America and I saw the
[1:56:06] money. I said, "No, this not real. I
[1:56:09] have to go to the bank." I didn't even
[1:56:10] drive. I said, "Bank of America is right
[1:56:12] here. I'll just run and go and check to
[1:56:14] see if this money is for real." And I
[1:56:17] went and the money was for real. I said,
[1:56:19] "Glory, hallelujah to the Lord."
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; God will give you what what what is for
[1:56:23] you.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; And it's not the money that I desire,
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; but it was meant for me. So God
[1:56:28] impressed upon a friend. This friend
[1:56:30] wouldn't let me. So like, "Go get it. Go
[1:56:32] get it." I said, "No, it's it's pass.
[1:56:33] It's pass." He pushed me to lie. I
[1:56:35] couldn't rest
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; and I had the money drop in my account.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; God will give it to what belongs to you.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; He's interested in your affairs.
[1:56:46] Everything about you, God is interested.
[1:56:47] The little things and the big things,
[1:56:49] he's interested in you.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Just change. Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; I think we are the last but one slide.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Oh, that's the last slide.
[1:56:58] Slide 10. Something like that. I hope I
[1:57:00] didn't miss nothing. You are changed.
[1:57:03] Amen. You are changed into the sun as
[1:57:06] the brother had a vision from a blizzard
[1:57:10] doesn't know where he's going to be and
[1:57:12] the prophet led him go through the
[1:57:14] processes four-legged in life you go
[1:57:16] through the where visions and dreams are
[1:57:18] symbols in life you go through certain
[1:57:21] stages go through the school room come
[1:57:23] to the tabernacle but God got your
[1:57:25] church by the jack for you
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; where you you feel the most comfortable
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; to pastor the congregation of the Lord
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; where you don't feel hindered you don't
[1:57:33] have to pack rush and
[1:57:34] where you can have meetings and invite
[1:57:36] people from all around to come and enjoy
[1:57:37] the goodness of the Lord. Amen. So we
[1:57:40] are changed into the image of the son of
[1:57:41] God. You are a son of God. You are a
[1:57:43] daughter of God. All the blessing is for
[1:57:45] you. You are born to be a ruler. Where
[1:57:48] do we rule? You rule as a son and
[1:57:50] daughter on this earth.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Who was the God of this earth? Adam.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Adam and his wife. They were all Adam.

[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; They were ruling the earth.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; The animals. God didn't say, "I'm the
[1:58:02] god of this earth. Are you my son?
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; You are the God of this earth.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; God has made you a god of this earth.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; In your home.

[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; You are the one. Your blessings go
[1:58:15] around the people. They may not know it.
[1:58:17] They will not recognize it. But you are
[1:58:18] the one that bring blessing around them.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; And God take us through transformations
[1:58:23] from calling us elected seed to be a
[1:58:26] bride. And then he marries you and give
[1:58:28] you the Holy Ghost baptism and put a
[1:58:30] wedding ring the token on you.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; All right. And then you go into a queen,
[1:58:34] a king and a ruler. And only eagles can

[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:57] Certainly appreciate the word of the
[2:02:59] Lord. Uh on today,
[2:03:03] Brother Quu was uh talking about uh not
[2:03:08] trying to revive a dead horse
[2:03:11] and uh took me back in my mind on on um
[2:03:17] man
[2:03:20] changed, you know, that that that took
[2:03:22] place for me um when we started Spirit
[2:03:24] and Truth Tabernacle. And uh I remember
[2:03:29] going to school one weekend and I I I
[2:03:32] didn't want to go to school because it
[2:03:33] was a Friday, Saturday, Sunday uh class
[2:03:36] and I say I I don't want to miss church,
[2:03:38] you know. I I I I I really don't want to
[2:03:41] do this. But it was in order to graduate
[2:03:43] I had to take this class. So you know I
[2:03:45] went and uh and I believe um they
[2:03:48] required us to read a book and only book
[2:03:51] I like reading is the Bible. Uh, but we
[2:03:54] had to read this book and I say, "I'm a
[2:03:57] right to get through class. I got to I
[2:03:58] got to do this." And I remember reading
[2:04:00] a book and recently, you know, I was at
[2:04:03] the house and going through my office
[2:04:06] doing some cleaning and I and I and I
[2:04:08] saw a report that I wrote on that book
[2:04:11] and I reread that report and I was like,
[2:04:13] "Oh my goodness." Um, looking back
[2:04:16] 20some years and to see the change that
[2:04:20] took place. But the name of the book was
[2:04:23] Who Moved My Cheese?
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; And and if you have if you have if
[2:04:29] you're a person that that that
[2:04:32] uh is in a season of change, it's a good
[2:04:37] book for you to read. Who Moved My
[2:04:40] Cheese? And uh and and now cuz cheese
[2:04:44] was something different for everybody.
[2:04:48] uh like what brother Quaker was just
[2:04:50] saying that he was in a particular job
[2:04:53] certified but like God got more for me
[2:04:58] than this right here. So his cheese was
[2:05:01] moving,
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; right? And he had to realize in order to
[2:05:05] get more, you got to leave that
[2:05:07] situation.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; You you have to be willing to make
[2:05:14] changes
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; if you want more from God.
[2:05:18] Right. And and and sometimes God will
[2:05:20] put you in a situation he stirs you up
[2:05:23] just a little bit, makes things a bit
[2:05:25] uncomfortable.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I I know we got We're
[2:05:30] running out of time, but I I feel like
[2:05:32] sometimes it's the it's the mother eagle
[2:05:35] making the little eiglets feel a little
[2:05:38] bit uncomfortable inside the nest. And
[2:05:41] sometimes when it's time to make change,
[2:05:45] she takes the eaglets out and she drops
[2:05:47] them for their first flight. And if they
[2:05:51] have the instinct on the inside to just
[2:05:54] stretch those wings out and begin to
[2:05:56] soar, then she know, okay, they got
[2:05:58] they're doing exactly what they're
[2:05:59] supposed to do. But if they don't have
[2:06:01] that and they begin to tumble and fall
[2:06:02] and do all kind of other things, she
[2:06:04] would she grab one with a claw. She'll
[2:06:07] grab another one with a bead and she'll
[2:06:10] make sure they get back to safety, you
[2:06:12] know. But she said, "Now look, you were
[2:06:13] born to be eagles. And at some point in
[2:06:16] time, you going to have to use what God
[2:06:19] gave you,
[2:06:21] but you got to be willing to make
[2:06:23] change."
[2:06:25] Hey,
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; that who moved my cheese
[2:06:32] changed my mentality.
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; And and from that book, I'm telling you,
[2:06:38] that was the seeds of Spirit and Truth
[2:06:40] Tabernacle being birthed.
[2:06:43] From that little book, God knows how to
[2:06:46] do things.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I I appreciate the word
[2:06:50] of the Lord on today. This was this was
[2:06:53] for me.
[2:06:56] This was for me.
[2:06:58] [Applause]
[2:06:59] Let me just have a word of prayer. We
[2:07:01] have to
[2:07:03] make a change.
[2:07:07] I receive what brother Quu said. This is
[2:07:09] just part of the journey. It's part of
[2:07:12] our story for his glory. Let's pray.
[2:07:16] Father, we thank you.
[2:07:19] Thank you for your servant just getting
[2:07:21] himself out of the way and allowing you
[2:07:23] to use him to speak to our hearts.
[2:07:27] We have been blessed
[2:07:30] by your word.
[2:07:32] And father, we are
[2:07:35] declaring that we will be all that you
[2:07:38] have called us to be.
[2:07:41] Our hearts say yes. Our will says yes,
[2:07:43] our mouth says yes. And as brother Quin
[2:07:46] says, say we're millionaires. I I I
[2:07:49] claim that I'm a millionaire.
[2:07:52] I I I'm speaking it. That's that's who I
[2:07:54] am because that's what you got for me,
[2:07:57] Lord.
[2:07:58] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:08:01] Lord, I I pray your blessings upon the
[2:08:03] saints as they prepare to leave
[2:08:06] this place, but not your presence. Give
[2:08:08] traveling mercies to everyone as they go
[2:08:11] and bring us back at the appointed time
[2:08:12] on Wednesday night.
[2:08:14] meet us once more is our prayer. Ask
[2:08:17] that you would cover each one and God
[2:08:20] that you would give them God ideas,
[2:08:22] Lord, that they would be able to go
[2:08:24] forth and accept this change, Lord, that
[2:08:27] is that is that is coming upon us.
[2:08:29] Father, there's you're you're moving and
[2:08:32] Lord, we want to be sensitive to the
[2:08:33] move of the spirit.
[2:08:36] Pray your blessings upon each heart,
[2:08:37] Father, is our prayer. In Jesus name we
[2:08:41] pray. Amen.
[2:08:44] Amen.
[2:08:46] I I was also going to mention, you know,
[2:08:47] one of the other changes we got today is
[2:08:49] we added a third camera. Uh so they're
[2:08:52] going to be able to pick up the audience
[2:08:54] from the front now. It's changes
[2:08:56] happening all around you.
[2:08:59] We thank God for all things. God bless
[2:09:01] you. The brothers will dismiss you at
[2:09:03] this time.
[2:09:05] I'll say yes.
[2:09:09] Oh Lord,
[2:09:12] I grieve my desire.
[2:09:18] Passion
[2:09:21] is
[2:09:23] to be what you call me to be.
[2:09:31] That's what I need.
[2:09:34] [Music]
[2:09:37] Oh,
[2:09:40] I will be what you call me to be.
[2:09:47] Oh Jesus, I'll see it.
[2:09:54] Lord, I agree. My desire.
[2:10:01] All that need is to be
[2:10:08] where you call me to be
[2:10:12] and that's what I will be.
[2:10:19] Yes.
[2:10:21] I will be
[2:10:24] what you call me to be.
[2:10:30] I say yes.
[2:10:33] Oh
[2:10:36] Lord, I agree. My desire.
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:48] I'll be want to be. I will be.
[2:10:53] Hey,
[2:10:54] that's where I will be.
[2:10:57] [Music]
