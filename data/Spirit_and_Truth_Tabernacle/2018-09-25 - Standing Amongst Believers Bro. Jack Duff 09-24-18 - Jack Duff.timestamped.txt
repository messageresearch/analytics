[46:41] times where we look down and the
[46:43] footprints of the sands of time there
[46:46] are times we see two scents of
[46:48] footprints and there's other times we
[46:49] see one set and the question was asked
[46:51] why is there one set of prints the
[46:56] answer was given that's the time that
[46:58] I'm carrying you so Lord we pray that
[47:01] you would carry them through the season

[47:05] strength that you'd be there their help

[47:17] ones as well but we pray God that you
[47:19] give each one strength that you continue
[47:23] to turn our mourning into dancing
[47:25] knowing someday we will reunite again
[47:28] never to depart from one another so

[54:43] man and it's always good to come to
[54:45] church and feel the presence of God a
[54:47] man here in John chapter 6 starting at
[54:54] verse 60 it reads as follows says many
[55:01] therefore of his disciples when they
[55:06] heard this said this is a hard saying
[55:11] who can hear it when Jesus knew in
[55:17] himself that his disciples murmured at
[55:21] it you said unto them doth this offend
[55:26] you what if ye shall see the Son of man
[55:30] to stand up where he was before it is a
[55:35] spirit that quickeneth and the flesh
[55:39] profiteth nothing the words that I speak
[55:42] unto you they are spirit and they are
[55:46] life in other words if I could just use
[55:50] modern-day terminology if you can shadow
[55:55] the song you can also shout over the
[55:59] word
[56:01] the words that I speak unto you they are
[56:04] spirit and they are life
[56:05] [Music]
[56:08] but there are some of you notice Jesus
[56:13] talking to this crowd of people but
[56:16] there are some of you that mean they
[56:18] were in church they this one the first
[56:22] time they work visitors these were
[56:25] regular churchgoers right they went to
[56:28] church all the time and Jesus makes this
[56:32] statement in his own church says but
[56:36] there are some of you that believe not
[56:44] for jesus knew from the beginning who
[56:48] they were that believed not and who
[56:51] should betray him and and i want to kind
[56:56] of you just clarify and that one verse
[57:00] there were actually let me put it this
[57:04] way and in that one verse three groups
[57:08] of believers were identified all right
[57:15] three three groups one that just
[57:18] believed anything and everything jesus
[57:20] said the others that believe not that's
[57:24] what we would call unbelievers but then
[57:27] there was a one that would betray him
[57:29] that's what we call make believers reign
[57:33] a man from this text from these
[57:37] scriptures brother Branham drew the the
[57:39] thought of three kinds of believers
[57:42] let's keep on reading it says and he
[57:47] said therefore said I unto you that no
[57:49] man can come unto me except it were
[57:51] given unto Him of my father from that
[57:56] time after that service many of his
[58:01] disciples I'm talk about people you
[58:03] thought was believed us many of his
[58:06] disciples people that used to follow him
[58:08] that that that that that was suck their
[58:11] denominational background too
[58:13] except what Jesus was teaching says from
[58:15] that time many of his disciples went
[58:17] back and walked no more with him then
[58:24] said Jesus unto the twelve now this is
[58:26] tough after seeing all these people go
[58:30] look at what Jesus does then said Jesus
[58:34] unto the twelve will ye also go away
[58:39] then Simon Peter answered him Lord to
[58:43] whom shall we go thou hast the words of
[58:49] eternal life and we believe in and I
[58:53] love this we believe we believe and are
[58:57] sure I love Peter he always found
[59:10] himself in trouble a lot of times but
[59:12] but but but he just said remarkable
[59:15] things at the right time right he said
[59:18] say we believe them and and and we are
[59:21] we are sure this extra question are you
[59:26] sure about this thing are you sure about
[59:29] the message of the hour
[59:31] are you sure God sent a prophet are you
[59:36] sure huh glory to God glory to God amen
[59:41] I want to bring it into today's turn so
[59:44] since they said we believe in our sure
[59:46] that thou art that Christ not just not
[59:51] cuz because Christ being anointed one
[59:53] right there's there's there's even many
[59:55] false Christ's but but we need to know
[59:58] who is that Christ that thou art that
[1:00:02] Christ the Son of the Living God jesus
[1:00:07] answered and after this powerful
[1:00:08] revelation from Peter powerful statement
[1:00:13] jesus answered them have not I chosen I
[1:00:20] mean I specifically picked you out have
[1:00:26] not I chosen you twelve and one of you I
[1:00:33] picked you
[1:00:43] want to use a devil
[1:00:52] he spake of judas iscariot and he didn't
[1:00:54] identify them but you know now you know
[1:00:57] see john could pick this up after Judas
[1:00:59] did what he did
[1:01:00] Oh Lord y'all y'all that one went right
[1:01:02] over y'all here John picked it up after
[1:01:07] Judas did what he did and some things
[1:01:11] you ain't gonna be able to pick up until
[1:01:14] certain things are done all right let me
[1:01:21] let me just read the rest of this and
[1:01:22] I'm gonna let y'all be seated he spake
[1:01:24] of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for
[1:01:27] he it was that should betray him being
[1:01:30] one of the twelve the Lord had a
[1:01:33] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:01:35] may be seated
[1:01:43] there's a there's a lot in here that we
[1:01:47] hope to address if if the Lord would
[1:01:49] allow us I want to use for our subject
[1:01:54] today standing amongst believers man
[1:02:01] believers that that's just that's where
[1:02:03] I feel like I am I you know we could see
[1:02:09] just by reading that Scripture and I
[1:02:12] told you brother branham used this
[1:02:14] particular passage of Scripture when he
[1:02:17] preached the sermon three kinds of
[1:02:19] believers and and notice I mean he's
[1:02:22] using I mean just a title of sermon
[1:02:24] there are believers right but there's
[1:02:26] there's three kinds of them he says
[1:02:29] there's their true believer a man there
[1:02:32] is the make believer and there's the
[1:02:34] unbeliever now they all were here a man
[1:02:38] in service on this day they all had
[1:02:42] experience you know just the mighty move
[1:02:47] of the Spirit of God they all rejoiced
[1:02:51] they all shouted you know even some of
[1:02:54] these folk at some point in time
[1:02:56] underneath the influence of Jesus
[1:02:59] ministry cast out devils right I mean
[1:03:03] they cast out devils and and
[1:03:05] come back rejoicing hi Devils were
[1:03:08] subject to them and this this this is
[1:03:11] the reason Jesus had to stop them in the
[1:03:15] midst of their rejoicing because
[1:03:17] unbelievers was casting out Devils right
[1:03:20] made believers was casting out Devils
[1:03:22] but Jesus had to stop them saying I
[1:03:25] don't rejoice because Devils are subject
[1:03:28] to you and and I love that I love that
[1:03:30] because what he's trying to get us to
[1:03:31] see is that you know it's one thing a
[1:03:34] man to see a manifestation of God but
[1:03:37] it's a whole nother thing to be able to
[1:03:40] take the Word of God
[1:03:41] oh and oftentimes we get caught up
[1:03:45] because if we see a manifestation they
[1:03:47] must be of God but Jesus stopped and
[1:03:50] said don't rejoice because Devils are
[1:03:52] subject to you but it's a rejoice
[1:03:55] because your name is actually written in
[1:03:59] the Lamb's Book of Life right and see
[1:04:02] what I ought to bring you amen a true
[1:04:06] joy amen a true shout it's when you see
[1:04:10] your name Amen that that better I'm not
[1:04:13] not when you hear your favorite song
[1:04:16] Amen that just moves your emotion but
[1:04:20] then you see your name Amen in the book
[1:04:24] then that should bring joy unspeakable
[1:04:26] and full of glory here we have this
[1:04:33] because you know we didn't read the
[1:04:35] scriptures Amen before this and I know
[1:04:39] many of you are Bible readers you
[1:04:40] already know what happened but for those
[1:04:41] that maybe have not heard the story
[1:04:44] before let me just explain Jesus
[1:04:47] teaching amen and he was saying some
[1:04:50] really really hard things a man some
[1:04:55] really really hard things and I need
[1:04:59] y'all to understand that the things that
[1:05:01] he was saying where it's actually
[1:05:02] intentional that might shake a few
[1:05:08] people but but these things were
[1:05:10] intentional in order to shake down the
[1:05:12] church to see who really was believers
[1:05:15] and who was not believers cannot cannot
[1:05:18] can I tell you something
[1:05:19] hallelujah you may look around the
[1:05:22] audience today you might you might look
[1:05:24] at a bit believer a man based on they
[1:05:27] dress and you might find out that you
[1:05:31] absolutely wrong because some folk know
[1:05:33] how to dress the park huh some people
[1:05:37] know they know they like they they know
[1:05:38] just how to do things in church to make
[1:05:41] it seem like they believers but
[1:05:43] sometimes God will do things
[1:05:45] intentionally to shake down the crowd to
[1:05:50] see you gonna be holding on at the end
[1:05:52] when the dust settles right
[1:05:58] I'm not win the time we go we gonna do
[1:06:00] something
[1:06:01] throw some dust up in the air but
[1:06:03] wouldn't the dust paddles we go see
[1:06:07] who's still stand-in let me put it this
[1:06:12] way when the trial is over when the
[1:06:17] tests test a man has reached its final
[1:06:20] point we're gonna see who still standing
[1:06:22] then because we don't realize it but
[1:06:26] we're heading into the final test right
[1:06:28] now some of us are experiencing it but
[1:06:31] we don't see you it was a real believer
[1:06:33] I was you know there's just this little
[1:06:36] quote that the Prophet you know made in
[1:06:38] and I don't I won't read it but he was
[1:06:40] making a statement about joke and he
[1:06:43] says how Joe the trial that Joe had
[1:06:47] wasn't just losing his family losing his
[1:06:51] animals and losing a lot of things that
[1:06:53] he owned that that won the real thing
[1:06:55] but what the real trial was it was the
[1:06:59] devil trying to convince Joe that God
[1:07:05] was punishing him for what he did that
[1:07:10] was a real trial it was the devil trying
[1:07:13] to convince you know you got you gotta
[1:07:16] catch this because the way he tried to
[1:07:18] convince joke is he used job's friends
[1:07:22] the ones that was closest to him Oh
[1:07:26] y'all in Whitley
[1:07:28] but the ones that was closest to him he
[1:07:32] was using dimly try to convince joke
[1:07:35] that God had forsaken him because
[1:07:37] something Joe had did but when John had
[1:07:41] overcome in power where is to realize
[1:07:43] that this didn't come from God this is
[1:07:46] coming from the devil and when he caught
[1:07:50] the revelation on my mind that's why you
[1:07:52] can say things like you know though we
[1:07:53] don't though though these skin warms
[1:07:56] skin worms destroy my flesh he say yet
[1:08:00] in this same flesh I shall see God huh
[1:08:05] he caught a revelation of his God in the
[1:08:08] midst of the trial and you gonna need to
[1:08:10] catch a revelation of your God in the
[1:08:13] midst of your trial Jesus told them
[1:08:17] don't rejoice you know because of the
[1:08:20] the mighty me should expect it but don't
[1:08:26] just stop there rejoice don't rejoice
[1:08:28] because it's your favorite song but
[1:08:30] we're just because your name is written
[1:08:32] now you know what happened here in this
[1:08:34] service if I could just you always just
[1:08:38] bear with me I want to read just a
[1:08:40] little bit for you we can kind of catch
[1:08:42] up a man what happened here in this
[1:08:44] church service this day here in John
[1:08:47] sticks amen
[1:08:51] hallelujah verse 44 let's pick it up
[1:08:55] there Jesus makes this come and says no
[1:08:59] man can come to me except the Father
[1:09:03] which hath sent me draw him and I will
[1:09:07] raise him up at the last day it is
[1:09:10] written in the prophets and they shall
[1:09:13] be all taught of God every man therefore
[1:09:16] that had heard and hath learned of the
[1:09:19] Father cometh unto me not that any man
[1:09:22] hath seen the father save he which is of
[1:09:25] God he hath seen the father says verily
[1:09:30] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[1:09:33] on me hath everlasting life and look at
[1:09:38] the words of Jesus a I
[1:09:40] I am I am that bread of life these are
[1:09:45] powerful words that he's speaking of man
[1:09:46] stemming the earth and saying these
[1:09:48] things I am that bread of life and it
[1:09:51] goes a little further make sure they get
[1:09:52] an understanding your father's did eat
[1:09:54] manna in the wilderness and are dead
[1:09:58] right it says but this is the bread
[1:10:02] which cometh down from heaven and that a
[1:10:05] man may eat thereof and not die he says
[1:10:08] I am that living grant which came down
[1:10:12] from heaven Jesus has identified himself
[1:10:15] in a way that no man has ever identified
[1:10:17] himself amongst atchoo sand and you can
[1:10:20] imagine hearing a sermon like this for
[1:10:22] the first time they struggled with this
[1:10:25] who is this man that would say something
[1:10:27] like this you are the bread of life you
[1:10:30] and the bread that came down from duck
[1:10:31] how could you make comments like this
[1:10:33] and notice that says I am The Living
[1:10:37] bread which came down from heaven
[1:10:39] If any man eat of this print he shall
[1:10:42] live forever and the bread that I will
[1:10:45] give is my flesh which I will give for
[1:10:48] the life of the world oh my god amen now
[1:10:52] notice he said any man eat of this bread
[1:10:57] just can't eat whatever you want to eat
[1:10:59] and think you're gonna have life can I
[1:11:02] go a little further with that statement
[1:11:04] you just can't go to any denominational
[1:11:07] Church and thank you gosh I'm like you
[1:11:11] gotta eat this bread praise praise
[1:11:16] praise God you gotta eat this bread
[1:11:17] Jesus said hey man can you see God loves
[1:11:25] everybody he's certainly assessed he
[1:11:28] survived that's why he bring truth to
[1:11:29] him he loved him so much he brings truth
[1:11:34] I'm gonna let he'd get me even level a
[1:11:36] little bit more he put free moral agency
[1:11:40] God's love bit that his level I'll shoot
[1:11:46] a choose otherwise he can make you love
[1:11:50] them but let me like let me just help
[1:11:52] you understand if a man is married to
[1:11:54] one man gotta make the woman love him
[1:12:00] that ain't a real relationship hi if a
[1:12:03] woman is married to a man if the if the
[1:12:06] woman has to two things to make the male
[1:12:09] love huh that is not a revelation I mean
[1:12:12] a true relationship you can't do enough
[1:12:14] to make another person love you you
[1:12:18] can't do enough to make God love you be
[1:12:24] love to because because he just does
[1:12:28] nothing about eleven stop hey you're bad
[1:12:31] it's my based on your good is based on
[1:12:35] its little you see we have to you know
[1:12:49] Jesus has given them some things you got
[1:12:57] to read your Bible you got to read
[1:12:59] between the lines when you read your box
[1:13:01] yes right I mean Jesus gave very
[1:13:04] specific words unless you eat this right
[1:13:08] I mean there was other doctrines around
[1:13:11] yes but the Pharisees have a doctrine
[1:13:15] beside you see they also had a doctrine
[1:13:20] they they didn't believe in the
[1:13:23] resurrection right that's why they're
[1:13:26] sad you see
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:30] yes they did believe in the resurrection
[1:13:33] that was their doctrine and whatever the
[1:13:36] Pharisees believed that was their
[1:13:38] doctrine but jesus said unless you eat
[1:13:40] this brain if I can just yes they have
[1:13:45] back to suggest they have Pentecostal
[1:13:48] yes I think yes they have Episcopalian
[1:13:51] but except you eat this way let you eat
[1:14:03] this bread you won't have eternal life
[1:14:35] now we don't talk spiritual I mean it's
[1:14:40] okay we meet natural blessings but we're
[1:14:42] gonna turn this tank spiritual I said if
[1:14:45] you're willing to still away all the
[1:14:51] unbelief of this hour you can be if you
[1:15:00] still away man I'm talking my auntie she

[1:21:47] little bread which came down from heaven
[1:21:49] any man eat up this brick and I'm
[1:21:52] putting emphasis on that you can't just
[1:21:54] eat whatever bread you want deep and
[1:21:56] thank you you got either this bread he
[1:22:01] shall live forever and the bread that I
[1:22:03] will give is my flesh which I will give
[1:22:06] for the life of the world the Jews
[1:22:09] therefore strove among themselves saying
[1:22:12] how can this man give us his flesh to
[1:22:16] eat then jesus said to him barely barely
[1:22:20] I said to you except you eat the flesh
[1:22:22] of the son of man and drinking his blood
[1:22:25] he have no life in you right and if this
[1:22:29] is the heart heart sing he goes I'm sick
[1:22:32] whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:22:36] blood hath eternal life and I will raise
[1:22:39] him up at the last day but my flesh is
[1:22:43] meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
[1:22:47] he didn't eat my flesh and drinketh my
[1:22:50] blood dwelleth in me and I in him and as
[1:22:55] the living father have sent me and I
[1:22:58] live by the father so he that eateth me
[1:23:02] even he shall live by me this it is that
[1:23:09] bread which came down from heaven not as
[1:23:14] your father's did eat manna and our dead
[1:23:17] neither eat up this mystery
[1:23:41] right
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:28:02] that's good
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:37] even in the temple in the most holy
[1:29:40] place there was some hidden manna right
[1:29:43] but jesus said did you see
[1:31:33] many great men of God and healing
[1:31:36] campaigns
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:51] right what shake just people that
[1:32:54] believe the following that's what
[1:34:44] I'm coming back
[1:34:48] uh-huh
[1:34:49] it says but in the midst of all of it
[1:34:51] the river age never probably that have
[1:34:53] been or would be there's going to be a
[1:34:55] certain amount of people that's the main
[1:35:05] message yeah look at this
[1:35:10] those ignore the crops those see the
[1:35:15] bleed was making for the crops they
[1:35:18] ignore the criticism of the ugly we grow
[1:35:23] crops and we ignore they don't ignore
[1:35:31] the crowds they ignore the criticism of
[1:35:34] the unbeliever they have no argument
[1:35:37] with me
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:36:58] [Music]
[1:37:05] [Music]
[1:38:46] some better things
[1:38:56] all right we have now just help us to
[1:39:33] see that in the days of Noah there were
[1:39:36] believers believers right the believers
[1:39:43] was actually on the boat inside of the
[1:39:49] boom and when God shut the door to the
[1:39:52] ark and then they were already inside
[1:40:03] where the world can no longer get yes we
[1:40:07] need people for the world and the things
[1:40:10] of the world can no longer amen and your
[1:40:13] relationship right you don't you up you
[1:40:16] up action overcame those things in a
[1:40:18] relationship you have no situation not
[1:40:32] that you went looking for but we have to
[1:40:35] face that the situation you don't get
[1:40:37] overcome I think that you stole
[1:41:04] they were speaking that they can any
[1:41:45] based on Association
[1:41:53] why do I believe or make believer the
[1:41:56] that they could get into they are
[1:41:58] based on Association right they start
[1:42:02] because they know no one is a is a very
[1:42:12] time thing we got here like this open up
[1:42:18] the door and let us get him no no I work
[1:42:23] with giving the text and because of my
[1:42:25] association to Noah I know that I'll be
[1:42:29] able to get it I'm gonna end on the
[1:42:31] outside but women
[1:42:33] I just feel one I'm sorry if I feel one
[1:42:37] proper aid come out and we don't be
[1:42:40] alright because I have no base from
[1:42:47] there so she some people think they
[1:42:50] gonna make a rapture based on their
[1:42:51] association
[1:43:06] I want to know the same water that state
[1:43:12] no no I think no would have tried to
[1:43:23] open up to go here's the problem North
[1:43:26] didn't close we go
[1:43:31] oh no one closes it was God that closed
[1:43:39] the door
[1:43:39] and so you playing games about when you
[1:43:42] reject him and his message rejected God
[1:43:53] see unless you get Jesus said unless you
[1:43:55] eat this pray that I put it this way
[1:43:57] unless you get in this car huh I mean
[1:44:04] this this is very cool right I mean it's
[1:44:08] not oh you can do this you can do that
[1:44:10] no no no no unless you do a more
[1:44:14] like and let's take out an Noah's Ark
[1:44:17] they were not going to survive read the
[1:44:31] books no rapture oh brother Jack that's
[1:44:35] just too far okay try it
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:55] Braves alone amen amen amen
[1:44:59] all right so let me let me go in a
[1:45:00] little further I got some things I need
[1:45:03] to read now so we had unbelievers in
[1:45:05] those days they thought no was a fanatic
[1:45:07] crazy lost his mind they criticized him
[1:45:10] all the time you had to make believe our
[1:45:12] borderline believing that was thinking
[1:45:13] it could get in the arc by association
[1:45:15] Amen are through the kindness of North
[1:45:17] but you also had to believe it that was
[1:45:19] already inside the arc and not only was
[1:45:20] believers in your God had animals
[1:45:24] animals that believe starts in animals
[1:45:28] two by two don't mean if it was me I'm
[1:45:32] just saying if it's my backyard
[1:45:44] - elephant
[1:45:49] - lying till she
[1:46:01] and you see him going to know his boat
[1:46:03] you all you see all these everyone's
[1:46:05] going north Oh something out of click
[1:46:09] that God a man could be so concerned
[1:46:12] about animals that he would send animals
[1:46:15] to get in the boat but humans his
[1:46:18] greatest creation refused his message
[1:46:23] they just thought that I sleeping with
[1:46:26] you you want to know how many people
[1:46:28] want to get saved after California going
[1:46:36] we're watching the movie yeah I've seen

[1:47:10] studying a prophet and we talked about
[1:47:12] we don't want the problem so we believe
[1:47:14] this believe they prophesy all right let
[1:47:17] me go on I'm trying to get somewhere I'm
[1:47:19] trying to get something here here here's
[1:47:23] the thing and days are know we had all
[1:47:25] of this you know it should have been
[1:47:26] something to awaken the people but no
[1:47:28] matter what God does for some reason
[1:47:30] people just don't
[1:47:31] hey thanks Lee
[1:47:39] I'm putting it in your terms so you can
[1:47:42] understand it
[1:47:43] you better get mochi God Simha prophet
[1:47:51] you better get wool all right let me go
[1:47:58] a little further here Jesus in the days
[1:48:03] of life Jesus said as it was in the days
[1:48:05] of life so shall it be in the coming of
[1:48:07] the son of man now and I'm 5 passed a
[1:48:09] lot there's a scripture sacred 17 you
[1:48:12] find it all there let's go to sacred 17
[1:48:22] seeing everything everything don't
[1:48:28] forget these things so even in here
[1:48:46] verse 26 and the days know what so shall
[1:48:53] it be also in the days of the Son of Man
[1:48:57] [Music]
[1:48:58] they did eat they drank they married
[1:49:00] wives now I'm gonna tell you something
[1:49:03] Jesus addressed these things and the
[1:49:05] Lord just has been dealing with me
[1:49:06] I'm coming soon coming soon to the
[1:49:10] church need you I'm gonna take a series
[1:49:15] a man on the family and you know it's
[1:49:19] not gonna be I doubt it's gonna be a
[1:49:21] shot with jumpin preaching you know type
[1:49:23] time we gotta learn some stuff right
[1:49:26] because I think we misunderstand you
[1:49:29] or even how God wants to be involved in
[1:49:31] relationships amen
[1:49:33] right so we have to just take time and
[1:49:35] go through that right brother branham
[1:49:38] you know there was things that people
[1:49:39] did before they heard marriage and
[1:49:41] divorce and brother branham say now now
[1:49:42] now say God forgive you for that you say
[1:49:45] but teach your children never to do
[1:49:49] nothing like that right so we got to
[1:49:51] teach we got to take tough if Jesus took
[1:49:54] time and talked about it Paul took time
[1:49:56] and talked about it where the random
[1:49:57] took time to talk about it we're gonna
[1:49:59] take time and talk about it not just in
[1:50:02] questions and answers it's gonna come
[1:50:04] from this pulpit because the closest
[1:50:06] thing to heaven on earth when you trying
[1:50:08] to hear the voice of God comes from the
[1:50:10] fool kids hate divorce God does not like
[1:50:24] it
[1:50:25] amen and I know if someone say well not
[1:50:28] if depend on the condition no no I'm
[1:50:32] gonna show you in Scripture it wasn't so
[1:50:36] I gotta show these things right because
[1:50:41] it changes our thought process all right
[1:50:43] you don't want to come back for a church
[1:50:45] that's without spot or wrinkle so I'm
[1:50:49] coming to a church near you I'm just
[1:50:53] letting you know these things ahead of
[1:50:54] time that way you know if you decide not
[1:50:56] to see I set you up but it's certainly
[1:50:58] like this today hello
[1:51:01] because after Jesus brought a certain
[1:51:03] word guess what happened a certain
[1:51:04] people they dropped off a man I don't
[1:51:08] get don't get all tits
[1:51:14] all right
[1:51:19] let me keep going
[1:51:23] first one said they did eat they drank
[1:51:24] they married wives so that that was a
[1:51:26] marriage and divorce problem in the
[1:51:28] church because they noticed nothing
[1:51:30] their own wife they had wives they had
[1:51:31] two wives three wives for one right they
[1:51:34] were given in marriage until the day
[1:51:36] that Noah entered into the ark and the
[1:51:38] flood came and destroyed them all so
[1:51:40] they were they continued in this
[1:51:41] lifestyle until they were actually
[1:51:43] destroyed all right likewise also as it
[1:51:45] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[1:51:48] drank they bought they sold they planted
[1:51:49] they build it so those are those are
[1:51:52] telltale signs that you're in the end
[1:51:54] time when he's still out of building
[1:51:56] all right that's a telltale sign that
[1:51:57] you in the end time I mean you walk by
[1:51:59] you drive by a little lot ain't nothing
[1:52:01] on next thing no God next week
[1:52:02] everything clearing and something coming
[1:52:04] up that's a sign that you in the end
[1:52:06] time right oh my god he says he said but
[1:52:10] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[1:52:12] it rained fire and brimstone and
[1:52:15] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[1:52:18] in the day when the Son of Man is
[1:52:19] revealed and that day he which shall be
[1:52:22] upon the housetop and his stuff in the
[1:52:24] house let him not come down to take it
[1:52:26] away and he that is in fear let him
[1:52:28] likewise not return back remember Lot's
[1:52:32] wife
[1:52:32] let me there's a couple of statements
[1:52:34] here about that time Abraham was the
[1:52:37] elected believer in that day and the
[1:52:41] elect a believer he lived outside a sign
[1:52:44] can I tell you something Abraham won in
[1:52:47] Sodom witnessing
[1:52:54] no he stood on the outside prayed but he
[1:52:57] did not go down inside him witnessing I
[1:53:00] think I can win some people certain
[1:53:05] parties you should not be in certain
[1:53:08] environments who should not be as I
[1:53:12] believe
[1:53:24] Abraham you knew it was God in the flesh
[1:53:30] and went when these three visitors came
[1:53:32] up Abraham said my lord lot saw two and
[1:53:38] lot said my Lords lot had the wrong rep
[1:53:42] if you ever searched and they preached
[1:53:43] in three gods you know you're in the
[1:53:45] wrong term can I go on a little further
[1:53:49] Abraham has to believe the heck got
[1:53:51] revealed the secret things to him lot
[1:53:53] had no idea destruction was on his way
[1:53:55] and to the Angels got down there and
[1:53:57] told him but Abraham was in the outside
[1:53:59] knowing exactly what was given half an
[1:54:00] asylum and when he heard about it what
[1:54:02] David him do as a believer
[1:54:06] yeah uit abraham did not skip the
[1:54:10] premium
[1:54:15] until I believe us believers go to
[1:54:18] prayer meetings you can't make it to the
[1:54:20] 7:00 a.m. prayer meeting on Sunday
[1:54:23] morning guess what guess what every
[1:54:25] other Tuesday set with rooster breath
[1:54:28] since you can't make it 7:00 a.m. we did
[1:54:31] 7:30 p.m. the end iodate Sun going down
[1:54:35] that's when God met Abraham the coolness
[1:54:40] of the Eve I mean a Adam in the coolest
[1:54:43] of the even he want to meet you every
[1:54:45] other Tuesday same time same place right
[1:54:48] hey mr. t brothers pray one to Z sister
[1:54:50] pretty other Tuesday believers get
[1:54:56] involved in something huh believe was
[1:55:01] realized that time is winding up we got
[1:55:03] the break oh you want somebody to pray
[1:55:05] your family through you'll pray your own
[1:55:07] family through secret things revealed to
[1:55:14] believe this lot was the make believer
[1:55:17] he was vexed with the stand down the
[1:55:19] Sodom but he continued to live in the
[1:55:21] situation oh yeah bobbin oh I don't like
[1:55:26] the lifestyle but he lived in do you
[1:55:29] know what happens if you keep living in
[1:55:30] the situation you become desensitized
[1:55:39] and since he was so desensitized a lot
[1:55:42] didn't do anything and he went to church
[1:55:46] heard sermons but he never left the
[1:55:48] situation until angels visited that's
[1:55:52] when life got it got it got it hurt
[1:55:54] after he had a supernatural visitation
[1:55:56] for angels and then he still was delayed
[1:56:00] hurry get your stuff and get out of here
[1:56:04] so you like made some bad decisions and
[1:56:07] one of the bad decisions that lot made
[1:56:10] was even go down into Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:56:12] he thought the grass was greener down
[1:56:14] there that decision impacted his family
[1:56:16] you know some people make bad decisions
[1:56:18] and they lose their life in the midst of
[1:56:20] the decision lot then loses life
[1:56:29] but his show lost his wife and that's
[1:56:33] why the Bible says remember Lot's wife
[1:56:37] well I wonder how many Lots Weiss are
[1:56:43] even in the church today thinking about
[1:56:50] thinking about going back
[1:56:57] you should need to let the front cross
[1:56:59] your mind you know God brought you to
[1:57:01] this work
[1:57:01] you know God revealed it to you when you
[1:57:05] were just in I mean and your sphere was
[1:57:08] an uproar you couldn't get enough in the
[1:57:09] center when God brought you here thanks
[1:57:11] settle for you and now you're gonna let
[1:57:13] a devil come and anoint you define
[1:57:16] something wrong Don them tell you the

[2:06:31] first for healing second full of promise
[2:06:33] time third quarter open the other words
[2:06:34] the mysteries revealed no more there's
[2:06:37] no more higher order to reveal the word
[2:06:39] and practice but the only the profit can
[2:06:43] be vindicated by the word so that's
[2:06:45] that's the key statement I just believe
[2:06:56] right right
[2:07:17] [Music]

[2:08:46] to the Congress but only the only way
[2:08:48] the profit can be benefit was about work
[2:08:50] remember the third course of opening of
[2:08:52] seven series the third and seven seas
[2:09:02] whoops opening of themselves to reveal
[2:09:06] the truth that's been stealing the word
[2:09:07] do you see it it is been in that day
[2:09:11] when this thing is to take place -
[2:09:13] Janice of Danvers Brian person makers
[2:09:15] will appear
[2:09:45] if you do bring in subjection to the
[2:09:47] work and we got some we work right all

[2:10:10] like they did with most of the people
[2:10:11] the original work to see they exactly
[2:10:16] [Music]
[2:10:28] this is it I want you to listen real
[2:10:31] close Mountain Pose three things
[2:10:33] remember three things have been
[2:10:35] fulfilled three things lays before you
[2:10:37] right now first the world is in a solid
[2:10:41] condition Jesus said it would happen
[2:10:44] look at the perversion our women trying
[2:10:46] to act like me I'm busy
[2:10:54] lowdown devil possessed yeah Wow the
[2:10:59] Bible said that would happen and that's
[2:11:02] where is that secondly is in there now
[2:11:05] according to the scripture here that
[2:11:07] Janus in jamberry some Pierce
[2:11:16] right
[2:11:24] [Music]
[2:11:40] right the genesis of damn experiences
[2:11:43] come up but they also have somebody
[2:11:45] trying to keep you between them right oh
[2:11:51] one last thing that I was she kind of
[2:11:54] investments remembers three things
[2:12:16] right the rest of them to walk out could
[2:12:20] explain it all but he said I'm staying
[2:12:24] right here
[2:12:24] and even after you made that statement
[2:12:26] there is still one more person in the
[2:12:28] church there I believe is the second
[2:12:30] brother Raymond Carver said he was it
[2:12:32] Jesus or today and he called along
[2:12:33] believing they walked out soon as Jesus
[2:12:35] preached that sermon that was a lasting
[2:12:39] super sister
[2:12:43] they told us you belong and now we see
[2:12:45] that you really know and I know I mean I
[2:12:48] know about
[2:12:50] alright alright alright so those were
[2:12:56] the leaders religious leaders in that
[2:12:57] day they were non-believers but it
[2:12:59] eventually was still in church after
[2:13:02] that
[2:13:23] yeah
[2:13:55] to make a little money all forget
[2:14:00] Association
[2:14:06] all the associates so Jesus Judas to
[2:14:14] make one less for investors there's
[2:14:20] three things that I always do is grease
[2:14:24] we know that he's protected in threes
[2:14:27] remember the days of nor they went
[2:14:29] ending up and then the days of Sodom
[2:14:32] Jesus is speaking of these two days of
[2:14:35] Sodom
[2:14:35] they went out ceasing and the date of no
[2:14:38] thing with India and the days of Sodom
[2:14:40] they went out for some time without him
[2:14:48] saw this time and they go look
[2:14:56] you have to either this time yes go in
[2:15:07] go out go up see that's what we need now
[2:15:10] we need a going up affair we even going
[2:15:12] up from these things and one of the
[2:15:14] things that's got us so bound down I
[2:15:15] like this
[2:15:17] Daniel wasn't going to the found
[2:15:19] ourselves watch he was going to keep
[2:15:22] that word in the place where did it go
[2:15:24] through the word what it do is sit down
[2:15:26] an angel to protect this like he didn't
[2:15:29] Mars see believers don't get marked with
[2:15:32] other things in the world no matter what
[2:15:34] the law I mean if they've changed the
[2:15:35] law when the Hebrew boys came along
[2:15:45] playing that music
[2:16:13] in you
[2:17:12] right here and you're cooking he said
[2:17:15] but but if he choose not to we want it
[2:17:19] to be reaping your books
[2:17:44] [Music]
[2:18:06] because the corners are scripted his
[2:18:09] struggles maybe just they got close to
[2:18:12] the fire they died right these bearing
[2:18:15] strong me bones that refused to be
[2:18:20] defined
[2:19:34] right
[2:19:36] come on out get that instant you know
[2:19:41] what believers do
[2:19:59] whoa you're working
[2:20:04] only working speak to us only working
[2:20:09] challenges all your work and help us
[2:20:17] just a little thought that you just
[2:20:19] split my heart to share with the church
[2:20:20] them to be Mourning the message has been
[2:20:26] delivered that without bringing the
[2:20:28] fruit running there's one that was
[2:20:31] thinking about walking away I'm freaked
[2:20:36] out too restrictive and curse their
[2:20:37] hearts they wouldn't do it they would
[2:20:39] stay with me even something like Mike
[2:20:41] Peabody could explain what Jesus it just
[2:20:43] reached no way I might tell everybody
[2:20:55] everything about it but God I believe
[2:20:58] hold on to me let us have that type of
[2:21:03] coach they think failure Jesus we rehash
[2:21:10] that you would help those that have got
[2:21:13] me so out of step or let them get
[2:21:15] themselves back this time the only way
[2:21:18] they could do is they got to hear the
[2:21:20] voice and Gus private you said a prophet
[2:21:23] that Noah state multiple prophecy amen
[2:21:29] there was a prophet there in live state
[2:21:33] as Abraham was the prophet of that day
[2:21:35] you even confessed it you told the king
[2:21:38] that had Sarah say that when Abraham
[2:21:40] live say let him pray for you because he
[2:21:43] is my proxy but every day who had
[2:21:48] prophets even today you would have a
[2:21:51] problem help us stay here in the voice
[2:21:56] [Music]

[2:22:14] many trials and many tribulations and
[2:22:15] distress if I get got will hold to your
[2:22:17] promises knowing that it's nothing that
[2:22:20] we did wrong to produce this but old
[2:22:23] gods it just seems to be coming at us
[2:22:26] with the trial that he's been allowed to
[2:22:29] present but even in the midst of trial
[2:22:31] it brings greatness alamos we're
