he loves us the way that he does amen that amen he sacrificed a man uh himself so that we can have a uh chance at eternal life amen if you grab your bibles we're gonna um a little study but before i before i go into that let me just everybody see things that look different and uh the pastor's is not here um you'll get a further um explanation from him i guess the church but to everyone else um he's in quarantine he does not have covet but out of abundance of precaution they're going to quarantine themselves his family and a few of the other saints for a couple of weeks 14 days i guess and uh so we'll just keep them in our prayers but uh the gospel moves on amen we don't shut the doors amen because uh because uh the the devil if if it was that easy amen the the devil get all of us in in a little sub amen so uh we thank god that uh amen that uh he's he's in control amen in that we'll be able to just move right on because the gospel must move on and man we're gonna hit a little bit of that tonight and and and probably sunday as well amen so um um god is still god amen so uh he he brought out he's talking to him and i don't know if you remember the last time that he spoke um he said he said that devil don't like this and he gonna fight he made that comment and here it is you know but uh if we had a victory we definitely had a victory hey man so we're going to just move on and i'm sure he'll be reaching out to each and every one of you um at a later time amen because just kind of caught everyone by by surprise here a little bit so we're gonna um if you take your bibles it's being bible study we won't be as formal amen and we're not gonna hold you along uh but if you turn in genesis we'll read this scripture right quick and then you can have your seats turn um to genesis the fourth chapter genesis the fourth chapter amen my mind amen genesis the fourth chapter and we're going to begin reading from the third verse and it reads it says here and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstling of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and his offering he had not respect and cain was very rough and his countenance failed and the lord said unto king why are thy wrath and why have that countenance fear fallen if thou doest well thou shalt if y'all do as well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well seeing life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him amen you may be seated all that blessings to the reading of the word we're going to take a little thought this evening on a study in well-doing doing well amen that that that what you when you think about just well doing that seems like that should be the christian mantra amen to uh always be doing well you know uh well done but we're gonna take a little we're gonna dive into this a little bit i like how uh this this brother quaker speaking of brother quaker there you go how he was talking about how uh uh jesus came i'm god stepped out of glory and um came down on the on and held on the cross there as a sacrifice amen and he was he had to uh he had to dive in he couldn't do it from glory he had to come down amongst us and he used the type he said it's like a lifeguard amen so he had he had to come down off of you know lifeguard sits up on a platform and he looks down and if he sees somebody's in trouble amen he jumps down off the lifeguard and he he dives in the water to what guard that life amen so he he's he's he's he's guarding not only your life but he's guarding amen the life that he put in you amen so amen we we believe that tonight amen the lord is going to uh come down and be a lifeguard and sometimes lifeguards they have to go in and they pull a person out and they may have to perform some uh cpr or different things to get the person back right and everything so we believe that god is our life god this this evening amen to god the life amen that he placed on the inside of us now looking at these scriptures here we see uh that uh came the sixth chapter he said the lord said unto cain why aren't thy roth you see cain was angry and why have thy countenance failed and thou if thou doest well thou sh shalt thou not be accepted and in cain's opinion of himself he had done well he had labored in the field he planted all of the fruits and things like that he worked very hard to bring forth his sacrifice he worked very hard he presented it and everything he he dressed it up real nice and and and and the thing of it was is that kane he thought he was doing well but you know he cast me a question uh if thou do us well he said well what do you mean if i do well i did do well he i brought forth all of the fruit and different things of that nature and notice god says if thou do us well cain what cain had done amen was not doing well in the sight of god even though he had put forth a great deal of effort even though he was very sincere in what he was doing amen he had not done well and if thou doest not well then seeing life at the door we know that later on that he got so upset and roth and angry immediately after this event he murdered his brother you know a good litmus test if you're doing well or whatever you might be doing hey man if if if you find out that in the midst of doing it you you get angry and you're well they don't accept me and now you get mad and all this that kind of stuff that's usually a good litmus test that you're not in the will of god that's a good litmus test right there because we see that the same thing happened to cain and in the process of time it says here cain brought the fruit of the ground and uh the fourth verse says and abel he also brought the firstling and the flock of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel's offering abel's work in his sacrifice revealed his faith amen his sacrifice actually showed the revelation that he had in his heart amen the original sin and the lamb of god would one day come and be slain for the sins for the redemption of of of mankind so abel had a revelation his his he was his his sacrifice his labor uh uh uh uh was was was received by god amen but because abel was in the will of god he was doing well amen he was doing well but unto cain and to his offering he had no respect now it wasn't that cain didn't put forth effort or energy but his sacrifice was inspired by a false revelation his sacrifice was inspired by a misunderstanding amen because he thought it was botany life that caught that caused eve to fall oh man because he thought it was botany life that caused eve to fall that she ate apples or whatever apricots are pears but we know amen that it was the shedding of innocent blood that caused the fall when the serpent went with eve in the false union we know that that that that was the first blood that was shed upon the earth amen now stay with me we're gonna get through this amen it was a blood sin amen then he had to be a blood therefore it had to be a blood sacrifice now cain again as i said was very was was very angry amen his face showed an angry scribe an anger uh he had in other words he had his lips poked out he was pouting and carrying on and the lord said unto king why why art thou wroth and why are their countenance fought if thou does swell shalt thou not be accepted so even in that the lord you see what the lord gave came opportunity to do well even though he didn't have the revelation the revelation was presented to him see the the he said if you do like your brother then i'll accept your sacrifice too so there was no reason to get upset all he had to do was accept god's provided way amen all he had to do was accept amen and do well like his brother amen and if thou do as well here in seven thou shalt if thou do is not if if thou do as well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou do its not well sin life at the door now we're gonna look at this word well doing just a little bit here well doing is a course of right action a course of right action it is a virtue to serve the lord according to the program and the revelation of god for the age that you are living in amen because we know by teaching of the message of the hour that we can try to do god a service amen and it not be his will and it's not accepted amen so uh but if the service is outside of the wheel and the plan of god for that age then the service is not accepted it will be in vain just as cain's sacrifice was it has to be in the will and in the plan of god amen talking about doing well well doing let's put up in galatians the sixth chapter and we're gonna look at the ninth verse of galatians here amen a study in well-doing it says here in galatians let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen now let us not be weary in doing so anyone is a human sometimes we just get weary we see kids you buy them a special toy they'll play with it for a while and after a while they tired of it they don't just don't want to play with it no more they just got they're weary of the thing i'm sure a lot of times we can all attest that sometimes we we sit down and we begin to read our bibles and study we get tired we get weary amen i believe it's in ecclesiastes i think it's the second chapter the 12th verse the bible talks about that that that we get where much study brings weary to the flesh we we even find that sometimes on our jobs we we we get a new job and we're excited about going but it'll be there for a few years you know it's just it's hard to roll out of bed in the morning man i don't feel like what we get we get weary sometimes now we can be honest with ourselves sometimes we get weary coming to church it's time to go to church oh man sometimes we just get a little weary but let us not be weary in well doing amen so we will reap in due season if we faint not we could allow ourselves to get weary on a lot of things but weary and well doing let us not get weary let us continue to just press the battle no matter how tired we get no matter how hard it seems because it is connected directly to a reward we'll get into that a little bit later on in the in the study amen the scripture promised us that there is a time coming that if we wearing not in our service then we will reap a great harvest a blessing in life so the scriptures are dealing with this human trait to encourage us not to get tired and to lose our enthusiasm amen for the things of the lord and our service to the body of christ amen now now now now i want to say i want to i want to bring this out that this this this word well doing we we we we're not talking about how you yo yo you you got you have to work your way to heaven that's not what we're talking about amen because uh you're saved by grace amen but there's certainly a reward connected to your well-doing amen because we know a salvation is of the lord and not by works amen but there is reward connected to the end of the road for our service amen let us look at matthew the 24th chapter i'm sorry 25th matthew 25th chapter there beginning at the 14th verse let us not be weary in well-doing amen for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered them to and to them his goods and until one he gave five talents and another he gave to and to another one one to another one to every man according to his ability man you see he god ain't going to ask you to do what you see thank you lord don't worry about what somebody else doing see you do what god told you to do you can't you can't you can't don't use me as your measuring stick don't use brother quaker is your measuring stick don't you you you have to you have to be led by the holy spirit now that don't mean where the lord told me to stay home no he didn't neither no that was the devil you need to learn to be able to differentiate the two if you just staying home now if you're ox in the ditch get your outside but if you stay at home i'm tired i'm gonna just kick my feet up now you watch yourself you're getting weary and well doing amen but he gave you see here in this example he gave every man his talents unto his own several ability and straightway took his journey then he that he had received the five talents he went and traded with the same and made them other five talents and likewise he that had received two top two he also gained other two talents but he that had one talent and he dig it into the earth and hid his lord's money amen after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoning with them what have you done with the talents that i gave you and so he that had received five talents came and brought the other five talents saying lord thou deliver us unto me five talents and behold i have gained besides them five talents more and the lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things i will make you ruler over many things enter into the joy of the lord he also had received two talents came to the lord came and said lord thou deliver us unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them and the lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things i will make the ruler over many things enter into the joy of the lord now we're just going to start right there because we know that the other fellow uh didn't didn't didn't quite do those things he just kind of sat on the gift didn't give back didn't do anything with it and and believe the scripture that said that he was cast into outer darkness amen so what i wanna i wanna i wanna kind of switch gears right there and i wanna i want us to think about something here one of the most precious commodities we got all kind of commodities oil gas uh gold all of these wood all these certain things but one of the most precious commodity is time god has given all of us a certain amount of time time is like currency and i asked a question of the day how will you spend the time god gave you you only got so much how are you spending god's time right that's heavy what are you doing with the time god gives you are you putting it to good use are you doing well or are you burying it and wasting the time god gave you think about that the most precious commodity to the person that don't know him in the salvation of your souls god is giving you time every day you wake up in the morning you have another opportunity to make it right how precious for god to give you time to make it right you didn't ask for it you didn't earn it it is freely given but every man his own measure we don't know when this when when our time is going to run out i don't care how much money you got i don't care what it is how popular you are famous how pretty handsome or whatever the case may be you're giving you a lot of time and one day he's gonna come back say what have you done with the time that i've given you amen let's move on we know here that uh the last servant was given one talent by his master and he hid it in the earth and was slowful with what he had been given and then we see that he was cast over into outer darkness now i'm not going to get into that because there's a there's a lot there so but we're looking at this question of what it means to be a good and faithful servant he said well done not good and faithful servant no doubt there's a lot of people that's doing things and spending the time very well i there's a certain uh uh uh a group of people that they come and and they'll knock on your door i mean they don't kind of got away from it a little bit but that's you know they knock on your doe and they they they spending their time man i tell you what man i admire y'all out here doing this you're wrong but i you know it's i'm you know that's real good what you're doing i like that you know but they believe in their hearts and their heart of hearts that they're doing well they believe in their heart of hearts that they're spending their time well but so they came your the spending of your time your well-doing is directly connected to the will of god there's no reason it would do me no good to get out here and start hammering away on the ark i am not well doing yeah that's not that's not the revelation of the age that we're living in amen the catholic we look at maybe they they they go to mass every morning and they might say 100 hail marys maybe you know that maybe people that in their heart of hearts they really feel like they're doing well hey man we look at our baptist brothers and sisters good folk love them and they may go and uh uh uh uh immersed in the water and baptizing in the titles and feel like they're doing real good doing well amen but they but without a revelation amen it's just like kane you know you you you you you're taking the talents and the time and you're and you're spending it but you're spending it unwisely it has to be connected to a revelation of the hour that you're living in amen or you're wasting your time amen kane thought that uh if he uh uh uh uh that his first fruit like cane uh god would have accepted his offering even though it was contrary to the revelation of the hour eve didn't eat an apple amen it was a blood sin and the revelation had to be made known to cain by the example of abel's offering so cain was presented with truth even though he had he he he he was he's presented with truth by abel's offering but he would not accept it he turned it down talking about well doing proverbs the 14th chapter 12th verse says there is a way that seemeth right unto man but in the end thereof are the ways of death amen to be a good and faithful servant you must multiply the talents given to you for the age that you live in there have been many talents given out in this age to all servants of this age those talents are connected directly and indirectly to the head servant of this age which god used to bring forth the restoration he was the first wave sheet amen so the word as he promised for this hour so our work is to be involved in the same work of using our gift talents to advance the revelation of this hour in whatever capacity we are called to serve in if we are called to serve the lord by supporting the ministry by helping in the church service by being a part of the body of believers being faithful part of the body then that is being faithful and well doing and you will hear those words well done that good and faithful servant amen we know that in the parable of the prodigal son he failed to take the right course of action we look at the prodigal son and and uh he got weary and well doing he went to his father and said i i i want my i want all i want my money now you know i'm tired of doing this i want to go out i want to explore i want to go do my own thing and we know the story he he went out and uh spent all his money you know just living living like he wanted how they said that they were living his best life doing all he wanted to do but he found himself in this in a situation where uh uh he broke and and destitute now i want to point out in in this story that he he didn't lose his salvation he lost a joy of his salvation because he was a son he was a son he was a son he that that didn't change amen but he made his way back home but in his not well doing or his unrighteous act what he did lose was his reward at the end he lost his inheritance it was directly connected to his reward we look at galatians amen um the sixth chapter the seventh verse says be not deceived god is not mark whatsoever a man soweth that shall he read for he that sought in the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap ever reap life everlasting and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint if we faint not amen now looking at this going back to the opening scripture there looking at how cain amen his accountants had fallen he was uh he was he was rough because he wanted to serve god in his age the way that he thought god should receive his sacrifice i'm gonna say that again he wanted to serve god in the way that he thought god should receive his sacrifice and god would not accept it that way cain thought he had done well but he hadn't done well because his what a service and a sacrifice with the contrary revelation is no service at all it is a disservice if thou doest well thou shalt not be accepted and if thou i'm sorry if thou do as well thou shalt not if thou do its well shall not be accepted he put it in the form of a question and if thou do as well not then sin lies at the door well doing is to come into the obedience of the revelation of god for the hour in which you live in well-doing is coming into the obedience of the revelation of god for this day our service and our sacrifice in this hour is to express the revelation of the word in the season for which we are living in and this is the season now that we were that we are to become one with the word this is the season amen that we are to unite with the word amen the prophet said it like they say we are to lay in the presence of the revealed word so that we that's where that all the greenness will be baked out of us and so that we can become one in marriage with christ himself that is the program of god for this time if ye do well weary not in well doing for in due season we will receive the things that he's promised amen we see here what is it to be well doing it is to manifest the will of god and the revelation of the age it is to serve god's purpose in your life to serve god's purpose in your life not to serve god's purpose in my life not me to serve god's purpose in your life i got to serve god's purpose in my life see the gospel uh uh is it it's like a a a a a a a show say a dark theater you ever go and and you have the ushers and they have their flashlights and the theater is dark but you purchased your ticket you have your token and your token has a number on it that identifies and matches up to a specific seat in that auditorium i don't care how late you come to the show that is still your seat paid for you didn't pay for it he paid for it and it's your seat you got the token amen so the usher would leave take his flashlight and he walked down the dark theater so that he can see where we're going without the flashlight because the theater is dark you wouldn't know when you see that you wouldn't be able to find your way to your seat you may stumble and fall you may you may wind up somewhere where you ain't even supposed to be but this usher is to lead you shining the light before you to your seat and if he gets dead in your seat and somebody is sitting in your seat excuse me sir you got to get up this is not your seat so don't worry about what somebody else is doing they got a seat you got to see make sure amen that you are doing what you can what you have to do to serve god's purpose find your seat find your seat because he said if it's being a part of the body of believers if i was to put on a show there's no reason for me to have a show with a bunch of empty seats i serving nobody but you are part of the body for that to be a successful show it has to be the people performing and the audience everybody in place now it's perfect everybody's in their place everybody's in their position we can go home amen no matter how late you could be the last one coming through the door there's one seat left what's your token number one there it is that's your seat so you don't have to be concerned about somebody taking your seat or uh uh or what am i suppose i remember one time i'll give a quick testimony oh i was i was i was i was a young young young lad about 16 17. and everybody know my brother was a was a just a dynamite song leader and i would serve the lord you know whatever could pass i i can't sing like that boy boy's insane i get up then and just i get in line with him and in tune with him and and have a good time but that was his calling that was his that was his purpose so i i can remember we was going we went home after a really good service sister bird my mom was in the kitchen and i i went in and i was just kind of puzzled and just kind of i said what does the lord have for me to do this was the question that i asked her and she she gave me a real good talk and i she said the lord has what he has for you is just for you and we had a little conversation and i it was probably somewhere in the neighborhood of nine ten o'clock at night after service so it was late i went outside and i leaned up against the car i'll never forget and i held my head down and i began to pray say lord what is your will for my life what what is it that you would have me to do and i i just felt lost and i had my head down my eyes were closed and when i i said that prayer i opened my eyes and i looked up there was a cloud in the form of an angel one wing was down at his body and the other wing was outstretched and he said come unto me i got you and it was just so plain i began to weep and i said oh lord is that you and i put my head back down and i began to pray again and i looked back up to see this sight and there wasn't a cloud in the sky i looked all around where where did the cloud go there wasn't a cloud nowhere i couldn't find a cloud nowhere that was the law that just let you know that each and every one he has a place that is just for you that is just for you how are you going to spend the time that he gives you he gave you a spike he gave you a seat are you going to show up and take your seat are you going to leave your seat empty it's your seat no one else can sit there amen what he has called you to be in this hour is to serve god's purpose and his will to the resurrection to serve his purpose not our purpose his purpose the bible says in second corinthians the ninth chapter the sixth and the seventh verse he says but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according has he purpose in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or out of necessity for god loves a cheerful giver studying well doing doing well recently i saw a little uh a little uh a post of uh senator lewis his passing and there was another minister i think right and the caption said that these men lived a purposeful life they lived a life of purpose and i pondered on that and i thought i said you know that that's just wonderful and i thought about our lord and savior and how we are to live a purposeful life jesus came to the rich young ruler and said sell all that you have and give to the poor give it away see the the mystery in that is that i gave it to you all the riches that you have all of the things that you have it came from me so what i want you to do is to give it away i didn't give it to you to bury it i gave it to you to give it away and the second part of that commandment was to give it away and come follow me he couldn't do it he couldn't give it away the things that god gave you he gave you life he gave you breath he gave you understanding he gave you knowledge he gave you love he gave you peace give it away share it give it to those who are less fortunate and come follow jesus amen amen thank you study and well-doing amen you know that that that whole saying sort of just get watered down today you know so many people believe that they're doing well and we're not going to burst anybody's bob i don't mean to do that but according to the scripture you know i i don't want you to get to the to the end of the road and you say well did i do this didn't i do that didn't i do this he didn't do well see just like he came you're gonna have an opportunity you're gonna you're gonna come into the contact of others who are doing well if you do like them it will be presented to you don't reject god's way he's provided way don't be like cain don't be like kane don't get weary in this house we at the end of the road we are almost at the finish line let's not get weary now let's press on to the mark of the hot caller amen now is not the time to get weird it's going to be hey look when at the end of the race it's the toughest part of the race that's the toughest part your body just don't your body giving out cramping up you said man i just can't make this last lap gotta dig deep just keep putting one foot in front of the other hey man just keep putting one foot in the other don't get weary in this hour we got the end of the race amen amen so i um some wasn't here when i made the first announcement um for the next couple of weeks pastor and his family and a few of the other saints will be on a quarantine they have uh now look man he told he told me to make sure he do not have the cover i repeat he don't have it okay so it'll be oh lord the pastor got no no no he don't have it this is just something out of an abundance of precaution okay that they're gonna quarantine themselves for a 14-day period before they come back amongst the saints and this is something we all should do that if we come into contact a person knowingly that we should do the same thing he's been an example for us all amen so keep them in your prayers amen because sometimes he get weary amen but you know i just he as we all know our pastor he got a motive he gonna keep going and going and going amen so uh just keep
