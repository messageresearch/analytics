pray amen glory hallelujah shall we give the lord a clap of faith the lord is good amen for even being alive standing on your feet regardless of what you're going through regardless of what you left back home god loves you and if he loves you to keep you alive you take care of every situation amen glory hallelujah to the lord shall we pick our bible and just do a little reading um let's go to the book of joshua joshua chapter two i wish you can read the whole book but it's quite long wanted to pick a story here of how the lord can turn brokenness into masterpiece so we're going to go through that we're going to go pick him from where we left from we preach on a trans transforming from brokenness to masterpiece and we might if we want to give it a title we can put it transformed from brokenness to masterpiece or you can make it version two it doesn't matter amen transformed from brokenness into masterpiece let's go to the book of joshua let me make sure i have the scriptures right okay joshua chapter two verse one probably we might escape some of the verses and joshua the son of anand sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and they came into the halot's house named rahab and lodged there it was through the king of jericho saying behold they came in in heather to tonight of the children of israel to search out our country verse three and the king of jericho sent out rehab saying bring for the men that are come to thee who are entered into thine house for they become to search out all the country and the king of jericho said sorry and a woman took two men the two men and hit them and said and said that they came in unto me but i wish not once they were this is the king james version i don't know where they went yes surely men came to my house but i don't know where they went verse five and it came to pass about the time of shouting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men went i what not pursue after them quickly for you shall overtake them verse six but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hit them with the stalks of flags which she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them their way to jordan onto the forts and as soon as they which as soon as they which pursuit after them were gone out they shut the gate and before they were laid lay down she came up onto the roof upon the roof and she said unto them i know that the lord god has given you the land praise god hallelujah who is searching for a land the lord god has given you the land you don't have to battle amen amen i don't want to jump i'll finish my reading but i want to say something the bible said in the new testament that you are more than conquerors let's break it down who is a conqueror a conqueror is the one who fight a battle or fight a war and win the victory but if you are more than a conqueror what does it mean right you don't have to fight a battle somebody wants a battery for you so you are more than a conqueror amen and the lord jesus christ won the battle for you so you are more than a conqueror you don't have to fight you have to surrender to him that's right glory hallelujah so which phase are we i think there's eight right and before they were let down and she said unto the men i know that the lord has given you the land and that your terror the fear of you is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you if we get to know our position situations will faint because of you amen glory hallelujah for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and when did you and when you when when he he did unto the kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan sion and og whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard of this our hearts did melt neither did they remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath amen look at rehab professing things that are all transfers of the lord that the lord is god of heaven above in other words god takes all the celestial dimension things that you can't see with his eyes he's taking care of angels theophanies demons things that you can see with your literal eyes and on earth below right here he's thinking of your situation so if the lord is with you why should you fear why should you panic why should you have a headache when the lord himself why do you have a migraine when the lord is in your situation just let him have control amen glory hallelujah glory glory and verse 12. now therefore i pray you swear unto me sway unto me by the lord since i have shown you kindness that you also show me kindness unto my father's house and give me a true talking that what is heavy talking a promise amen and all that and that you will save alive my father my mother my brethren my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death the lady could see that there's an imminent death on their way and these people have got control over death they've got the power to give life and a power to kill amen if you have christ in you you've got the power to destroy the works of the enemy and the power to raise our life amen because the same jesus christ two thousand years passed ago the same jesus christ is leaving you and whatever the jesus christ of nazareth did you've got the authority and the power of heaven in you and the power in all the dimensions in you to do the same amen glory hallelujah to the lord because you're a little omnipotent you are christ you are not modern omnipotent because who your father is is who you are amen you take the jesus of your father and your mother so if your father is elohim you've got to make up genetic makeup of elohim if your father can speak into creation the same authority is vested in you by genetics by the token by the blood by the covenant by the lifeline amen glory hallelujah so then she let down the court through the window for the house was upon the i think i missed something okay and the man answered our lives for yours and you utter not our business and it shall be when the lord has given us the land then we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let them down by the court through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain let's list the persuase meet you and hide yourself there three days until the persuasive return and after after what may you go your way and the man said unto her we will be blameless of this than oath which thou has made made us swear behold when we come into the land that shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou has which doubt these letters down by and thou shalt bring thy father thy mother thy brother and thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of that house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be giftless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him verse 20 and if thou alter this our business then we will be quit of that oath which thou has made us away and she said according to your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window and they went and came onto the mountain about three about there three days until the persuasive returned and the pacers saw them throughout all the way but found them not so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of man and told them all the things that befell them and they said unto joshua truly the lord has delivered into our hands all the land for even the inhabitants inhabitants of the country do faint because of us amen may the lord add blessing to the reading of his word shall we be seated glory to the lord so we want to give it a title transformed from brokenness into masterpiece how the lord can take things that have broken things of no value since of no dignity and the lord can transform them and make them a masterpiece now if you take the word masterpiece you can break it into pieces master and peace master is if you bring it into artistic language someone who who is specializing in a craft he can take just a piece of wood and craft it like a sculptor put into pieces and make a wonderful design that can cause thousands and billions of dollars so it contains just a wood which is just a piece of food which is nothing which is broken cut into pieces and design something out of it in art they call something like a collage they can take maybe papers pieces of papers trash and assemble them together and make beautiful art forms with it so masterpiece is someone who can take something like a scrap something that is of no value let's say car manufacturers they take auto manufacturing vehicle metals plastics and different things meld them weld them use of course we are in the modern world use computerized machines and make ford make chevy make whatever vehicles you want out of them but those met those uh materials came from the earth which was just like ordinary metals nothing of any value but when they put it goes through the factory they melt it and then it comes out you see your brand new for now you can put paid a hundred thousand for that you can pay forty thousand because now the car has got the value it's become it passed through the fourth line so it's come up as a masterpiece now the natural type spiritual the lord does the same thing the lord can take your broken life your wretchedness you can take whatever you are which nobody even regards you your broken life your broken dignity your broken relationship and the lord can put them together and make a brand new nature out of out of you amen is anything hard for the lord no there's nothing that the lord cannot do all you need to do is surrender to the lord regardless of you don't have to think about your situation just give it to the lord in prayer and believe it and go the way the lord list you amen so we know rehab here her life was not a life of dignity she was a prostitute she was a woman of ill fame who is known by many men now god didn't choose out of the whole the people in jericho they were good women they were virgins there were great women there were women who had good reputations they were princes and princes maybe queens but the lord choose uh rahab to save god his spies amen there's nothing in the believer's life that is out of cater whatever happened to you is for a purpose amen whatever you go through is for the lost redemption in your life so that the lord can bring his attributes out of you amen because the lord is a deliverer he's a savior if nothing is lost he cannot save nothing if there's nobody sick doctors nurses pharmacists health care workers all of them will go back home because there's no job for you to do nobody comes to the hospital now this earth is a hospital full of sick people and that is the work the lord doctor jesus has specialized in healing people saving people transforming broken lives into masterpieces glory hallelujah so when the two spies came they found himself i mean in the house of this woman rehab and rehab was had the seed of god regardless of the the the outside there was something on the inside called a seed called a life of god called a presentation called the theophany called element of god a part of eternity elohim is in this woman was in that lady regardless of the outside the eyes i was shocked was nothing that you couldn't admire because she was a woman of what ill-famed but inside her is a seed of god before the foundation of the world before she became a prostitute the lord knew her amen glory hallelujah to the lord so this one came before the two men and they have to make a vow the vow is if you keep my business i'll keep your business so the woman realized that this men are not ordinary men the lord is with them amen and that is what a believer has to know his or her position if you know your position the situation circumstances will be afraid of you you will not be afraid of coronavirus but coronavirus has to be afraid of you coronavirus is just a manifestation of death angel upon the land a man is nothing that an angel of death moving across the whole earth or the continent destroying people is nothing different from what happened in the time of egypt when there was under there was a death angel going on on the land to kill the egyptians because of the sins and abomination of the earth the lord permitted the death angel to go about the earth and bring judgment upon the earth and also for mankind to know that the lord is the one who controls the earth not a putin not a a trump none of them but jesus christ is the one who controls the planet amen none of the atomic bombs and the hydrogen bombs and the nuclear weapons could save any mankind all of them were hiding all of them were in the india india india chambers all of them were some of them were taking chloroquine some of them were taking hydrochloroquine and different things so the only one who has got a power who has got a cecil is jesus christ amen not politicians no not religious people but the lord jesus christ when he say he says his word is he in amen and if the lord is in you you have to just let him come out of it and take control of our situations amen he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world the lord in you is greater than chronovirus if you it's your time to go you can go whether by corona whatever cancer you can go but if it's not your time no demon no virus no death angel can touch your life amen you might pass through the viruses you might breathe breathe breathe them into your nostrils but there's something new the control tower in you will see them out of you amen you don't know what happens when you go to sleep you don't take care of yourself in the daytime when you see a danger you pass by it you run away from it but in the night time you don't know the spirits that could have killed you had not been the angel of life who stan who is in you and who is around you who protect you and your family who protect your loved one he's the lord jesus christ amen you might not see that angel visibly with your this eyes but it's with you amen sometimes it can appear in different forms into you to let you know in your life that there's a higher power who is in control for your life when situations get worse and you can't control those situations there's somebody who put things together who opens door for you and before you realize there's an open door for you to pass through amen sometime you come you can come to your with end where there's nothing you can do about this situation you might feel you're going down but all of a sudden the lord will open the door for you you can use a human being you can use the word of the lord you can use signs and wonders you can use miracles you can use creation you can use the energy in the universe to change your situation regardless of whatever it might be amen it could be sickness it could be job it could be family issue it could be finance it could be whatever it is but the lord is the one who takes control i am the lord that god amen have no fear of no other god all the other guys are what they are dust everything else is creation of god don't worship vehicles don't worship human beings don't worship politicians don't worship religious men don't worship but worship the lord jesus christ who lives in your heart amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord so this woman was like i said was nobody but there was something in in her and when she saw the word in those two spies the word in her and the word in the spice of joshua connected the word calling upon the word deep calling for the deed this one confessed that we could see that the lord is with you and the fear of you is is upon the whole nation our kings and our soldiers they're all running away they can't face corona but there's god in heaven he's the one who takes control over every situation so this one asks for a sign i want a token to make sure that when you when you guys come and destroy the land my parents my family my loved ones are not destroyed and that took him was a red skelet that was symbolizing the blood of jesus christ which is the took him for all mankind amen that can deliver them from death but they say token that would develop you from judgment and distraction in this life and after this life and that token is the holy ghost baptism not the physical blood of jesus christ if the lord is here and he gives you his physical blood he's not going to profit you nothing because his blood is from the earth it went back to the earth but there was a life in the blood that is eternity itself that is eternal life that is the almighty god the creator himself when he comes to dwell in you by the seed by the new breathe by the holy ghost baptism by adoption there's nothing you should fear in this planet because everything is in your control by the christ in you amen your word is the word of the almighty when you speak your word is here and amen when you speak heaven speaks when you speak all the authority in the universe obey your word amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord so this one was given the red token and they told her to display the token on the door post somewhere around the house and everyone that would come under they took him will not be destroyed but those who stay outside they took him their blood would be upon their head and so when god has given you a token what is the token the holy ghost baptism you've got loved ones that you are praying and praying and crying after you bring them under your token under your love and you pray for them you can't physically go and arrest them and bring them to your lot to your house no your house is not where the your heart the holy ghost is where the token is amen and if you put your loved ones in your heart and you pray for them in your heart you pray for them and love them the holy ghost in you that redeem you will redeem your loved ones it's not it's not going to be on your time but it's going to be on the time of the lord jesus christ amen because he that is in you is greater than other universe is greater than the situations that hold your loved ones is greater than all the other barriers all the chains and darkness and each time that you pray the lord does something supernatural you might not see it visibly but the lord does something amen and at the right time things will fall in places for you so you just keep praying and keep believing amen glory hallelujah to the lord there are four elements on the earth the element of fire the earth itself a and a f water all the elements under the control of the creator and those elements are under your control a man this energy system in the universe on the planet and those energy system is controlled the lord put in the those energy system in the earth let me let him put in a simple way if you go to sometimes when you when you're distressed from what you go to park all the woods or a river to rest it calms you down you look at the blue skies you look at atmospheres you look at the animals they have an energy they have something about them it's part of its energy system the lord put in the creation to bring calmness how much more the word these are elements how much more the word of the lord the word of the lord is life itself is the source of life and when you eat the word into your heart the word takes away everything that is not of god it takes away sin it takes away unbelief it takes away your brokenness and transforms your life amen so the word himself is christ the word of the lord is not what is on the paper the paper is just an attribute that we can read to understand the word which is the lugas the logos is christ himself amen so through the written word the lord reveals himself in the revelation of the word what is the revelation of the word is christ himself amen what is the evidence of the holy ghost when you can receive the word know when you can read bible know when you can read and write bible verses no but when you can receive christ the word of the lord into your heart that will show that you've got christ in you that issue that has exceeded you that can eat the word of the lord glory hallelujah to the lord let's let's take another lady before the lamb captioned what i preached last week maybe some people were not here so that everyone will benefit glory hallelujah how the lord bring brokenness bring masterpieces out of brokenness last no last week i think two weeks ago we learned that when you go to the book of genesis man broke his fellowship with his maker christ but out of that brokenness the lord brought redemption the greatest redemption plan of salvation unto mankind exodus speaks about broken laws and commandments of god but god used those to prove that his mystery of salvation and grace is not on condition it's not on your merits but it's on the grace of the lord unto you amen that is unconditional love numbers the book of numbers depicts a broken covenant but god used to use it to establish a more excellent covenant in christ jesus without condition the first covenant was if you do this i'll do this if you tell the tree of knowledge of good and evil the day that you touch it you will surely die but now the second covenant was not based on if you touch something is the lord himself is a decreed commandment to you amen be holy how are you going to be holy how can a human in yourself be holy and please the lord but it's a decreed and declared statement that be holy in other words the lord has put something in you to make you holy amen not your holiness but this holiness in you because your holiness will not please the lord the bible said that your righteousness is a filthy rack unto the lord at the best of our righteousness without christ is a filthy dragon to him that's when a rich young ruler came to jesus christ and now that young man was holy he was consecrated to the lord to the god of moses he obeyed all the commandments man of the holiness of the lord had shifted from moses law unto grace unto the second covenant of unconditional love so all that this young men needed was to accept the lord jesus christ but he wanted to count upon his own merit he wanted the lord to approve his righteousness but the righteousness of the lord was the word for the hour and the day and he couldn't receive the word so he went back hopeless but they broken a woman at the wall of samaria oh let me finish this one before i go there glory hallelujah i'll go there so god is the broken covenant if you go to numbers god uses a broken covenant to depict a more excellent covenant in jesus christ when you read the book of psalms it's had as david pouring out his heart broken and a contract heart of king david god used this one to reveal his unconditional love for his elect sons and daughters amen if you take the book of kings it talks about broken prophet elijah he was broken as being chased by jezebel but god used the spirit of elijah time and time again five times amen god said behold i'll send you elijah before the great and dreadfully of the lord but this prophet was broken so he was run away from a woman jezebel but god can use your brokenness to bring redemption to do greater things amen if you look at a book of judges judges speaks about broken pictures in the hands of 300 men god used to show his victory over the enemy it doesn't matter the tools in your hands it doesn't matter how broken it is samson had a jawbone of an ass that's all he had and he had about a thousand men to face to fight how are you going to use a jawbone of an ass a job of a move of a cow of a horse to face thousand men those thousand men are they just standing there even if they are standing they are not fighting how are you going to kill thousand men with a jawbone of an ass don't you see there was a supernatural element behind a jawbone it wasn't the born but it was the lord jesus christ it was the overt gyra it was elohim using the jawbone in the hands of samson to slay those thousand men so now no matter what you have or your emptiness your mind your hands might not contain nothing but when you surrender it to the lord the lord can use it to kill thousand philistines amen you might not have nothing in your bank account but if i surrender your finances to the lord the lord can make millions out of you amen you might not have riches and houses and and things of this world but you surrender your life when you surrender your life to the lord the lord can use your life to save millions and to bring riches unto you and onto others glory hallelujah to the lord our god who make things out of brokenness in matthew we look at a broken loaves of bread in the hand of jesus christ the lord took piece two pieces of bread and three uh two pieces of bread and three fishes some something like that and it fed how many five thousand people and they were extras twelve baskets four in other words the lord can feed multitude out of the little that you you have amen uh mark talks about the lord can use uh broken things to feed the multitude the book of mark talks about broken roof when jesus was ministering unto the people it god uses to show how he can be approached no matter the obstacle regardless of the obstacle before you you don't have to go to pennsylvania to pray in the old testament they had a place of worship they have shiloh so yearly probably it's a long long distance so they go yearly with families but in the new testament you don't have to go to shallow to pray you can pray in your heart you can pray in your room you can pray when you are driving you can pray in school you can pray on the job you can pray when you are sleeping you can pray when you are lying down you can pray when you are talking to people you can be praying in your heart when you are talking to people so you don't have any limit amen talking to the lord is not limited in no way you can pray in your mind in your heart in your thought in your sleep you can pray all day long amen the lord is everywhere amen there's a story of a young young lady who finished at college or high school and this young lady his father is an old-time pentecostal hallelujah praised the lord person so this young lady wanted to party with a girlfriend so he told that he said daddy i know you you and your aiming and you know when you are doing your bible study and praying you are you make a hell of noise you know but i want you to do me a favor i'm going to have a party you stay upstairs and then i'm going to give you a geographic book i'm taking your bible from you i want to give a geography just look at the map and look at you know look at the countries you know look at the ocean indian ocean pacific ocean atlantic ocean look at india look at asia look at russia look at different countries and just lay silent you know just lie in your bed or lie in a couch silent after the party you can just i'll bring back your bible and you can do your hallelujah aiming so they had a deal okay so this girl brought her friends girlfriends they put their sound system ghetto blaster whatever you call it they started their party and they were dancing having their champagne having their good time so called you know and then this young girl had their daddy praise god hallelujah glory to the lord what's going on daddy he's disgracing me i gave him geographic book why is he shouting praise god so when he went oh sweetheart come and look look at the lord is so wonderful i can't imagine how he spoke floyd into existence it's just marvelous how he spoke takes us into creation how come there are mountains in this country and florida is plain land there is green everywhere when you go to arizona it's desert glory hallelujah who could do this by the lord jesus christ said daddy but i gave you geography book you're not supposed to see god in geography just look at maps why are you praising god he said honey there's god everywhere you can see god everywhere you don't have to see him on on king james bible no alone you can see god in your in creation you can see god in the trees you can see god in the sun you can see god in the moon you can see god on the oceans you can see god even in manufactured things amen you can see god in the building this button have got the foundation has a foundation that's the alpha it's got a body that's the body the seven change edges it's got the roof that is the omega the edge the crown and the capstone so you can see god in everywhere when you want a man stand a man is a pyramid we have a beast the food is a beast we've got a body and we've got a head that is a crown so we stand as a pyramid so god is seen everywhere you can see god everywhere in spartacles in glasses in in blouses you can see god whatever you need to see god amen so the lord you don't need to bible it's not only bible wherever you go there's god in you people should seek christ out you don't have to pack your bible to show people you're a christian if you go to job you have your bible with you what i do with this i'm a christian i want you guys to know i'm a christian if you go to walmart you've got your bible with you what are you doing with your bible in walmart i want you guys to know i'm a christian no you don't have to do that that is not a christian that is a show off if we're christian you don't have to tell nobody they have to know it from from from from you amen you have to see it from your life they have to seek christ in you if they are not seeing christ in you then keep praying amen if you're a human being and people don't see you a human being they think you're a cow then there's something wrong either the people are not seen right or maybe you are behaving you are walking as a cow your foot your hands on the ground so people thought you were a cow or you were a donkey amen but if you're human being even animals you know you're a human being sometime when an animal sees you they stand a fight and look at you if they haven't they are not experienced like what is this in their mind they also can think they can't reason but they can they have seen something they haven't seen before they've got spirit animals don't don't do not have souls but they've got spirit they can see with wearing blue jacket they could see this is not it doesn't look like the trees that it doesn't look like the green leaves they are used to those things in the woods but when they see you they could feel your spirit they have a spirit so they can stand and watch you it doesn't matter it doesn't have to be domestic animals i'm talking about animals in the woods you could be the raccoons it could be deer they watch you and they could even feel your spirit sometimes you see certain animals they want to walk after you and i've experienced it before animals walk where i was walking where i went to pray now down to pray a deer went to lie down right there where i went down to pray for a child of god so animals can't even see the spirit in you amen that you are the creator is living in you glory hallelujah to the lord so the fear cast off here and doubt away and let the lord jesus christ be in control glory hallelujah let's look at a broken roof when jesus was ministering the lord used it to be that he cannot he can no obstacle you can approach him there's no obstacle that can hinder you look the book of luke right about a broken alabaster oil god uses to show that he can accept even our brokenness a woman with a broken spirit broken life no good nobody regards this woman but she anointed the lord before her her burial amen with a broken alabaster oil that she bought with money from prostitution so even in your brokenness in your unworthiness the lord can see use you glory to the lord amen let's look at a broken hearted family lazarus in the book of john right about broken hearted family lazarus was that that laying dead god used the situation to prove that he's a resurrection and life when the only brother of two sisters was dead there was no hope for them they were grieving the lord used a situation to show them that he was the resurrection and he was alive and today he is the resurrection and he's alive because hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forevermore is there any death situation in your life is there anything that i need to resurrect in your life what are you looking for this morning what is your objective this morning what is your desire why are you sitting here what what requests what did you think about before coming here whatever was on your heart before coming here there's a living crisis to take off your situation it doesn't matter how dead it is if it's your children if it's your husband your family if it's your job if it's your relationship if it's your marriage whatever it is if it's sickness the lord is here to heal you amen because he can create broken create masterpieces out of your broken condition glory to the lord in the book of um we read a broken net after fishing all night in the time of peter in peter's life god used the situation the happening to reveal his change of dispensation from the night of the church ages to the day the day time of revelation 10. now peter fished all night and the disciples didn't even get one fish but when jesus came to the situation he told them to cast their net at the other side and if you fish at the wrong side you only have one fish but if you fish at the right side you're going to have abandoned so your net will be even be breaking amen so you have to fish at the right where the word of the lord is in the old testament they have to go to shallow to pray that's where the lord put his name but in the new testament god has put his word if you find someone with the word of the lord whether he's a man he's a young person he's an old person he is where the lord who is where the word is amen when elisha saw that elijah had the anointing of the lord and there was a desire upon elijah's heart to get a double portion of what elijah has he didn't go after king king ahab no he didn't sit in the palace but he went after eli he followed elijah amen and if you have the elijah's ministry given in this hour malacca 10 malachi 5 4-5-5-6 behold before us before the great and dreadfully of the lord i will send you like the prophet to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers who is the children the children are christianity who have gone into trinitarianism worshiping three gods with idolism god is turning our hearts from idol worshiping unto god of jehovah god of moses o israel the lord your god is one god we don't have three guys we don't have two guys we are not poli politistic polytheism is worship of more than one god we are not adult worshipers we have even certain idols worship only one god if we go to in the olden days egypt they knew that there was only one god even idol worshipers they called their god ra god of the son which was an adult worshiping how can we christians worship three gas trinity god the father god the son god the holy ghost which has got no basis in bible no basis in creation even animals trees the moon the sun they know that the america is one even the sea they know there's one maker there are not three guys who agree father son and jesus and the dove are green together no that is trash that is filthiness that is ungodliness amen it doesn't matter whether it's coming from religious big religious men from whichever pulpit the lord your god is only one god he is the lord jesus christ jehovah became he can translate himself the same jehovah he was in the time of moses adam he transformed himself i use the word theomorphy theo means god elohim murphy and morphy means changing forms so now god spanish people call it a deal portuguese causes adults friends say deal it's all around the same thing the same field theo god himself which is a from the greek origin transformed theomorphic himself from jehovah who was almighty when he was coming he attended there was lightning and flashing and fenders and and things where buildings were breaking and people couldn't stand it they said moses you were able to stand this we cannot we cannot stand it just news and come and tell us that's enough so the lord said okay i'll be selling you prophet but now the same guy said he loved mankind he loved you and lied so he wanted to come and live with you so emmanuel emmanuel means the lord with us so the lord himself the great almighty god who thundered he didn't even tell his name to moses moses said lord when i go and tell your people that you send me and if they ask me what is your name what do i say say tell them that i am that i am what is this i am that i am you give them that that that name i'll tell you later i am that i am but now he became a son right that's why sometimes we christian confused people who are not because son and you don't break it down people think like god married what do you mean by that jesus is the son of god so god had having a wife in heaven that demanded no he himself became a son means something coming out of you your son is a product from you is a jinn and your blood self coming from you so a son the flesh of jesus is called the son but in him the spirit and the soul is the same almighty god that was speaking to moses and to the children of israel so their son means their flesh is called their son it doesn't mean god had a wife elohim had a wife in heaven and married the way human beings were married no but he transformed himself from the thief from the celestial dimension created a body spoke a body into the womb of mary and then went into that that body called jesus little jesus who played like little children like little girls who did everything like every normal boy would do amen he was circumcised on the a day and he dwelled in that flesh to save mankind because mankind felt in this in the flesh in blood system so the lord the almighty has to leave the great dimension leave the angels leave all the glories of the celestial dimension and drop into flesh because you can't see if someone is drowning in a leak you can't stand on top of the lake and save the person about five feet or six feet is what feet am i right how many feet right five feet down no if you're a diver and you're a rescuer what do you do right get in there and just hold him and bring him out get the water out of him so the lord has to leave angels behind and then dive take a deep dive upon the earth come here to the lower basement coming into our muggles and fruitiness and sinful nature and become part of us amen that he can rescue you and you and i and that is a real diver a real a saver a real a water give me the term uh those who rescue people in decision knife lifeguard thank you he's a real life guard so he came to save us from our wretchedness amen it was the same almighty god in the time of moses now that wasn't enough he said i'll be with you elohim who was the almighty god said i'll be with you jesus but i want to be immanuel i want to be in you so that i'll become one with you one so after he died he resurrected and what did he do he came in another form called the holy spirit baptism king of sins he was the son of david to dwell in you and i so when brother solomon is working people know him as oh mr solomon maybe your workplace your your environment your family your friends but maybe some not all of them i know that the almighty is living in him amen when sisanami is working people might think oh this naomi i know her i mean i know her i know i know her i was a young friend right there we went to school together but they might not know that the almighty is dwelling in hair amen because the almighty has changed dwelling place again he moved from the tabernacle of jesus christ into 2000 plus years ago and came to live he's now living in your tabernacle is dwelling in you and i if you have the holy ghost baptism and if you don't have it today is the day amen as you hear the voice of god not my voice but the voice of god you hear is where they receive the word the word has got the power to transform it's supernatural it changes you amen and when you become jesus christ walk as jesus talk as jesus speak as jesus because your work you are jesus christ walking upon the earth glory hallelujah you are literally jesus christ you are embodiment of jesus christ working and what doing redemptive redemptive work as he did two thousand years ago amen that's why you carry burdens of people on on your shoulder the lord has given you that grace the loss is living in you it doesn't matter whether your sister a brother when you have the holy ghost you are just like rahab when rehab when he had it she had a token what did she do she wasn't selfish she said before she could even think about herself he said my father's house my mother my sisters and their family wow this one went she went far she could have talked about her boyfriend alone no she said my father my mother and my brothers-in-law sisters-in-law and their family my friends my neighbors everyone i want you to save everyone and jesus can go more than what you can even ask amen she can give you he can give you more than he gave rehab what a true spies given to rahab if you ask their loved ones your friends your country your neighbor your city the lord will do it amen if the lord is living in you he's not living in you for a show off he's leaving you for a purpose a function amen and you have to recognize that purpose for he taking upon all the flesh upon the planet he didn't live in in in the big peoples in the billionaires but he's living in you and you have to recognize who you are and the purpose that you're leaving you for you manifest that purpose amen the redemptive work of christ amen so that through you others will come to know him in the power of resurrection glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord amen now that's what the lord can do and we know our god can do the lord uses broken sheep in the book of acts the act of the holy ghost the lord used a broken sheep use the pieces to save paul and all that were in the ship from death amen so the lord has got a broken body he said this my body when the lord before he died he took bread and wine brewed the bread and he said this is my body which is broken for you the physical bread was symbolizing his body the body of christ that will be broken for all of us that everyone will have a peace how can it be one person it wasn't his physical flesh but it was the spirit of the lord that was broken because when he was killed when he was broken on calvary i'll read that scripture for you he cried said ella elijah sabachthani my lord my lord the flesh was crying the human spirit in him jesus was 100 human being he got tired he slept he ate he cried he wept he did everything human beings do he gave his life to us so on the cross when he pierced him when he was done he cried my lord my lord why has thou forsaken me and the bible said that water and blood came from his side the water and blood is where you and i came from where he took our sin upon himself took our death he became death that you and i will become life amen he died for you that you may live he died for me that i'm gonna leave he took all my sins upon him that i will become his very righteousness you took all your sins all your brokenness all the wretchedness everything you can dream of every negative things you can think about in your life he took every iota of it he didn't leave any stone on ten he took all the blame upon himself because when he died heaven rejected him and the earth was already done with him there was darkness on the on the ninth hour at his death why darkness means gloom sin death death fell upon him and he died physically as a human being why because he took your sin he took my brokenness before even you committed your sin before even you were born there was a prize paid for you already there was a blood to save you there was redemption already for you that you become his righteousness for what to walk as a testimony that is alive today not that he's going to be resurrect no he already resurrected and he's living in you and i we are the waves being with upon the earth you know in the east in the time of israel they used to do a famine when you plant corn whatever mango whatever plant that you you you whatever fruit and plant that you plant you sowed when you get a first fruit you bring it to the high priest and the high priest will take your your your corn if it's corn the first corn fruit and wave it to the lord that lord thank you for the first fruit may all the fruits all the plants come i mean bear fruits like this one so the lord jesus christ were the first fruit who was weaved upon the earth he was the one who resurrected a man he was the first person to resurrect and when is erected he brought resurrection onto all mankind that's why you and i are resurrected from sin not resurrected from from physical grieva no if you die and israel you're going to die again lazarus was resurrected but what happened he died physically again so the resurrection i'm talking about is not leaning the tomb yes the lord does it i've seen it twice before the lord that's it people who died and lord bring them back from life that's not but the most important resurrection is when you are dead in sin and unbelief your soul is dead you are broken and wretched you could see you could see within you there's nothing good in you but there's another voice that tells you my daughter my son you are mine and nothing can take you for my life that is your resurrection amen glory hallelujah glory hallelujah to the lord so transform from life i want us to read one more scripture look at another let's look at john john chapter four let's look at another broken life broken dignity broken marriage broken relationship broken whatever you can call it and let's see how the lord took this broken woman at samaria and turned her life around and not only her but use her life to save others so if you have your bible let's go to john chapter four let's read um verse one when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left judea and departed again to galilee and he must he must need go through samaria then comment here to the city of samaria which is called psycha near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph now jacob's world was there jesus therefore being worried with his journey sat thus on the world and it was about the sixth hour in those time the counter time in hours first hour third hour six hour ninth hour and so forth there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciples who have gone away onto the city to buy meat verse nine then said the woman of samaria unto him how is it that being a jew ask drink of me which i'm a woman of samaria for the jews i have no dealings with the samaritans racism didn't start today racism was way back in bible times so let's see then jesus answered and said unto him he thou knew was the gift of god and who it is that seed to thee give me to drink thou would ask would have asked of him and he would give thee the living water so now jesus was using finding a way into a spirit if you want to help somebody don't look at it from the outside look at it from the outside but go inside if you've got a spiritual eye so jesus was looking at trying to descend her problem so the water is just a conversation to get into his soul so he was striking a conversation with this uh woman trying to go into a suit to see her problem because he got another third eye beside the two eyes jesus has got a third eye from from the inside out eternity and you have got the same eye you've got a third eye beside your two eyes what is that eye is the eye of faith the eye of revelation the lord in you so let's see how the conversation ensued um [Music] last night we read that one we read that one verse 10. he said jesus said if okay verse 11 then the woman said unto him say thou has nothing to draw with and the world is deep from whence then has thou the living water are thou greater than our father jacob which gave as the world and drunk there himself and his children and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall fast again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never fast but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a world of water springing up into everlasting life in other words eternal life the woman said unto her say give me the this water that i fast not neither come heather to draw jesus said unto her go call that husband and come either the woman said answered and said i have no husband. jesus said unto her thou has well said i have no husband for thou has had five husband and he whom thou now has is not a husband in that says doubt truly the woman said unto him say i perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped this mountain worshiping this mountain and you see that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor in jerusalem nor jerusalem worship the father but the hour cometh 23 and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for their father's secret search to worship him god is a spirit and they that i worship him must worship him and spread it in truth then the woman said unto him i know that messiah cometh which is called christ and when he's come he will tell us these things jesus said unto her i that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciple a marvelled that he talked with a woman yet no man said why secret thou or why torquez thou the woman then left the water pot and went into the city let's see what happened after that went into uh went to the city and said unto the men come see a man which told me all things that i ever did it's not this them the christ then they went out to the city and came unto him in the meanwhile the disciples praying said unto him master it but he said unto them i have met to eat that you know off you know not of therefore sell the disciples one to another had anyone brought him meat jesus said unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work amen jesus forfeited his lunch for further going to the city for the sake of this broken no dignity wretched woman amen when you have a need this one didn't even pray it was the time that they have preached they are tired it's time to go and go and buy lunch and just to the disciples i'll go get a lunch because his lunch was to do the will of his father his lunch was to look for the sons and daughters of jacob his lunch was to look for sons and daughters of god who have been kidnapped by the enemy broken into pieces by circumstances of life and they are mourning and crying and weeping there are people that have no joy they go to bed they cry and wet their pillows there are people that walk around could be your co-workers you they might smile they might have a makeup on their face but deep on the inside is full of sorrow and and wretchedness and the lord put some of these people in your path the lord put you in the path of some of those people that you will be the arm of salvation unto them just like this woman who received mercy she had a five husband the sixth one but she needed a seventh husband seven is the number of completion and all the husbands all of us need that husband the lord jesus christ because without him you are not married so i've married for 50 years i've got children grandchildren no you're not married if you don't have jesus christ the true marriage is married to the son of god married to christ the word married to god himself god wants to have that relationship with you so regardless of how many children you have under your marriage or how long you married if you are not married to the lord jesus christ today is the time to have that wedding and you can have it right now amen and that's where speaking weddings are going on right now god is marrying to his people amen marrying to the word marrying to eternal life and god put people in your life that when you open your eyes when you are sensitive enough you will be the arm of deliverance unto those people just like jesus was an arm of deliverance onto the woman of of samaria and when this woman received greece she went she threw the water pot away went into the city come and see a man that i found he told me all that i have done all my wretchedness there was nothing that was hidden he knew all of them amen jesus can see you and he can see through you he can see through your lives from when you were born because he made you a man there's nothing to hide from the lord when you talk to the lord confess your sin let him know your your feeling let him know your he said man amen the lord is a the lord he said he's a high priest who can be touched by what by the feeling of your infirmity so pour your heart out to the lord let him know your situation let me know that you need deliverance maybe not for yourself for your family for your relationship for your husband for your children for your parents for your neighbors for somebody who might not be your physical bloodline by your co-worker somebody on the street begging when you hit a traffic light you look at that person so poor poor old what do you call it a homeless person for you you despise him no you don't you're not supposed to do that you probably to show your heart he said mankind he's the daughter of god he's a daughter of abraham son of abraham life situation has put her in that broken situation and if you cannot give him a penny you can pray for him or her amen if you cannot maybe you are not trapped you cannot go down and say god bless you my brother my sister you can pray lord the holy ghost in you is not limited remember you read from the bible god is not limited you can speak the word in your heart you can have a thought of goodness to that person sitting there begging running around begging on drugs on cocaine on marijuana you can speak into his life i've seen people that never i didn't even i heard them having conversation about stopping trying to stop cigarette smoking i didn't have a word with them i didn't i had a co-workers i didn't say nothing to them i just look at them they were having their conversation in the teacher's room and i was listening to a conversation this person said i've smoked for this number of years i want to quit it's about time for me to quit and i was just watching them and my heart went after them i didn't ask them i want to pray for you and one of them stop smoking the other one stop smoking and sweet to switch to another one i know by this time you stop smoking all together because there's something in you that when you project the love of god the sovereign grace of god takes over and i saw this one talking about smoking going through the difficult time when you smoke and nicotine is addictive so when he was quitting he was having a hard time he said but i'm determined and i was praying for him i was just letting my energy the lord in me touching him without physically going to say nothing to him and the lord makes the lord has a way of letting you know what you need to know when we are there he'll be having a conversation it's hard for me it's very difficult it's tough i mean i quit koteki and it's hard i feel like going back but i don't want to go back yes lord glory hallelujah and i just put the energy to him he doesn't know that i was praying for him in my heart but the lord almighty knew it and he quit smoking he doesn't smoke no more [Applause] there's something in you that is a lord that when you let him project he operates on your choices sometimes you operate on what you let him to do if you limit him in your mind that lord i want you to go so far that's how much fire can go there's a story in i think a brazilian family told me that a man had a christmas uh christmas celebration and he he prepared a chicken and he said our chicken wanted to invite jesus to come and participate with the chicken a fiesta festival for you chicken festival pollo di carlo di pollo so that's what spanish college right so this man was waiting for jesus to come and dang with him with his chicken and somebody knocked on the door there was a little little tiny girl so hungry chicks protruding and he said can i have something to eat i said well i mean uh i have a chicken but you know that chicken is for jesus so i can give you the the defeat so this man broke a little feet one of the chicken pieces that fit and gave it to the girl the girl said thank you she went and after a while this man was waiting for jesus to come and come and have this dinner a chicken fiesta with him with him and after a while somebody knocked on the door and they saw this man limping with broken legs and i mean he said i want something to eat i've not eaten in a while say well i have a chicken face but you know it's for jesus so but i can do a favor or give you one arm so the man took a piece of arm and gave it to uh the old man the woman said thank you he went i mean chewing on the chicken and a third person came another a young boy came very hungry and he was asking for to eat he gave it peace and this man waited and waited and waited a long time so finally jesus came and said lord i think in a dream he said lord i've waited for you a long time to come and down with me you didn't come you came too late he said well i came i said you didn't come so i came in the form of the girl with protruding cheek hungry and you gave me a piece and the lord showed him the peace i came in the form of the old man wretched maybe he's thinking i didn't take in shower in in in probably years you gave him a piece of arm i came in and found a little girl who was hungry and he gave me a peace that was me i said oh lord if i knew you were the little girl if i knew you were the old man if i knew you had a little boy i would have given you the breasts and everything about the chicken and the potato and everything all this you and the gravy that went with it but i didn't know but less than they just said i'm already satisfied i got what you gave it to me so sometime when you treat not some time all the time treat god's creation as you treat god especially fellow human being regardless of who they are regardless of their race regardless of whether it's a senior christian regardless of attack on them regardless of whether they are beggar regardless of what they wear regardless of who they are regardless of their position treat them with your heart as you treat yourself for the bible said i love your neighbor the first commandments have all israel and you are supernatural israel have have no other god beside me elohim the second commandment is love your neighbor as yourself love your fellow mankind ask yourself amen if you can give somebody 50 give it to him wholeheartedly if you could give him one dollar let it come from your heart don't think like oh he's a beggar he was in dry he was on drugs he deserved to be on the street breaking his deserve he doesn't deserve a home i was working hard when he was on drugs he wasn't working he was begging he was this she was that there was that life could switch you could have been in that situation but the lord gave you grace that you should also graciously give unto others to him much is given much is what required amen and the more we get sensitive to the lord the more we come for those ministry the ministry is not the one who take the just the one who take the uh preacher man it's not jailbrother jack or but a quest brother brother jerry brother but troy and brother solomon and all of us have ministry everyone has got a ministry everyone every human being has a ministry from the lord even their children but joseph has a ministry brother brother josiah has a ministry the little sisters have a ministry everyone has a ministry amen the ministry is not just preaching from the pulpit you are the pulpit your life glory hallelujah [Applause] you are the puppet and god want to preach from your pulpit we human beings free from this pulpit but the lord want to preach from the pulpit of your heart if you let him alone to preach if you surrender your life to him your life will become a sweet smelling incense that people can smell and they want to find out what is brother joe tell me who really are you i'm a son of god amen glory let's give him a clap amen that's the best response i'm the son of god i want to know more wow you're a son of god i want to be a son of god too what can i do can you give me a clue you can read your bible and pray every day amen glory hallelujah read your bible and pray every day amen let's give another clap amen reading our bible and praying every day we know who our father is that will transform my heart that will change me i will hit the promise of god repent and be baptized because all the promises are there and i will also relieve a son of god i didn't know so reading my bible and praying or connecting to my father and know that my father is the richest man on the planet amen let's give our journey a little clap another club [Applause] glory to the lord so the lord has given us so much that we should also give it to others because we were also broken at one point in time we were broken and wretched we didn't have anything good but the lord brought something good out of our brokenness let's look at how the lord use a few more broken situations and we'll be done for the day praise be to god let's use how the lord used broken funeral procession to raise a dead person time will not permit i'll give you the scripture second kings 13 20-21 probably i can't read oh it's only two verses i think i can do that second kings 13 20 to 20 20 to 21 20 and 21 and elisha died and they buried him and the bands of the moabites invaded the land at the camel are they coming in the year and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold despite a band of men and they cast their man into the sipoca see what is a tomb of elijah and when the man was let down and touched the bones of elijah he revived and stood upon his feet glory hallelujah there was a funeral procession people holding cascades they didn't have this sophisticated uh heads and ambulances and vehicles and you know they use their men use their hands they haven't grabbed their casket let's go so they went and they saw these enemies and when they saw the enemy hey this one is already dead i'm not going to lose my life for the sake of a dead person no let's have an idea let's throw this now and run for our lives so they throw their casket and quickly run for their life and the casket didn't land anywhere but where elijah the prophet was buried that's where the casket landed and this man that person resurrected on his feet how a broken family broken funeral possession there was a resurrection and i saw the lord reveal my something to me last night as i was thinking about that god used a broken dead man hitting the bone of elisha and to show that there's life in death even in death there's life and number two prophets and christians cannot die prophet and christian do not die they only change their dwelling places there's a dimensional change but they don't really die in the flesh yes humanly speaking jesus died how can almighty died in their flesh this flesh has a beginning that's why we have braved this the day we were born so they said you're gonna be have a last birthday whether you drop to the earth or whether you come up from the flesh and go to the other dimension right here we can call it death but christians and prophets do not die amen so elisha wasn't dead he changed his dwelling place and one revelation the lord gave you to realize if elisha was alive he was a person to pray for the dead for the dead uh for for the son of uh for the for the young man the person that was dead but because he wasn't in the physical dimension to pray for this man who was dead he died his mother lost the sun but the sovereign lord has a way of doing things the lord raised an enemy who were coming he the lord knew that this people were afraid of this enemy so this enemy were coming they didn't even see them but they fear of them let this young men who are going to bury the dead person drop the casket and i mean run for their life and the cascade landed on the sepoka the tomb of elijah and elijah in the celestial dimension spoke into creation spoke his life back to him how can a dead person raise a dead person it wasn't a dead elijah it was jesus christ he has a ministry the lord has spirits if you read a book of revelations there's seven spirits there's only one spirit but the form of manifestation is different the way brother solomon sings if you told me to come and sing like him i'll get a sore throat yeah because i cannot the lord didn't give me that makeup i can sing in the kitchen i can make a little noise to the lord but i don't have this the voice the tone how the lord did it the lord did it so the lord has a form of anointing that check with brother solomon's voice with my sisters my brothers the lord has a form of using the piano as my sister and sister rachel and their sisters how they play if you put me here i'll stare at you i don't know how to do it i don't know how to do it i don't know how to do it i just don't know the keys i don't even know the keys the only key i know is the key of key the key of cocoon i can sing that's that's make a melody to the lord a joyful noise i can't do what but i tried it this morning no so the lord has got different not one spirit but different way so the bible said seven spirits uh um paul up to abraham it's only one spirit but it works in different different ways so uh the lord has a spirit called elisha a prophetic elijah double anointing which is a form of elijah but the noble anointing so if elijah elijah was alive he was the one to pray for this woman and the sovereign lord has to make a way that they have to go to elijah for prayer even her dead body on the tomb the pill of fire was still there the theophany of elijah was still around and when the the dead man had it the life came back to him i've seen pictures of people go to abraham's er where he was buried in jeffersonville indiana they go for tourism believers from different countries us they go and want to see where the prophet of god was buried and i've seen pictures where there was a dove not a physical death supernatural like a fire coming from the tomb two of them the pill of fire the prophet don't die they are still alive christians do not die amen that's why we are not afraid of death death is just as swapping your dimension swapping your clothes changing your athlete tabernacle to the to the eternal price and you going to the theophonic dimension amen it's still here you use it but when you leave this flesh you have no limitation amen christians do not die when sister and sister hope but abram's first wife died and iran was grieving there's only one who could console him the lord was certain but the lord couldn't console him she has to he has to use the spirit of uh hope to consult with abraham so he said go and console your husband and she went physically when i was there put his son around him he said billy don't don't cry no more go ahead and preach you don't know you preach about heaven but you don't know what happened is when i went to them at peace i was like a made of what you call a guest of anna women in and white clothes came to meet me birds singing trees beautiful trees working on blue grasses things that you cannot imagine with the natural mind here i haven't seen blue grasses before i've seen green grasses and when they dry they become brown but this in the sixth dimension there are blue grasses that we working upon amen and so when she came around to comfort the husband she left and when she dropped she went back to the pill of fire there was a rainbow so you are not just a human being you are a celestial person that's why death cannot conquer you amen death is not your ultimate even in death there is life amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so god even in funeral possession can bring life let's look at the son of god broken son of god the messiah in his broken situation the whole mankind had eternal life matthew 27 37-46 i'm not going to read i'll read only one one three verses matthew book of matthew 20 27 36 to 46. you can't really want to go home but let me read 40 44-46 the thieves also they were talking about when jesus was on the cross the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour 46 and about the ninth hour jesus christ with a loud voice saying eli eli lammak sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me so the spirit separated from the flesh the son of god died in the flesh broke into pieces and through his death he was able to live in you and i amen even in death the lord can do miracles let's look at as samson when he was disappointed the lord disappointed himself let's see what the lord did broke his secret brokenness right vow let's uh judges 15 14-16 i'll read only one lemme see what some say lord let me die with my enemies glory be to the lord so let's read um verse 30 and 31 or let's read 29 to 31 and something took a hold of the two middle place upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one which is right and the one which is on the left and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the laws and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life this is the this is th then his brethren and the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and esther in the barren place of manwa his father and the judge israel 20 years now samson we know how he disappointed the lord he had a vow that was not supposed to be known by the enemy he had seven locks like the way our sisters played their hair that was a nazarite vow given by that by an angel of the lord samson gave his flesh to women and they will go defeated but even at the time that when he was most defeated his lowest ebb the lord had his cry because samson was a spoken word son of god he had that says the lord amen so he cried he prayed for one prayer i said lord let me down with avenge me give me a revenge because they plucked these two eyes and it was makings he was making cracking jokes for the enemy to to to be happy he was making spots he was entertaining them so something said lord just one more time and the pillar of fight the enemy didn't know that his hair was growing now when he was in his ministry he had seven locks which was a type of the seven church ages but the seventeen chinese were shaving off leaving nothing but the a.d the awareness of christ he tended to begin to grow on his head and they didn't know that his head was growing there was nobody to plate it but they were all grown together as one amen it means god is bringing unity upon the earth we have seven planets we have waters and sea but that wasn't the original creation original creation was the whole world as one country or continent or city or village whatever you call it and the sea and the rivers are around it and the lord is bringing it back to where it used to be before noah amen so when the enemy when the uh something prayed the pillar fired anointing god on him and he let the small boy go far away and with all his might he build a pillars and he killed more even in his in his lowest ebb a child of god is omnipotent the time when you are crying you are sobering you are having fears you are at your lowest end you don't know where to go just yell out a little cry just speak from your heart just speak your desires to the lord and the lord will hear you hannah at the lowest ebb when she was broken when she thought she couldn't have children menopause 17 years hannah cried lord if you give me a man child i will dedicate and consecrate him to unto the lord the lord heard him give him a prophet and many other children at your lowest condition if you can cry as an omnipotent son of god regardless of the situation what we do is we look at situations we don't look at christ in us so the situation put us down bury you barries you your faith is no longer in action you don't have the joy of the lord in your heart one time it happened to the king david he was a joyful person playing music and dancing and rejoicing but the enemy took his joy out of his life and there was no joy and david came to realize amnesia is when you don't know who you are david went into amnesia but the sovereign sovereign lord was with him he came to himself he said this is not who i am it's a lord restore the joy of my salvation creating me a clean heart oh lord a renewal spirit within me creating me a clean heart oh lord and renew every spirit within me oh lord cast me not away musicians from thy presence lord take not thine holy spirit from me but restore to me the joy of my salvation and renew every spirit within me the lord doesn't cast away amen and the lord restored the joy of the uh of david unto him and the lord made everything new for him amen so the lord has specialized in transforming broken situation onto masterpieces what is your situation this morning what are you crying about where has the enemy defeated you or your loved one what situation do you think that the lord cannot overcome in your life whether you are on watching through the internet or you are here physically the lord knows everything about you and the lord is in you speak the word why cry even in your brokenness yes the law sometimes permits to be broken so that the supernatural will work in you when you are not broken when moses wasn't broken he thought he was a deliverer he was a deliverer but his delivery was not going to be his human might he was supposed to stand up to the lord for the lord to do it for his glory but moses went ahead of himself to use his human mind he failed willfully but then when he saw the pill of fire at the back of the desert when he was a broken runaway prophet that's when the lord began his redemption redemptive work at the age of 80. the lord can use your brokenness to form a masterpiece amen shall we pray heavenly father we thank you for this hour we give you glory commit the broken pieces of words into your hands lord manifest your
