[18:33] you may be seated just for a moment well
[18:37] I'm so happy to be in the house of the
[18:38] Lord tonight with you Saints here I know
[18:42] Wednesday is a work day from any and so
[18:46] it really you know it pulls out the real
[18:50] Christians the ones that are willing to
[18:53] make that sacrifice not that the others
[18:56] that didn't come are not Christians I
[18:57] don't mean it that way but you got a
[18:59] really dig deep to make it to church on
[19:01] a Wednesday night and and I know what
[19:05] that is you work all day and then we got
[19:08] to get home and get cleaned up and try
[19:10] to be here and for what purpose you know
[19:14] he's worthy to be praised
[19:16] even when I'm tired even when I'm not
[19:19] all the way focused he's still worthy to
[19:22] be praised and when you have the sign
[19:25] out there that says you're gonna be here
[19:26] at 7:30 that's just not to the pastor
[19:29] that's like we all gonna be here at 7:30
[19:32] us that's what that means that means
[19:35] what church you go to spirit of truth
[19:38] when you guys have service well we have
[19:39] service Sunday morning Sunday night I
[19:42] believe then Wednesday night and so I
[19:45] was on the airplane one time with the
[19:47] gentleman and we were talking and we're
[19:50] talking about things in church he was an
[19:52] old Methodist and I asked him if they
[19:53] still watch the Saints feet he said well
[19:55] no I said well we still do he's oh
[19:57] really
[19:58] oh okay he says um what about your
[20:01] church service oh we have service on
[20:03] Sunday morning Sunday night Wednesday
[20:04] said you go to church on Wednesday I
[20:07] said yes he said you must be a preacher
[20:10] I said I said well that's a matter of
[20:13] fact I am but you know if there's only
[20:16] preachers that come to church I mean
[20:18] when have nobody to preach to before I
[20:21] was preaching I made it to the house of
[20:22] the Lord
[20:23] Wednesday night amen and I thank God for
[20:27] you Saints that made the effort to come
[20:29] and I trust the Lord will bless you very
[20:32] richly I it's not a work day for me so I
[20:37] can sleep in tomorrow and so but I'll
[20:42] try and have a little mercy on you folks
[20:44] and I try to get right into the word and
[20:47] out of the way my son Levi had a event
[20:50] with his music and school and so forth
[20:53] that allowed him to be in Miami this
[20:55] week and it pays for him and his cello
[20:59] and then one parent so I was able to go
[21:02] with him come with him on this trip and
[21:04] to me this is the whole purpose of them
[21:07] buying the ticket for him was for me to
[21:10] be in the house of the Lord here here in
[21:13] spirit and truth Tabernacle I counted a
[21:17] man where's Laura
[21:18] a man because everything else will fail
[21:24] and everything has the beginning and the
[21:26] end but the word of the Lord will endure
[21:28] all the way to the end and all of our
[21:31] events in our school and our friends and
[21:35] our appointments all our planners
[21:37] everything you write in them will all
[21:39] dissipate one day it'll mean nothing one
[21:42] day but what you did for Christ that's
[21:44] the only thing that will last amen so we
[21:48] believe that with all our heart you know
[21:50] it's it's a prayer meeting is it's a
[21:54] powerful meeting it really it really is
[21:58] one of the more powerful services that
[22:02] you can be a part of it takes a lot of
[22:05] effort and my preaching right now all
[22:09] right a prayer meeting is one of the
[22:12] most powerful services you can be a part
[22:15] of because it requires a lot of you it's
[22:19] not easy to pray it just doesn't come
[22:23] you know how many like to hear a choir
[22:25] sing wonderful how many like to hear
[22:27] good preaching always have you like to
[22:29] hear a good Bible story told
[22:32] absolutely how many like to just get up
[22:34] and just pray you see your flesh does
[22:37] not want to do that you were right by
[22:40] not saying Amen god bless you
[22:42] you're telling the truth because to get
[22:44] into the spirit of prayer we see the
[22:46] devil robs us from that time with the
[22:50] Lord you come into a house of the Lord
[22:53] for a prayer meeting and then you sit
[22:55] there and your Bible open you start
[22:57] making it a time to read your Bible and
[22:59] that's great that's fine but that's not
[23:01] what we came here for it's for a prayer
[23:04] meeting I could sit down and watch other
[23:06] folks it's the closer to be in prayer to
[23:10] really you know let the flesh man just
[23:12] move him out of the way and go into the
[23:15] realm of prayer and let the Holy Spirit
[23:17] bring you up and lead you in prayer
[23:21] where he wants you to pray you have
[23:23] things that you want but then God has
[23:25] things that the spirit wants and you
[23:27] don't know what the spirit I don't know
[23:29] what the spirit wants me to pray for but
[23:31] if I get into the spirit of prayer glory
[23:34] he'll lead me to pray for sister to pray
[23:39] for brother to pray for pastor to pray
[23:42] for the needs of the church but see when
[23:46] we come just to be entertained which
[23:49] many of the churches have gone that way
[23:51] of entertainment then we lose the real
[23:55] power of a prayer meeting now I trust
[24:00] that that we would open our eyes to the
[24:04] hour that we live in now I want to take
[24:07] a scripture here god bless you so much
[24:08] and as we're happy to be here and leave
[24:11] us here with me we'll go right into the
[24:13] word and I'll take a couple scriptures
[24:15] brother Wesco always nice to see him
[24:18] it's just your Wesco very very fine
[24:21] people Christians and my my very good
[24:25] friends and I appreciate them and
[24:26] rapturing Faith Tabernacle I see some of
[24:29] the Saints here god bless each of you -
[24:31] hey man if you're just a little tired in
[24:34] your body didn't just ask the Lord to
[24:37] help you and strengthen you so you don't
[24:39] miss what the word what the word wants
[24:42] to deposit in your spirit and you come
[24:45] to church sometime
[24:45] have you ever been tired in church and
[24:48] sleepy in church yes it gets on you but
[24:52] then you can rebuke that spirit and ask
[24:54] Lord to help you so you can receive from
[24:57] the Lord what you have need up Thank You
[25:01] Man so let's go right into the word
[25:03] we'll take the scripture over in there's
[25:11] a number of scriptures we can go to but
[25:13] we'll take and leave us in Isaiah part
[25:19] of me it's in part of me excuse me just
[25:24] a moment here
[25:30] there's more
[25:35] Isaiah 52
[25:47] and the scripture says in verse number
[25:50] one and two awake awake put on thy
[25:55] strength o tsiyon but on thy beautiful
[25:58] garments Oh Jerusalem the holy city from
[26:02] henceforth there shall no more come into
[26:05] the the uncircumcised and the unclean
[26:08] shake thyself from the dust arise and
[26:12] sit down or Jerusalem loose thyself from
[26:15] the bands of thy neck o captive daughter
[26:18] of Zion but to take one more scripture
[26:23] in revelations chapter 16
[26:33] and verse number 15
[26:44] behold I come as a thief blessed is he
[26:49] that watcheth and keepeth his garments
[26:52] lest he walk naked and they see his
[26:56] shame let's let's bow our heads for a
[27:02] word of Prayer we'll stop right there
[27:03] dear Lord Jesus we pray that you'll
[27:05] bless your word and you'll bless your
[27:08] people tonight in a very special way oh
[27:11] god we commit the service into your
[27:13] hands right now in Jesus name Amen
[27:16] I bless you you may be seated now the
[27:21] the word of the Lord is the only thing
[27:25] that will prepare you for the great
[27:30] oncoming judgments that have been
[27:32] prophesied to come
[27:33] it also will prepare you for all the
[27:35] blessings that are of the role for you
[27:38] to come that's his word we are the type
[27:41] of people that hear the word and then we
[27:44] prepare we don't wait until disaster
[27:47] comes and then we try to get it together
[27:49] but the listening they're people the
[27:51] people that have wisdom the people that
[27:53] are called of God they actually study
[27:56] the word and they find where they're
[27:59] living at and then they can prepare for
[28:02] the hour that they're living now in the
[28:05] Book of Revelations when the angel came
[28:07] to John to reveal to him what what
[28:10] things must shortly come to pass the
[28:15] angel begin to show John all these
[28:18] things he sees shows him a woman that
[28:20] had a cup Mystery Babylon written over
[28:24] her head and she had a golden cup in her
[28:26] hand and her filthiness that she was
[28:29] abomination that she was giving out to
[28:31] the nation's and all of the scriptures
[28:33] and all throughout the book of
[28:35] Revelation I think it's four or five
[28:36] times our Lord Jesus says behold I come
[28:40] quickly that's what he says he didn't
[28:43] lie he told us he comes quickly and the
[28:46] prophet of God tells us that that if the
[28:49] people if the bride if the believers
[28:51] knew that they had seven long church
[28:53] ages to go there I'll never reveal to
[28:56] them those love
[28:57] long ages but he did tell them to watch
[29:00] and pray and to be ready and so that
[29:04] preparation the Lord gives us through
[29:07] prophecy through the word through the
[29:12] anointed word that God brings to his
[29:15] people it prepares our hearts like
[29:18] nothing else will you know it's not our
[29:21] smarts it's not our high IQ it's not any
[29:25] of those things it's it's called wisdom
[29:27] there's five wise and then five foolish
[29:31] virgins and the difference between
[29:34] wisdom and being smart smart is quick
[29:37] quick witted may be a high IQ but that's
[29:40] not what we're talking about wisdom is
[29:41] what when you have experience and when
[29:45] you know you have knowledge of something
[29:47] that's wisdom you know how many smart
[29:50] people were in the days of Noah but look
[29:52] at the dumb sheep in the mule DOE and
[29:54] the giraffe they all got in the ark how
[29:57] that happen that wasn't that smart they
[30:00] didn't have the intellect of a man but
[30:02] see your smarts is not where it's at you
[30:04] know I've taken many texts and I've
[30:06] preached many times I don't remember
[30:08] everything I preached I don't remember
[30:10] everything I preached and I know that
[30:13] people listening to me don't remember
[30:14] everything that I preached that's not
[30:16] what it's about it's about your spirit
[30:19] man catching word so that it can produce
[30:22] a faith for a rapture it's not your
[30:25] intellect of course we take notes of
[30:27] course we we'd read but our first man
[30:30] the Holy Spirit leads us to feed on the
[30:33] word by our first man which is a spirit
[30:36] man now the prophet of God says this
[30:39] here and I want to read this for you
[30:43] here he says this in the message the
[30:47] seventh seal he says if you want
[30:49] something to happen now you have to take
[30:51] my word for this if I'm planning on
[30:54] doing something I know better than to
[30:56] tell anybody about it
[30:57] not that the person would tell it but
[31:00] Satan will hear it he can't get it in my
[31:03] heart there as long as God has got it
[31:07] closed up with the Holy Spirit so that's
[31:09] between me and God
[31:11] see he don't know nothing about it until
[31:14] you speak it then he hears it and I've
[31:17] tried I tell people I'll do a certain
[31:19] certain thing and watch the devil cut
[31:21] off every will he can to get there see
[31:24] to beat me to it but if I get the
[31:27] revelation from God and just don't say
[31:30] nothing about it then it's different now
[31:33] can you keep a secret can you we like to
[31:38] talk all the time everything we know we
[31:40] talk and Satan catches that but can you
[31:42] keep a secret
[31:43] let me ask you a question well what is
[31:46] God revealed to you to you personally
[31:49] that you're keeping it in your heart
[31:51] waiting for it to come to pass you know
[31:54] you know you don't have to vindicate
[31:56] yourself by telling everybody what God
[31:58] spoke to you but if he spoke to you just
[32:01] hold it in your heart and then wait for
[32:03] it to come to pass
[32:04] confess it and believe that it's gonna
[32:06] happen just exactly like he said it was
[32:09] going to happen but many times we talk
[32:11] and we talk too much but the revelation
[32:13] comes from God and it's not by our with
[32:17] our knowledge but it's by wisdom the
[32:20] prophet of God continues in this message
[32:22] God has a provided way and he says this
[32:25] here we send our children away to Bible
[32:30] schools in college and we learn them the
[32:33] Bible what good does it do to know the
[32:35] Bible if you don't know the author the
[32:38] Bible doesn't say to know the word Satan
[32:41] knows the word better than any student
[32:45] in the world put that together there
[32:48] look at that Satan knows the word better
[32:53] than any student in the world
[32:57] so thinner it's not knowing the word is
[33:01] it it's not our intellect is it it
[33:05] starts there but it's got to go deeper
[33:07] than just there Amen yeah pick up your
[33:10] Bible you need to read the word you need
[33:14] to pray in the spirit and let the word
[33:17] drop that revelation down in your heart
[33:20] let's go a little bit deeper about this
[33:23] being Satan brother Branham says and
[33:25] Satan hates any book in the Bible it's
[33:28] revelations he talks about how Satan
[33:31] hates the Book of Revelations in the
[33:34] book of Genesis he hates those two books
[33:37] because they reveal here what the
[33:41] prophet of God says here in the message
[33:42] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[33:44] and forever he says he's here in
[33:47] Charlotte right now talking about God
[33:49] he's omniscient omnipresent omnipotent
[33:53] infinite he's everywhere all the time
[33:56] everyplace Satan can't be that for God's
[34:02] the only one who's I'm nipa tent on
[34:04] mission and omnipresent proffer God
[34:07] continues in the message what does it
[34:09] take to make a Christian life and he
[34:11] says this here only God can create Satan
[34:14] cannot create he can only pervert what
[34:17] has been created there's only one I'm
[34:20] omnipresent Satan cannot be omnipresent
[34:24] God alone is omnipresent omnipotent
[34:27] infinite so here the Prophet God
[34:30] shirring us with these two quotes here
[34:32] that Satan can't be everywhere he's not
[34:35] he's not all-knowing he's not
[34:37] all-powerful but he knows the word
[34:39] better than everybody else
[34:41] he knows the word but he can't receive
[34:45] revelation revelation is exclusive to a
[34:50] believer and this is why in the
[34:53] scripture it tells us to watch and pray
[34:57] it's only the believers that's going to
[35:00] be ready for the coming of the Lord
[35:03] you know they got you're all worried on
[35:05] the news it's the worldly people that
[35:08] are worried because they don't know
[35:09] what's going on but we are well informed
[35:12] know what's going on how many know it's
[35:14] gonna get worse and it'll never get
[35:17] better
[35:18] is not gonna get better our schools
[35:21] worse our politics worse the churches
[35:25] the young people is gonna get worse cuz
[35:29] that's what the prophecy said so when I
[35:32] see worse happening I know God's
[35:35] fulfilling his word what does it do I
[35:38] look up my Redemption draws nigh
[35:42] his coming is upon us he's coming back
[35:45] for me he said he was you keep your mind
[35:50] in the news you'll be arguing at the
[35:52] radio yelling at this TV screen mad at
[35:56] FoxNews mad at the president mad after
[36:00] the Republicans mad at the Democrats
[36:03] they're doing exactly what the worst
[36:06] said they was going to do praise the
[36:09] Lord
[36:09] but we have a higher calling something
[36:12] is moving us greater and higher we have
[36:15] things that are speaking to us and we
[36:17] know what the end is going to be present
[36:21] Lord
[36:22] it's prophecy this United States for
[36:27] example 1956 January prophet comes back
[36:32] from overseas and he prophesies and says
[36:36] that he believes that this would be the
[36:38] year that America will either accept or
[36:43] reject the gospel before I read that let
[36:48] me read something for you hear what he
[36:51] says about our choices that we make he
[36:55] says that when will you make a decision
[37:02] and by faith Moses he says and it may be
[37:06] this morning that there will be men and
[37:08] women set in here that will make your
[37:10] final choice you are today what you are
[37:16] because several years ago you chose to
[37:19] be what you are now
[37:24] will determine what you'll be five years
[37:27] from five years from today you may be a
[37:32] missionary five years from today you may
[37:35] be a renowned Christian I'm five years
[37:37] from today you may be in hell because
[37:40] you made the wrong decision five years
[37:44] from today you may be cleaning spittoons
[37:46] in the bar room five years from today
[37:48] you may be a prostitute on the street or
[37:52] you may be a man or woman that's a
[37:53] credit to any society because of your
[37:57] choice for Christ five years from today
[38:00] you may be in glory gone in the rapture
[38:02] because you made your choice today but
[38:05] you've got to choose and don't look at
[38:06] what you see choose what you see by
[38:09] faith
[38:10] now our decisions today will affect us
[38:15] five years from today and where you are
[38:19] today is because a decision that you
[38:22] made five years ago and here a
[38:24] vindicated prophet of God stood publicly
[38:28] and made this statement here he wasn't
[38:32] even in his tabernacle
[38:34] this is condemnation by representation
[38:36] he was in Lane Tech High School in
[38:38] Chicago when he first gave that prophecy
[38:41] 1956 here it is four years later and he
[38:44] says this here and now let me bring
[38:46] something else I haven't I haven't got
[38:50] written here but on magnetic tape and
[38:53] this is taped to 1956 in Chicago
[38:57] Illinois standing at the lane Tech High
[38:59] School they were there we're there I
[39:03] said this year is going to be the
[39:06] changing point of America I just come
[39:09] from overseas I don't know why I come I
[39:11] come back council my meetings in Africa
[39:14] and around I come back Billy Graham
[39:17] something mysterious he cancelled his
[39:20] Tommy Osborne Council his and we all
[39:23] crossing the United States in meetings
[39:26] I said America will either receive or
[39:29] reject Christ this year then I said when
[39:35] they elected in Indiana 22 year old boy
[39:38] to be a judge the Spirit of the Lord
[39:40] came on me and I said they'll finally
[39:43] have a president that'll be one of these
[39:46] crew-cut playboy beatnik type presidents
[39:50] a ladies man
[39:52] now them is predictions years ago see
[39:57] where we're at now here he is
[40:01] four years later 1960 he's reformed back
[40:05] to something he said back in 1956 of a
[40:09] prophecy concerning America revelations
[40:12] chapter 13 all right here he goes a
[40:15] little bit further
[40:16] two years later 1962 a testimony on the
[40:21] see the prophet of God says this here
[40:24] God willing I'm giving a try now of
[40:28] evangelism we know the revivals over
[40:31] everyone knows that I predicted that
[40:35] back in 56 when it would start ending
[40:40] Billy Graham comeback Tommy
[40:43] Osborne in them I said this is it
[40:49] America will receive it or reject it
[40:52] this year and they rejected it we're
[40:57] nothing waiting but judgment now you
[41:01] marked that down and see if brother
[41:04] branham's right or not that's thus saith
[41:08] the Lord we're headed for it and we're
[41:12] going to pay for what we've done we got
[41:16] too much glamour in the church in
[41:18] Hollywood and everything else got sick
[41:21] and tired of it the last one will come
[41:24] in after a while and that'll be it
[41:26] 1962 you know what the largest church in
[41:28] America is Pastor Joel Osteen you know
[41:32] how many people tuned into him weekly 7
[41:34] million people you know how many
[41:36] congregation members come to his church
[41:37] weekly 52,000 people go to hear him
[41:41] preach
[41:42] do you think he's gonna preach on
[41:44] homosexuality this evening is gonna
[41:46] preach on the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:49] whose new thing
[41:51] he's gonna preach on marriage and
[41:53] divorce and adultery and lust
[41:56] no it's lollipop preaching it's popcorn
[42:01] it's candy it's pizza it's entertainment
[42:05] it's fun let's go to church and have fun
[42:12] but when your soul needs to be saved who
[42:17] wants to have fun when your soul is on
[42:20] the line you'll need somebody that I
[42:23] tell you the truth even when it's
[42:25] uncomfortable even when they get up and
[42:28] leave even when they get mad you gotta
[42:31] stay with the word because the word of
[42:35] the Lord is the only thing that will
[42:38] change you from what you are to what you
[42:42] need to be that's the largest church in
[42:45] America we love it here in 1956 the
[42:52] Prophet gives the prophecy 1962 he says
[42:57] we did reject now what's interesting
[43:04] 1961 the prophet of god takes a message
[43:07] jessabelle religion you that take notes
[43:10] take a note go home and listen you know
[43:14] why because when he takes the message
[43:18] spoken word is the original seed I'll
[43:21] read it for you if I got time part of it
[43:23] he says in the spoken word is the
[43:25] original seed he said he got the people
[43:27] all to a place so where I'm gonna lead
[43:30] them to I got them hanging on the limb
[43:33] now I brought prophesies of Sodom of a
[43:36] place where Willie Graham was place to
[43:39] Oral Roberts was places many what am I
[43:41] gonna do and he says the spirit told him
[43:44] to pick up the pen and he begin to write
[43:47] and when he got through writing he went
[43:50] back and looked at what he wrote and
[43:53] when you read what he wrote we ready for
[43:55] the Saints for I watch night service and
[43:58] when you read what he wrote what the
[43:59] Spirit told him to write one of the
[44:03] the spirit refers to is the message
[44:05] chess about religion yes yes jessabelle
[44:11] religion
[44:12] now when Jesus said watch who is he
[44:15] talking to when the Prophet said mark my
[44:18] word oh is he talking to
[44:20] well if he ain't talking to you he's
[44:22] talking to me yes watch watch for what
[44:28] I'm not smart enough to know Bible
[44:31] prophecy but I can get wisdom what is
[44:36] wisdom the fear of the Lord is the
[44:40] beginning of wisdom oh you gotta serve
[44:44] the Lord he'll give you wisdom I'm not
[44:48] talking about your IQ I'm not talking
[44:51] about your smarts I don't care if you
[44:53] can pass a SAT test but can you receive
[44:57] the Holy Ghost though you fear the Lord
[45:00] have you committed him as your
[45:02] all-in-all that's wisdom right that's
[45:09] glory let's go a little bit further 1962
[45:16] he says that will start it would start
[45:20] the ending okay
[45:23] so now let me read something for you
[45:28] here in the message marriage and divorce
[45:34] here's what the prophet of God says
[45:37] paragraph 239 he says that's what he
[45:40] said to Adam before sex was ever induced
[45:44] or introduced multiplied to replenish
[45:46] the earth when he was yet in the
[45:49] beginning when he was yet both male and
[45:52] female in himself there shows then that
[45:56] the bride has got to come from the word
[46:00] by spiritual multiplication
[46:03] multiplication see replenishing the
[46:07] earth so here the Prophet is referring
[46:10] to Genesis 1:26 the first man that he
[46:13] created was both male and female
[46:16] made in the image of God is that right
[46:18] he was a spirit man and the prophet of
[46:22] God says I think if you got the CLD book
[46:24] the first question he deals with that
[46:26] how a man when God formed him he was
[46:29] like a tree and his toes were like
[46:32] what's growing in the ground but before
[46:35] he was in the image so before he can be
[46:37] in that form to till the soil he was a
[46:40] spirit man both male and female and
[46:43] their name was Adam Cain say Amen
[46:47] it was in that form that Adams spoke
[46:50] that he had the ability to speak
[46:53] multiple multiplication of the word
[46:58] replenish the land and it was in that
[47:01] form
[47:02] that's his original form that is man's
[47:05] original you it's not what you see with
[47:08] your eyes it's what you're led by by the
[47:11] Spirit because the sons and daughters of
[47:14] God they're not the smartest faithful
[47:16] but they are led by the Spirit of God
[47:20] and that's all I want I want to be led
[47:24] don't go there stay back here do it like
[47:28] this I want to be led by the Spirit of
[47:31] God that's the real you that's the real
[47:34] me is when I left the Holy Spirit lead
[47:38] me not on call oh man the devil got his
[47:44] food always in the mirror trying to be
[47:48] cute always trying to change the outside
[47:50] man that's gonna burn keep living is
[47:55] gonna get a wrinkle keep living is gonna
[47:57] dry up hey lemon it's over krei that's
[48:01] not you but your spirit man was the
[48:04] original man and he led the animal
[48:08] kingdom like the Holy Spirit leads to
[48:11] believer today that's what he said he
[48:14] said that spirit man that spirit being
[48:17] led the animal kingdom like the Holy
[48:20] Spirit leads the believer today that's a
[48:24] low in the image of God
[48:28] see this is 1:26 then in Genesis chapter
[48:31] 2 then a forms man and he stands up and
[48:35] he looks like an earthly man and then
[48:40] from there Adam names and then from
[48:43] there God takes from his side a type of
[48:46] Christ is that right so where do we
[48:50] begin
[48:51] it's like a little baby no baby no who
[48:55] is mama and daddy is is that right he
[48:59] can't even talk but you try to hold him
[49:00] like who is who it ain't his knowledge
[49:05] he can't even talk but he know his
[49:07] spirit knows that you ain't my mama and
[49:10] you ain't my daddy take your hands off
[49:12] of me see that's in him and a believer
[49:17] with this make decisions that look crazy
[49:19] sometime people to understand it are you
[49:23] gonna give up that job they don't
[49:25] understand it what do you like here for
[49:27] they don't understand it why you going
[49:30] to church on a Wednesday night because
[49:33] we are led by the Spirit of God
[49:37] Laurie I'll take that over anything hey
[49:43] man that's what we come in contact with
[49:47] when we receive the Holy Ghost where our
[49:51] spiritual man is awakened and now we got
[49:55] the power to live right and when the
[49:57] word comes forth our spirit man is
[49:59] growing feeding on the word faith is
[50:03] growing for a rapture there's the Lord
[50:09] amen amen
[50:13] so let's go a little bit further here
[50:19] this America rejected
[50:24] and the prophet of God said five years
[50:29] so in 1961 this country elected his
[50:34] first Catholic president with his name j
[50:41] FK there i some of young people didn't
[50:44] know that hi he was a nice man handsome
[50:47] I mean I take a picture look nice next
[50:50] to his wife Jacqueline but you see what
[50:53] was he he was Catholic you see the there
[50:57] are many Christian people voted for him
[51:00] because their eyes wasn't open to
[51:02] spiritual things but when you listen to
[51:05] the message this is right after he was
[51:06] elected
[51:07] jessabelle religion he's not at the
[51:10] tabernacle but he blasts what this
[51:13] nation just did but look this is 1961 he
[51:17] was elected the first Catholic president
[51:19] and the Prophet blessed him but five
[51:22] years prior we already rejected 56 57 58
[51:27] 59 60 61 five years later we get this a
[51:33] man on the throne brother man who said
[51:36] that Israel was a type that America was
[51:39] the type of Israel that we came over
[51:42] here for religious freedom
[51:43] revelations 13 said there was a beast
[51:45] that come up out of the earth two horns
[51:47] like the American Buffalo and he had
[51:50] cervical civil and ecclesiastical power
[51:53] and we came here for a religious freedom
[51:55] that was the forefathers of this nation
[51:58] now we didn't preach the baptism of the
[51:59] Holy Ghost we didn't have everything
[52:01] right but we came over here for a
[52:03] religious freedom you know we had slaves
[52:05] we did the American they did the
[52:07] American Indian wrong and and all kind
[52:09] of things were contrary but but still
[52:11] the prayer that they would have come to
[52:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[52:15] civilization travels from the east to
[52:17] the west and that's the way the gospel
[52:19] travels and that's where the Sun rises
[52:22] from the east to the west and that light
[52:24] would have finally come to our nation
[52:26] and to the churches which it did I
[52:28] didn't have their laws together but they
[52:30] had enough to know that they didn't want
[52:31] to be a part of a harlot anymore or the
[52:34] so they came over here for freedom
[52:37] of religion and then 1960 while we elect
[52:41] our first Catholic president and we are
[52:48] done so you want me to go get out get
[52:53] out the vote sign to a nation that's
[52:57] already done you want me to stand up to
[53:00] somebody's life matters who you want me
[53:03] to get a t-shirt is that where we're at
[53:05] right now I'm getting all whose life
[53:08] matters the only life that matters is
[53:11] the life of Christ and if you want to
[53:14] receive the Holy Ghost that's what
[53:16] matters if you want to get saved that's
[53:19] what matters the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:22] Calvary that's what matters it'll make
[53:25] the difference in your life I'm not
[53:27] gonna get out the vote get out the vote
[53:29] for what for who huh and if you listen
[53:35] to them the media and have your mind oh

[56:47] let me read something for you here I
[56:49] don't want to hold you too much longer
[56:51] but we'll take in this message the I
[56:55] believe it's the mark of the beast
[56:58] yes mark of the beast' 1954 May 13th
[57:04] he's has this here this United States
[57:09] will come to a time that the church and
[57:11] state will unite together Protestant and
[57:14] Catholic will throw their things
[57:16] together to fight communism and it in
[57:20] its exactly playing in the hands of what
[57:23] God said right here and you Protestants
[57:27] laying yonder sound asleep reading a
[57:30] love story magazine instead of your
[57:33] Bible out guiding around somewhere to
[57:37] some kind of a party instead of a prayer
[57:40] meeting somewhere fussing at one another
[57:42] about little old petty things that don't
[57:44] matter that much you ought to be on your
[57:47] knees somewhere if you know what
[57:49] eternity meant he continues on the same
[57:54] message mark of the beast' 1954 same
[57:58] message straight down paragraph 249 he
[58:00] says it said the whole world Protestant
[58:04] in all wondered all except those whose
[58:07] name was written in that book why were
[58:09] the names written they are Abraham's
[58:12] seed and our heirs according to the
[58:14] promise
[58:15] elected before the foundation of the
[58:17] world that's why they don't wonder
[58:19] notice here now what's what he said
[58:23] what's these in the Lamb's Book of Life
[58:26] here is the mind that has wisdom now I
[58:31] want to ask you something is wisdom one
[58:34] of the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[58:36] congregation says Amen is that right
[58:40] how many believes that the Bible first
[58:42] Corinthians twelve teaches that the
[58:44] gifts and all in the church is wisdom
[58:47] let's see one of the gifts a man well
[58:49] how could you say there is no speaking
[58:52] in tongues then how do you say there is
[58:53] no interpretation of tongue how could
[58:55] you say there's no divine healing for
[58:57] the same body if I'm a body got a hand
[58:59] on the this side and hand on that side
[59:02] and a foot there how can you say that
[59:05] the hand is not the foot didn't you hear
[59:07] what Paul said now watch he is
[59:11] speaking in the last days directly to
[59:15] the body said here is to the one that
[59:20] has wisdom oh I like this oh my here is
[59:25] what will shock you listen to this all
[59:27] right here is the mind that has wisdom
[59:30] if the Holy Spirit gifts didn't come
[59:33] down to all the age why did he speak
[59:35] this for the last days then if there's
[59:40] going to be no gifts in the church in
[59:41] the last days why did he direct this to
[59:44] the last days then here is to the one
[59:48] that has wisdom the seven heads are
[59:54] seven mountains on which the woman
[59:55] sitteth
[59:56] how many hills how many cities in the
[59:58] world
[59:59] he continues on paragraph 253 that the
[1:00:02] church sits on seven hills only one
[1:00:05] where is that the Vatican City Rome
[1:00:07] that's right the Bible said that this
[1:00:10] horrible war that made all the world
[1:00:13] commit fornication brought out a bunch
[1:00:16] of little daughters to teaching them
[1:00:17] about the same thing said they wasn't as
[1:00:20] bad as her but they were harlots taught
[1:00:22] them the same thing said the beginning
[1:00:24] of it will be a woman or church sitting
[1:00:27] on seven hills and Rome I looked over
[1:00:29] the world tell me where it's at a church
[1:00:31] sitting on Seven Hills
[1:00:35] now the Prophet said that it was calling
[1:00:40] to the last day people this prophecy of
[1:00:47] wisdom here's to him that has wisdom
[1:00:57] is wisdom important can you pray for it
[1:01:03] and have it is this scriptural to ask
[1:01:07] for God to give you wisdom you young
[1:01:11] people you think a little wisdom will
[1:01:12] help you a married man you think wisdom
[1:01:16] will help you in your home you walk upon
[1:01:18] the job if people setting traps all
[1:01:20] around you think wisdom will help you

[1:01:24] you got things you have to do you think
[1:01:27] a little wisdom will help you you're
[1:01:29] traveling you're going here and there
[1:01:30] you got people after you got the devil's
[1:01:33] after you do you think wisdom will help
[1:01:35] you here's to the mind that has wisdom
[1:01:38] one of the gifts of the Spirit one of
[1:01:41] the things that's necessary for the
[1:01:43] believer in this age and this hour as I
[1:01:47] prepare to close the the scripture tells
[1:01:53] us of wisdom I'll just read a couple
[1:02:00] places for you here if I can find it
[1:02:04] quickly Psalms 111 10 says the fear of
[1:02:10] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom a
[1:02:14] good understanding have all day that do
[1:02:17] His commandments his praise endure
[1:02:20] forever proverbs 1:7 the fear of the
[1:02:24] Lord is the beginning of knowledge but
[1:02:26] fools despise wisdom and instruction
[1:02:29] proverbs 9 9 and 10 give instruction to
[1:02:32] a wise man and he will be yet wiser
[1:02:35] teacher just men and he will increase in
[1:02:38] learning the fear of the Lord is the
[1:02:41] beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of
[1:02:44] the holy is understanding proverbs 5
[1:02:48] proverbs 4 5 through 7 get wisdom get
[1:02:53] understanding forget it not neither
[1:02:56] decline from the words of my mouth
[1:03:00] forsake her not and she shall preserve
[1:03:03] thee love her and she shall keep thee
[1:03:07] wisdom is the principal thing therefore
[1:03:10] give
[1:03:11] wisdom and with all thy getting get
[1:03:15] understanding
[1:03:19] you see brothers and sisters Satan knows
[1:03:24] the word but it's the word is not
[1:03:28] revealed to him you see the difference
[1:03:33] but the children of God have wisdom and
[1:03:38] the the wisdom is the principal thing
[1:03:43] now as I prepare to close just so you
[1:03:50] know when I got up here I was preparing
[1:03:52] the clothes all right so you got a watch
[1:03:55] how I said wisdom you would have caught
[1:03:57] that as I prepare to close everybody a
[1:04:02] smiling but it's all right
[1:04:04] I've been there I've been there that's
[1:04:06] discouraging when he was planning to get
[1:04:08] off in a few minutes

[1:04:19] justice will help you the word of the
[1:04:21] Lord will help you and this message pick

[1:04:29] the first part and when you get a chance
[1:04:31] you go home and you listen to that or
[1:04:34] read it and we'll bring you to where we
[1:04:37] where you need to be it's a warning it's
[1:04:40] a prophecy it's not for the world it's
[1:04:42] for you it's for me and then you get a
[1:04:46] chance to go to the message services
[1:04:51] just the time six dreams by pastors all
[1:04:58] right I'll preach it now right I've been
[1:05:01] here before
[1:05:01] everything the Holy Spirit was here
[1:05:04] before service is just a time six dreams
[1:05:09] then capped off by a vision and when he
[1:05:13] opens up his vial is as Romans chapter 9
[1:05:16] where they stumbled at the stumbling
[1:05:19] stone
[1:05:20] they still stumbling at the
[1:05:22] stumbling-stone
[1:05:23] all right I almost stumbles at that
[1:05:26] altar right here god bless you y'all
[1:05:30] pray for me I'm alright but in this
[1:05:33] message the spoken word is the original
[1:05:36] seed I'm just gonna read one two three
[1:05:38] four paragraphs and then this was set up
[1:05:41] when you get a chance to hear this other
[1:05:44] part he says here paragraph three one
[1:05:47] zero he says now that's what we got all
[1:05:51] these things that we got now all things
[1:05:54] all these things I've said if they don't
[1:05:57] jive with the Bible or dovetail what
[1:06:00] God's Word they're wrong they're wrong
[1:06:02] all this picture now I'm just going to
[1:06:05] hurry over some of this not explain it
[1:06:07] but just hurry over it so you can get to
[1:06:10] it and I promise you as quick as I
[1:06:12] possibly can I got a place here where I
[1:06:15] got so in the spirit I got the church up
[1:06:19] to show it and proved in the word here
[1:06:22] exactly what happened all along and then
[1:06:25] when it did I thought Lord I got the
[1:06:29] people standing here now I'll have them
[1:06:31] standing there what can I tell them I
[1:06:34] can't predict the future I can't tell
[1:06:37] them what to do or what will I do I'll
[1:06:39] leave them standing on a limb I raised
[1:06:42] up my hand I said God I think I'm doing
[1:06:45] this by your will I've never did this
[1:06:47] never did before because the seed hadn't
[1:06:49] been sold yet
[1:06:50] I said now I've got I believe it's time
[1:06:54] for me to say it but now what am I going
[1:06:56] to say now and just as plain as you hear
[1:07:00] my voice something said pick up your pen
[1:07:04] I'll read it to you in a minute and when
[1:07:07] I got through there it was just the
[1:07:09] answer I didn't even know what what I
[1:07:12] was writing just started writing and
[1:07:14] when I got through I laid the pen down I
[1:07:16] looked I thought God have mercy there it
[1:07:19] is right there
[1:07:20] that's what I'm looking for now there
[1:07:22] are some things I had to bypass we'll
[1:07:25] get to it in a little bit the Lord
[1:07:27] willing so there's a long amount of
[1:07:30] space he explains a few things in him he
[1:07:33] picks up and
[1:07:34] for one for through paragraph four it
[1:07:44] gets 447 look for one for the paragraph
[1:07:48] four for one and you get a chance you
[1:07:54] read that you people that want to be
[1:07:56] made ready you that want to receive the
[1:08:00] warning of the Holy Spirit take I'm not
[1:08:02] gonna read it for you
[1:08:03] I want you to read it I want you to
[1:08:05] listen to it you go find the message
[1:08:06] spoken word is the original seed he
[1:08:09] listen to what the Spirit told him when
[1:08:12] he picked up the pen and he wrote and he
[1:08:14] didn't even know he was writing and then
[1:08:16] one of the things in there was Jezebel
[1:08:18] religion showed us where we are
[1:08:22] America has rejected the word and that
[1:08:27] was a brief touch on America through the
[1:08:33] Bible America in the word what has
[1:08:37] happened where we are today
[1:08:39] you take Romans chapter 1 and you read
[1:08:43] straight down that God has given them
[1:08:47] over let's close with that scripture all
[1:08:50] right let's close with that one
[1:09:31] it seems hard sometimes the stuff we
[1:09:35] have to say and the reason it seems so
[1:09:39] hard is that everything has become so
[1:09:42] watered-down that the true word of the
[1:09:45] Lord it really sounds hard but that's
[1:09:48] what you need you need truth and I
[1:09:53] believe in positive I believe in keeping
[1:09:57] your thoughts positive I believe in
[1:09:59] looking up and I believe in self-help
[1:10:02] and doing things to better yourself but
[1:10:04] if you're trying to better yourself
[1:10:05] without the cross without the blood
[1:10:09] without repenting it's not gonna work
[1:10:11] you're just gonna swap one thing for
[1:10:14] another thing if it don't require
[1:10:16] repentance which means to turn around
[1:10:19] from what you're doing and then the
[1:10:21] blood of Jesus Christ to atone for what
[1:10:23] you did and then the Holy Spirit to give
[1:10:25] you the power not like the Superman not
[1:10:29] like a superhero but its power that you
[1:10:31] surrender to and you surrender to that
[1:10:34] power it gives you the grace to live a
[1:10:36] godly life you're tested you're tempting
[1:10:39] you say Lord Jesus help me I'm weak
[1:10:41] right now and it gives you the power and
[1:10:43] you overcome that's the Holy Ghost power
[1:10:45] that's the power we live by power to
[1:10:48] overcome and I revel in Romans chapter 1
[1:10:50] on our read here says this here I'm
[1:10:54] going to start verse number 18 for the
[1:11:02] wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[1:11:04] against all ungodliness and
[1:11:07] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:11:09] truth in unrighteousness because that
[1:11:12] which may be known of God is manifest in
[1:11:15] them for God had showed it unto them for
[1:11:18] the invisible things of him from the
[1:11:20] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:11:22] being understood by the things that are
[1:11:25] made even his eternal power and Godhead
[1:11:27] so that they are without excuse because
[1:11:30] that when they knew God they glorified
[1:11:33] him not as God neither we're thankful
[1:11:37] but became vain in their imaginations
[1:11:41] and their foolish heart was darkened
[1:11:42] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:11:45] become fools change the glory of the
[1:11:49] uncorruptible God into the image made
[1:11:51] like to corruptible man to birds
[1:11:53] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[1:11:55] were for God also gave them up to
[1:11:59] uncleanness through the lusts of their
[1:12:02] own hearts to dishonour their own bodies
[1:12:05] between themselves who changed the truth
[1:12:08] of God into a lie worship and serve the
[1:12:11] creature more than the Creator who is
[1:12:13] blessed forever amen
[1:12:15] for this cause God gave them up who gave
[1:12:20] them up God gave them up unto vile
[1:12:23] affections for even their women did
[1:12:26] change the natural use into that which
[1:12:29] is against nature and likewise also the
[1:12:32] men leaving the natural use of the woman
[1:12:35] burned in the lust one toward another
[1:12:38] men with men working that which is
[1:12:41] unseemly and receiving in themselves the
[1:12:44] recompense of their error which was meet
[1:12:47] and even as they did not like to retain
[1:12:50] God in their knowledge God gave them
[1:12:53] over to a reprobate mind to do those
[1:12:56] things which are not convenient being
[1:12:59] filled with all unrighteousness
[1:13:00] fornication wickedness viciousness
[1:13:03] maliciousness full of envy murder debate
[1:13:06] deceit malignity whisperers backbiters
[1:13:10] haters of god despiteful proud boasters
[1:13:14] inventors of evil things disobedient to
[1:13:19] parents without understanding
[1:13:20] covenantbreakers without natural
[1:13:22] affection implacable unmerciful who
[1:13:26] knowing the judgment of God that they
[1:13:28] which commit such things are worthy of
[1:13:32] death not only do the same but have
[1:13:36] pleasure in them that do them now when
[1:13:41] God has given them up and their mind is
[1:13:47] reprobate and they have gone into vile
[1:13:53] affection
[1:13:54] the scripture says they're worthy of
[1:13:57] what dad that's not cool to say that
[1:14:00] it's not it's not comfortable to say
[1:14:03] that but that's the truth you know the
[1:14:05] the that we we win our little church
[1:14:07] their release it from the school
[1:14:10] department they're a man that we lease
[1:14:12] it from his name was Richard and you had
[1:14:17] a little spirit on him and I ain't seen
[1:14:19] him for a few months a few months I went
[1:14:20] back to go pay the lease every time I
[1:14:23] pay it he wasn't there and I noticed the
[1:14:26] name change from being called Richard to
[1:14:28] Ricky our Akki like what and then hurt I
[1:14:33] thought I heard one delicious we'll
[1:14:35] leave it on her desk like on her desk
[1:14:37] well this person she went through this
[1:14:40] change and when we signed a contract it
[1:14:43] was a man I went to go pay the leases
[1:14:46] the first time I saw them or hurt him or
[1:14:50] what in several months and it's he's now
[1:14:56] a woman now yeah right before my right
[1:14:59] before your eyes
[1:15:01] you see that and not a very pretty woman
[1:15:05] either I'm sure I just had to say that
[1:15:08] excuse me really what's ugly is the
[1:15:11] attitude in the spirit but then when I
[1:15:14] dropped to check off and I shook hands
[1:15:16] at the hands of a man now you tell me
[1:15:22] that that's not disgraceful you tell me
[1:15:27] that's not disgusting but the devil will
[1:15:30] make you think that you're hateful when
[1:15:34] you preach against such things because
[1:15:36] all of the media and all the news have a
[1:15:39] gospel that they want to hear the only
[1:15:42] thing that's going to save you is when
[1:15:43] you hear the truth an evil spirit can't
[1:15:46] have no power until context don't whine
[1:15:48] evil spirit comes in contact and you get
[1:15:51] you know you see a naked woman walk by
[1:15:53] then you're dealing with your bodily now
[1:15:55] you stay in the presence of the word
[1:15:57] then you got faith the anointing comes
[1:16:00] it strengthens the spiritual man you get
[1:16:02] out of the presence of the word you're a
[1:16:04] man
[1:16:05] you're a woman you'll get influenced you
[1:16:08] listen to talk radio all the time
[1:16:10] listen it out all the time you get
[1:16:11] influenced and then you start picking up
[1:16:13] attitude towards people the only answer
[1:16:16] is the gospel it's the word of the Lord
[1:16:19] it's the mouthpiece of God that coming
[1:16:22] this day that's the only act that's what
[1:16:24] we stand for that's the blood that's the

[1:25:42] it was given to our horse tonight think
[1:25:44] tough for brother Israel watching free
[1:25:47] and just you know it's it's so easy to
[1:25:54] get caught up and swept away in some of
[1:25:57] the things in the world a man would like
[1:26:00] to us to get swept away in and a few
[1:26:04] weeks a few months ago the Lord put in
[1:26:06] my heart my spirit just X I was I was
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:12] Arizona at the time we were out visiting
[1:26:14] for the Israel and while I was in the
[1:26:16] hotel room I was reading the scripture
[1:26:18] and this side is first that I was
[1:26:21] reading there on the first job that says
[1:26:23] if we love the world the things of the
[1:26:28] world the love of God is not in US and
[1:26:32] as I'll just begin the meditative manner
[1:26:34] to speak and just kind of reflect on
[1:26:38] oh just how deep that thought was right
[1:26:41] and and oftentimes Satan just really get
[1:26:43] us so so so caught up in us so so caught
[1:26:47] up in us in the thing just whirling we
[1:26:48] missing what God is doing as it was just
[1:26:52] preaching they're just beginning to
[1:26:53] think about you know this is this is a
[1:26:54] you know the word selfie didn't even
[1:26:57] exist to this age and never even existed
[1:27:02] I was that's a new word that came up in
[1:27:05] this age and you know and and when you
[1:27:07] look at it in scripture it says that
[1:27:09] remember the man would be lovers of
[1:27:11] their own selves selfie
[1:27:16] right right if men would be lovers of
[1:27:19] themselves and I was just thinking said
[1:27:20] you know when you take it herself and
[1:27:22] you want us to see you we really not
[1:27:24] looking at you we can't see you like
[1:27:27] that because that's not the real you
[1:27:31] the real you don't look like that the
[1:27:34] real you ain't made up and all that
[1:27:36] that's not the real you but we really
[1:27:38] want to see you the one that got me
[1:27:41] that's who we're looking for that's why
[1:27:44] we come here to the house of the Lord to
[1:27:46] hear the word of the Lord to bring out
[1:27:47] the real us because the devil is me and
[1:27:51] that way is a lion let's just put it
[1:27:53] that way in and some of us he's trying
[1:27:55] to make our lives look like it's
[1:27:57] something that it's really nice I thank
[1:27:59] God for the word I thank God it cleanses
[1:28:01] us it purges us it's it just it makes us
[1:28:05] who we need to be watch and free watch
