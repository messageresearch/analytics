[31:33] let's let's bow our heads in prayer real
[31:34] quick. Um, heavenly father, as we
[31:37] approach this word, um, we just want to
[31:40] say that we're so grateful for you and
[31:42] what you've done in our lives, Lord.
[31:44] We're grateful for how you've just given
[31:46] us the ability to recognize your word
[31:48] for this hour and to come and join
[31:50] together around the table and to feast
[31:52] on what you have for us tonight. Lord,
[31:54] please open our hearts to receive.
[31:56] Please uh just take control of the whole
[32:00] service, Lord. Whatever we can do to
[32:01] foster your spirit, whatever I can do,
[32:04] Lord, just take over my tongue and let
[32:06] your words cross my lips, Lord. Nothing
[32:08] from my own mind and nothing from my own
[32:10] heart, Lord. We pray this and we ask
[32:12] that it's quickened in our hearts this
[32:14] evening. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[32:17] [Music]
[32:19] Amen. Thank you. Thank you musicians.
[32:21] Fantastic job. How many people
[32:23] appreciated those specials? Those are
[32:25] great, right? Um,
[32:28] brother brother Jack was talking about
[32:30] the youth using their gifts and uh I
[32:33] just wanted to tell y'all we stole one
[32:35] of your ideas over here uh up north
[32:38] right in Indiana. And uh it was Becca
[32:40] who brought it up to me and we were I
[32:42] don't know it was probably about six
[32:43] months ago. How long has it been? Six
[32:45] almost a year. Um we were headed to a
[32:48] Bible study and I was supposed to be
[32:49] talking in the Bible study to our youth
[32:51] and um she told me what y'all you know
[32:54] what you guys do down here where the
[32:56] youth run the service. They had a youth
[32:58] service and out of that so many
[33:00] different gifts came out of that. And uh
[33:03] now a lot of those young people are
[33:05] adults and they're still serving the
[33:06] Lord to this day in their ministerial
[33:09] capacity. It's just a beautiful thing.
[33:11] So um we presented it at that Bible
[33:15] study as an idea and guess what? We've
[33:18] had several youth services since then,
[33:20] right? And um that's right. Uh I I I I
[33:27] really feel it on my heart when I look
[33:28] at these young people cuz you know they
[33:31] I mean we've all been through it. Um we
[33:34] all have to go through it. It's just a
[33:35] season but during that season God has
[33:38] something for us. Um he has no limits to
[33:41] what he can do through us, right? Um we
[33:45] had a brother uh ministering for us and
[33:47] talking to our youth again recently um
[33:49] brother Nathan Ericson from Ohio and he
[33:52] was talking about God's economy and he
[33:54] was saying how we're all a part of that
[33:56] economy. You come to church to give and
[33:58] to receive. And he was trying to teach
[34:00] them, hey, you know what? You have a you
[34:02] have something to give and God wants you
[34:03] to give that cuz you're there to receive
[34:05] as well. Don't let the devil stop you
[34:07] from giving. All right. Amen. Um, and I
[34:11] believe that uh if you will turn with me
[34:15] to uh first John
[34:19] uh chapter 2,
[34:22] I want to say I was looking at my
[34:24] calendar and I realized I have not
[34:25] spoken uh to this assembly in I think a
[34:29] year and a half and 10 days.
[34:32] So uh I got to make good use of the time
[34:34] I have here, right?
[34:37] Uh we'll let the Lord have his will. Um
[34:40] 1 John
[34:42] chapter 2, let's go to verse 12. It
[34:46] says, "I write unto you little children
[34:49] because oh, and when I'm reading this,
[34:52] uh I want you to know this the message
[34:55] tonight." It's not just to young people.
[34:56] It's definitely to older people, too, in
[34:58] regards to younger people. So, as I read
[35:01] these verses, pick your your spot. It's
[35:04] going to say uh elders and youngers uh
[35:07] whatever you identify as, just put
[35:09] yourself there. All right? And don't be
[35:11] offended because it's the word. It says,
[35:14] "I write unto you little children
[35:15] because your sins are forgiven you for
[35:17] his name's sake. I write unto you
[35:19] fathers because ye have known him that
[35:21] is from the beginning. I write unto you
[35:24] young men because ye have overcome the
[35:26] wicked one. I write unto you little
[35:28] children because you have known the
[35:30] father. I have written unto you fathers
[35:33] because ye have known him that is from
[35:34] the beginning. I have written unto you
[35:36] young men because ye are strong and the
[35:39] word of God abideth in you and ye have
[35:41] overcome the wicked one. He goes on to
[35:45] say, "Love not the world, neither the
[35:46] things that are in the world. If any man
[35:48] love the world, the love of the father
[35:49] is not in him. For all that is in the
[35:51] world, the lust of the flesh and the
[35:54] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[35:56] is not of the father but of this but is
[35:58] of the world. and the world passeth
[36:00] away, and the lust thereof, but he that
[36:03] doeth the will of God abideth forever.
[36:05] You may be seated.
[36:11] So, um,
[36:15] uh, like I said, it's a pleasure to be
[36:17] with you tonight. I I have not I don't
[36:21] want to be disres disrespectful, but I
[36:23] haven't preached in a t-shirt since I
[36:25] was, uh, in the Philippines. But it's
[36:27] it's as hot as the Philippines right now
[36:28] and I gotta take this off.
[36:33] It's been a while.
[36:36] All right. Uh
[36:39] and I see y'all fanning yourselves, so I
[36:41] don't feel like I'm in the wrong place.
[36:43] Okay. So, um there is this uh online
[36:48] video that went pretty viral and
[36:51] sometimes I hear about it, right? And
[36:54] you'll know why whenever I tell you. And
[36:56] the online video is about this guy who
[36:58] mispronounces everybody's name. And uh
[37:01] he um is talking to this guy named Aaron
[37:04] and he says, "You done messed up, Aon."
[37:07] You know, and when he says that like
[37:11] everybody just starts laughing cuz it's
[37:13] funny, you know, it's a viral video,
[37:14] whatever it is. Um but over the years,
[37:17] I've heard that statement a lot because
[37:20] of my name. People call me a Aon and
[37:23] they all think they're original. Like I
[37:24] haven't heard it 300 times. But u I hear
[37:27] from my colleagues, I hear from people
[37:28] at church, I hear from, you know,
[37:30] family. It is what it is. It's all
[37:31] right. It's funny. It's It was amusing.
[37:34] But um that inspired my title tonight
[37:39] cuz tonight my topic is what Aaron done
[37:42] messed up.
[37:43] And I am I'm going to use that title to
[37:48] talk to you about how I grew up and what
[37:50] I messed up while I grew up and what God
[37:53] has taught me. Okay? And I think a lot
[37:55] of these lessons, they go beyond just
[37:57] what was happening, what was happening
[37:59] to me when I was young or when I was a
[38:01] teenager or whatever. And it goes on to
[38:03] adulthood. I'm still learning some of
[38:05] these lessons. So, everybody should be
[38:07] able to get something out of this. Amen.
[38:09] Um, and I'm just going to try to hit
[38:12] each thing that I learned, like some of
[38:14] these major points that I learned. I'm
[38:16] still learning. I'm not perfect. I'll
[38:18] probably be learning to the till the
[38:19] till I pass the grave. It's fine. Um,
[38:23] but these things are major things that I
[38:25] I had to figure out. Some of them the
[38:27] easy way, sometimes the hard way.
[38:29] Sometimes the Lord just showed me. And
[38:31] when it hit, then I was like, "Wow, I've
[38:33] been messing this up my whole life." And
[38:36] um you know, not that I have these all
[38:39] straightened out either. I just realize
[38:41] that God has shown me these things. And
[38:43] I hope that he ministers to you through
[38:45] them, too. Learn from my mistakes. Amen.
[38:48] So, the very first one
[38:51] I'm going to talk about is defending the
[38:54] Lord. Defending the Lord. So, uh, when I
[38:58] was, um, when I was growing up and I I I
[39:03] actually felt like God was calling me, I
[39:06] don't know, between 9 and 12 years old,
[39:09] it happened multiple times. God would
[39:10] call out to me, and I'd just find
[39:13] suddenly find it on my heart to try to
[39:14] seek the word. I'd either read message
[39:16] books or the Bible, I'd get serious
[39:18] about it, and then um, uh, stuff would
[39:21] happen, and then I'd slip back and just
[39:23] go back to doing whatever. And um uh
[39:26] it's a sad thing to say. I think I I was
[39:28] 23 years old when I finally got the Holy
[39:30] Ghost. I wasted all those years. And um
[39:33] this is a major thing for me was
[39:35] defending the Lord because I thought in
[39:38] my mind before I before I I sought my
[39:42] salvation and got the Holy Ghost and
[39:43] actually completely surrendered to him,
[39:45] I thought that people in my social um
[39:49] interactions would attack me once I
[39:53] became a Christian. So the more I live
[39:55] like Christ, the more I'd have to
[39:57] explain to people why I was not living
[40:00] like them, like to my friends. So I go
[40:02] to school and I see everybody's living a
[40:03] certain way, right? And uh they're all
[40:06] doing these things and I'm doing a lot
[40:07] of them with them. And then if I
[40:09] suddenly go off in the corner and just
[40:10] hide with my Bible, say that's what I
[40:12] was picturing what, you know, that's
[40:13] what Christians do. They hide with their
[40:15] Bible over here. And then, you know,
[40:17] every time somebody has a problem with
[40:19] them, they'll come under attack and they
[40:20] start verbally assaulting you. And then
[40:22] you have to defend why you're not acting
[40:24] like them. So I thought I'd be defending
[40:27] the word. And I I I really thought that
[40:30] that's what my life was going to be. And
[40:32] for those people in big families, like I
[40:34] was the last born out of five. And I
[40:36] don't want to blame my siblings or
[40:38] anything like that. This is just my
[40:39] perception. Um some of it might be
[40:41] accurate, some of it less accurate, but
[40:43] my perception was I watched what my
[40:46] older siblings are doing and I thought
[40:47] that was cool. Big mistake.
[40:50] y'all y'all with older siblings, you
[40:52] probably learned that by now and you
[40:53] probably will at some point. But um I I
[40:57] thought what they were doing was cool
[40:59] and not we we all did things that we hid
[41:02] from our parents that we knew didn't
[41:04] line up with the word and we kept it
[41:06] among each other and we had our own
[41:07] little social group there and it was
[41:09] beautiful, right? Mom and dad don't know
[41:11] nothing about this. It's great. So, uh I
[41:14] thought if I start following the Lord,
[41:16] they're going to be the first to notice
[41:18] and then they're going to say something.
[41:20] And one thing my family's great at is
[41:22] verbal assault.
[41:24] We are great at that. We are great at
[41:26] insulting each other. We have plenty of
[41:29] diswords. We have plenty of funny things
[41:31] to say about each other. And I just knew
[41:33] as the youngest, I was already getting
[41:35] picked on. I was just not ready for
[41:37] that. And I was like, I don't want to
[41:38] have to hide again. The Bible have to be
[41:41] defending everything that I do and be
[41:43] like, well, Aaron, you think you're
[41:45] better than everybody else. Tell us
[41:46] where that is in the word that we can't
[41:48] do that. And I thought that that's how
[41:50] it worked. But I didn't realize that
[41:53] God, there are actually a lot of
[41:55] scriptures in there. If you think about
[41:57] it, you're you're not supposed to defend
[42:00] the word. The word is supposed to defend
[42:02] you. Okay? So, it's built that way. If
[42:05] you think about it, the word of God is
[42:07] quicker and sharper than any two-edged
[42:08] sword, right? Isn't it weird if you went
[42:11] into battle with a sword and you have to
[42:13] guard the sword?
[42:15] Like, that's not how that works. It's a
[42:17] weapon, right? So, you're supposed to
[42:20] use that to defend yourself.
[42:23] That's not how that works. So, if you go
[42:27] into battle, just think of it this way.
[42:28] You know, uh Paul, I believe it's in
[42:30] Romans, he talks about all these things
[42:33] that you that you're guarded with, like
[42:35] the armor of God. All of it is
[42:37] protective. Like everything about that
[42:40] is protective. You're not protecting
[42:42] God's armor. God gave you armor. God
[42:45] gave you something that's going to stand
[42:47] for you. Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And I have a lot of scriptures under
[42:53] each thing that I learned. I'm not going
[42:54] to try to hit every last one of them,
[42:56] but I'm going to pull out a couple of
[42:58] examples for you of how the word, you
[43:00] know, defends you. First off, I go to
[43:02] Psalms in chapter 3. Uh Psalms uh yeah,
[43:05] chapter 3:3 says, "But thou, oh Lord,
[43:08] art shield for me, my glory, and the
[43:10] lifter up of my head. I cried unto the
[43:12] Lord with my voice and he heard me out
[43:15] of his holy hill. Sellah that that
[43:19] that's the relationship there. This word
[43:21] in the beginning was the word and the
[43:22] word was God and the word was with God.
[43:24] He is a shield. This word is a shield.
[43:28] It is my shield. Now any type that you
[43:30] think of God being even as the
[43:32] bridegroom and the bride, ain't nobody
[43:35] protecting Becca but me.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; She's not going to be out there
[43:38] protecting me.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; She doesn't have now. She might get a
[43:41] little feisty or slick at the mouth. If
[43:43] you if you look at me sideways, she
[43:44] might. But the bottom line is my job is
[43:48] to protect her and I take that
[43:50] seriously. When she gets lick of the
[43:53] mouth and someone's throwing hands, I
[43:54] need to step in front of her cuz I'm the
[43:57] protector, right?
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; That's my job. Every every type you can
[44:01] think of God being.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; So, young people and older, don't be
[44:05] afraid. Even if it's your colleagues,
[44:07] you get in front of them. Sometimes you
[44:09] don't want to have to, you know, bring
[44:11] the mood down by saying, "Hey, please
[44:13] just stop cussing." I don't deal with
[44:15] that,
[44:16] &gt;&gt; you know, or, you know, I I just don't
[44:18] want to that kind of atmosphere around
[44:20] here or I'd like to be able to take time
[44:22] off to go to church or a convention or
[44:24] something like that. You're not
[44:26] defending the word in that case. God
[44:27] will protect you no matter what you say.
[44:30] If you stand for him and you're on the
[44:32] right, he is obligated to come into your
[44:34] situation
[44:35] &gt;&gt; and protect you. Amen. That's right.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in third Exodus,
[44:39] "So, the only thing you can ever do to
[44:41] beat him," he's talking about the devil,
[44:43] "is rely on Christ and humble yourself
[44:45] and let him lead you. You'll never do it
[44:48] any other way. Your intellectual powers
[44:49] will never do it. You got to believe it.
[44:51] Just rely on him. He is the shepherd. It
[44:54] ain't the sheep's business to keep the
[44:56] wolf away. It's the shepherd's business.
[44:59] But the sheep must stay with the
[45:01] shepherd in order to stay safe. That's
[45:04] my safety zone is in Christ and Christ
[45:07] is the word.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; That's the safety zone. I think that's
[45:10] like a football euphemism. Am I wrong?
[45:12] Is there a safety zone in sports or
[45:15] something? Oh yeah, I'm getting some
[45:16] nods. Okay, I'm not too far off. Another
[45:19] thing
[45:21] in John,
[45:23] it says, "These things have I spoken to
[45:25] you." John 16, "These things have I
[45:28] spoken unto you that in me you might
[45:30] have peace. In the world, you shall have
[45:32] tribulation, but be of good cheer. I
[45:34] have overcome the world. He didn't put
[45:36] you somewhere that he couldn't handle
[45:39] himself. So that's why he came here in
[45:41] the flesh in the first place. All right?
[45:43] And that actually that's why I
[45:44] congratulate people when they get to be
[45:46] 34 years old. I tell them, you outlive
[45:48] Jesus.
[45:50] He couldn't handle it here for 34 years.
[45:53] Someone took him out.
[45:55] But I mean, we don't have the weight of
[45:57] the world on our shoulders. But still,
[45:59] that's impressive. Every year you live,
[46:02] realize you're not going through
[46:03] anything worse than Jesus went through
[46:05] himself.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't put you somewhere he
[46:08] couldn't handle.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah,
[46:12] I like this verse and I'm going to break
[46:13] it down just because I like it. Um
[46:16] Isaiah 52,
[46:19] uh verse 11, he says, "Depart ye, depart
[46:21] ye, go out from then. Touch no unclean
[46:23] thing. Go ye out of the midst of her. Be
[46:25] ye clean and bear the vessels of God.
[46:27] Now I believe that whole verse still
[46:28] applies to us departing from the world.
[46:32] For ye shall not go out with haste, nor
[46:35] go by flight. For the Lord will go
[46:37] before you, and the God of Israel will
[46:39] be your re-reward.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; That word right there,
[46:44] &gt;&gt; if you look at what that means in modern
[46:46] English, it's a military term. It means
[46:49] your rear guard. All right? So, it's
[46:52] going to like just like that verse in
[46:54] Psalms where it says he's your shield.
[46:55] He'll like shields are held up here,
[46:57] right? But he'll watch your back. He'll
[46:59] watch stuff you ain't even seen
[47:00] happening. God will watch your back. If
[47:04] you're walking in his will, he will take
[47:05] care of what's going on over there. And
[47:08] honestly, if somebody's starting to give
[47:10] you grief for being a Christian or
[47:11] living the life, just turn your back on
[47:13] them. Be like, "You know what? God's got
[47:16] me. I don't have to worry about all
[47:18] that. Settle it. I don't have to worry
[47:21] if my income source is going to change
[47:23] because God's got my back,
[47:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:27] &gt;&gt; I love that. Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to get off that or I'll
[47:31] stay on that one topic the whole time.
[47:34] Um, another thing for young people, um,
[47:39] uh, the second thing I learned, so the
[47:40] first thing was defending the Lord. Um,
[47:43] you don't do that by the way, you don't
[47:45] have to. Um the second thing I learned
[47:48] was how temptation works. And um here
[47:53] was my misconception, right? My
[47:55] misconception was that uh
[48:02] my misconception was that
[48:05] if I was tempted by something and
[48:08] overcame that temptation, I'd never be
[48:10] tempted by that thing again. That's what
[48:13] I thought. Yeah.
[48:15] And um I thought it was one and done.
[48:18] It's like, you know, I I I used to be uh
[48:22] I think with my siblings, yes, this is
[48:23] how how I used to be with my siblings. I
[48:26] I was the goofball, you know, the
[48:28] youngest brother. I'd go out there and
[48:29] I'd do my best to make everybody around
[48:31] me annoyed and annoyed just enough to
[48:34] where they're saying go away, but not to
[48:36] where they're throwing hands and I'd
[48:38] step back and then move on to the next
[48:39] person, you know? And uh I I always did
[48:43] that. I did that kind of stuff all the
[48:44] time. Um, and then when other people
[48:48] tried to give me trouble and cause me to
[48:50] be annoyed, I'd blow up and get mad. And
[48:54] I thought that uh I'd pray to God about
[48:56] it. And I did pray to God about that. I
[48:58] I don't know. I might have been hearing
[48:59] a tape or something like that, the word
[49:00] or a sermon that kind of convicted me on
[49:02] that. And I was like, "God, make me like
[49:04] my mom." Cuz my mom was like so settled.
[49:07] Like it didn't matter what people were
[49:08] telling her, she'd just be chill. and
[49:10] she God answered that prayer pretty
[49:13] quickly. Like my siblings know me. I
[49:15] don't I don't blow up at them. It is
[49:17] what it is. Whatever they're doing, I
[49:19] might think it's weird. I might think
[49:20] it's strange. I might, you know, tell
[49:22] them they're being goofy, but I'm not
[49:24] going to get mad and go off on people. I
[49:26] don't usually do that. So, uh, and I
[49:28] thank God for taking that away from me.
[49:30] But as an adult,
[49:33] God keeps, um, showing me what I've
[49:37] overcome. Let me say it that way.
[49:39] Sometimes sometimes my patience gets
[49:42] tried
[49:44] and the the longer I am an adult, the
[49:47] more there is to uh be tried on. So
[49:50] young people, I'm going to give you a
[49:51] couple of examples of people in the
[49:53] Bible.
[49:54] Let's start with uh Jesus Christ
[49:56] himself. All right? He was tempted in
[49:58] all manner, right? The Bible tells us
[50:01] that. And um the three major temptations
[50:04] he has are at the very beginning like
[50:06] right after he gets the Holy Ghost he
[50:08] goes out there into the wilderness and
[50:10] he fasts for uh 40 days and then he gets
[50:12] tempted in three different ways and
[50:14] actually we read them with our opening
[50:15] scripture. Uh one was the lust of the
[50:17] flesh the other one's lust of the eye.
[50:19] The other one's the pride of life. Now
[50:21] um brother Brandham actually breaks it
[50:23] down and says those three are those
[50:24] three. Now I'm going to explain what I
[50:26] mean because I don't want to talk over
[50:27] anybody's head when he says the lust of
[50:30] the flesh. I know you're well taught,
[50:31] but I'm just going to go over it just in
[50:33] case somebody um needs a refresher.
[50:36] The lust of the flesh is um when
[50:40] Jesus was offered was told to uh turn
[50:43] the stones into bread, right? Y'all
[50:46] remember that very first temptation. So,
[50:49] his flesh needed some food, you know?
[50:51] So, that was a a a lusting for that food
[50:54] and he had to overcome that. And how did
[50:56] he overcome that? I'm just asking these
[50:58] younger people how how did he overcome
[50:59] that? Y'all remember?
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Man shall not live by bread alone.
[51:06] So he actually quoted the word out right
[51:08] back to the devil, you know. And um I
[51:12] believe if if Jesus said wanted to, he
[51:15] could turn it into into bread just like
[51:16] that. Be easy. It's not a problem. Um
[51:20] but he knew it was the devil saying it.
[51:22] So there's probably something about that
[51:23] that ain't right.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; And it was a temptation. So, um
[51:29] the uh second temptation, you guys know
[51:31] what that is?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Exactly. Great. So, uh Satan
[51:39] showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[51:40] and he said, "They belong to me. I'll
[51:42] give them to you if you just bow down
[51:44] and worship me." And that is the lust of
[51:46] the eye right there. So, he was showing
[51:49] him with his eye and he he he knew that
[51:51] Jesus knew that he would inherit all of
[51:53] those things after he followed God's
[51:54] will. Um but it would have been simpler
[51:57] to just bow down to the devil and just
[51:59] to take it all rather than go get
[52:01] crucified and go through all those
[52:02] things. Um the very third temptation
[52:06] does somebody want to tell me?
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Throw yourself down from a high
[52:12] place. Devil takes him up to a high
[52:14] place. This is the pride of life. He
[52:16] says throw yourself down and then uh
[52:19] doesn't it say in the scripture that uh
[52:21] my my angels will deliver you? They'll
[52:22] catch him. And yeah, he could have done
[52:24] that and God would have sent his angels
[52:26] to capture him. Um, now the funny thing
[52:30] about Jesus is, and I just love Jesus so
[52:32] much. He had a he had a funny mouth like
[52:34] like I do, you know? He had a sassy
[52:36] mouth. He had a lot to say. I love it.
[52:38] And um in this case when he's talking to
[52:42] the devil each time he responds he could
[52:44] have gone anywhere from Genesis to the
[52:48] book of Malachi for these scriptures and
[52:50] he just stayed in the book of
[52:52] Deuteronomy chapter 6 and 8 right there.
[52:56] And back then they hadn't broken them
[52:57] down into chapters. So he had the
[52:58] smallest unit of the Bible which is the
[53:00] book of Deuteronomy. He's like I don't
[53:02] need much to take care of what you're
[53:04] talking about right here. He says this
[53:06] verse here and if you go down the scroll
[53:08] a little bit right there, that's the
[53:10] other one. And he responded to the devil
[53:13] and the devil had to back off. Right?
[53:15] Beautiful. Yes. Beautiful. Now, I I love
[53:19] that. I love that scripture. But I'm
[53:21] going to point out to the fact to you
[53:23] Jesus gets tempted by those same three
[53:25] things throughout the rest of his
[53:27] ministry. The devil didn't run and back
[53:29] off and stay away. He kept coming again
[53:33] and again. all the way until he was on
[53:36] the cross. So the first one, the lust of
[53:40] the flesh,
[53:42] if you think of his ministry, he really
[53:43] had nowhere to lay his head,
[53:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:46] &gt;&gt; He just wandered around. They were
[53:48] hungry most of the time. They were
[53:49] walking around on the road. Him and the
[53:51] disciples missed a lot of meals. He
[53:54] denied himself on um sleep. He denied
[53:57] himself sleep on Mount uh
[53:59] transfiguration. Whenever the disciples
[54:01] fell asleep, he he had to keep going to
[54:04] pray and he knew he needed to pray. So
[54:06] he denied himself rest so he could pray
[54:08] and get closer to God. And then that
[54:10] transfiguration happened. And then um I
[54:14] believe the garden of Gethsemane. He he
[54:16] was praying till he was sweating blood.
[54:18] You can't tell me he wasn't denying him
[54:19] his flesh. He was denying the lust of
[54:22] the flesh over and over again. The lust
[54:25] of the eye.
[54:27] I remember he he gets to Jerusalem and
[54:30] he sees he sees the glory of uh
[54:32] Solomon's temple. He was actually there
[54:34] probably like two or three times
[54:35] throughout his ministry. He sees the
[54:37] glory of Solomon's temple. The first
[54:39] time when he was 12 and the second time
[54:41] um he he sees it and he says um
[54:47] he says tear down this temple and I'll
[54:49] destroy it in 3 days. Now he's talking
[54:50] about his body, but he completely
[54:52] rejected what was in front of his eyes
[54:54] and realized that God was moving on to
[54:56] the spiritual things and completely
[54:58] leaving aside all this rich buildings
[55:00] and rich architecture, all that stuff.
[55:03] Denied it and he followed Christ.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Um
[55:10] he also didn't do anything to make
[55:11] himself appealing, the lust of the eye.
[55:14] Uh he the Bible says there was no beauty
[55:17] that we should desire him. He was a
[55:19] starved man and he looked way older than
[55:21] he should be. Probably 20 years older
[55:22] than he should be. And he didn't really
[55:25] do much to fix himself. Um, not that I'm
[55:27] saying neglect your hygiene. I'm not
[55:29] saying Jesus did that. Amen.
[55:32] Amen.
[55:34] No.
[55:36] I'm saying that he wasn't over there,
[55:39] you know, going to the beauty salon. He
[55:41] wasn't out there making sure he hit the
[55:43] barber. No, he he wanted to esteem est
[55:46] esteem the kingdom of God higher than
[55:49] whatever his body wanted, whatever he
[55:51] wanted in his flesh. The third thing,
[55:53] the pride of life.
[55:56] Um,
[55:57] Satan still had to come at him verbally
[56:00] for the pride of life and he spoke
[56:02] through Peter because he's talking about
[56:03] his crucifixion. And Peter says, "No,
[56:06] it's not going to be that way." And
[56:08] Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan." cuz
[56:11] he knew that Peter was speaking the
[56:13] words that Satan had given him and
[56:15] talking about how his life is going to
[56:17] be spared. That's not true. That wasn't
[56:19] true. That's not according to the word.
[56:21] He had to get aside from that
[56:23] temptation. The very last temptation I
[56:25] could think of on the pride of life was
[56:27] um when he was on the cross, brother
[56:30] Brandham the prophet, he actually told
[56:32] us he could have twitched a finger and
[56:34] like every angel that was on all those
[56:37] hills over there would come and take him
[56:38] off and prove that he was the son of
[56:41] God, but God's purpose wouldn't have
[56:43] been fulfilled.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; He needed to overcome that temptation to
[56:47] the minute he was to the hour he was
[56:49] dying.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; He had to keep overcoming temptation.
[56:52] Now,
[56:54] I'm going to I said it at the beginning.
[56:56] I'm going to point this out to you.
[56:58] Every single temptation category that
[57:00] Jesus went through, he went through it
[57:02] after he got the Holy Ghost.
[57:05] Everything.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean it's over. That
[57:08] doesn't mean your fight's over. You're
[57:09] going to keep fighting
[57:11] &gt;&gt; once you get the Holy Ghost.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; See, the Holy Ghost, it I'm not going to
[57:15] say it won't fight your battles. It will
[57:16] fight your battles. I'm not going to say
[57:18] it won't protect you. It will protect
[57:19] you. But God never promised that you're
[57:22] never gonna have temptations again. He
[57:25] promised a way of escape.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; He did not promise no temptation.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; You know, um the de the the the Holy
[57:33] Spirit, it gives you power to swim
[57:35] against the tide, but there's still
[57:36] going to be a tide. You're going to have
[57:38] resistance. Amen. Um Brother Brandham
[57:41] says in redemption by judgment,
[57:43] temptations come. There'll never be a
[57:45] temptation unless he give you grace to
[57:47] bear it. And he's promised to meet you
[57:49] on every battlefront right there and
[57:51] stand in your place. So then that's
[57:53] where your hope is at. You get to the
[57:55] place, you say, "Well, brother Bill,
[57:56] they have so many temptations. Tell me
[57:59] one Christian that doesn't have
[58:00] temptation. We never come to a picnic.
[58:03] We come to a battleground. We're out
[58:05] here to fight the enemy." Why? Sure. We
[58:08] don't put our armor on our armor just to
[58:10] be looked at. If you become a Christian
[58:11] just to be looked at, then I'm afraid
[58:14] you got in the wrong place.
[58:17] A couple more quotes. He says in Hebrews
[58:19] chapter 4, "Now, haven't you had a lot
[58:22] of temptations?" He's asking like,
[58:23] "Haven't you have a lot of temptations?"
[58:25] The answer to that is a rhetorical
[58:27] question. Yes. Yes. We've had a lot of
[58:29] temptations. Amen. Don't complain about
[58:32] them. And then a one-word sentence,
[58:34] rejoice.
[58:35] God is with you.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; He is trying to prove your faith.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Next one, uh, quote, it's in questions
[58:44] and answers 61.
[58:46] Someone asked this question. I thought
[58:47] it was beautiful. I I said I couldn't
[58:49] leave that out. He said, this person
[58:51] says, "Is it possible for a Holy
[58:55] Ghostfilled person to be driven by the
[58:58] driven by the to I'm pretty sure he says
[59:00] driven by the devil to do minor things,
[59:03] influenced to do minor things that he
[59:06] doesn't want to do." Brother Brandham
[59:08] says with an exclamation point, "Oh yes,
[59:11] yes, sir. Yeah, a holy ghost fil person,
[59:14] you're right in the place then to be
[59:16] drove by these things. You just put
[59:19] yourself up a target. When you're down
[59:21] there serving the devil, he just lets
[59:22] you slouch around any way you want to.
[59:24] But once you take a stand for Christ,
[59:26] you you got on the other side. Then he
[59:29] trains every gun right around on you.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Every temptation, everything that could
[59:34] be throwed on you that then you got it.
[59:36] So those times when I was young and
[59:39] trying to follow the Lord. So, first
[59:41] off, defending the Lord, I I was scared
[59:43] to start defending Jesus. Um, I didn't
[59:47] really catch on until I was older that I
[59:49] didn't really need to. But, uh, another
[59:51] thing about the temptation is what was
[59:53] causing me to slip back cuz one thing
[59:55] like my an example of what me and my
[59:57] siblings got up to a lot. Um, praise the
[1:00:00] Lord, we're delivered of this, but we
[1:00:02] used to listen to bad music. And um uh
[1:00:07] because we listen to bad music and I
[1:00:10] engaged in a lot of uh piracy. Yes. Um,
[1:00:15] I didn't pay for this music
[1:00:17] and I had, you know, we we had a
[1:00:20] computer our g our dad let us have was
[1:00:22] an old beat up computer and
[1:00:26] uh somehow we'd like hustle and get an
[1:00:28] internet connection and then we'd get it
[1:00:29] on there and then pirate all we could
[1:00:31] download all the music we could and then
[1:00:32] we'd listen to that bad music and it
[1:00:34] would be the worst thing. And um I I
[1:00:38] remember that every time I felt a call
[1:00:41] on me that God was calling me, I knew
[1:00:43] the music had to go. So I would delete
[1:00:45] all the music and then uh I don't know 6
[1:00:49] months later I have all the music back
[1:00:51] again. Why? Because I thought that
[1:00:54] temptation was gone. And no, I didn't
[1:00:56] have the Holy Ghost. But I thought, "Oh
[1:00:58] yeah, I've deleted it. That's the end.
[1:00:59] I'm never going to have to worry about
[1:01:00] that again."
[1:01:02] young people, old people, doesn't matter
[1:01:04] who you are. Um, I struggle with music
[1:01:07] to this day. Like, to this day, it's
[1:01:10] something I can't I can't pretend I
[1:01:13] don't know that song. If I'm walking in
[1:01:15] the supermarket, there it goes. If I'm
[1:01:17] sitting in a restaurant, there it goes.
[1:01:19] It's not that I'm singing this out. I
[1:01:21] just recognize it. And then my brain's
[1:01:23] like an encyclopedia. It's like, "Oh, I
[1:01:24] know that singer. He also sang this. I
[1:01:26] know that singer. She also sang that.
[1:01:28] And then that means this. and that song
[1:01:30] goes with this and my mind is connecting
[1:01:32] things and I have to keep coming back
[1:01:34] and centering myself and you know I know
[1:01:36] those thoughts are going to come you're
[1:01:37] supposed to chase them away before they
[1:01:39] take root I have to fight that every day
[1:01:42] and I remember brother Brandom was
[1:01:44] talking to um Billy Paul whenever he was
[1:01:46] on the run and he had him stretch out
[1:01:48] his arms like this you know and he said
[1:01:50] as far as you run down that way as far
[1:01:53] as you run down that way God's going to
[1:01:55] have to bring you all the way back so
[1:01:56] the farther you run from him the more
[1:01:58] you get into The deeper you get into the
[1:02:00] things of the world, it's that much you
[1:02:02] have to fight to come right back. Amen.
[1:02:04] And it doesn't stop. It doesn't stop.
[1:02:08] You can ask your parents. They probably
[1:02:09] remember the songs from the
[1:02:14] decades before.
[1:02:17] They probably remember songs from back
[1:02:18] then.
[1:02:20] You hear them laughing. It's true.
[1:02:23] I used to used to listen to songs from
[1:02:25] every decade from the 20s all the way up
[1:02:27] to the 2000s and the 2010s. I was
[1:02:29] listening to bad music and I have to
[1:02:31] fight every genre of music I can think
[1:02:33] of. Don't put yourself in that
[1:02:35] situation. But at the same time
[1:02:37] recognize that the devil, like brother
[1:02:39] Brandham says, everybody has a one punch
[1:02:41] that you know you're going to get a
[1:02:43] punch. The devil will find something to
[1:02:44] hit you with. And um nobody's so much of
[1:02:47] a saint that they don't get tempted.
[1:02:49] Brother Brandham himself had a cross in
[1:02:51] his car to keep his eyes off the wrong
[1:02:54] thing. And that was in 1960 whatever.
[1:02:58] It's way worse right now. You can't walk
[1:03:00] anywhere without seeing the wrong thing.
[1:03:02] Um
[1:03:04] I'd have to close my eyes and walk
[1:03:05] blind. So um
[1:03:09] okay. And uh here's some encouragement
[1:03:12] for you. Acts of the Holy Spirit. He
[1:03:13] says, "And then the Holy Spirit then
[1:03:16] abides in and grows daily. just grows,
[1:03:18] making itself greater and greater,
[1:03:19] pushes out the things, the cares, the
[1:03:21] temptation. As you overcome them, the
[1:03:24] Holy Spirit takes its place. Do you know
[1:03:27] that if you got real bad temptation of
[1:03:29] something that's not right, overcome
[1:03:31] that thing a few times and watch if your
[1:03:33] testimony don't bloom on account of it?
[1:03:35] He never said in any of that that it's
[1:03:37] never coming back to tempt you. That he
[1:03:39] said just keep overcoming that. The
[1:03:42] temptation gets weaker and weaker. It
[1:03:44] does. I mean, it'll be there, but if you
[1:03:47] fill yourself up more with the Holy
[1:03:49] Ghost, say, "God, Lord, I do not want
[1:03:50] that thing. God, I'm trying to to get
[1:03:53] away from that, you think, you know, my
[1:03:55] heart, you know, I don't want to feed on
[1:03:56] that thing of the world." Then the Holy
[1:03:59] Spirit will will take that spot. He he
[1:04:01] he can give you grace to overcome that.
[1:04:04] The next one is a hard lesson, and I'm
[1:04:07] sure all the adults are going to
[1:04:08] identify with this. It says, uh, "God
[1:04:13] doesn't have to explain himself."
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And, um, that one was one that hit me
[1:04:20] pretty hard when I was about eight or
[1:04:22] nine years old, you know. Um, my, uh, my
[1:04:26] family, I've said it before, my family
[1:04:28] got deported. And when we were in Kenya,
[1:04:31] you know, I went from a first world
[1:04:32] country to at best like a second world
[1:04:35] country. And, um, we were poor there,
[1:04:38] pretty poor. And there were times, you
[1:04:40] know, uh where I'd be sitting out on my
[1:04:43] own and just balling my eyes out. And I
[1:04:46] remembered my school friends from over
[1:04:47] here. And I was I was just praying to
[1:04:49] God and I was like, "God, why didn't you
[1:04:52] deport them?" First off, they were, you
[1:04:55] know, from here.
[1:04:59] But in my little mind, like I didn't
[1:05:02] recognize that. It's like, well, God has
[1:05:04] a reason that my family had to be
[1:05:06] deported. And I have no idea what that
[1:05:08] is. And over and over throughout my
[1:05:11] family's life, every time we seemed like
[1:05:13] we were getting to a place of financial
[1:05:15] security, everything would get like the
[1:05:17] rub would be swept right from under us
[1:05:18] and then we back at square one over and
[1:05:21] over and over to the point where I have
[1:05:24] trouble in my mind just feeling like I'm
[1:05:27] safe financially. Like it's that bad
[1:05:30] because I'm always just looking around
[1:05:31] the corner. God, are you going to test
[1:05:33] me again? You know, I and I know he he
[1:05:36] he has the right to test me, but I don't
[1:05:38] understand why we had to go through all
[1:05:40] that. I don't know understand every
[1:05:43] little thing we had to go through, but
[1:05:45] um I do understand that uh I don't have
[1:05:49] to get an explanation from God, you
[1:05:51] know, and it did make me the person I am
[1:05:53] today. I'm grateful for that. But um I
[1:05:56] could have read it in a book and I would
[1:05:58] have got the same lesson.
[1:06:04] Um but God decided to do that to us. And
[1:06:07] you can look in your own lives and see
[1:06:08] what your families are going through.
[1:06:10] You can look through your, you know,
[1:06:12] adults and younger ones. Um you can look
[1:06:15] at your own self and be like, "Okay,
[1:06:17] God, why is this like this? Why does our
[1:06:20] church have to struggle through this?
[1:06:22] Why does my family have to go through
[1:06:23] this? And why do I have like you know
[1:06:25] there are some people who have a health
[1:06:27] problem like every single year they
[1:06:29] always have something new they're
[1:06:30] praying about as soon as one thing gets
[1:06:32] taken care of whether it be through the
[1:06:34] medical stuff or a miracle as soon as
[1:06:35] that's done something else pops up.
[1:06:37] Other people are dealing with financial
[1:06:39] stuff like us. Other people are dealing
[1:06:41] with social problems within their
[1:06:43] family. Um family problems and all that
[1:06:46] stuff. Everybody's got their own trial
[1:06:48] for some reason and God picked you and
[1:06:50] your character and he, you know, he
[1:06:52] tailor made those trials just for you.
[1:06:55] So, wear it like a suit, okay? Just get
[1:06:58] out there and be like, "God, you you
[1:07:00] gave me this and like I said, in every
[1:07:04] trial, there's a way of escape." And
[1:07:06] there's no reason that he gave it to me
[1:07:08] and didn't give me a way out.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Um, and didn't didn't have a reason,
[1:07:12] even if it's just known to him. I I
[1:07:14] remember Paul and I'm not going to read
[1:07:16] every scripture because I'm going to be
[1:07:18] running out of time if I do, but I
[1:07:20] remember Paul, he had that infirmity in
[1:07:22] his eyes. And he got to that point where
[1:07:26] uh and that came from his meeting with
[1:07:28] the Lord. And you would think, you know,
[1:07:30] God actually tells him to go to Ananas
[1:07:33] and Ananas gives him the Holy Spirit and
[1:07:35] then the scales fall off his eyes. You
[1:07:36] would think, hey, my vision's great. I'm
[1:07:39] going to go out there and I'm going to
[1:07:40] preach to everybody. Yeah, he did go out
[1:07:42] and preach to everybody, but God didn't
[1:07:44] completely take that away from him. And
[1:07:46] God had a reason for that. And God inh
[1:07:49] Paul prayed over and over and over and
[1:07:51] said, "God, why don't you take this from
[1:07:53] me?" And his answer doesn't really sound
[1:07:55] like an answer to me personally. He
[1:07:56] says, "My grace is sufficient." But he
[1:07:59] doesn't really say why.
[1:08:03] And his grace was sufficient. His grace
[1:08:05] is sufficient on us. Doesn't matter what
[1:08:07] you're going through, you still have
[1:08:09] God's grace. At least you have one
[1:08:12] thing. Doesn't matter how broke you are.
[1:08:14] Doesn't matter how sick you are. It
[1:08:16] doesn't matter how many things you've
[1:08:17] been struggling through. You have his
[1:08:19] grace and you can stand on that.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; God gave us his grace. And we don't have
[1:08:24] to um be be caught up in the little
[1:08:27] details of, okay, why do I have to
[1:08:29] struggle? Why is it that this person at
[1:08:31] church always has to come out and talk
[1:08:33] to me? I don't want to talk to them, but
[1:08:35] God, you always send them down my path.
[1:08:37] And I I hate talking to that guy. And um
[1:08:42] God knows why. Preaching from experience
[1:08:44] in case you can't tell, but uh God knows
[1:08:48] why.
[1:08:49] And uh in Philippians, well, he talks
[1:08:52] about his infirmity in uh Corinthians,
[1:08:54] but I'm going to read from Philippians.
[1:08:56] He says, "Not that I speak in respect of
[1:08:58] want, for I have learned in whatsoever
[1:09:00] state I am therewith to be content. I
[1:09:03] know both how to be abased. I know how
[1:09:05] to abound. Everywhere and in all things
[1:09:08] I am instructed both to be full and to
[1:09:10] be hungry, both to abound and to suffer
[1:09:12] need. I can do all things through Christ
[1:09:15] which strengthenth me. And I don't think
[1:09:19] Paul would have written that if he
[1:09:22] didn't have the infirmities. I don't
[1:09:25] think Paul would have written that if he
[1:09:26] hadn't been beaten and put in jail. I
[1:09:29] don't think Paul would have been would
[1:09:30] have been able to write that if he
[1:09:32] hadn't had some sort of experience that
[1:09:34] brought him to that place. So even if we
[1:09:36] don't know God's entire purpose, you can
[1:09:38] at least see what the result is and that
[1:09:41] is us getting closer to him. Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; And learning to rely on him. In acts of
[1:09:46] the Holy Spirit also, brother Brandham
[1:09:48] says, "Times may be hard. God has not
[1:09:50] promised a flower bed of ease, but he
[1:09:52] has promised grace sufficient for every
[1:09:54] trial that can hit you." That's right.
[1:09:56] Yeah. That right. That's right. Yes.
[1:09:58] Indeed. Grace is sufficient. Not he's on
[1:10:01] a flower bed of ease, but he promised
[1:10:03] grace to overcome in every temptation.
[1:10:06] When a cross gets heavy, Christ promised
[1:10:08] to be with you. When it gets heavy, he's
[1:10:11] going to be right there to help you
[1:10:12] carry that up. Okay, so that point was
[1:10:16] um God doesn't have to explain himself.
[1:10:20] My follow-up point is the next point is
[1:10:25] and that means I don't have to explain
[1:10:27] myself. Okay.
[1:10:29] So, when you start following God, you're
[1:10:32] going to act a little weird. Okay. Like
[1:10:34] I said, that's what I was scared of at
[1:10:36] the beginning when I was thinking I had
[1:10:37] to defend the Lord. I started acting
[1:10:40] weird to everybody else. I started doing
[1:10:42] things differently from everybody else.
[1:10:44] And the more I did that, like the more
[1:10:49] um it was easy to do that. It is pretty
[1:10:52] rough at the beginning, but when you
[1:10:54] start following God, your character, you
[1:10:55] know, you get the Holy Ghost or you get
[1:10:57] closer to him, your character has to go
[1:10:59] through a change and people will notice
[1:11:01] that change. It doesn't matter who you
[1:11:03] hang out with, the change is going to
[1:11:04] happen. And when that happens, um, don't
[1:11:08] be scared of it. Uh, but the right
[1:11:10] people will still stay with you and the
[1:11:13] wrong people will get away. Okay? Now, I
[1:11:17] I you know, I could have done a better
[1:11:19] job of witnessing. I always can.
[1:11:21] Everybody can probably do a better job
[1:11:23] of witnessing. But for me in that time
[1:11:26] period, because I had to turn away from
[1:11:28] so many things of the world, my mind
[1:11:30] wasn't really even on witnessing. I was
[1:11:31] like, God, help me figure this out cuz I
[1:11:35] need to figure this out right now. And
[1:11:37] when I was trying to figure that out,
[1:11:40] I was actually living the scripture,
[1:11:42] seek ye first the kingdom of God, and
[1:11:44] then everything will be added to you. So
[1:11:45] I was going to work and uh I was working
[1:11:48] in a warehouse environment about about
[1:11:50] the time when you know this lesson was
[1:11:52] learned. Um, and I was uh that's from
[1:11:56] about the age of 19
[1:12:00] uh probably 19 to 24 25 years old about
[1:12:06] th about those ages. And I thought uh
[1:12:09] the more I follow God, I'm going to have
[1:12:11] to explain it to everybody around me
[1:12:13] what I'm doing. If God led me to do
[1:12:16] something, I'd have to explain it to
[1:12:17] them. But then I started to turn a leaf
[1:12:20] and I started to say, "I'm tired of
[1:12:22] being fake." Because I realized that I
[1:12:25] had been living a life up until now that
[1:12:27] made Aaron a certain personality that
[1:12:29] everybody was used to. But once the word
[1:12:31] started coming in, I I felt like there
[1:12:34] were two things fighting in me. One side
[1:12:35] and the other side. There's this Aaron
[1:12:37] over here and this this Aaron I want to
[1:12:38] be and this Aaron that I am that
[1:12:40] everybody knows. And I had to keep
[1:12:41] changing my mask every time I came over
[1:12:44] to work and then change my mask when I
[1:12:46] go home. And um I started talking less
[1:12:48] and less at work because I I just didn't
[1:12:50] want to be saying the wrong thing like I
[1:12:52] used to. And then uh I just went quiet
[1:12:55] and true enough friends
[1:12:58] disappeared just like that.
[1:13:01] But then I got to this point where uh
[1:13:03] and I was in
[1:13:05] uh when from the warehouse environment I
[1:13:07] started working in a truck dispatch
[1:13:09] area. You know how truckers are and the
[1:13:11] dispatchers are no better. um at least
[1:13:13] the office I was working in, you know,
[1:13:16] everybody just cussing all day and all
[1:13:17] that stuff going on. It was a very toxic
[1:13:19] environment. And um one day I
[1:13:23] interviewed for seven jobs and uh sorry,
[1:13:27] I applied to seven jobs and I only got
[1:13:29] an interview for one. And when I got on
[1:13:32] that call to interview, it was a remote
[1:13:35] interview. I got on the call to
[1:13:36] interview and uh we go through the
[1:13:39] interview process. I'm answering
[1:13:40] questions like I always do and then they
[1:13:42] asked me a question and keep in mind I
[1:13:44] hadn't finished school, nothing. I
[1:13:46] hadn't done anything like that. Um, I
[1:13:49] never finished school and I was trying
[1:13:51] to get a job that would pay a lot more
[1:13:52] money and it was a technical job. So,
[1:13:54] you should have done some school and um
[1:13:57] they asked me this question at the end
[1:13:59] of the interview. What do you value?
[1:14:02] And you know, all the years of my life
[1:14:04] had passed me by and I like flashed
[1:14:07] through my head and I'm like in my head
[1:14:09] I was tired of coming up with corporate
[1:14:11] answers. Oh, I value, you know,
[1:14:13] competitiveness within our, you know,
[1:14:15] uh, within our industry. I value us
[1:14:18] growing forward as a company. And I
[1:14:20] could have said any of those things that
[1:14:21] sounded great on paper, right? And in my
[1:14:24] head, I was like, okay, I'm going to be
[1:14:26] honest. I'm a Christian and I value
[1:14:28] Christ. I value living for Jesus. I
[1:14:30] value like walking in his way. So I said
[1:14:32] that. They said, "Okay, thanks. Gone."
[1:14:35] You know, they hung up. And while I had
[1:14:37] worked in this where in this company for
[1:14:39] 7 years, um, everybody had been
[1:14:42] everywhere I'd been working was toxic.
[1:14:44] So I was like, I'm just going to be
[1:14:45] honest. If I get that job, then I'm
[1:14:48] going to be a different Aaron there from
[1:14:49] where I've been over here this whole
[1:14:51] time. I was like, it's a new leaf. It's
[1:14:53] changed. So when I told them that, they
[1:14:56] offered me the job a little bit later
[1:14:58] and I was like, "Okay, I got the job. I
[1:15:00] worked there for two months
[1:15:02] and then the guy who interviewed me, he
[1:15:04] calls me up and we were talking and then
[1:15:06] he said, "Do you know why you got this
[1:15:08] job?" And I said, "I don't know cuz I I
[1:15:10] haven't done any school. I haven't done
[1:15:12] anything. I'm not qualified." And he
[1:15:13] said, "We interviewed a bunch of other
[1:15:15] people, but when we asked you that
[1:15:17] question, what you valued, that's what
[1:15:19] got you the job. None of the other stuff
[1:15:21] you did." And he said, "It's cuz he was
[1:15:24] a Christian and my manager was with him
[1:15:27] was also a Christian. And when they
[1:15:29] heard that, they're like, "Oh, it's a
[1:15:31] keeper." And I was I was the very first
[1:15:34] person to get interviewed for that job.
[1:15:36] And they just like went through the
[1:15:38] motions with everybody else and just
[1:15:39] picked me.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; And I was like, "Okay, well, uh, okay.
[1:15:45] There's a different errand.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; That's what it means to seek first the
[1:15:50] kingdom of God and everything will be
[1:15:52] added because he's going to take care of
[1:15:54] those details." He said, "Live for me."
[1:15:56] That's it.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; So, I didn't have to explain myself by
[1:15:59] giving a weird answer to most of the
[1:16:01] world and just say, "I'm a Christian and
[1:16:03] I value Christ. I value serving Jesus.
[1:16:05] That's my value." Now, some of you, I
[1:16:08] don't know, extroverts or expert
[1:16:09] witnessers or whatever you do in the
[1:16:11] church. Some of you probably don't even
[1:16:13] think that sounds hard to do because,
[1:16:15] you know, you're just always out the
[1:16:16] mouth, you know, just teaching about
[1:16:17] Jesus. But me, my personality,
[1:16:20] especially at that point in life, I
[1:16:22] could not have done that without him. It
[1:16:25] took him to tell help me help me out in
[1:16:27] that moment cuz that was a struggle. It
[1:16:29] was a big struggle to just uh step back
[1:16:32] and be like, "God, you got this. I'm
[1:16:34] just going to throw that out there." And
[1:16:36] uh by God's grace, this this is the best
[1:16:38] job I've ever had. I still work in that
[1:16:40] department. So, that's great. Um still
[1:16:43] ain't finished school. So
[1:16:46] uh
[1:16:48] he says in first John he says behold
[1:16:51] what manner of love the father hath
[1:16:52] bestowed on us that we should be called
[1:16:54] the sons of god. Therefore the world
[1:16:56] knoweth thus not because it knew him
[1:16:58] not. The world didn't understand Jesus
[1:17:00] so don't expect them to understand you.
[1:17:03] And Jesus didn't really explain
[1:17:05] everything he was doing. If you think of
[1:17:07] the examples like of people asking Jesus
[1:17:09] questions like I said he had a sassy
[1:17:11] mouth. And one of the things that he
[1:17:14] said um one of the things that happened
[1:17:17] was Nicodemus came to him by night and
[1:17:18] he's like uh Jesus you know uh we know
[1:17:21] that they that thou art the come from
[1:17:23] God you know he says something like that
[1:17:25] because no man can do what you do
[1:17:26] without God's help and um Jesus he he
[1:17:31] answers the question in a beautiful way.
[1:17:32] We just read that the other night and um
[1:17:35] he answers the question by not even
[1:17:37] addressing the question which is what
[1:17:39] Jesus did a lot you know and he says
[1:17:43] verily verily without um sorry I forgot
[1:17:46] what he said yeah you must be born again
[1:17:49] that doesn't address what Nicodemus just
[1:17:51] said that's not an answer Nicodemus
[1:17:54] comes back with another question and
[1:17:55] Jesus says something else it's not an
[1:17:58] answer to what Nicodemus just said and
[1:18:00] Jesus didn't explain what he said And if
[1:18:03] you if you go to the tapes, uh I don't
[1:18:05] remember what tape it is exactly, but
[1:18:06] brother Brandham says he he was glad
[1:18:10] that people didn't understand
[1:18:11] everything. No, no, no, my bad. Brother
[1:18:14] Brandham must have said that. But Jesus
[1:18:15] said that he's happy that people don't
[1:18:18] understand and it's been hidden from the
[1:18:21] eyes of the wise and prudent because for
[1:18:24] babes such as we'll learn. So a lot of
[1:18:26] the stuff he was saying was just going
[1:18:27] over people's heads and it's supposed to
[1:18:29] be that way. You know, the more you live
[1:18:32] for Christ, the less the world is going
[1:18:33] to look like you and understand you. And
[1:18:36] that comes back to my point of, you
[1:18:38] know, the word the word will defend you.
[1:18:42] Doesn't matter what you're doing or
[1:18:43] where you are in life. If you stand for
[1:18:44] him and he's led you to do what you're
[1:18:46] supposed to be doing, um then the word
[1:18:49] will defend you. It's his job. Um
[1:18:55] yeah. To this point, actually, I'm going
[1:18:57] to drive this home. If God tells you to
[1:19:00] do something,
[1:19:02] if it be through the word or if it be
[1:19:04] through the prophet, whoever he sends to
[1:19:06] tell you to do that thing, stick with
[1:19:09] what he told you to do, regardless of
[1:19:11] who tries to come against you. Right?
[1:19:13] And I found a pattern that God, if he
[1:19:18] tells you to do through something
[1:19:19] through a channel,
[1:19:22] if he wants you to change what you're
[1:19:24] doing, he's going to end up using that
[1:19:25] same channel. Did you ever notice that?
[1:19:28] If God has a commandment for me that
[1:19:30] comes from the message and it says to do
[1:19:34] such and such or the word of God and it
[1:19:36] says to do such and such, I'm not going
[1:19:38] to go listen to something on, you know,
[1:19:40] Brother Jack always says, "Don't
[1:19:41] Google." I'm not going to go out there
[1:19:43] and Google something because Google's
[1:19:45] not going to tell me. It's not going to
[1:19:46] line up with what where where I got this
[1:19:48] from. Where I got it from is the message
[1:19:50] in the word.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; So, I need to go back to that same
[1:19:53] channel and find out if God changed his
[1:19:56] mind. And if he didn't, keep doing what
[1:19:58] he told you to do. Simple, right? Now,
[1:20:01] an example is if you go to first kings
[1:20:03] uh 13, you don't have to, but uh if you
[1:20:05] go to first kings 13, there is this
[1:20:07] young man with a really powerful
[1:20:09] ministry. Right? And uh he was sent to
[1:20:13] talk to King Jeroboam. Now, Jeroboam was
[1:20:15] like, you know, the guy who ruined every
[1:20:18] kingdom. I mean, every uh the entire
[1:20:20] dynasty for the rest of Israel um
[1:20:23] throughout the book of Kings. And God
[1:20:25] sends this young man to speak to him.
[1:20:28] And the young man is a prophet. Really
[1:20:30] powerful ministry. So, uh, verse one, it
[1:20:33] says, "And behold, there came a man out
[1:20:34] of God out of Judah." This is the young
[1:20:36] man, "A man of God out of Judah by the
[1:20:38] word of the Lord unto Bethl. And
[1:20:41] Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn
[1:20:43] incense." So, Jeroboam was the king. He
[1:20:45] was burning an an idolatrous uh
[1:20:48] sacrifice, and he was leading people
[1:20:50] away from God. Whether or not he
[1:20:51] understood it or not, he was doing that.
[1:20:54] And this young man uh like the verse
[1:20:58] says, he came by the word of God, the
[1:21:00] word of the Lord. So the Lord had told
[1:21:01] him with his own words, go and tell
[1:21:04] Jeroboam such and such. Now when he
[1:21:06] tells Jeroboam this prophecy, he tells
[1:21:08] him, hey, there's going to be a king
[1:21:09] named Josiah. He's going to kick you
[1:21:11] out. He's going to break this altar.
[1:21:12] Stuff like that. He said a lot of stuff
[1:21:14] that Jeroboam didn't like. So Jeroboam
[1:21:18] raises his hand. He's like, "Size that
[1:21:20] man." Now his ministry was so powerful
[1:21:23] that his hand withered up whenever he
[1:21:26] was pointing at you know at this young
[1:21:28] prophet. It withered up and he wasn't
[1:21:31] even able to use it. So he asked the
[1:21:33] prophet hey go uh can you please pray
[1:21:36] for my hand
[1:21:38] and then the hand comes normal and then
[1:21:41] he realizes okay I can't just attack
[1:21:44] this man cuz everybody just saw that and
[1:21:47] that was embarrassing right? So he's
[1:21:50] like, "Okay, let me play host." So he
[1:21:53] says, "Hey, young man, come over to my
[1:21:55] place. You going to cook you a good
[1:21:56] meal. You're gonna make you a steak. You
[1:21:58] going sit down there? You going to
[1:21:59] sleep?" He said all that stuff. And the
[1:22:02] young man sticks with his ministry.
[1:22:03] Amen. He sticks with the word of the
[1:22:05] Lord that was told to him.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Verily, you know, I don't
[1:22:08] think he said verily, verily, but he
[1:22:10] said something along those lines." He
[1:22:11] says, "I can't turn aside because God
[1:22:15] told me with his words, I'm not supposed
[1:22:17] to turn left or right. I'm not supposed
[1:22:19] to take any hospitality. The way I came
[1:22:22] here is not the way I'm supposed to go.
[1:22:24] I'm supposed to go another way home. I
[1:22:26] don't want people to get used to me on
[1:22:27] that track and then invite me in. I'm
[1:22:29] supposed to come this way. If I came on
[1:22:31] jog, I'm leaving on Okchobee. Does that
[1:22:33] make sense? I don't know who. Close
[1:22:36] enough. Okay. Yeah. If I came on one
[1:22:38] road, I'm leaving on the other. Okay.
[1:22:41] Now, when he told the king that, you
[1:22:43] know, he's following the word and he's
[1:22:45] just like walking on his way. And then
[1:22:47] he gets to this point and uh there's an
[1:22:51] older prophet
[1:22:53] and the older prophet he talks to his
[1:22:55] sons. He says, "Oh, there was a young
[1:22:56] prophet. Okay, let me find this guy." So
[1:22:58] he hops on top of a donkey or mule,
[1:23:00] whatever it was, and follows after him.
[1:23:02] He finds him. He's like, "Hey, come to
[1:23:04] my house." You know, and uh in verse 13
[1:23:08] of the same chapter, no, sorry, verse 18
[1:23:10] of the same chapter, he said unto him,
[1:23:12] "I am a prophet." Now, now the young
[1:23:15] man, he told him what the what he told
[1:23:17] the king. God said, 'I'm not supposed to
[1:23:19] go with you anywhere. Now the older
[1:23:22] prophet, he said unto him, I am a
[1:23:23] prophet also as thou art. And an angel
[1:23:26] spake unto me by the word of the Lord,
[1:23:28] saying, Bring him back with me into
[1:23:30] thine house, that he may eat bread and
[1:23:32] drink water. But he lied unto him. So he
[1:23:36] went back with him and did eat bread in
[1:23:37] the house and drank water. So the young
[1:23:39] man, he's like, "Oh, snap. I'm a
[1:23:41] prophet. God talked to me. I'm not gonna
[1:23:43] pretend that God only talks to me. You
[1:23:45] know, that's a good spirit, right? God
[1:23:47] doesn't just give me the word. Came the
[1:23:48] word of me to me only. Word of God to me
[1:23:50] only. No.
[1:23:52] But at the same time, if God had wanted
[1:23:56] him to stop and stay with that
[1:23:58] hospitality,
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; he would have come the same way
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; he told him the first time.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; So, the word of the Lord would have come
[1:24:05] to him and said, "You know what? Never
[1:24:07] mind. Go hang out with this dude."
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; But he didn't follow that. So, he was
[1:24:12] dead the next day. I'm not going to say
[1:24:14] you're going to die every time you
[1:24:15] disobey God. But he was dead. He did. He
[1:24:18] didn't go home. And God actually used
[1:24:20] the the mouth of that older prophet to
[1:24:23] tell him, "Thus sayeth the Lord, you're
[1:24:24] going to die cuz you disobeyed God."
[1:24:27] He's the one who lied to him. Now, I
[1:24:29] know this will be controversial, but
[1:24:31] hang with me. Don't stand up and walk
[1:24:32] out.
[1:24:34] If you are with the word, young people,
[1:24:37] and God showed you to do something and
[1:24:40] it lines up with his word and you know
[1:24:41] he's talking to you, do that.
[1:24:45] And it doesn't matter who tells you not
[1:24:47] to do that thing.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if it's your parents.
[1:24:52] It doesn't matter if it's your
[1:24:53] grandparents. It doesn't matter if it's
[1:24:56] a preacher. It doesn't matter if it's
[1:24:57] me. If I say something that's off the
[1:24:59] word and God told you to do something
[1:25:00] else and you can prove it by the word,
[1:25:02] ignore me, please.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; And it might be a little controversial
[1:25:06] for you y'all older folks who are
[1:25:08] parents and who are grandparents, but
[1:25:09] that's just a challenge to you to only
[1:25:11] tell your kids what's in the word.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Okay? That's your job. That's my job.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; We got to take it seriously. So if if
[1:25:20] you have a decision, don't make the
[1:25:21] decision for your young person or child
[1:25:24] or nephew, aunt or grandchild. If you
[1:25:27] have a decision to help them out, then I
[1:25:29] have no idea why I'm playing with this
[1:25:31] handkerchief. Um, that's really strange.
[1:25:34] I just realized I've been doing this for
[1:25:35] an hour. Okay. Um, if you have a
[1:25:38] decision and it doesn't come from the
[1:25:40] word,
[1:25:43] then you have to ask yourself what your
[1:25:45] motive is. Is it just like your emotions
[1:25:47] that are causing you to tell them that?
[1:25:50] Did God lead you in that situation to
[1:25:51] speak to them that way?
[1:25:54] Or did he put a lying spirit on you to
[1:25:57] tell your child something that's wrong?
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be the test that your
[1:26:02] child is going through. I don't want to
[1:26:04] be the test for somebody else.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; No, I want to be on the word.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Um that holds true. The same pattern
[1:26:13] holds true. Whenever um what's his name?
[1:26:16] King Hezekiah was talking to Isaiah.
[1:26:19] Isaiah comes and tells him, "Hey, get
[1:26:21] your house in order. you're going to
[1:26:23] die. And uh Hezekiah turns and he starts
[1:26:27] praying to the Lord. And this is the
[1:26:28] prophet of God who had actually had God
[1:26:32] tell him verbatim him what to tell
[1:26:34] Hezekiah. And he says, "Hey, thus sayith
[1:26:36] the Lord, you're going to die." And
[1:26:38] Hezekiah after he prays, um God has an
[1:26:42] answer for him and changes the
[1:26:43] situation. He says, "Okay, I'm going to
[1:26:44] give you 15 more years and you're going
[1:26:46] to be victorious over your enemy. 15
[1:26:48] years. Um so you're you're going to be
[1:26:51] fine." But the way he did that, he
[1:26:53] didn't call some other prophet.
[1:26:56] He didn't call some other person way out
[1:26:57] there. No. And if you if you go to the
[1:27:00] book of Kings, it's counted twice. Once
[1:27:02] in Isaiah and once in Kings. If you go
[1:27:04] to the Kings version in Kings, it says
[1:27:06] Isaiah was still in the middle court. He
[1:27:08] hadn't left the building yet. And God
[1:27:10] said, "Turn around. I got something to
[1:27:12] tell this man's." And he sent Isaiah
[1:27:14] back to tell him, "You got 15 more
[1:27:17] years."
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; The the outlet didn't change.
[1:27:22] And our one outlet is going to be the
[1:27:24] word of God. It's going to be the
[1:27:26] message.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; So if that told me to do something one
[1:27:29] way, the only way that that's going to
[1:27:32] change is if I find it in the word of
[1:27:34] God
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; or in the message.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; That's the only way that's going to
[1:27:38] change.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] Um
[1:27:43] now I and I'm and you have to
[1:27:45] distinguish that young people and older
[1:27:47] people you have to distinguish the
[1:27:49] difference between okay Aaron you know
[1:27:52] up here he was preaching and he had a
[1:27:54] slip of the tongue informational
[1:27:56] something wrong and he said one thing
[1:27:58] one time a year and a half ago when he
[1:28:00] preached here but he said the opposite
[1:28:01] this time when he's preaching here. I'm
[1:28:03] not the word of God. I'm here to bring
[1:28:05] the word of God to you and I might make
[1:28:07] mistakes,
[1:28:08] but um it's not the same thing. So, if I
[1:28:12] come back and tell you something that's
[1:28:13] the opposite, please approach me with
[1:28:15] love and say, "Hey, you said something
[1:28:16] here that you said the opposite of over
[1:28:18] here that looks different. What are you
[1:28:19] talking about?" I might have a way to
[1:28:21] balance it out that I understood but
[1:28:22] didn't actually tell you or something I
[1:28:25] said might have beenformationally wrong,
[1:28:27] but the word of God is not going to lead
[1:28:29] you the wrong way. It's not going to
[1:28:31] turn you around in the opposite
[1:28:32] direction.
[1:28:34] And and about explaining myself, other
[1:28:38] people don't need to explain themselves
[1:28:40] to you.
[1:28:42] Am I right? You know, a lot of people
[1:28:44] have a problem with the way the messages
[1:28:46] um because of the messenger. They have a
[1:28:48] problem with the messenger. They have a
[1:28:50] problem with the way with who he was.
[1:28:52] They say, "Oh, why would a white prophet
[1:28:54] have something for me? I'm black or I'm
[1:28:56] Asian or I'm from this country that some
[1:28:58] guy in Kentucky. Why would he have
[1:28:59] something for me?" They get caught up
[1:29:01] with the messenger and then forget
[1:29:03] about, you know, it's the message. It's
[1:29:05] not the messenger. And they'll talk
[1:29:08] about brother Brandham's failings
[1:29:10] because he was human. As nice as he was
[1:29:12] a guy, as much as I want to meet him
[1:29:14] when I get to heaven, as cool as I think
[1:29:16] he was and amazing as an example, he had
[1:29:18] failures because he was a man. And I
[1:29:21] have to accept that. now because he was
[1:29:25] a man and he had failures um they just
[1:29:28] throw away the entire message cuz they
[1:29:30] can't deal with those failures
[1:29:33] you know um
[1:29:35] and to that point uh I feel like wait
[1:29:40] hang on where was I going with that yes
[1:29:41] he had failures um if you actually look
[1:29:45] back at the other prophets in the Bible
[1:29:47] they had a lot uglier failures than
[1:29:49] brother Brandham did like and and people
[1:29:52] just read through the Bible and accept
[1:29:54] what they said. They'll flip right over
[1:29:56] to the book of Hosea.
[1:30:01] That guy who married a prostitute
[1:30:04] and then he was told to go take a
[1:30:06] concubine while he was married to that
[1:30:08] prostitute in another chapter and like,
[1:30:11] "Oh yeah, Hosea said this. Yeah, we can
[1:30:13] quote that." And then you show them the
[1:30:15] table and they flip out.
[1:30:18] It's like,
[1:30:20] are you serious?
[1:30:22] The double standard here is just crazy.
[1:30:27] I can't even believe it. Oh, he slipped.
[1:30:29] He had a slip of the tongue back in, I
[1:30:31] don't know, 47. I just can't follow the
[1:30:33] rest of this because he messed something
[1:30:35] up. He said 700 instead of 7,000. Like,
[1:30:38] come on now.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; It's a man. It's not Jesus.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] those same people and you can easily
[1:30:48] point out in like different things. You
[1:30:51] could go to uh the gospels and I
[1:30:54] actually did this because I was trying
[1:30:55] to do a study and I I got a Bible that
[1:30:58] has the gospels in chronological order.
[1:30:59] So it'll take a verse from John and the
[1:31:01] same verse from Matthew, Mark, Luke and
[1:31:03] you know line them all up like that and
[1:31:05] it went chronologically and then you'd
[1:31:07] read their accounts and it's just like
[1:31:09] huh there's something a little different
[1:31:10] here. It's like who was the first person
[1:31:12] at the tomb? I can't tell, you know. And
[1:31:16] it's it it's a man who wrote it down.
[1:31:19] The point is somebody was at the tomb.
[1:31:22] The point is someone came out of the
[1:31:23] tomb. Don't miss the point because
[1:31:26] you're worried about those little
[1:31:27] details.
[1:31:29] The point is there's an open tomb and a
[1:31:31] guy who should be dead is not. That's
[1:31:34] the point.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; And people just read the gospels like,
[1:31:38] "Yeah, sure, brother. That was great."
[1:31:40] and then show them a message book.
[1:31:43] It's all the word and it was all sent to
[1:31:45] us. I know throughout this sermon
[1:31:49] I I keep saying, "Oh yeah, I look in the
[1:31:51] word or the message." I'm not saying
[1:31:52] that the word is the message is not the
[1:31:54] word. I'm not saying that. I hope nobody
[1:31:55] gets that. Um to me, they're the same.
[1:31:58] If I if I if I come up here and I'm
[1:32:00] reading something and I want to be
[1:32:01] certain of it, I'm going to pull it from
[1:32:02] the Bible or a message book because I
[1:32:04] believe the message has the word of God
[1:32:06] in there. It's not I don't have a
[1:32:08] problem with it. To me, it's the same
[1:32:09] thing. I just uh distinguished verbally
[1:32:10] so you know what I mean. Now the very
[1:32:13] last point um and I I think this plagues
[1:32:17] young people definitely by the time they
[1:32:20] hit uh teenage years um give me a
[1:32:24] second.
[1:32:33] definitely by the time they hit their
[1:32:34] teenage years because um when you're
[1:32:37] younger everything's black and white,
[1:32:39] right? God said do this, don't do that.
[1:32:42] It's simple. You know, the word of God
[1:32:43] says do this, don't do that. And the
[1:32:46] older you get, the more you realize that
[1:32:48] there are uh
[1:32:50] uh things that you might have questions
[1:32:53] about that you don't see a scripture in
[1:32:55] the Bible that verbally tells you
[1:32:57] exactly what to do in that exact moment.
[1:32:59] And people call those gray areas because
[1:33:02] people have different interpretations.
[1:33:04] An example is like modesty. How short
[1:33:06] should your skirt be? There's no ruler
[1:33:09] for that. There's no verse that says,
[1:33:11] you know, 2 feet, 10 in, whatever.
[1:33:13] There's nothing like that. It doesn't
[1:33:15] say how tall are you? Well, your dress
[1:33:16] should be that long. There's nothing
[1:33:18] about that. Um, and the older you get,
[1:33:21] the more you realize that people will
[1:33:23] have different impressions and leadings
[1:33:25] from you. So, my last category is this
[1:33:29] one. It says, "Having questions is
[1:33:32] bittersweet."
[1:33:34] And uh I'm going to explain that to you.
[1:33:36] I'm going to use as short a time as
[1:33:38] possible. I want to be conscious of
[1:33:39] time, but um
[1:33:42] especially by the time kids get to be
[1:33:44] teenagers. Uh and definitely for me, I I
[1:33:49] you know, you're taught in a good
[1:33:51] scriptural church, you're taught that
[1:33:52] you should go to the word to find
[1:33:53] answers for everything. The the word
[1:33:55] should give answers. And I've said that
[1:33:56] multiple times in this sermon right now.
[1:33:58] Stand with the word. And that's
[1:33:59] important. That's great. Um, but
[1:34:02] sometimes we don't understand something
[1:34:03] about the word. So, you go to a church
[1:34:05] leader or you go to your parents or you
[1:34:07] go to you go to somebody to get an
[1:34:09] answer. Now, the reason questions are
[1:34:12] bittersweet is because I think questions
[1:34:15] are amazing. That's how I learned so
[1:34:17] much about the word because I had
[1:34:19] questions and I was like, "Every answer
[1:34:21] is in there. Great. Open that Bible. Let
[1:34:23] me find it." I'm the kind of person to
[1:34:25] be like, "Yes, I believe that and I'm
[1:34:26] going to find it in there because it
[1:34:28] will be in there. And if not that, then
[1:34:30] I'm going to pray to God and he'll
[1:34:31] answer that for me." Or I'll listen to
[1:34:33] sermons. I'll listen to tapes. I'll do
[1:34:34] what I can and I'll find that answer.
[1:34:36] And I I find that in the church world,
[1:34:38] there are two kinds of people. They're
[1:34:40] curious ones.
[1:34:43] No offense to the ones who don't seem to
[1:34:45] be as curious. They're the curious ones
[1:34:46] who will go to the Bible and they'll be
[1:34:48] like flipping through there and go to
[1:34:49] the message, try to find answers. And
[1:34:51] then there the other ones who think all
[1:34:53] they need is faith. And so they'll just
[1:34:54] be like, "Oh, bless God. I just believe
[1:34:56] it. That's all." Don't ask questions.
[1:34:58] Just believe it. I believe it, brother.
[1:34:59] I don't care. I don't I I believe it.
[1:35:01] Every time you ask them a question, they
[1:35:03] don't really have a straight answer for
[1:35:05] you. And they say, "I believe it." And
[1:35:08] true, faith is important. Faith will get
[1:35:11] you saved. Faith is great. But knowledge
[1:35:14] is on the stature of a perfect man for a
[1:35:16] reason.
[1:35:18] Jesus said, "Search the scriptures for
[1:35:20] in them you think you have eternal
[1:35:21] life." Why do you think that? Because
[1:35:23] you know something that you sought out.
[1:35:25] So you need to find something in the
[1:35:27] scripture for yourself. So there I'm not
[1:35:29] saying curiosity is God to me. I don't
[1:35:32] think cur those who are curious are
[1:35:34] perfect people. I'm not saying people
[1:35:35] who just go on faith are perfect people.
[1:35:37] I'm saying there's a balance somewhere
[1:35:39] in the middle where if you are prone to
[1:35:42] be faithful and uh constantly just
[1:35:45] believe the word, that's a good strong
[1:35:47] place to start. But if a younger person,
[1:35:50] and I'm talking to parents right this
[1:35:51] moment, if a younger person talks to you
[1:35:53] and asks you questions and you just
[1:35:55] don't have answers, search the scripture
[1:35:58] with them cuz they might be a curious
[1:36:01] person and you're just shutting them
[1:36:03] down, saying, "Just believe it. Just
[1:36:04] believe it." that young person, all
[1:36:06] they're going to get is a legalistic
[1:36:08] doctrine.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; It grows into legalism because instead
[1:36:12] of finding answers of why we do certain
[1:36:14] things in church and why we don't do
[1:36:15] certain things, you're just saying
[1:36:17] believe it and you're not even have you
[1:36:19] don't have a scriptural base for
[1:36:20] anything you did. If you listen to all,
[1:36:23] you know, I don't know, is it 1181 or
[1:36:25] 1,200 messages? I can't remember how
[1:36:27] many messages there are. Um, but if you
[1:36:29] listen to all of those, you never hear
[1:36:31] brother Brandon preach a topic or talk
[1:36:33] about a topic without referencing the
[1:36:35] word. Why? Because he sought it out and
[1:36:37] then he brought it out to you. And it
[1:36:39] didn't matter which angel of the Lord,
[1:36:41] you know, came and told him that. It
[1:36:43] doesn't matter when he does that because
[1:36:45] brother Brandon will take everything he
[1:36:46] heard from the angel of the Lord and
[1:36:48] open his Bible immediately and search
[1:36:50] down each thing and be like, "Wow,
[1:36:51] you're right."
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Why? because he needed to search the
[1:36:55] scriptures to make sure his experience
[1:36:57] matched up with the scripture.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; But at the same time, those who are
[1:37:01] curious, the reason I said it's
[1:37:02] bittersweet is because God wants you to
[1:37:05] be curious because the more you know the
[1:37:07] word, the more you know him. That's
[1:37:09] great. The devil wants you to be curious
[1:37:13] because if you choose the wrong source
[1:37:15] to answer your question, he will take
[1:37:16] you down the wrong path. Right? So qu
[1:37:20] questions are great. I love it when
[1:37:21] young people have questions. even when I
[1:37:23] can't answer them. I was in a Sunday
[1:37:25] school class and young people, they
[1:37:26] started asking me, "Why does the Bible
[1:37:28] say unicorns and what is that about?"
[1:37:30] And I was just like, "I don't know. Why
[1:37:33] does the Bible say unicorns? I don't
[1:37:35] know what they're talking about." Um, I
[1:37:38] think they were talking about some other
[1:37:39] mythical creatures that were in the
[1:37:41] Bible. I was just like, I don't know
[1:37:43] what to tell you, but I mean, we looked
[1:37:45] together and it's interesting that
[1:37:47] that's there. That's cool. I can't tell
[1:37:49] you why they're there. Um, but guess
[1:37:52] what? We had a great discussion. And I
[1:37:54] could be honest with them. I didn't just
[1:37:55] tell them, "Oh, just be quiet. Just
[1:37:57] believe it.
[1:37:59] Believe the unicorns."
[1:38:01] Like, what's the plan here?
[1:38:05] No, that wasn't going to help them in
[1:38:06] that moment. They had questions. And
[1:38:09] I've had young people who come to Becca
[1:38:11] and I and they want counseling. They're
[1:38:12] like, "Okay, every time I have questions
[1:38:14] about the Bible or the message, my
[1:38:16] parents just tell me to believe it. Now,
[1:38:17] what am I supposed to do?" Amen. It's
[1:38:20] just like, well, you should believe it,
[1:38:22] but I don't don't shut them down.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; You know, um, as Christians, we we tend
[1:38:29] to be uh the more you grow into a
[1:38:33] Christian, the the more faith you can
[1:38:35] have in God because you've lived with
[1:38:36] him and you've dealt with him, you've
[1:38:37] had that relationship, you know. Um,
[1:38:41] but, uh, that should be a strength. It
[1:38:43] shouldn't be a weakness. It shouldn't be
[1:38:45] a weakness to the point where it's just
[1:38:47] like, oh yeah, just do what God said.
[1:38:49] Just, you know, if you're if you don't
[1:38:51] know about it, don't do it. You know,
[1:38:52] Brother Brandon does say that in the
[1:38:54] message. If you if you don't have an
[1:38:56] answer and you're not sure about whether
[1:38:58] or not you should do something, just
[1:38:59] don't. He says that that's important.
[1:39:01] That's good. But you can take that too
[1:39:03] far to where you don't do anything and
[1:39:06] you don't have an explanation for why
[1:39:08] you don't do anything. You just don't do
[1:39:10] it because you you're scared. That's
[1:39:11] fear. That's not faith. That's the
[1:39:13] opposite of what you're professing to
[1:39:15] have. It's opposite. Um,
[1:39:19] so yeah, I respect young people. They
[1:39:21] got like some You guys got some big
[1:39:23] brains. You're really intelligent. Freak
[1:39:25] me out sometimes cuz you'll ask me
[1:39:26] something I have no idea. I didn't even
[1:39:28] consider, but I respect you. That's It's
[1:39:30] just amazing um how intelligent you guys
[1:39:34] are and the potential. Um
[1:39:37] so don't turn them down and don't don't
[1:39:39] hush them up.
[1:39:41] And if a young person you feel
[1:39:43] disrespected by an adult, don't be
[1:39:45] disrespectful back. Don't don't forget,
[1:39:48] you know, uh, like I said,
[1:39:51] I mean, the Bible will tell you to do
[1:39:53] things like respect your elders and
[1:39:55] stuff like that. You definitely need to
[1:39:57] do that. And, um, I I love the fact that
[1:40:00] there are so many young people I meet
[1:40:01] who are respectful. It shows good
[1:40:03] parenting, but um, that anything the
[1:40:07] devil can do, he will turn it the wrong
[1:40:08] way. He'll lead you too far down a path.
[1:40:11] musicians can return. He'll lead you to
[1:40:13] too far down that path. So, don't forget
[1:40:15] to be curious if you can.
[1:40:18] And uh uh that actually reminds me one
[1:40:21] day I want to preach a sermon called uh
[1:40:24] well I won't give you the name but I
[1:40:26] want to preach a sermon on that because
[1:40:29] the devil when he makes when he gets you
[1:40:31] curious and you look up an answer let's
[1:40:35] say let's say I am a young person who
[1:40:38] went to my dad or my mom and asked an
[1:40:41] answer to a question and they just said
[1:40:42] just believe it. Well that's not an
[1:40:45] answer for me. So, every time I go to
[1:40:48] church and hear that specific bit of
[1:40:50] scripture, I don't understand it and I
[1:40:52] don't know why. I'm just told to believe
[1:40:54] it. Uh, that will be all I see. Cuz
[1:40:57] every time I start to look at other
[1:40:59] things in the Bible, the devil will just
[1:41:01] keep showing me inconsistency after
[1:41:02] inconsistency after inconsistency,
[1:41:05] and he'll just take me down that path.
[1:41:07] But God, if you take your questions back
[1:41:10] to the word and you're shown where the
[1:41:12] answer is, he will show you how it
[1:41:14] dovetales over and over and over. So,
[1:41:16] both of them can use that curiosity of
[1:41:18] yours for a strength. Amen.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; All right, that's what I had for
[1:41:23] tonight. I'm going to uh close with a
[1:41:25] word of prayer. Uh heavenly father,
[1:41:28] thank you for uh this opportunity to
[1:41:31] dive into your word, Lord. We thank you
[1:41:33] for these things that you've taught us
[1:41:34] and reminded us of. Lord, as we go out
[1:41:36] of here, we as uh parents and leadership
[1:41:40] and adults, Lord, we want to be shining
[1:41:43] examples to these young people. And I
[1:41:45] pray that uh you can lead us to be that
[1:41:49] kind of person that you want us to be.
[1:41:51] Let us shine that light to them. Let us
[1:41:53] answer this challenge that you've given
[1:41:55] us in your scripture about um to the
[1:41:58] fathers and the young ones that to the
[1:42:01] young men, Lord. uh in young women in
[1:42:03] this in this gathering. Lord, whoever is
[1:42:05] listening online, Lord, we pray that you
[1:42:08] uh just shine your light and show us
[1:42:09] what you want for us. Lord, let help us
[1:42:12] to just throw aside and put a aside
[1:42:14] every weight that besets us, Lord.
[1:42:16] Forget people's opinions and just shut
[1:42:18] it all out, Lord. And just to seek your
[1:42:20] kingdom, Lord, for in you is eternal
[1:42:22] life. Just to seek you and to know that
[1:42:26] if we follow you, you'll take care of
[1:42:28] all the little details. If we follow
[1:42:30] you, you'll defend us, Lord. We don't
[1:42:34] have to defend you. We don't have to
[1:42:35] cower. We don't have to hide and pretend
[1:42:37] that we know every bit of scripture and
[1:42:38] try to debate people or uh justify every
[1:42:42] action that we take. Lord, we just need
[1:42:45] to hide ourselves in you.
[1:42:47] Please show us your will, Lord. Please
[1:42:49] keep us from temptation and tribulation
[1:42:52] that might uh upset the goal that you
[1:42:54] set for us, that might put us off that
[1:42:56] path. Lord, we pray this in the name of
[1:42:58] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:08] [Music]
[1:43:11] Thank you.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:18] Certainly appreciate um the word of the
[1:43:21] Lord on tonight.
[1:43:23] Um
[1:43:25] just um I have to say I'm amazed at how
[1:43:28] God just kind of takes us down um some
[1:43:31] of these paths through the ministry. A
[1:43:35] lot of the things that brother Aaron was
[1:43:38] bringing to us tonight. I just just kind
[1:43:40] of going back through my my own journey
[1:43:43] and I believe you know for the uh the
[1:43:45] parents certainly um you could identify
[1:43:49] with every point that was being made.
[1:43:52] uh you know and first becoming a
[1:43:55] Christian and and and and certainly my
[1:43:57] journey started when I was uh a young
[1:44:00] man you know as far as serving the Lord
[1:44:03] and um defending the Lord how you deal
[1:44:06] with temptations and um God don't have
[1:44:10] to explain himself which mean I don't
[1:44:12] have to explain myself right and if God
[1:44:16] tells you to do something do what he
[1:44:17] asked you to do and having questions is
[1:44:20] bittersweet just I could I could sit
[1:44:23] here and tell you my own personal
[1:44:24] testimony, how every one of those points
[1:44:27] um impacted me along my my journey. Uh
[1:44:32] young people, I will tell you this will
[1:44:34] certainly be a sermon that uh you will
[1:44:38] want to go and revisit.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; You'll want to listen to this one um
[1:44:44] over and over again, especially, you
[1:44:47] know, when you're dealing with
[1:44:48] temptations and things like that. and
[1:44:51] and falling and having to get back up.
[1:44:54] Uh even the scripture tells us that a
[1:44:56] just man
[1:44:58] uh falls seven times. But the thing
[1:45:02] about it is that they get back up,
[1:45:06] right? And and and often times what
[1:45:08] happens with us is that we fall and oh
[1:45:12] and and the beautiful thing that he he
[1:45:13] he he made a statement that Jesus went
[1:45:17] through these things after he got the
[1:45:18] Holy Ghost.
[1:45:20] Now that's that's that's a something
[1:45:23] just really, you know, ponder on because
[1:45:26] um you know, we're going to go through
[1:45:27] things before the Holy Ghost and then
[1:45:29] even after we receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:45:32] we're still going to have trials that we
[1:45:33] have to go through, right? And um you
[1:45:36] know, but the the main thing that you
[1:45:38] have to remember is that don't let Satan
[1:45:41] take away your experience
[1:45:44] when you go through a trial. Don't let
[1:45:46] the devil have your experience, right?
[1:45:48] God just wants to actually give you more
[1:45:51] uh of himself in the midst of it. So, it
[1:45:54] was just it was this was just full of
[1:45:56] nutrients, you know, tonight. And and I
[1:45:58] I I just I thought it was really really
[1:46:01] good for uh our our youth kind of
[1:46:03] preparing them for uh this next phase in
[1:46:06] their journey, but also for the old ones
[1:46:09] to kind of go back and reflect and uh
[1:46:11] and when we can just get, you know, all
[1:46:13] those things in alignment, it helps. And
[1:46:15] and I just just I was blessed. I was
[1:46:19] blessed. I was blessed. I was blessed.
[1:46:21] Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother
[1:46:23] Aaron. Thank you so much for
[1:46:27] getting yourself out of the way. Amen.
[1:46:30] This was this was this was nice. What
[1:46:32] Aaron done messed up.
[1:46:38] That's all right.
[1:46:40] Amen. Let's sing this this song uh
[1:46:42] before we leave uh on tonight. Just
[1:46:44] stand to your feet with me. Let's just
[1:46:47] offer the Lord a song of praise. I will
[1:46:51] be
[1:46:53] what you called me to be.
[1:46:56] Say, I will be what you've called me to
[1:47:02] be.
[1:47:04] Oh, and I'll say yes,
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:12] Lord. I agree. My desire,
[1:47:20] oh passionately,
[1:47:23] is to be what you've called me to be.
[1:47:30] Oh, and that's what I will be.
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:38] Oh,
[1:47:41] I will be what you've called me to be.
[1:47:48] Oh, I'll say yes.
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:55] Oh Lord, I agree. My desire
[1:48:02] here all
[1:48:05] passionately
[1:48:08] is to be what you've called me to be.
[1:48:14] That's what I will be.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; That's what I
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:48:20] hallelujah. I'll say yes. Oh, and I'll
[1:48:25] say yes.
[1:48:30] Say yes.
[1:48:32] I agree.
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:37] Everything you spoke about me, I'll say
[1:48:40] yes, Lord.
[1:48:42] I'll say yes.
[1:48:46] Yes,
[1:48:50] I agree.
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:54] Hallelujah. Oh, tell the Lord. Yes
[1:48:58] tonight. Oo, I'll say yes.
[1:49:04] I'll say yes.
[1:49:08] I agree. I agree.
[1:49:12] Oh,
[1:49:14] I will be what you call me to be. Say, I
[1:49:18] will be.
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:24] Oh,
[1:49:26] and I'll say yes,
[1:49:30] Lord. I agree.
[1:49:34] My desire,
[1:49:39] passionately,
[1:49:43] oh, it's to be.
[1:49:47] You call me to be. That's what I will
[1:49:51] be.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; That's what I
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord a hand
[1:49:58] of praise.
[1:50:01] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:50:04] Amen. Let's pray. Father, we thank you
[1:50:06] for your word
[1:50:08] that has been ministered to our hearts
[1:50:10] tonight. Just walking through this
[1:50:13] journey, things that brother Aaron
[1:50:16] learned along the way. God, the wisdom
[1:50:19] that was poured out uh in this room
[1:50:22] tonight, things that we all could
[1:50:24] identify with. And Lord, we um uh we
[1:50:29] just appreciate, Father, him just
[1:50:31] getting himself out of the way and
[1:50:33] allowing you to use him. I believe
[1:50:35] hearts have been helped and people have
[1:50:37] been strengthened. Uh his transparency
[1:50:40] on some of the things that he has gone
[1:50:42] through. I I know you are speaking to
[1:50:45] people in this room as well as those
[1:50:47] that have joined online. And father, I
[1:50:49] pray that the word would have the
[1:50:51] preeminence in every heart. That the
[1:50:53] word itself is what would bring
[1:50:54] deliverance and break yolks in the lives
[1:50:57] of your people. And father, may we be
[1:50:59] determined to rise from wherever it is
[1:51:02] that Satan has tried to pull us down.
[1:51:04] May we rise to what you have called us
[1:51:06] to, oh God. And Lord, be all that you
[1:51:09] desire for us to be. We thank you,
[1:51:11] Father. Amen. For this word tonight. How
[1:51:14] our spirit man has been strengthened and
[1:51:17] encouraged, uplifted, Lord, by the word
[1:51:19] of God that has come to us. Bless us now
[1:51:22] as we leave this place, but not your
[1:51:23] presence. May we go reflecting and
[1:51:26] thinking on the things we heard here
[1:51:27] tonight. And may you bring us back at
[1:51:29] the appointed time on Sunday morning,
[1:51:31] Lord. And may you meet us here in a
[1:51:33] special way, God. It's in Jesus' name we
[1:51:36] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You can be
[1:51:39] seated. Don't forget on Sunday we'll
[1:51:42] still be parking. Amen. There in the
[1:51:45] grass area. Uh so just make sure you you
[1:51:49] put your car there while they're working
[1:51:50] on the parking lot here. God bless you.
[1:51:53] The brothers will come at this time to
[1:51:55] dismiss you.
