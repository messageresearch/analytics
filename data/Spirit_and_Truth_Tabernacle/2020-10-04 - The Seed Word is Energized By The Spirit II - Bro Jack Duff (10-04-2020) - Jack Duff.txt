god bless you saints it's a blessing to be in the house of the lord this morning brother jack has been on the theme since the beginning of 2020 of catching the vision and stepping into it and uh god has unfolded many visions that i missed there was there's one that's especially precious to me uh as we went into the lockdown earlier back in march one of my co-workers contacted me and said the lord had inspired her to [Music] just have a saturday prayer time of sad saturday prayer and to pray for the nation and the issues that were going forth and she asked me if i would be a part of it it was just going to be a small group of the three of us and i prayed about it and i said lord yes yes i'll be a part of it so as we begin to meet we all kind of put forth what we were praying for and one of the things that i was praying for mainly that god would deal with this church that he would deal with his church and deal with his people in churches that they were really not being fed but they were just there and uh i i just thank god for how he moved than that and realized it would touch me so closely and as we met week to week we bonded more and more and we talked more and more and my heart it was in my heart to really share more with them but i didn't think that they were in a place that they could bear what i wanted to say so i wanted to be careful very careful how i how i spoke to them but the things that i would share they kind of hung onto the words and one particular friday night out i was praying and i was really longing to get into a deeper fellowship with the ladies and i was just talking to the lord i really want to share i want to share this gospel but i don't want to go before you because i don't want to lose them i just want to be careful i want to know it's you before i launch out and say anything and as we met the next day we talked and talked and the conversation changed and i began to see that there was a longing and a hunger in their hearts for more and i was just kind of following the conversation i said lord is this the time is this the time for me to step up and one of one of the ladies she started talking about the book of revelations and she wanted an understanding of the rapture and the tribulation and she was going to do a personal study on it and i said lord i'd hate for her to go through all of this effort and come up with the wrong conclusion so i began to just talk about my understanding of it according to my teachings and they were pretty much spellbound and as we talked more and more they were very receptive to the conversation and i told them i said you know one of these sanities i'm going to share you all with my testimony my walk with the lord what has been the success of my walk i said i want to share that with you and and just let you know where i started from and where i am and the ministry that i'm under today well it didn't wait till the next saturday we went right into it and we were on a zoom call [Music] so zoom ended we got back on zoom again i went further just opened up so many things in the word and uh we went through three zone calls still weren't finished so we'd say well let's make a phone call and we talked and we talked and i my heart was overjoyed because i longed that long to share these truths those ladies i was just so excited so i called brother jack a little later and told him about what had happened and he says well invite them to church invite them to church so i did i sent them a text and and invited them and uh blanca the one who's been coming i'm not sure where she is today but maybe she'll be late but uh she said right away that she would come and we were doing the two services at that time and concerned about the numbers so she texts me back and asked me could her daughter come i said yes for sure for sure blanca was a part of a a very big church and she was very active in that church and i i didn't imagine that she would want to leave it now her daughter was not her daughter hadn't found any place that she really wanted to worship so she uh blanca was very surprised when she said she wanted to come so she was dressed and ready dressed and ready to get here from the moment they came in they fell in love they fell in love with the fellowship they fell in love with the ministry the people and i just thank god for what i see to see the growth in them and what have you got is speaking to them in there you know they're walking in obedience i i truly think that's that was a part of a vision that i didn't know about i did not know about that but she she just loves being here and she says it reminds us so much of a church similar the atmosphere to when she lived in new jersey and she couldn't find anything like that down here so she settled for a big church and just got involved but she wasn't really being fed and the other young lady we talked about her too and she hasn't come yet but she's still in tune uh just pray for that you know god will set her free that she can come she and her husband and their children but anyway this song step into the vision it's to me it's very appropriate for this season that we're in i see many of you step into new visions brother troy i remember the conversation we had years ago so you step into that vision that's my heart so many of you so many so i invite you to sing it with me let's bless the lord with us praise god show me the me you [Music] shut it see [Music] show me the one dean worthy of the sun and i'll manufact the thoughts that are in your mind lord show me the me [Music] help me to know why you've loved me so and how many best the thoughts that are in your [Music] oh and i'll take my place [Music] [Applause] to your vision [Music] right into [Music] i'll take my place [Applause] the dogs [Music] that i could ever be just like your son he and i is oh i've taken my pace in your mind my wonders are mine it's to glorify your name cast off this film [Music] take on your righteousness [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes have you taken your pace [Music] if i never cease to pray stay in your word each day [Music] for our manifesto [Music] yes you called me by my name since that day [Music] hey oh lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus thank you your jesus thank you lord the hallelujah praise the lord god bless you sister birds amen is that your heart's desire to manifest the thoughts that's in the mind of the lord jesus christ thank you [Music] hallelujah [Music] i will our manifested thoughts [Music] that are in your mind come on everybody say i'll manifest the thoughts yeah yes i will [Music] manifest letter in your mind here [Music] thoughts i'll manifest [Music] i will your thoughts how manifest [Applause] [Music] yes i will hallelujah you see i stepped into the vision i step right into the vision and i'm manifest yay glory yes i will yes i will well i'm gonna hallelujah one more time i'll never face your mind hallelujah thank you jesus [Applause] glory to god glory to god [Applause] thank you jesus amen you can be seated in the presence of the lord a man certainly appreciate that song from sister birds and then step into the vision [Applause] some years ago um that song was given to her and we were song leading at the time amen and i still sunglee i realized as a thought came to me years ago that when david was made king he never lost his ability to write songs amen and when the lord called me to the pastoral ship he never took the song leading away from me so i still do that a man when uh it permits uh but i was so leaving at the time and and uh her pastor at the time they come for fellowship and pastor went back and they was having church and the pastor just made a statement say that brother jack he done stepped into the vision and that's that's that's what he said and um mom caught inspiration you know from that statement and she wrote that song and and who knew that years later i'd be preaching a whole series about stepping into the vision right amen and and this this series has been taking us through the whole year and i got i want to say just my outlook i've got about five most sermons that that i i want to bring amen that that's going to flow with this thought and and i trust that the lord would just bless us but um 2020 has been a a very um special year man a lot has happened here this year but but i believe it's a year that we're stepping into the vision that god has for us i believe that with all of our hearts so i'm under expectation for great things that those words hit me a little bit different today i overcome my faults and i'm gonna manifest every thought that you had amen i'm not looking at my failures and mistakes the blood covers all that man i'm gonna manifest the vision that god has for me praise god i'm here to say the devil is still a liar and the blood is against them the blood is against them hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i remember somebody saying a long time ago i believe the prophet said it said you know satan if you're going to get me you're going to have to come through the blood to get me and if you come through the blood that's going to make you my brother [Music] hallelujah so we we thank god we thank god it's so good to see a brother and sister cooper amen with us on today praise the lord from georgia hey man uh we just appreciate him he called me up and said me and my wife are celebrating 40 years of marriage amen we celebrate with them congratulate them amen uh on a tremendous accomplishment and uh you know they were just passing through the area and said he wanted to come to church you know so it's good to have you all and amen we certainly appreciate you coming to be with us amen and and i will tell you brother cooper probably at the end i'm gonna have you close out the service so just be prepared i'll call you to do that amen uh i um i i just quickly wanted to give you all uh a building fun update i know i did it just a couple weeks ago that was for uh august because i was away at the beginning of the month and then i went under the two-week quarantine so now i'm giving you update for september and i just want to quickly give that to you and and then we will move right on in the service um i thank god for all things while i'm while we're getting that ready i also want to say that we thank god for the food pantry that god has just kind of placed in our lap and and we stepped up and just start you know doing what we could and everyone finding a little spot to get in and and we're making a difference sister tina gave me some numbers just wanted to say in the month of september we served 958 people a man through their pantry praise the lord almost a thousand people that we had the opportunity to be a blessing to and and and like i say you know we'll start out by giving natural food but our our intention is to be able to give spiritual food amen glory to god jesus had a food pantry y'all know that he fed 5 000 and he had 4 000 with natural food praise the lord somebody amen so we we uh we thank god for all things so let's just quickly give these numbers a man uh for the building fund just um just as you can see there we had a goal of raising 105 000 a man each year for three years and this is our last year for 2020 a man we had a goal our pledges towards that goal was fifty four thousand nine dollars i actually uh found out i realized this one i've been giving y'all the wrong number there i think i had it at sixty thousand but there was i had a miscalculation so the pledges was actually fifty four thousand nine dollars towards the goal and what we have received year to date is twenty nine thousand two hundred ninety nine dollars and forty six cents uh towards that goal i'm grateful amen for what the lord has done amen just last month we received 6396.37 so uh we're still moving in the right direction amen and as you can see we're still gaining interest ever since uh this pandemic hit the interest just kind of tanked but it's still moving up we're not losing interest but we're gaining interest so we thank god for that and it gives us a net of 29 579.62 for this year so we're grateful amen we're extremely grateful uh for the hand of the lord for his blessings amen upon his people uh because we wouldn't be able to do this without you we thank god for what we see him doing and just this small group of people we found out a long time ago that little is much when god is in it amen amen thank the lord thank the lord musicians thank you all so much i appreciate you all amen the lord bless you and amen and uh we will just go right into the word of the lord on today amen um i want to uh it's good to see sister carol again god bless you amen good to see you sis um and and i was you know we were talking about that um i was just thinking that when you are a part of a vision there's nothing you can do to get yourself out of it right if god has placed you in a vision right there's no one else can take your place right you all remember uh the the time that the prophet went to the house to pray for the little boy um and you know the man came in and picked them up and and as they were on the way to the house to pray for the little boy brother branham said uh does your house look like this and do you have this you have wayne scouting here and you got this you got that you say yeah brother brown that's exactly what my house looked like he said how do you know when had you ever come there you say i just left i just left your house right in a vision all right so uh so when brother branham went to pray there was supposed to be a certain man there amen and and uh certain things were supposed to be in certain places and and he went to pray and he got ahead of the vision praise the lord right and when he prayed the boy almost died and uh you know but i thank god that even though he got ahead of the vision it didn't change the vision oh come on church [Applause] it didn't change the vision that's because you got out of place in the vision it don't change the vision you might have failed here you might have failed there you might have did this you might have did that it does not change god's vision all right so what we what he ended up having to do is sit there and wait because as he looked around he said wait a minute wait a minute they say this brother here that brother their hat supposed to be over here but there's a woman that has not walked into the room yet and he had to wait for that lady to come he couldn't tell anybody what he was waiting on right he was waiting on the lady to come and she had to be in a certain place right he couldn't put the people in their place now you stand here and you stand there no no god don't do it that way right i mean but but by predestination he knows where each one is going to be standing i'm getting ahead of myself i have not even read a scripture [Music] but you you you can't stop the vision from manifesting and when the lady walked through the door the first uh brother graham was great getting ready to leave he said oh don't let him leave the lady just showed up he said please don't lord please don't let him leave and in some kind of way it's god allow something to happen to graham walk back through the door yeah he said oh not everything in place and say the lady wiping her glasses the hat's sitting over here and now here comes uh graham sitting over there everybody in their place they say now brother do you believe me to be god's prophet amen say i got ahead of the vision the first time he said but now everything is in place and if you believe bring your boy to me [Applause] and and praise god i guarantee your boy amen is gonna be made whole and he'd say i believe you brother branham brought his boy brother brandon prayed for him and within three days the poor was made completely whole [Applause] i want to tell you when god has ordained for you to be a part of the vision ain't nothing you can do to get yourself out of the vision and and i'm i'm i'm trying to go a little deeper because there's a greater vision that god has called you to be a part of an angel told a prophet to pick up his pen and write and he wrote things about you before you were even born [Music] let's read the scripture lord lord lord we got to read the bible now acts uh chapter one uh verse two uh through eight amen acts chapter one glory glory glory amen the lord is good um acts chapter 1 verse 2 says until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed uh himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he uh ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence amen if if there was a person here that had not been filled with the holy ghost but has done everything god actually to do to be repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins the bible says you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the promise is unto you uh those that are far off as men as our god shall call uh if you haven't received it yet i will take hold to this scripture amen not many days hence and when you pray pray that way god you said not many days hence not only that god through his prophet said that god's obligated to fulfill his word amen god's obligated for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked him saying lord without this time restore again the kingdom to israel and they said to them it is not for you uh to know the times or the seasons which the father have put in his own power but ye shall receive power and if i can put it this way you shall receive dynamics amen after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and and and samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen also just quickly over in zechariah uh chapter four amen and uh verse six just reads as follows amen this promise from god amen says then answer and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts amen the lord of the blessing to reading of his word can we just quickly breathe the word of prayer father we come into your presence just thank you lord for this opportunity to uh to gather in your precious name we have felt your anointing thus far in the service through the worship the special lord everything that's been done we felt the anointing now god let the anointing come upon the word and make the difference lord in in our hearts and in our lives on today god don't let us leave here the same way we came may we be changed from glory to glory by the power of transformation that is in the word of god so father bless those that are here bless those that are joining the line speak to every heart and courage strengthen uh uh lord correct whatever needs to be done today god do it it's all for your glory for your honors in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you uh you can be uh seated and we are just picking up our thought from uh last week um the seed word is energized by the spirit amen uh the seed word is energized by the spirit and uh we'll just kind of get started there's some things that i kind of went off i guess off my course a little bit last week but god knows all things and and i won't just kind of come back because i'm planting seed a man i'm planting seed as we go through this um and some of this seed is prophecy uh when i'm when i'm reading to you some of the quotes that i'm gonna read to you these are prophetic quotes and uh some of the prophecy by you even walking into the church today you might not realize you fulfill the prophecies you are fulfilling the prophecy amen your life is fulfilling this prophecy so uh things that were written about you were spoken about you it might not have called your name but it knew your condition you know even in scripture uh you know we think about the woman with the issue of blood we don't know her name we don't know her name amen but the scripture identified her as a condition glory to god and there's many others that amen we might not have known their name the man at the pool of bethesda amen we didn't get his name but we had his condition glory to god and and sometimes when god is speaking certain things he don't have to call your name let them call your condition and you can identify with that come on somebody hallelujah amen so i want to just uh uh pick up a few things say man just to lay our background uh here i want to read from um uh oh my my my my let's let's go with uh it's the rise of the sun but just go um nope just i want to start at paragraph 103 on that and this derives in the sun uh we read this last week we were talking about how you can have two cars amen to cadillac cars uh but if you don't amen both of them can be filled with gas and they can have plush seats and all that say but uh if it doesn't have a spark in order to light it then it's no good for you right so uh so that that spark is what we call the dynamic power amen and we're not just interested in having people come to church amen just to say that they go to church we're looking for god to give people a spark in inside hallelujah the spark in the car takes place on the inside you can't see it amen but you know when you put the key in there something happens glory to god and we're expecting that when amen that this key of faith will unlock something inside of god's people we're expecting something to happen amen it might be a different experience for everybody glory to god but something should happen on the inside where you're being changed from glory to glory now the prophet says this no matter how much theologians a man claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much you like the bible until that wave sheep until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move glory he says we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic it needs a dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and bring to pass that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can could still be water see but only the proof of it is put the life on it it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not so we want to continue to put stress amen on the dynamics he said we put a lot of emphasis amen on the mechanics but not nothing on the dynamics so we want to continue to stress the dynamics hallelujah i've been praying that god would just send his dynamic power into the church if i want to tell you this morning as the song service was going i was feeling some of that power i was feeling some of that anointing hallelujah amen why can't we have that every time we come here we don't have to wait for a special service amen in order to experience the power of god every time we gather you bring your liquor fire i bring my liquor fire amen everybody bringing licks of fire before you know it we'll see the pillar of fire breathe god something that'll change people from the inside i'm not talking about something that just get on your flesh i'm talking about something that produces a change [Applause] all right here in this message the spoken words original seed now uh when i'm when i'm using this quote this is the vision that the angel told the prophet to pick up your pen and write uh hold on one second for me sis hey man this is where i was i was just trying to this is where my my inspiration for the year was drawn from i was saying earlier amen that uh you are a part of a vision and might not even realize it but the angel of the lord back in the 60s amen told the prophet pick up your pen and write he said this message that you're writing down is for the it has something to do with the word and the bride you say this message it's for it's got something to do with the word and the bride hallelujah back in the 60s he wrote this down and as he put it on paper and had it recorded we could go in and look in amen the church age book or we can go back to the message spoken words original sheet listen to the sermon and we can hear what the angel lord gave the prophet to write down for us hallelujah amen so so when i talk about vision because you know the year 2020 everybody got some kind of vision amen many churches had visions that crumbled amen because uh the the the pandemic coronavirus brought their vision to a halt hallelujah amen they had a vision for this and we're gonna grow the church this way and we're gonna do this and we're gonna do that and it brought her to her almost lost the church in corona virus amen by see we have something greater than a man a business vision we had something greater than a personal vision we had something greater amen than just any old kind of vision we have something greater than 20 20 vision praise god we have heavenly vision and glory to god amen we're not limited by what's going on on the earth amen we're rising up to a higher plane a greater atmosphere glory to god church amen we thank god for the natural things but we talk about spiritual things [Applause] glory to god so here the angels say pick up your pen and write and brother branham wrote down all these things i want to say roughly two and a half pages and now what i've done by the holy spirit just leading we've taken paragraph by paragraph and we've just been preaching a series of sermons from that vision and here we are amen in another paragraph and we're just we're we're trying to find where the holy spirit is going to actually lead us to amen and and here i've already preached three sermons really from this one paragraph this my third sermon now look at this amen he says the statement in spoken words original seed part two it says how can you tell them now now what he's saying here uh let me just leave before before i say it what he's saying here is that there's two spirits within the framework of the church amen there's a false spirit amen and there's a true spirit let me take it down again i'm i got to explain these things amen there's a false spirit and there's a true spirit now i need to understand both spirits are anointed by the genuine holy ghost bull spirits will have manifestations by the genuine holy ghost because when the rain falls it falls on the just and the unjust i was talking last week about those weeds that got around amen the things that i planted in my front yard amen the rain when it's coming i want the rain to grow those trees that i planted but somehow weeds get in there and the weeds start growing right along with my trees i didn't plant those weeds where did they come from the devil brings that in and the devil liked to bring stuff into the church but the holy ghost is here to pull every weed out amen the weed is there to try to take the life from the seed but god will pull them weeds out [Applause] hallelujah glory to god so so so so he said you know that there's these two spirits within the framework of the church and by god's spirit you got to be able to discern and withstand what is happening in the church by god's spirit you got to be able to discern it because it looked it looked real it looked genuine it looked like the real thing hallelujah glory to god they teach those those those tellers at the bank how to spot a fake dollar how to spot a fake 20. they have certain things they have to do amen maybe they take a little uh pen that they get and they just draw a little line on it and and if it doesn't produce a certain effect they know this thing is fake glory to god you got to amen you got to be able to give it a specific test and when it comes to the word of god when it comes to discerning whether it's the true spirit of god or not the way you discern it is by giving it a word test can you find it in scripture not find it in your feelings not find it in your flesh but can you find what i'm talking about in the scripture if it passes the word test then it's from god now let me read this it's got to pass the word test watch this now it says how can you tell them give them the word test how can you know it speak the word see what they say about it my god there's a lot that i can say there see what they say about it amen give them the words amen when i'm talking about god sending prophet i'm talking about malachi 4. all right let's talk about revelation 10. yes i'm talking about things that god put in scripture and hallelujah if we can believe john the baptist what's the fulfillment of certain scriptures then we got to believe amen just like god had a a full run at his first coming he would have a forerunner at his second coming all right church all right all right all right it's give him the word test glory to god and i always ask people saying now if you say brother brand i'm not the fulfillment of malachi 4 just tell me who is that's all just tell me who he is you can you can tell me a lot about i don't think it's him well who is it amen i need to know because that promise was sent to me behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the dreadful day of the lord that's a promise directly to me so you need to tell me who he is amen all right all right glory to god let me go it says now speak the word see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they have no seed germ in them if you don't believe the word what's already written in the bible you have no seed germ in you it says they are of the evil one and deceive you my god think about it now amen there are the evil one and deceive you as the first bride was deceived and the second bride was deceived they are deceivers of the third broad by high reading the word the third bride of you the first bride was adam and amen and uh and uh eve amen he was deceived a second bride amen would have been jehovah and uh and in israel nation nation of israel the third bride would have been jesus and the bride amen and and i want to tell you that church was deceived when they allowed the catholic the dogma to kind of get started after the 19th encounter they with the council they were deceived the church was deceived but there is a promise amen there's a promise that i will restore saith the lord that is a vision and you are walking in that vision you're part of joel's prophecy glory to god all right let me let me keep reading it says uh as a bride as the first pride was deceived and the second bride was deceived they are deceivers of the third bride by high breeding the word or trying to god never placed signs ahead of his words i like that statement because people get confused amen with the anointing they can see the anointing on certain things and they say there's got to be god know the rain has fallen on the just in the unjust if they can't stay with the word then it's not of god amen you know moses was anointed and he got worn out the rock when he hit it twice right but he he got away from the word of god and missed going into the promised land so we're not just looking at the anointing hallelujah we want the word with the anointing that's right in other words we want spirit amen we want spirit and truth brother don't give me spirit only that's what many of them had they had the spirit only and no truth and then some had truth only and no spirit we want them both together mechanics and dynamics all right let me keep reading says god never play sounds ahead of his wording man that's a scorcher god never played signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word but the word is first and that's what we're saying here right now we're storing the word first it says to prove it elijah said to the woman bake me a cake first and then watch the miracle happen come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word itself so once it's sown hallelujah the c word itself is what the holy spirit energizes that's where we're getting our thought from amen the the the the the the c word is energized by the spirit i believe that but we got to sew we got to take time to sow some things amen i want to sow dynamic seed in order for dynamics to come forth amen i want to get people on the expectations for dynamics now don't you be don't you be alarmed don't be alerted amen when you just walk in here in the presence of god just moving all over the people don't be alarmed what you supposed to do with that when the angel come and trouble the water your your your job right is not to sit back and and and spectate right watching who gonna get who gonna get it this time who gonna get what's gonna no no no your job is to jump in [Applause] and you want to know why those people were jumping in is because they realized they needed something whether the doctor might have had mechanics the doctor might have been giving out medicine but these people need a dynamic power of god the spirit of god to move upon the water and when the spirit moves they jumped in and they got everything they could on it and realize now the first person that jumped in was the one that got their miracle [Music] i'm here to tell you today amen god got enough of this going around that if everybody would jump in i said if everybody would jump in everybody will receive their portion [Applause] whatever you need god's got it hallelujah if you need deliverance god's got it if you need salvation god's got it if you need the baptism of the holy ghost god's got it if you need a refilling of the holy ghost god's got it if you need healing in your body god's got it whatever you need god's got it [Applause] glory hallelujah c word is energized by the holy spirit amen the c word you are part the you are part of that word amen you are part of the word you know there was a quote i read recently amen where uh uh the scripture said that uh in the beginning the word was made flesh and dwelt among us but brother branham said yes the word became flesh but now the word has become your flesh i want you to think about that we can see it in christ we see the word manifesting itself in christ but you got to see the word manifesting itself in you because you are part of the same word amen amen i'm here to tell you scripture is gonna be repeated again the word will become flesh and dwell among us you're gonna be a manifestation of the word all right all right let me let me read something else to you this is not authoritarian church h now as i read this i'm letting you know this was a prophecy and uh in this prophecy by you coming into the church you're fulfilling this you that are watching online you're fulfilling this all right watch this stop starting church h the prophet amen is speaking in the section uh sentenced against the harlot past and anybody that want to study amen in the book of revelation give them a church age book it talks about the first three chapters of revelation hallelujah glory to god if you can catch them first three chapters it also takes you deep into some of the other chapters amen but give him a church age but a prophet reveals it amen here he's talking about this verse revelation chapter 2 verse 22 through 23 behold i would cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds look amen it says and i will kill her children now there's a lot here i could i could take a whole sermon and just preach about who it's her that he's talking about all right hey man this this is the church that he's talking about glory to god i mean out of the catholic church came some children that's why the catholic church is called the mother of harlots the catholic church in scripture is considered the mother of harlots that means there were children born from her other denominational churches that were born out of her glory and that's why and then eventually a man a daughter gonna find a way right back to a mama yeah amen and that that's why that's why you got all this uh the catholic church the pentecostal church the presbyterian church the baptist church all of them can agree now because the mother the daughter don't found her way back to mama oh man y'all gonna say her name again oh man i told y'all i see i'll say his name so i might as well say man uh i believe it was kenneth copeland praise the lord amen a great charismatic minister amen had an agreement going with the pope trying to bring amen the charismatic church is back underneath the pope and there was a guy that called himself amen he called himself the fulfillment of malachi 4. but the man went claiming that he died within weeks of his claim hallelujah god didn't have but one person to fulfill that his name was william marion glory to god but kenneth copeland was the one that kind of started bringing some of these things back together on the pentecostal amen our teachings he's bringing them back to the catholic church because they were harlots according to the scripture amen i hope you're getting out now i don't know what god did amongst the pentecostal churches was from god but when they went into organize or organized religion that's when they left god that's when god left him and that's why it's in the condition that it's in today hallelujah but don't worry i got something else i'm gonna just read this let me just read this let me read this it says uh and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searches the reigns and the hearts and i would give unto every one of you according to your words what this woman has children he says and she was a she a and if that is uh if that is the case that she had children by her whoredoms then she must be burnt with fire as the word has said that is exactly true that is her and and for her and for she will be and that is her and that is her end for she will burn with fire her end is the lake of fire but stop and think about these children for a moment it says a woman is the one out of whom the children come it is evident that the woman had children that came out of her but they did the same thing she did show me one church that ever came out of organization see that's the problem that the catholic church was the first one to organize and anything that came out of it goes right back into organization this message was not organized and it's still not organized today anytime the denominational spirit rises god does something to destroy it amen we don't have no headquarters here we don't have nobody we got to report to amen the only person that leads this church is the spirit of god amen glory to god i thank god we ain't got no headquarters nobody tell us what to preach nobody tell us when to preach it hallelujah somebody the holy ghost is what leaves this church and the holy ghost always wanted preeminence in the church [Music] look at this now it says uh uh uh it's evident that the woman had children come out of her uh but they did the same thing she did show me one church that ever came out of organization that organization that didn't go right back into it there isn't one not one here's a statement the lutherans came out see luther when he went to the the catholic church store with his 95 thesis and knocked on the door and said these things are against the word of god i can't stand with the catholic church no more oh i love luther i didn't even know he was a messenger but when i heard his story in school i was just just going to school when they they talked about luther something in my heart struck there's something special about that man didn't even realize he was a messenger when i came to the message saw brother branham identified him as a mess i said no wonder i identify with that fellow even in school when i didn't even know the message i said something about this fella it says when he knocked on the catholic church store say these things i just can't stand with no more the lutheran reformation began hallelujah coming against the catholic but probably problem was is they went right back underneath the organization again hallelujah what happened next he says the lutherans came out and then organized right back and today they are hand and glove with this economical move now what happened see god god was with luther but when luther went back god left luther and then god raised up somebody else the methodists right amen came out when god started dealing with the methodists you know what they did that came out they didn't stay with luther they came out praise god the methodist came out what happened they organized right back and so when when the method is organized and went back just like luther did then the pentecostals came out lest it be the name of the lord god was with the pentecostals they came out they couldn't stay with the methodists they couldn't stay with the lutheran they couldn't stay with the catholic they had to come out that's right praise god if you don't find christ you got to leave where you act [Music] glory when mary and joseph were looking for jesus they had to leave where they were and they had to go back and find christ where he was and where we gonna find him in his words look at this the pentecostals came out here's the problem and they organized right back now we might as well be truth and honest about this it was a time where the only people you found with them white collars was catholics only ones you found within them white college was catholics that's how they identified themselves but the pentecost has now got more white collars than anybody they look just like the catholics oh we ain't gonna say it man it's the truth and it happened amen and spiritually they don't even realize what's going on they trying to carry a certain look but they don't realize what they're doing they're identifying with their with their mama um glory to god anyhow look we had a prophet that went to rome had an invitation to see the pope and when he got his invitation he said okay what do i need to do say when you go in make sure that you uh um you know you you back up don't don't turn your back on him just back away like this bow down and kiss his ring and say oh i said wait a minute i gotta do what he said yeah bow down and kiss his reading and say that's out he said can so i mean we got we had a preacher in this city that had a visit with the pope and he didn't cancel nothing he bowed down he did everything he could so he can take that picture with the pope hallelujah but we had a prophet say cancel my appointment and i'm gonna tell you i think it's some people that follow that prophet that if they had an invitation to go see the pope they would do the same thing cancel my appointment i ain't bound down to kiss no man reign oh my praise and glory gonna go to jesus he said if you want to be called reverend i call him reference he want to be called preacher i call him preacher he said but i i am not bowing down and kissing no man's ring tell him i'm canceling my appointment hallelujah thank god for a profit like that it shows us how to conduct ourselves if we find ourselves in the same situation pentecost came out and they organized right back now this was three great moves the lutheran amen the wesleyan which was which is a methodist and the pentecostals these were three very special moves that god used god did it praise the lord but when they organized god left it right now let's look at the rest of the quotes oh glory amen see this is this is this is oh my my my hold on hold on hold on one second let me just say that i i i i put this i put this just a few weeks ago i brought to you how uh samson amen when he was uh bound glory to god and samson had those those green whiffs praise the lord he was telling uh delilah see delilah amen it's just been a common story that many of the people have uh have heard over the years and you know we thank god for it but um delilah represents something delilah amen represent your struggle and i want to tell you amen every person in here has a delilah in their life whether it's a man or a woman you gotta delilah something you struggle with praise the lord right and the church also had a delilah amen delilah in a church room would have represented the catholic church hallelujah and as as as samson's laying down in delilah's lap she's like please share with me your strength and and they say well you know what if you take seven green whiffs that were never dried tie me up with them i'll be just like any other man and she tied him up and and uh samson at samson walk he said she said samson the philistines be upon you samson woke up and broke free hallelujah when he broke free the first time that represented luther hallelujah it represented luther who broke free from amen denominational barriers underneath the catholic church hallelujah buddy went and laid back down in delilah's lap again he's back in bondage again amen and this time she said now you got free last time you you you embarrassed me tell me where your great strength lies samson don't lie to me say if you get some new rose a man that would never occupy and you tie me with them i'll be just like any other man she got the new ropes tied him up and she then she put him to sleep and say sam said the philistines be upon you and this time he broke he rolls up he rose up and he broke free that represented wesley breaking free hallelujah glory to god but wesley organized and laid right back down in delilah's lap again hallelujah now this time it got a little closer this time he says uh she said now you don't lie to me two times tell me where your great strength lies sampson she said if you weave the seven locks of my head with the web then i'll be just like any other man hallelujah glory to god and this time it looks it look i mean he was getting real close to where his strength was i want to tell you something amen the church was getting real close amen to where god amen wanted them to be hallelujah but this time amen when he laid down she said samson the philistines being he rose up and broke three brother branham say that represented the pentecostal church now the fourth time he goes and lays in our lap and when he lays on the lap this time he said he finally gave up the secret if you cut my hair it may not be just like any other man and this time she cut the hair and he and he's laying down and laughing and saying he said she said samson the philistines be upon you hallelujah samson the philistines are pointing she said she said she he tried to rise up this time and break free but he had no strength that's where the church is now the church has no strength to break free from the things that they found themselves in but i'm so glad it didn't stop there god used the lutheran church god used the methodist church god used the pentecostal church but all of them went back into amen denominations denominationalism organization and that's why they lost their strength but let's look at this quote let's look at this quote let's look at this quote glory glory glory glory glory amen the lutherans came out amen and and then organized right back and today they are hand in glove with this ecumenical move the methodist came out and they organized right back the pentecostals came out and they organized right back but look at this there is going to be another coming out that's where we find ourselves there's going to be another coming out and praise god they won't organize back because they know the truth glory hallelujah amen this group is ordained not to fall this troop is ordained not to be deceived like the first two brides were this group will stand the test in this hour amen i love this i love this there's going to be another come out and notice that it didn't say a staying in it's going to be another coming out just like the pentecostals had to come out from the wesleyans in order to receive what god had for them we're going to have to come out from the pentecostals to receive what god got for us westerns came out of the lutherans came out of the catholics hallelujah glory to god westerners came out of the lutherans amen the pentecostals came out of the wesleyans and the bride has come out of all types of organization amen oh hallelujah i know what i'm talking about i say there's gonna be another coming out and praise god they won't organize back because they know the truth that group will be the bride oh the group that's able to come out come out to what come out to the word come out to the word come out to the word and let me tell you when you come to the word when you bake a cake first then you'll see a miracle happen i'm i'm i'm telling you a man i'm sowing seed because i'm expecting dynamic power i'm expecting the real power of god to strike the church but it's got to be done on the word of god according to the word of god hallelujah this is not a feeling on emotion this is the real thing hallelujah look at this now amen joel 225 is a scripture amen that that we're we find ourselves in our restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you amen god says he's going to restore now i was uh looking at that and i want to go to this message restoration the bride tree i was just uh sharing with brother mike we were in i was in the barber shop and i was sharing a little thought about amen this this series that we've been under and uh and as i was sharing sharing a few things he said brother i just was thinking on this quote about this quote out of respiration broad tree about those death messages that came into the church but god said he was gonna restore glory glory glory glory i say brother that's exactly where we are so let me just read this for you amen out of restoration of the broad tree this is where we are we are a part of a vision amen you're you're coming to this message you are part of a vision you're a part of amen this restoration process that joel spoke about listen he says now listen closely says listen now don't miss this now there was four death messages or would you rather we just closed would you rather this morning it says listen real close now look there was four four death messengers killed that tree that's right uh what was it palmer worm locust cankerworm caterpillar is that right it says amen four messengers of roman devils dogmas killed that tree one took its fruit one took its part or took its leave one took his bark one took the life is that right amen four messengers of dog must kill the tree but all but the roots it killed the tree but it left the roots that's that's good right there amen because if it left the roots and that's an opportunity for the tree to sprout again and that's why the devil couldn't take you out he took this and he took that but he could not take the roots the roots remain planted church and at the scent of water the roots will sprout again it says if four messengers of death kill the tree four messengers of the life restores the tree do you get it he says amen for god said i'll restore it he's going to restore how by four deaths five by four death messages killed it therefore life messengers will restore what was the first life messenger what was the first martin luther amen with justification what was the second john wesley amen by sanctification glory to god what was the third pentecost with the restoration of the gifts let me go a little further but it didn't stop there glory to god there was four life messengers pentecost was the third one but not the fourth one hallelujah amen glory to god deliverance is is in the number four right watch this it says pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the holy ghost baptism of the holy ghost what was the fourth oh hallelujah this is what we're talking about the not just of the gifts of the spirit floor but the word with the gifts what happened is that the church took the gifts but fight forgot the giver [Music] but what we want is to give up with the gifts amen what was the fourth the word what the word the there were four great prophets now now who brought the word back to us that's what that's why malachi 4 is so important because the bible says that he will turn our hearts to the children back to the faith of the fathers so his of our hearts turning back to the faith of the father simply means our hearts will turn back to the word the church has left the word the church does a lot of things in their feelings the church does a lot of things in their emotions a lot of things in their own thinking but what we need to go go back and do and see what the word says about it our hearts have come back to the words now i want to be i want to be very very um a man specific here we're not we don't want to be a church that's just built solidly on mechanics mechanics mechanics mechanics we must have dynamic power of god we must have the dynamic power of god now what does this energize the c word be energized by the spirit i gave you this last week energized is is an action word amen it's a verb it's an action word it's amen it's it's enlivening glory to god it's it's live enough it's animate praise god it's vitalize invigorate amen energized means to perk up and energize mean to excite hallelujah i don't know anything that excites me more than seeing the presence of god amen on the people of god y'all remember we came to church that one time that was brother brother whisper was preaching and and something energized brother gary y'all remember that service oh yeah amen brother and just the word was being preached and as brother whis was preaching the energy hit brother gary he started leaping and jumping now when you see brother garen jumping what you gonna do you gonna start praising god yourself see energy is contagious hallelujah glory to god amen we we love to see the presence of god come upon the people of god it brings that energy into the church i want to tell you another thing that brings energy into the church when new faces show up when new faces show up it brings an energy into the church hallelujah but the greatest thing that can give us energy is when the holy ghost himself pours out inside the church [Music] see we need to be invigorated we need to be made alive again hey man we need to hey man we uh uh uh we need to get motivated can i say it like that when it comes to the things of god we need to get motivated right we need to perk up it says energize means to electrify oh i like that energize means to stimulate glory glory amen and see we need we need stimulation amen something that goes along with the revelation stimulation of revelation we need that that's dynamics to the mechanics he says we need we need to get the church stirred up hallelujah we need to get the church fired up glory to god we need to get the church to move we need the church to drive oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how can the church drive how can the church drive i think about this story amen in scripture where um disciples were with jesus and there was a man amen that had his son that was that was uh you know this this young boy was bound glory to god and he had a dumb spirit amen his father confessed that my boy has a dumb spirit he said i brought him to the disciples and i tried to get them to to lay hands on him but they couldn't get nothing done they couldn't get it done it says uh jesus i want to bring my boy to you if if if if you got any compassion would you just please touch my boy and have have mercy on us and jesus told a man say now if you can believe all things are possible to you if you believe now jesus already knew what he could do but he said all things are possible to you if you believe man confess and say lord i believe but help my unbelief amen oh hallelujah lord i believe but help my belief and i believe that's the that's that's the the place where most of us are lord we believe these promises god we know what your prophet said is yeah and amen but help our unbelief what's stopping this thing up jesus brother said bring the boy here to me and as he brought said he said he prayed for the boy they said he said our death and dumb spirit leave this boy and never come back to him again now see any sickness that's attacking your body is a spirit see the church needs to be driving the church need to be in control amen the church need to get out of the amen the the the passenger seat the church needs to start driving jesus said i go away but but i'm sending my comforter to you he's saying he's saying the works that i did shall ye do also he says and greater works than these shall you do for i go unto my father the church needs to start driving can i tell you take your driver's license test go out there and get your certificate so you can start driving devil's eye hallelujah it was it was the disciples responsibility to take care of that because they approached it the wrong way is why they did not get results if we could ever get our focus right church i believe god gonna do some things here that we never thought the church needs to be driving with there's so many so many calls of sickness so many so many uh uh people coming to us i got this problem i got that problem and sometimes all we do is just bring it and make it a prayer request and when it becomes a a common thing that we do we pray over all the prayer requests is that all we want to do is just pray over him or do we want to see god manifest himself we ought to be expecting god to answer the prayer if we ask anything in his name amen amen it says he's going to do it if we ask anything in his name so it don't matter what the condition is if we come according to the word of god we ought to see dynamic structure mechanics i'm trying i want to sow these i want you to be in power church pray for that person that's that god brought into your life hey man they're saying the person's sick they asking you to pray for yeah well i'm gonna tell my church no you stop and pray and watch god answer your prayer and then come back to church and share the testimony when you share the testimony you know what happens the church is energized amen we're not going to be energized by lies we're going to be energized by the truth hallelujah let me read this glory glory so this is out of looking unto jesus glory hallelujah thank you jesus says moses looked one day and seen a pill of fire it attracted his attention since this great theologian he had run with all of his theological training and his understanding by his mother oh my see moses mama taught him who he was glory to god his mama told him all these great things amen about his birth and amen and how he was hidden on the nile river and ended up in a man pharaoh's court through pharaoh's daughter right and moses moses taught all these things and when pharaoh's mother couldn't take care of him i mean the first daughter couldn't take care of she needed a wet nurse just so happened that amen moses sister miriam had to have spotted where hey man that where where where the basket went and she went running up and said do y'all need a wet nurse yeah we need a wet nurse and didn't even know who this young girl was thought she was working for her maybe she even got paid to go find a wet nurse she said i got the perfect one for you hey man i know who can take care gonna do a real good job went running back to the house mama i got a job for you and moses mama never even applied for the job praise god a man somebody amen but god has something special for her say mama i got a job they need a wet nurse to work inside pharaoh's court to raise a boy your boy gonna be raised in pharaoh's court you i guarantee you when moses mama heard that she was energized the testimony energized we need supernatural testimonies that will energize because the seed word is energized by [Applause] spirit she went running back to the house i'll take care of this i got this i got this honey i got to go i got a job in pharaoh's court i'm going to be raising our son in pharaoh's court and his mama taught him all the greatness all of his greatness amen look at this now uh but what but but based on what his mama taught him that's all he had is mama's teachings and i don't want that to be your testimony all you got is what your mama taught you or what your pastor taught you i want you to have your own experience yes your experience is what's going to energize you glory glory glory you'll be just like the energizer bunny you're nothing without the batteries can i say you are you'll stand still without batteries yeah you won't beat nothing you'll just be standing there but put them batteries in there brother that fellas start moving and won't stop moving and what the banners represent the holy ghost hallelujah glory glory glory look he says uh he he his uh uh uh he had run with all of his theological training and his understanding by his mother of the word itself of how that he was to deliver the children of israel but when he tried in his way he fell and what and although his mother had thoroughly instructed him on what to do and what he would do and what god had raised him up for all this knowledge as good as it is and it is good amen but yet it had to be set off my god that was only mechanics amen mechanics ain't what runs the automobile it's the dynamics that runs it the mechanics don't run the church i want to make sure we get that one down the mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word church that's what i'm looking for the holy ghost to get into this word now it's not just the word that i'm preaching you are the word so i'm looking for the holy ghost to get into the word and make a difference in the life of the people amen i'ma tell you you can't do it without the holy ghost you can quote scriptures right uh because it's just in your head you don't learn you got to learn behavior it's a truth in it you got to learn behavior you've been hanging around the church long enough you know exactly how to do it you know when to do it can i talk to y'all for a little bit all right amen when you call the pastor you know exactly what to say you know say this word and say that word and amen the pastor's gonna say amen glory to god hallelujah glory to god don't don't don't make me have to be the one to have to discern all the time praise the lord somebody amen i just want to have simple conversations hey man don't try to deceive me though the holy ghost ain't going to be deceived sometimes the holy ghost may not say nothing but the holy ghost ain't deceived oh hallelujah somebody amen sometimes amen i'll be thinking about doing a certain thing then i get a check right from the holy ghost and now not yet not yet not yet not yet and use this person no not yet and i don't know why he telling me not yet but i just wait and before you know it information start coming out and i say oh god i see what you were doing see you i'ma tell you you can fool people most of the time but you came through yourself and god none of the time it's the truth in it amen we don't amen when we talk about dynamic power we talk about a holy ghost that cleanses you from the inside a holy ghost that go home with you a holy ghost out of visits you in your house not just the holy ghost that come on sunday morning a holy ghost at a ride in the car praise god the holy ghost and live in your bedroom a holy ghost that'll be in your living room i'm talking about the holy ghost that goes home with you amen you you want to know some of the most powerful testimonies i ever heard is when people have had experiences with god at home [Applause] amen i i know a young brother was telling me about how god feeling with the holy ghost he was on the phone talking about the words amen as he was talking about the word at home the power of god came into the room where he was and he was out for hours don't even realize when he when he stopped talking that's what i'm talking about the power of god moving like that [Applause] amen just enough holy ghost to try to satisfy the pastor oh but ain't what we talking about here we got to talk about the holy ghost to satisfy anybody the only reason we speak in tongues is try to try to try to imitate what somebody else is doing if god ain't giving you that gift find something else that he can give you to work with but we're not here to imitate nobody we're here to be who god has made us to be to step into the vision that he has for our life but i'm talking about a real holy ghost a holy ghost that can tell you no the holy ghost had to give you a check no you shouldn't be doing this no you shouldn't go there with this person the holy ghost had a taste and no that ain't no uh don't say that the holy ghost said go back and apologize i'm talking about a real holy ghost not one that step over this and step over that go back and apologize make that thing right [Applause] i'm talking about the holy ghost there to get all the sin out because when you bring sin into the camp you stop the revival your misbehavior amen will stop the revival from blowing in this church i want to i'm trying to get all the weeds out praise god lord help me get all the weeds out because we want the real holy ghost to flow through the church we want everybody to be filled the same way it was on the day of pentecost 120 souls everybody was filled with the holy ghost we want the real thing we want the real dynamics i i there was a time amen i i'm let me just stress a little bit just a little bit i'ma get back to this quote but there was a time i remember taking some of the young people to some of the meetings amen and and and we went to a meeting up in in south carolina holy spirit was moving in that place such a way the one young man fell out under the power of god now you can tell when it's the power of god and when it's flesh when it's flesh people get hurt i'm talking about physically hurt amen but this brother fell out underneath the power of god and start rolling on the floor just rolling back and forth and as he was rolling the chairs was moving by themselves chairs just moving by themselves getting out the way so he didn't get hurt the holy spirit was moving so so so mightily you know god came down and and brother caleb had he he still has a gift i want to know why because god gave him the giving god well don't give a gift and take it back god don't do things like that but gifts and columns are without repentance but underneath the anointing brother caleb began to go and just speak different things to different people yeah i mean things that only they knew and god knew was in their heart he was speaking right out i mean underneath the power of the holy ghost it was happening now see what the devil has done is tried to kind of uh put water on all this yeah yeah the devil tried to snuff it out but satan as you put water on it you don't realize it's seeds underneath all this and when you put water on seeds you understand satan didn't realize he thought he was putting the fire out but underneath all that was seeds and when you put water on seed water causes the seed to sprout up watercolors to seed to be energized [Applause] [Music] see i'm putting stress on it i know what god already has in the church and i know why the devil fight what god got in the church but like i said at the beginning when you're part of a vision ain't nothing you can do to get out the vision you can't go nowhere you can't you can't try to hide amen if god is ordained for you to be part of the vision you're going to be part of the vision amen oh hallelujah glory to god i remember services here amen we we had uh back in the old church we had a service one time and uh the power of god come down just on the words see we don't have to make this happen we don't have to work this up i i'm telling you if you ever seen the real thing you go if you've never seen it you're gonna see it here because if the word has been sown right yes the seed word will be energized by the spirit we're just preaching the word and and the holy spirit just begin to pour out amen in the service and and one of the sisters uh she thought she thought she was uh gonna go help somebody right and she she was walking up a man on the other sister say maybe i had a little sheet to put around or something and as she was walking up to approach the sister she felt energy oh god she felt energy and when she felt energy she backed up hallelujah glory to god what was god saying you don't need to help nobody jump in and get some of this glory to god amen put the sheet down cover yourself with the sheep get in the spirit praise god hallelujah somebody baby she went to try to help the sisters she got touched herself see i'm gonna tell you this thing is uh uh contagious when one person get energized another person get energized and another person get energized dynamic striking all the mechanics i i i i it's just like if i didn't have a phone charger but my phone is dying and i know my phone's dying i ain't got my charger i ain't got no store to go to you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go around and ask people yeah right what type of phone you got do you have a droid or do you have an apple praise god cause then when i get a certain app which which type of apple you got because there's a certain cable that's needed even on the droid there's a certain cable that's needed you just can't give me any kind of cable yeah and expect for me to get some power [Music] [Applause] i need an adapter on that kind of cable and some of us need to adapt some of us need to change our lifestyles some of us need to change the way we thank him some of us need to change the way we live and praise god we need to make some of that we need to adapt to some things stop sinning start living for god praise god amen there's got to be a holy ghost that'll stop you from sinning [Applause] praise god there's got to be a holy ghost that bring conviction in your life not just amen the pulpit have to bring it but the holy ghost had to do it by itself i'm talking about a holy ghost like like like brother branham when he went to africa praise god went to a meeting and amen and just preached the word of god and as he preached the word of god the anointing come down upon the people is to say the sisters just showed up the way that they normally show up amen no clothes on nothing that was normal for them they were in the presence of men and that's what they did all the time it was very very normal for them so here they come to the service like this and uh and the holy spirit began to move out over the audience and different things different healings and everything taking place and as the holy spirit began to move over the audience amen uh what what happened is that uh those same ladies went back home at the service came back to the night service but this time they was dressed different man this time these ladies had something to cover themselves up yeah what was it see when they were in the presence of men which was very normal for them they didn't know no better but when they came into the presence of gods that was totally different and what we're trying to do is get people out of the presence of me we want to bring you into the presence of almighty god and i need you to understand his presence is not something that's only here at church on sunday but his presence will be with you seven days a week 24 hours a day i'm talking about a holy ghost that'll make you say no to some things not talking about the holy ghost that caused you to jump and shout and speak in tongues but can't live right [Applause] we talk about something to make you live right if you need to cut off relationships it'll make you do it huh i'm talking about the holy ghost that'll deal with your heart no no no no no i can't do this no more something on the inside i've been energized i've been energizing something that something said i can't i cannot do things like this no more i can't talk to you on the phone no more i can't send texts to you no more praise the lord i'm talking about the holy ghost that make you do that because see i'ma tell you something if the holy ghost don't make you do it and you do it just because the pastor said do it you're gonna go right back to it again amen see i'm talking about the holy ghost there to stop you from drinking a holy ghost that'll stop you from smoking not just around the pastor you know what i'm saying let's be old the holy ghost saw that the holy ghost see all that you think the holy ghost don't notice that see i mean we need we need people to be honest with god and i'm gonna tell you where revival starts when honest hearts can admit that they're wrong amen come to church with i mean the first thing you ought to do don't come out you know sin all in your life you walking up to church smile the first thing you ought to do is get to this all to repent before service even start get here 30 minutes early praise god and make things right with god god i failed you this week and god i don't want to leave here amen the same way i came do something for me today i'm laying myself on the altar people people used to go to the altar quick nowadays we run from the altar what is it something contagious up here praise god come to the altar to make things right amen church see i'm gonna tell you don't don't be aching in this camp don't don't don't find yourself like aiken aiken came to church and acting like he was everybody else but aiken had sinned back home aiken had stuff underneath amen i mean he had some garments that that he shouldn't have had he had some gold some money that he shouldn't have had hallelujah actually aiken took god's money aiken had all this stuff and then when the revival started they start losing men how come all these people dying what's going on they had to had to have a discernment line tell us what happened aiken well what i uh i saw them garments and i i i just longed for them i got them where they at in my tent underneath this underneath bring him his family everybody kill em all and the only way they was gonna win battles after they got rid of aiken sin i'm gonna tell you when we we're gonna see the power of god moving in this place if we can get sin out of here amen i don't like saying i hate it i hate it i i'ma just be honest with you i hate it i don't like the look of it i don't like it i don't like it god got to deal with my heart when it come to sin because i know where the devil had me right and i just i just i didn't like that where i was and when i see other people going down that same path i just hate it i got i just something in me rise up and y'all shouldn't be comfortable with seeing either i want to see dynamics i want to and the c word is going to be energized by by the spirit i want to see the dynamics of god come into the church of god but i know it's going to take some digging out and some pulling some weeds out we got to we got to get ready for what god getting ready to do the uh the i remember in in the scripture where uh they went to the prophet elijah they said you know uh we we elijah they went they like she said look we we in this battle we don't and they got to a situation where they they shouldn't even been there here they don't took a seven days journey with a compass and can't find no water how about they going to fight a battle no water for that for themselves no water for the men the water for uh for the animals no water nowhere how are they going to fight about it they would die of a thirst out there so they say they found said we got to go get the prophet we got to go to the prophet now i'm going to tell you something when the church needs to realize they die on a thirst the church is dying a thirst seven day journey ain't got nothing right we need to go back and see what a prophet got to say it went and said say elisha we need you please get a word from the lord from us he say look you know what if it wasn't for jehoshaphat being with y'all i wouldn't even come out here and try to prophesy he said but get me a a minstrel give me somebody can get me in the spirit give me somebody that can that can play some anointed music all right don't just bring anybody get an anointed musician bring them here let them start playing and as they start playing now i can feel the spirit of god coming upon me it says now y'all y'all get ready it's not gonna be any rain right it's not gonna be it's not gonna be that he say but there's gonna be water in this desert he's saying the way that you need to get ready for the water is start digging ditches praise god amen you're gonna have to start making preparation for your manifestation glory and maybe it's time for you to start digging some ditches maybe it's time for you to bury some stuff praise god amen but it's time to get ready for the manifestation of dynamics start digging ditches and and the deeper you dig the more water you'll get the more water you'll get the more ditches you did the more water you get start digging them ditches next morning they woke up and didn't know how it came there was water all over the place water all over the place and god provided a miracle they needed dynamic power of god in order to get that water we gonna need the dynamic power of god in order to sustain in this hour the mechanics don't run the church the dynamic power of god does but i'm not just talk about something just make you shout for a little bit that's what we talked about last week them seeds falling in certain certain atmospheres it caused you to shout but brother if it ain't if it ain't taking root it'll never bring forth and you're gonna have to bring forth impatience i'm gonna tell you right now god is the god ain't no magician god ain't doing things like that what god's trying to do is work character in you so some things you have to do right now and then wait for your miracle let me just finish these a couple of these quotes and i'll i'll close for the day that looking under jesus the mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word it's not a seminary that teaches you all the theology and the greek interpretations but it's the dynamics of the holy ghost and there to set that a fire and to bring it to pass and to make it live just exactly what the promised word is for this hour not the mechanics the dynamics it takes mechanics and dynamics the word and the spirit they are the one that gives life all right um oh jesus jehovah jireh the prophet says this now the vine doesn't bear fruit does it who was he talking to says the church i'm the vine you are the branches the branch is energized by the life of the vine therefore jesus has no lips tonight on earth but mine and yours he has no eyes but mine and yours he has no hands but mine and yours he energizes us and we bring forth his life as he brings it through us whether it's preaching the gospel by lip or it's seeing vision by eye whether it's whatever it is laying hands on the sick whatever it is it's christ working through the branches of his church every office literally electrified by his presence i like that i say every office if you if your office is uh lay member still lay member needs to be electric preachers electrify deacon electrify song leader electrify musicians electrified bro joe don't stop saying amen last week brother joseph coming here he was electrifying every week you got to come with that same fire brother joseph everybody don't let the devil take your fire uh yeah i say i'm preaching long he said preach as long as you want to amen brother joseph you don't know what that does for a preacher one day he'll experience it praise the lord amen uh every office literally electrified by his presence isn't it wonderful how how how we are now either told the truth or a lie if i told a lie god would never have nothing to do with a lie you know that if i told the truth god is obligated amen amen [Music] now it's not me working it up i ain't gonna do nothing but just lay the seeds in there and as i lay the seed i know what to expect dynamics to the mechanics one last question what shall i do with jesus call christ church i'm on the expectation and i'm telling you i said it's it's good for you to uh prepare yourself by listening to the mechanics or read the mechanics when you're at home so when we come together that we can expect god to do something hallelujah glory to god we we we're facing a a a society where people need to see god this just this this this corona demon just came out came from the pits of hell that's a major attack people don't know what to do people afraid now they talk about forcing people to take um i mean we don't we you know we don't know what we what we're in for we we have no idea we need to be protected by almighty god and you need to know that you can you can get see some dynamics in your life praise god stand like them hebrew boys if god don't deliver [Music] [Applause] my confidence is that he's able to do it now if he don't choose to do it through me or to me he's still able to do it and since i know he's able now you realize that they were standing on his able yeah or he has but he's able can you stand on he's able [Applause] standing on he's able i know what he's able to do if he choose not to do it that's okay somebody else gonna see the dynamics but i know he's able to do dynamic things for me man he need to fire up seven times hotter that's fine they ain't gonna make me change my mind tied all up running into a fire and when they got in there somehow the fire loosed them and they just in there praising and jumping and shouting and nebuchadnezzar's like what in the world i'm happy now wait a minute wait a minute i know i i know i you know i i can count i put three men in but i see four and the fourth one look like the son of god can i put it this way the fourth one look like the dynamics that's what we're looking for church what shall i do with jesus call christ this is the last one the dynamics of this church i told you it's prophecy the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit and many of us need refillings now it's not not that we haven't been filled yes we have been filled but our experience has dried up we need a refilling of the holy ghost and the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit now we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unites unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise up just exactly like that even in the dead say that again even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years ago we'll rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the holy spirit god knows the seeds have been planted i believe this is the season for it i'm under expectation in church i'm encouraging you look for god to do just exceeding the abundant above all you can ask or think i'm talking about a holy ghost that make you jump every sunday i'm talking about the holy ghost and make you say amen to the word every week see that that's how you water the seeds with your a amens and see if you listen to the word at home if you read the word at home when it comes back across the pulpit you can say man that's god speaking back to you you asked to hear god's voice and and he just wants a response when you sit around talking you want people to respond to you mama's are they talking to their kids do you hear me say something you want to make sure that they hear you say something to me if you hear me right god's the same way if you if he's speaking to you say something don't just be nod now oh no say something to him amen thank you lord glory to god [Applause] that's it amen create an atmosphere your own personal atmosphere you know you need god to do something for you hallelujah [Applause] we need god to speak back we need the dynamics to speak back praise god hallelujah church [Applause] glory to god but i want you to come on the no matter who's preaching and don't let the devil put that in your head well who preaching today i know folk that won't even get online based on who preaching you missing your blessing missing your blessing when you do that it don't matter who preaching come with your amen and god will change the whole service just for you praise the lord if you're approaching it the right way amen hallelujah you might as well get ready i've read the prophecy the dynamics of this church will be will be you gonna get your refilling if you ain't been filled you're gonna be filled but you're going to get a refill another holy ghost my god whether it's in a prayer meeting whether it's in a sunday morning service whether it's in a wednesday night service anytime we come together we're on the expectation god amen we're stepping into the vision stepping into the prophecy god already spoke these things about us amen we shall receive we shall receive hallelujah i would love to be a part of brother branham was in the service of the holy spirit was was upon him so strong young sister just was on the piano and couldn't couldn't stand it no longer just couldn't stand it she was trying to keep playing but before you know she was just ah in the spirit on the piano well the holy spirit wants the music to keep going so the holy ghost kept playing the piano [Music] the holy ghost did it why why why they have to be a a past tense we can have things like that now even because sometimes the system be like i just you know i i want to just get into the service well get in the service you can still be at your duty still getting in the service and one of these days the holy ghost may take over the pm come on look tesla built a car that will take over your driving if technology is at that level why can't we come to church and expect the holy ghost to take over the service if tesla can take over the car the holy ghost can take over the service [Applause] [Music] church i'm on the expectation i want to see god i want to see god i've been watching the devil like like crazy and brother branham toes went all hell break loose this corona virus broke loose every time i turn around pray for this person pray for this person pray for this person pray i'm like my lord ain't been this many prayer requests and i don't know every time you turn around somebody need prayer we got to put the devil in this in this place but back back that devil up no that's enough satan that's enough that's enough take your hands off god's property lose god's people let them go we're not gonna we're not gonna accept cancer we're not gonna accept coronavirus we're not gonna accept diabetes we're not gonna accept high blood pressure we ain't taking nothing [Applause] amen dynamics to the mechanics dynamics coming to energize the church somebody hear about healing in somebody else's body they get faith if god do it for them god could do it for me and let me tell you another thing when y'all hear testimonies come forth from up here take the testimonies and share them with people you don't know who's going through what share a testimony with them it'll energize them hallelujah that's how you build people's faith up tell them testimonies oh yeah this happened i haven't i just told you all the testimony how sister was had stage four cancer but laying in her bed and the camera picked it up caught it the lady went back to the doctor's doctor said you you something everything unchanged what happened you healed what happened about to say say i don't see that no more see if they went back and looked at the camera at the house they say while she was sleeping snowflakes was falling on up snowflakes was falling on and at the time the snowflakes fell out that's from heaven it's a supernatural move of god caught by the camera my sister walked away from the hill now don't get me wrong lazarus was healed and he still died right we all gonna leave here one way or the other but i tell you ain't got to take what the devil bring to you amen rise up amen with the power of god in your life rise up come on church the c word is energized by the spirit by the spirit praise god let's pray jesus we thank you for your word god we glorify you we exalt you we praise you we have an expectation god that has been placed in our hearts through the word of the lord the sea word will be energized by the spirit god we trust that you would take this and you would bring life to it he said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost god these are things that you promised and lord i just trust oh god that as the promises have been relayed to the people that you will bring it to pass help us to see lord this the way that you have moved lord throughout the ages how you started with the church on the day of pentecost but how they they organized the catholic church comes some years after they started the first organized church and it calls lord the beginning of denominations that's when you began to leave luther rose up one day and realized that no this is not writing nailed this 95 thesis to the church door and he stepped out by faith he came out god but he eventually the people that followed luther went right back into denomination systems again organized and that's when you left and then met the methodist with john wesley rose up again and said no no no no no there's there's there's great there's a greater work sanctification father they began to to live and declare that gospel lord the day after wesley died many went right back into organization again and you left him father but lord the pentecostals were looking for the restoration of the gifts they were praying for it father you moved by your spirit 1906 god a tremendous move of the spirit there in the southern street god and and and and the gifts broke forth the anointing broke forth but father after many of the leaders died the people went right back into denominationalism again organization and the spirit of god left it but father you promised that there would be another coming out again this is where we are [Music] this is where we are father with the word the restoration of the truth god but we don't want to put all the emphasis father on the mechanics we want to stress the dynamic power of god we want to stress the dynamic power of god let the c word be energized by the holy spirit [Music] it's in jesus name we pray amen amen amen hallelujah [Music] let's just stand our feelings worship the lord and the song amen the song says holy spirit rain on us fill us with your power saturate us with your love holy spirit rain on us hallelujah oh [Laughter] holy spirit rain on us holy spirit rain on us oh feel us with your power and saturate us with your love holy spirit please reign [Music] oh holy spirit [Music] rain on us oh god a holy spirit let it rain on us hallelujah fill us with your power oh fill us with your power and

hallelujah oh yes scott oh yes god thank you jesus whoa glory thank you jesus amen uh brother cooper if you would just come and just greet us and have a closing word of prayer we certainly would appreciate it thank god for you and sister cooper being here with us on today amen praise the lord [Music] thank you jesus thank you do you love him amen you know ministers we also like to hear a good message amen amen and you know there's so many things that were said uh today that's it's been been on my heart for for quite a while and uh let me just i just want to kind of prove it to you a little bit this was a you heard this uh today during the service and the lord had had me prepared this uh back in 1993 and i had to wait until today to hear it just kind of let you know that there might be but a jacket myself are two separate individuals but there's still one spirit working within us amen and so the holy spirit said today there are four for for death angel i mean dead messengers is that right that killed the tree amen i mean the whole thing is right here all right you know so when you when it was red amen i was saying i said oh my god i'm in the right place today amen and to let you know that even though that these the the locus and the the the palmer woman the cankerworm you know i'm now i'm paraphrasing trying to you know not to prolong it let you know that even though the killing brought it right down to the roof there's still a restoration it's a restoration and you know and so but in that restoration he was saying he said that uh he said that one day that you would begin to see yourself saying that you say you may not recognize well let me let me just let me just read it it's recognizing your day and his message say listen his word which he is has begun to be risen his word that is down uh through the aids of luther and wesley you know see it has begun to raise up in power talk about dynamics now is that right then it begins to move then move a little more amen is coming into what identification amen you say you might not you say you you might find yourself identified here in the world as a believer one of these days you all you you may not know him but you may come to know yourself like the prodigal son did and find yourself amen identified in the scriptures amen so what he's what malachi 4 was saying amen that you're the sign of the resurrection amen there's the same god yesterday in malachi 4 we'd have to be the same god to you today is that right maybe because because what we're looking for is like you said is the dynamics is that right but the thing about it is this amen oh hallelujah oh my see sometimes you gotta understand that your soul amen is connected to god a matter of fact it is a part of god but it's buried in your subconscious

but these holy father did you get that jesus christ is praying for you to be one as he and the father one look look what let's read the 20th verse neither alone that's you and i because our heart said what turned back to the we just heard that this morning the holy spirit spoke to us on that this morning is that right in the end that they may also be what one as thou father in us amen amen that's the lord's prayer the lord prayed for you to be one with god amen if you can only believe that if you could only believe that then you will see the dynamics come into this church trying to get you amen to believe what god has made you to be amen father i've just encouraged your people to be more acquainted with themselves and to let them know that they are they were with you before the foundational will and when you came you came and prayed and we know that you don't pray amidst whatever you pray for it shall come to pass and we are here we are here under the expectation for the dynamics oh god father you have already placed your son here lord watering amen the very seed amen that have been planted as the souls of these individuals here just waiting for the right time oh god for f for your spirit that refilling the filling and refilling to come lord god to energize that that would seem to come to flow from the subconscious to the conscious mind and when that conscious

said if poor people make it in i know my people would make it in because i preached what paul preached and the rest of them said we are standing on that oh hallelujah so dear god we thank you our minds are coming to the reality of that which you have ordained for us to be lord god may our spirits be so inspired to draw closer to you dear god that we will step into that vision manifest your
