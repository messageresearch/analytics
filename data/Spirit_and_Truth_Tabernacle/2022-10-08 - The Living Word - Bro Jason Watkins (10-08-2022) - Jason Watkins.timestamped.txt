[23:59] amen and I remember brother brother Hugo
[24:02] McDonald he made a statement uh years
[24:05] ago and it just stuck with me
[24:08] um it was talking about
[24:10] if you had the opportunity a man to uh
[24:14] be in one of brother branham's Services
[24:16] uh where maybe there was thousands in
[24:19] the service or if you had the
[24:22] opportunity to have a personal interview
[24:24] with the prophet he says which one would
[24:27] you choose
[24:28] and uh it's just you and the prophet
[24:30] that's there and every question that you
[24:31] have in your heart you could just just
[24:33] just ask and you know just believe that
[24:35] you'll get an answer and uh and I think
[24:37] you know when he when he posed that
[24:39] question I said for me I said I would
[24:40] love to have this maybe just a little
[24:42] private moment uh with the prophet and
[24:45] just kind of have all my questions
[24:46] answered and and and and and and and not
[24:49] you know I mean I appreciate the big
[24:51] service but you know just that that what

[24:59] intimate moment amen that we can have
[25:01] with God it's just you and God Alone

[39:18] amen and we just want to get out of his
[39:22] way quickly and we're going to invite
[39:24] you right into the scripture to Saint
[39:26] John chapter 1. very familiar reading
[39:30] for us
[39:35] been reading these passages here
[39:37] probably since our days of children and
[39:39] Sunday School
[39:41] here we see
[39:43] this is where Jesus comes to John in the
[39:46] water
[39:47] declares him to be the Lamb of God
[39:51] I want to speak to you tonight on The
[39:53] Living Word the living
[39:55] word and that's I want to underscore
[39:57] living
[39:58] and I sure appreciate just before we get
[40:01] get preaching want to say how much I
[40:03] appreciate brother Jack you have no idea
[40:06] how much we love brother Jack my and uh
[40:10] he's loved around the world and
[40:12] he's been like the the opening of the
[40:15] seals to the men's meeting amen when he
[40:18] come up there last year man it was a
[40:20] seal was broken amen and so they wanted
[40:24] him back this year and I could see why
[40:26] amen so we certainly haven't been
[40:29] enjoying him for many many years and
[40:31] brother Jack and I share teaching duties
[40:34] on our morning Bible study and uh I
[40:37] always loved to catch mother Jack I just
[40:39] his his way of going through his Bible
[40:42] studies is I always glean so much so
[40:45] much so if I say something tonight you
[40:47] might have heard before it's probably
[40:48] why I might have heard brother Jack said
[40:51] Amen on on the line and uh but you know
[40:55] it doesn't belong to any of us it
[40:57] belongs to the Lord and we're just his
[40:59] humble servants amen all you know I I
[41:03] I'm always mindful to say Lord you know
[41:06] that that's all I want to be just your
[41:09] servant amen praise the Lord so we want
[41:12] to to look right into the word of God
[41:15] tonight I have a
[41:17] you know kind of a special burden not
[41:20] not a special sermon per se but a real
[41:23] special burden on my heart that the Lord
[41:26] has been dealing with me about this
[41:28] service tonight and I can't confess to
[41:30] you that I know what's up fully but I do
[41:33] know that the Lord has got a great
[41:35] purpose in this service tonight so I
[41:38] want you to be mindful of that and I've
[41:41] done all I can do I've set myself aside
[41:44] and I've you know just laid before the
[41:47] Lord intentionally and just believing
[41:51] that God wants to do something very
[41:52] special tonight amen so I'm going to
[41:57] pretend I'm at home amen amen I'm among
[42:01] Home Folks
[42:02] amen praise the Lord praise the lord we
[42:05] have one common father and that's
[42:07] almighty God
[42:10] amen but to see brother smile he put a
[42:13] smile on my face
[42:14] I was sitting down my head down I was
[42:17] overlooking my notes and suddenly the
[42:19] room got dark and I I realized somebody
[42:22] stepped into the light and I looked up
[42:24] and there's brother Willian
[42:27] like my grandson with Brother Willie I
[42:30] have to get on my tiptoes to give him a
[42:31] hug
[42:32] brother Smiley my wife told me the first
[42:35] time you ever come and preached at
[42:36] Beaufort and you stepped out and I and
[42:38] and I introduced you at the platform she
[42:40] said
[42:41] for the first time in my life somebody
[42:44] made you look little
[42:46] I said wow
[42:49] hey man so we've been loving brother
[42:52] Willie for a long time as well
[42:54] appreciate his stand in the word of God
[42:56] heard y'all out here talking about
[42:58] brother Diggs and we don't call him
[43:01] brother Diggs around our church we call
[43:03] him the weapon
[43:05] I mean I'm not kidding even on the
[43:07] church calendar it don't say Cadre Diggs
[43:09] it says the weapon and everybody knows
[43:11] when they see that oh brother Diggs is
[43:13] coming
[43:13] [Laughter]
[43:16] even our church calendar says that oh
[43:17] the weapon is going to be here
[43:19] so praise the lord we we sure we seem to
[43:23] love we seem to have a lot of things in
[43:25] common brother Jack that we we love a
[43:28] lot of the same people amen praise the
[43:30] Lord let me get to my scripture a man
[43:33] would stand here and talk I feel relaxed
[43:35] and enjoying myself so
[43:37] amen we just want to go straight in here
[43:41] in first John I'm sorry Saint John
[43:43] chapter 1 verse 29.
[43:49] you have it say Amen
[43:52] the next day John seeth Jesus coming
[43:55] unto him
[43:57] and saith Behold the Lamb of God
[44:00] which taketh away the sin of the world
[44:04] this is he of whom I said after me
[44:06] cometh the man which is preferred before
[44:08] me for he was before me and that amazing
[44:12] he's saying this is the this is this is
[44:15] the man that's right this man and
[44:18] actually John was older and he says this
[44:20] man was actually before me
[44:22] see and I knew him not but that he
[44:26] should be made manifest to Israel
[44:28] therefore am I come baptizing with water
[44:32] and John bear records saying I saw the
[44:34] Spirit descending from heaven like a
[44:37] dove and it Abode upon him and I knew
[44:39] him not but he that sent me to baptize
[44:42] with water the same said unto me upon
[44:46] whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[44:47] descending and remaining on him the same
[44:50] as he which baptizeth with the Holy
[44:52] Ghost and I saw and bear record so John
[44:56] is a living witness here and I saw and
[44:58] bear record that this is the son of God
[45:02] again the next day after John stood in
[45:05] two of his disciples and looking Upon
[45:08] Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the
[45:11] Lamb of God he's saying it again see and
[45:14] the two disciples heard him speak and
[45:16] they followed Jesus
[45:18] and
[45:19] um you know it's just amazing
[45:23] John he's so positive you know that he's
[45:27] he's saying it here two and three times
[45:29] I I bear record this this is the one
[45:32] this is the Son of God this is the Lamb
[45:35] of God see and and so um
[45:39] uh let me see if I want to continue on
[45:42] here
[45:43] yeah okay so verse so verse 38 John Is
[45:46] Now John has been told
[45:48] you know that uh whoever he would see
[45:51] the spirit of God descending and
[45:54] remaining upon this would be the Lamb of
[45:55] God verse 38 then Jesus turned and saw
[45:59] them following and saith unto him what's
[46:01] seek ye they said unto him Rabbi which
[46:04] is to say being interpreted Master where
[46:08] dwelleth thou he saith unto them come
[46:12] and see now if you go 7 chapters deep
[46:15] into the Book of Luke I want to go to
[46:17] Luke chapter 7.
[46:20] praise God
[46:31] now this next passage is astonishing
[46:35] having heard just how positive John
[46:39] was in saying two and three different
[46:43] times repeating it and even telling the
[46:45] miraculous sign that he said the one who
[46:48] sent me told me when you see this and I
[46:50] saw it right now it's it's going to be
[46:53] difficult to reconcile but watch Luke 7
[46:56] 18.
[46:58] and The Disciples of John coming now to
[47:01] Jesus John sent them from prison John
[47:03] gets thrown in prison sends them to see
[47:05] Jesus and the Disciples of John showed
[47:08] him all these things and John calling
[47:11] unto him two of his disciples sent them
[47:14] to Jesus saying art thou he that should
[47:18] come or look we for another
[47:21] when the men were come unto him they
[47:24] said John Baptist hath sent us unto thee
[47:27] saying art thou he that should come or
[47:30] look we for another and in that same
[47:33] hour he cured many of their infirmities
[47:36] and plagues and of evil spirits and unto
[47:39] many that were blind he gave sight then
[47:42] Jesus answering said unto them go your
[47:45] way and tell John what things ye have
[47:48] seen and heard how that the blind sea
[47:51] the lame walk the lepers are cleansed
[47:54] the deaf hear the dead are raised the
[47:57] poor to the poor the gospel is preached
[48:01] and blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[48:05] offended in me
[48:08] let's pray
[48:11] father we stand here tonight Lord and
[48:14] they sang a song Lord that the bride has
[48:17] sung around the world Lord for decades
[48:19] now only believe all things are possible
[48:23] Lord they they sang a song and invited
[48:27] me to come forward and all I've done
[48:29] Lord is follow you up here now that's
[48:32] all I've done that's all I I'm just here
[48:34] to be your assistant Lord that's all I
[48:37] want to be that's all I've ever wanted
[48:39] to be is just your assistant so now Lord
[48:43] I humble myself and as brother Branham
[48:45] said I humbled myself again father now
[48:49] we just lay ourselves out to The
[48:52] Obedience of your spirit may you give us
[48:55] the bread of life we are depending on
[48:57] you tonight in Jesus name amen God bless
[49:00] you friends you can be seated say
[49:02] brother Jack I left that water both of
[49:04] those back there if you could grab one
[49:06] of them for me I'd appreciate it
[49:14] so I want to take tonight the Living
[49:17] Word and I'm I'm just going to if you'll
[49:21] just bear with me for a little bit I
[49:23] like to kind of lay a foundation thank
[49:25] you sir and and kind of build my case
[49:28] you know that's what the the word of God
[49:31] is I'm here to convince you of the word
[49:33] of God now I know you don't need
[49:35] convincing of the word of God you
[49:37] believe the word of God but but but a
[49:39] lot of times uh you know it's one thing
[49:42] to believe the word of God but then when
[49:45] it comes time for the word to live in
[49:47] you now we get a little shaky sometimes
[49:49] a lot of times we have a hard time
[49:52] because you know
[49:54] um kind of like John here we find
[49:57] sometimes that you know life can take a
[50:01] turn right and you know to to John you
[50:04] know it it you know it it it began to
[50:07] look doubtful to him when the
[50:09] circumstances of his life got really bad
[50:12] now it was one thing when he was in
[50:15] church and baptizing people and the
[50:18] spirit of God is descending and the Lamb
[50:20] of God is there and he's he's surrounded
[50:22] by all of his disciples and he's got
[50:25] Fellowship of the Saints and but you
[50:27] know now he he's not in church he don't
[50:29] have Fellowship he's cut off he's in
[50:31] jail and and suddenly life's not so
[50:34] bright anymore and brother Branham talks
[50:37] about his eagle eyes must have got a
[50:39] little dim and and you know and I I say
[50:41] that tonight not to not to throw our
[50:45] dear brother John under the bus but to
[50:47] encourage you if it can happen to Elijah
[50:50] it can happen to me it can happen to you
[50:53] that's right you know a lot of times you
[50:56] don't you know you don't always have
[50:57] that same you know that same feeling you
[51:00] you know a lot of times a pastor I I
[51:02] said this to my church recently I when I
[51:05] sometimes when I see the people you know
[51:07] away from church I don't always see that
[51:09] glowing smile and that joy and that
[51:11] happiness because life has a way of
[51:13] getting you down
[51:15] and then in perfect honesty and perfect
[51:17] sincerity and humility I don't always
[51:20] see the same guy in the mirror that I
[51:22] was that I was on Sunday
[51:24] I mean on Sunday you know it's the power
[51:26] of God and the people are here and the
[51:28] singing and the worship and the
[51:30] preaching and mind you just where's that
[51:32] devil and you're ready to crush him and
[51:34] then and then Monday comes
[51:37] and then sometimes things aren't as rosy
[51:40] and beautiful as they as they were and
[51:43] you know this is this is how it can go
[51:45] but now I'm preaching to you tonight on
[51:48] a living word because there is a word to
[51:51] be lived not just believed
[51:56] you know a lot of times we have to come
[52:00] to the sobering reality that we don't
[52:02] believe the word quite as much as we
[52:05] would like to think we do
[52:07] and and I and I'm not talking about
[52:09] being mentally convinced of it I'm
[52:11] talking about seeing it manifest in my
[52:14] life
[52:15] because if you believe it you'll live it
[52:17] so then sometimes when I see how I do
[52:20] and see how I am and see how I go
[52:23] sometimes I catch my actions or my
[52:25] reactions which is normally that gets us
[52:28] in trouble more than our actions is our
[52:30] reactions and I wonder my goodness I
[52:33] don't I don't have enough Faith here I
[52:35] thought I was a believer of this word
[52:37] hallelujah it's sometimes it can be
[52:40] uncomfortable to look in God's mirror
[52:45] and the and that you know it's when you
[52:48] when you look in the mirror of God's
[52:50] word it shows you the kind of person you
[52:53] really are
[52:55] and Paul you know he he warned against
[52:59] coming and looking into the mirror of
[53:01] God's word looking into this Liberty and
[53:05] and then the word really shows you
[53:08] really where you are
[53:10] I mean it takes away all doubt when you
[53:12] come out of the presence of God and the
[53:13] anointing and the and the ministry
[53:15] starts preaching the word of God you
[53:17] really get a real look at where you are
[53:20] spiritually
[53:22] and and that's not a bad thing that's a
[53:24] good thing that's why you come to church
[53:26] the bad thing Paul says is you leave the
[53:28] church and forget straight away what
[53:31] manner of man or woman the Bible showed
[53:34] you you were
[53:36] yes
[53:38] see Jesus talked about a principle of of
[53:41] the children of God versus the children
[53:44] of Darkness the children of Darkness do
[53:46] not like the light they won't come to
[53:48] the light they don't want to come to the
[53:50] light because the light exposes them and
[53:53] they don't want to be exposed but he
[53:56] talks about the children of God come to
[53:59] the light they love the light and the
[54:02] word of God exposes me it exposes you
[54:05] but I'm here to tell you I want to be
[54:07] exposed now don't want to be exposed to
[54:10] you but I want to be exposed to me I
[54:13] want to know where I stand I want to
[54:15] know if I got a problem I want to know
[54:17] about it
[54:17] [Music]
[54:20] I don't want the Lord to just Pat me on
[54:23] the head and say you're a good boy now
[54:24] carry on I want to know I'm looking to
[54:26] make a rapture
[54:29] I want to see the power of God flow
[54:32] freely when I pray for my children or
[54:34] grandchildren I want to see Devils move
[54:38] when I when I got married couples coming
[54:40] that need a problem I want to have a
[54:43] problem I want to see a devil defeated
[54:45] people are sick people are bound I want
[54:48] to see them free
[54:51] I got no time uh to to let myself I got
[54:55] no time for me
[54:58] listen we have seen the enemy and it is
[55:00] us
[55:02] that man in the mirror is your worst
[55:04] enemy see it's that one that you've got
[55:08] to constantly put under the blood and
[55:10] constantly keep your guard up
[55:14] there's a Living Word to be lived and a
[55:16] living force of God working to live his
[55:20] life in you that's a that's a mouthful
[55:22] but that's a point that I want you to
[55:24] get right off the bat there is there is
[55:27] a word to be lived there was a word in
[55:30] every age and there's a word in this age
[55:31] to be lived and a living force of God
[55:35] working to live his life in you now say
[55:39] man that's Jubilee I'm going to shout
[55:40] for that hold on there's an enemy
[55:43] lurking
[55:44] there's also an anti-word
[55:47] and a living devil trying to do the same
[55:49] thing
[55:51] just like there's a spirit of Christ
[55:53] there's a spirit of antichrist and just
[55:56] like there's a word there's an anti-word
[55:58] and just like there's a living God
[56:00] trying to live his Living Word in you
[56:02] alive there's a there's a devil trying
[56:05] to live an anti-word by his anti-life
[56:08] and know this he is anti-life
[56:11] he is anti-life I tell young people he's
[56:14] not your friend he he's trying he hates
[56:16] you he hates your family he wants to
[56:18] kill you he wants to kill every Satan
[56:20] will take away from you everything you
[56:23] care about
[56:24] right amen amen
[56:28] I want to be subject to The Living Word
[56:31] of God
[56:34] Jesus concluded here when he was
[56:38] he was giving the answer to John's
[56:41] disciples
[56:42] you know he didn't reintroduce himself
[56:44] he didn't he didn't pull out a business
[56:47] card you know John wants to know are you
[56:49] the one you know he he didn't he didn't
[56:52] show a photo ID he had nothing to do
[56:53] with that he wasn't trying to say yeah
[56:55] go back and tell him yeah I'm Jesus of
[56:57] Nazareth and his mother and my mother
[56:58] and all you know remember all of that
[57:00] remember that prophecy he didn't
[57:02] actually he actually didn't even go into
[57:04] the in into the into just the the
[57:06] history of of Prophecy but he actually
[57:10] referring back to Isaiah 61 about that
[57:14] the spirit of the Lord God would be upon
[57:16] him now he had already read that and
[57:18] went into his ministry the spirit of the
[57:20] Lord God is upon me to do what to set
[57:22] that Liberty that I'm her held captive
[57:24] to open these blinded eyes
[57:26] to to declare the acceptable year of the
[57:29] Lord
[57:30] and so when he when he's going to remind
[57:33] a word prophet of who he is what does he
[57:36] do he says go back and tell John what
[57:39] things you have seen and heard how that
[57:43] the blind sea the lame walk the lepers
[57:46] are cleansed the death here the dead
[57:48] erased the poor have the gospel preach
[57:50] because John knew a word Prophet would
[57:52] identify the word
[57:56] Jesus knew that a word Prophet like John
[58:00] Jesus knew a word Prophet would identify
[58:03] by the word
[58:05] and when he could see when the disciples
[58:07] came back as living witnesses to say
[58:09] what he read in Isaiah 61 1-2 we saw it
[58:14] we Are Witnesses and and that that
[58:17] satisfied John he was ready to go home
[58:19] to Glory
[58:21] I'm here to tell you something friends
[58:22] sometimes we can get down also we can
[58:25] get our eagle eyes filmed over uh
[58:27] circumstances can put that on us but
[58:29] when I come back to this word and I and
[58:32] I don't see it's just on a page but I
[58:34] see it living in the lives of the people
[58:36] and I see the the divine power of God
[58:39] moving
[58:40] see you've come too late to tell me it's
[58:43] not true
[58:46] and Jesus said blessed is he whosoever
[58:49] shall not be offended in me see
[58:52] so Jesus who was performing these
[58:55] Messianic Miracles reminded John's
[58:58] Disciples of this
[59:02] his point was that
[59:04] you know don't be offended when you see
[59:07] the word coming to pass
[59:10] when you go back to the Greek you find
[59:12] that it's meaning don't get trapped and
[59:16] thus let oneself be ensnared away from
[59:20] the word of God
[59:22] because sometimes The Word Alive offends
[59:26] human Minds
[59:28] it
[59:29] offends political correctness
[59:33] sometimes it it you know Jesus looks at
[59:36] a at a Greek woman and calls her a dog
[59:38] brother Branham said if he'd have done
[59:40] that to a Pentecostal they had jumped up
[59:42] and walked straight out of the building
[59:43] and I said I don't have to put up with
[59:45] this and she didn't have to put up with
[59:47] it but she was willing to
[59:50] because it was a test of her faith oh my
[59:53] goodness friends how many of us could
[59:54] witness tonight and say the Lord has
[59:56] tested me and I'm here still standing
[59:59] and still believing this word
[1:00:02] Hallelujah one had to have faith in his
[1:00:05] message and in his works that he was
[1:00:08] indeed that Messiah the worst
[1:00:10] translation records that 23rd verse and
[1:00:13] spiritually prosperous is he whoever
[1:00:16] does not find in me that of which he
[1:00:19] disapproves and which hinders him from
[1:00:22] acknowledging my authority
[1:00:25] now it's interesting because when they
[1:00:28] had said to Jesus we read it in our
[1:00:31] opening text
[1:00:32] then Jesus turned and saw them following
[1:00:34] and saith unto him what seek you they
[1:00:36] said in them Rabbi where dwelleth thou
[1:00:38] and he saith unto them come and see it's
[1:00:41] interesting because he's already
[1:00:43] starting to establish here that that you
[1:00:47] know you're going to have a right and
[1:00:50] you should have an expectation to see
[1:00:54] the power of God
[1:00:56] it shouldn't just be something that's an
[1:00:58] intellectual concept because you can be
[1:01:01] persuaded
[1:01:03] that doesn't mean you're revelated
[1:01:06] if you can be talked in you can be
[1:01:08] talked out if you can be persuaded in
[1:01:10] you can be dissuaded out brother Burley
[1:01:12] Williams honor brother Burley brother
[1:01:14] Burley told me one time he said brother
[1:01:15] Jason I learned long time ago if
[1:01:18] somebody can get you in with a hot dog
[1:01:19] somebody gets you out with a hamburger
[1:01:24] said Burley you're the only man in the
[1:01:26] world would come up with
[1:01:29] and there's so much truth in that listen
[1:01:32] friends I'm not I I the Bible is
[1:01:34] provable and the message is provable by
[1:01:36] the Bible if you believe the Bible you
[1:01:37] can't you can't uh you can't come
[1:01:39] against the message
[1:01:41] I've been challenging that since 15
[1:01:44] years old doing public Bible studies uh
[1:01:46] in public I mean that this this message
[1:01:49] is nothing but the scriptures and it's
[1:01:52] provable forwards and backwards I I one
[1:01:55] time we had a a a a situation in
[1:01:57] Beaufort where we had a church come
[1:01:59] against us and we decided to have a kind
[1:02:01] of a public venue in a public forum that
[1:02:03] I wouldn't let it turn into a debate but
[1:02:05] I said it'll be a it'll be an open forum
[1:02:07] and uh I'll take some time and you can
[1:02:09] take some time and we'll invite the
[1:02:11] public and and let whoever wants to come
[1:02:13] and I probably shouldn't have said that
[1:02:15] man the newspaper got a hold of it
[1:02:16] brother Jack and people started showing
[1:02:19] up we had the Performing Arts uh rented
[1:02:21] at the college campus College professors
[1:02:24] were coming students were coming people
[1:02:26] from the community were coming is like a
[1:02:28] big Showdown and I didn't want him to be
[1:02:29] a big Showdown oh my but you know we
[1:02:33] were I don't want to get sidetracked
[1:02:34] that's a lengthy testimony but but but
[1:02:36] but but I'm making this point that that
[1:02:39] we had agreed to to take the topic of
[1:02:43] the original sin wow
[1:02:45] and this this this pastor had a big
[1:02:47] Bible school as Doctor of divinity had a
[1:02:49] large Bible school that he was the dean
[1:02:51] of and and pastor of a large Church
[1:02:54] there and here I am you know this is why
[1:02:56] I was just starting my goodness I didn't
[1:02:57] have maybe 30 some odd people and and
[1:03:00] and here we are all of our people in one
[1:03:02] little row and his whole church filling
[1:03:04] up row after row after Rome and then all
[1:03:07] the people come in the back and the
[1:03:08] professors and students and uh in place
[1:03:11] with seat 500 people and we didn't have
[1:03:13] near that but but we had probably at
[1:03:15] least several hundred and so you know
[1:03:18] but I I was trying to get him to
[1:03:20] understand that you know I'm going to
[1:03:22] bring the thought of the original sin
[1:03:24] the Serpent's Seed and you know he just
[1:03:27] he just you know he I don't want to
[1:03:29] repeat what he said it's not anything to
[1:03:32] repeat in a pulpits not even something
[1:03:33] I'd want to repeat in public the man was
[1:03:36] just so horrible and you know he's
[1:03:38] threatening this and he's going to do
[1:03:39] this and make me you know make me look
[1:03:41] like an idiot and all these kind of
[1:03:42] things and I'm just you know and and
[1:03:45] we're kind of go on the phone and I'm
[1:03:47] thinking wow why is this guy so upset
[1:03:49] we're just we're supposed to be
[1:03:50] preachers we're gonna just discuss the
[1:03:52] scripture and and you know he uh he said
[1:03:56] he said I won't have any problem he said
[1:03:57] because that that that that that
[1:03:59] Doctrine is nowhere in the Bible
[1:04:02] and I said Dr Baker it's all through the
[1:04:04] Bible
[1:04:05] and he said I'll take my Bible and he
[1:04:07] said I'll make you look well he's what
[1:04:09] he said he'd make me look like I ain't
[1:04:10] gonna say
[1:04:13] back part of a horse but he didn't say
[1:04:16] it that way
[1:04:18] yeah
[1:04:19] it had a he had a thoroughbred Baptist
[1:04:22] temper
[1:04:26] and so you know we're
[1:04:28] and I I was troubled and I I said he
[1:04:32] said I'm going to take my Bible and show
[1:04:34] you up in this way and I said Dr Baker
[1:04:36] I'm just going to warn you right now I
[1:04:38] said I'm just going to warn you sir your
[1:04:40] doctor of divinity I have none of that I
[1:04:43] said but I'm going to warn you
[1:04:45] that if you if you come against the
[1:04:49] teaching of the original sin you better
[1:04:52] bring something other than your Bible
[1:04:55] oh and that just kind of made him more
[1:04:57] mad I said because it's all
[1:05:00] the Bible
[1:05:02] and uh and and God came down and proved
[1:05:04] it in it in a miraculous way amen I I
[1:05:07] can't get sidetracked on all these
[1:05:09] stories but I'm here to tell you
[1:05:10] something friend God God
[1:05:13] proves his word
[1:05:15] God proves his word
[1:05:17] you don't have to you don't have to back
[1:05:19] up from it God will demonstrate it I've
[1:05:22] seen him demonstrated around the world
[1:05:23] this Living Word lives see
[1:05:27] and so so we find then that Jesus would
[1:05:31] when they said where do you do you where
[1:05:33] do you dwell and he said come and see
[1:05:34] interestingly enough we find that this
[1:05:37] is the very thing he says in Revelation
[1:05:39] 6 1 when the seals are opened and and I
[1:05:43] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[1:05:44] seals and I heard as the very first one
[1:05:46] as it were the noise of a thunder one of
[1:05:48] the four be saying come and see
[1:05:51] he says it again all the way through all
[1:05:53] the way through the fourth seal under
[1:05:55] the eagle age that we live in today
[1:05:56] Revelation 6 7 and we need to open the
[1:05:59] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[1:06:01] fourth Beast say come and see so there's
[1:06:04] obviously something to be said about
[1:06:07] what we see what we perceive and what we
[1:06:11] conclude
[1:06:13] see
[1:06:15] so it it becomes very clear in the
[1:06:18] scripture that you know life can throw
[1:06:21] these things at us just like it through
[1:06:23] things that John but you know John was
[1:06:26] able to recover by a reconsideration of
[1:06:29] the word of God you know I want to tell
[1:06:31] you something tonight friends I I I
[1:06:33] can't help and I might can't even
[1:06:36] explain why why why you might be in the
[1:06:39] trial you're in why something might be
[1:06:42] in your life hindering you it might be a
[1:06:44] sickness it might be a bondage it might
[1:06:46] be some Calamity it might I don't know
[1:06:48] what it might be but I know this have a
[1:06:51] reconsideration of the word of God
[1:06:53] tonight
[1:06:54] because my conclusion is this that he
[1:06:57] lives and he's true and he wants to live
[1:07:00] in me
[1:07:03] and it becomes important what we believe
[1:07:05] and what we demonstrate
[1:07:08] see brother Brannan picks this up in
[1:07:11] looking at the Unseen and the seventh
[1:07:13] seal and various places I don't want to
[1:07:16] get too bogged down tonight uh in
[1:07:18] scriptures and quotes because I'm trying
[1:07:20] to really deliver my heart to you
[1:07:22] my brother Branham talks about being a
[1:07:24] witness amen
[1:07:26] and you remember he tells the the
[1:07:28] amusing story of being a boy and how he
[1:07:30] could jump out of his overalls into the
[1:07:32] cold water and all of his friends he was
[1:07:34] always the first one in and one finger
[1:07:37] minutes cold be careful come in Easy
[1:07:39] boys two fingers met yeah it's warm Jump
[1:07:42] On In and and brother Branham said he
[1:07:44] said now he says he says I I was a
[1:07:48] witness I had already tested it and now
[1:07:51] if there's any here tonight that
[1:07:53] perchance are not born again just come
[1:07:55] on in the water's fine
[1:07:57] I've already witnessed it
[1:08:01] he was a witness of God's word
[1:08:04] you're you're more of a witness than you
[1:08:06] realize friends I'm a witness
[1:08:09] I've take I've traveled this message on
[1:08:11] six of seven continents and I've seen
[1:08:13] the power of God move I know what this
[1:08:15] word will do in a person's life
[1:08:18] Hallelujah
[1:08:20] brother Brandon talks about in the
[1:08:21] seventh seal man have I ever had this
[1:08:23] happen
[1:08:24] he says I went to a man not long ago
[1:08:27] he come to me rather and he had been
[1:08:29] arguing oh my they loved argue don't
[1:08:31] they
[1:08:32] he had been arguing all around
[1:08:34] everywhere
[1:08:37] against Divine Healing
[1:08:40] all right and he come up and he said I
[1:08:41] don't believe in Your Divine Healing
[1:08:43] I said mine I guess wouldn't be any good
[1:08:46] because I ain't got any
[1:08:48] and he said and I said but God is
[1:08:49] perfect and he says there is no such a
[1:08:52] thing I said you're too late to say that
[1:08:54] buddy
[1:08:55] yeah you done waited too long for that
[1:08:57] you might argued that a few years ago
[1:09:00] but there's another age on now there's
[1:09:02] Millions to testify I said you're too
[1:09:04] late now fella to say that
[1:09:07] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:09:08] the world is too late to tell me it's
[1:09:11] not true because we're all we're we're
[1:09:14] living and I'm not just talking about
[1:09:16] miracles I'm talking about the greatest
[1:09:18] Miracle listen friends the greatest
[1:09:20] Miracle you've already accomplished it
[1:09:22] in your life
[1:09:24] you pass from Death unto life something
[1:09:26] you had no way to affect in your own
[1:09:28] life but God rich in Mercy it was a
[1:09:31] supernatural act
[1:09:33] I mean your human mind was enmity
[1:09:35] against God and could never agree with
[1:09:37] this word how are you ever even going to
[1:09:39] believe it God rich in Mercy I'm here to
[1:09:42] tell you something friends you've
[1:09:44] already conquered the greatest battle
[1:09:45] you would ever have to fight
[1:09:47] everything from there is downhill
[1:09:50] because now you got a new nature so
[1:09:52] don't be discouraged press the battle
[1:09:58] we're living in an age of impossibility
[1:10:01] it is impossibly dark
[1:10:03] there's no way no bride should have been
[1:10:05] able to survive this my brother Brandon
[1:10:07] when he's asked I remember theorasmus
[1:10:09] talked talking about when brother
[1:10:10] Brandon was there and there was a
[1:10:12] reporter from his country who
[1:10:14] interviewed brother Branham concerning
[1:10:16] his prediction of 1977. why did you
[1:10:18] choose 1977.
[1:10:20] and he says because that it got so dark
[1:10:24] after that he said I couldn't I don't
[1:10:27] think I didn't think anyone could
[1:10:28] survive it
[1:10:30] and here you are decades into
[1:10:33] impossibility you are decades you say I
[1:10:37] don't feel like much of a Christian God
[1:10:39] is doing more in you than you are aware
[1:10:42] of Hallelujah the world is falling away
[1:10:45] into insanity but there's a group of
[1:10:47] people who are still standing
[1:10:50] still believing still going forward
[1:10:56] the world cannot have me I belong to the
[1:10:59] Lord
[1:11:03] God keeps his word god proves his word
[1:11:07] God is looking to live his word through
[1:11:10] you
[1:11:11] I mean in the in the nature change and
[1:11:13] Divine Healing and deliverance and and
[1:11:16] blessing and all of these various things
[1:11:17] I mean listen friends they've come too
[1:11:20] late to tell me I've done seen blinded
[1:11:22] eyes open
[1:11:23] I've done seen the lame walk I I've I've
[1:11:26] I've been around ministers personal
[1:11:28] close ministers and and we've already
[1:11:31] had the dead raise and that's that's not
[1:11:33] yesteryear that's recent
[1:11:35] friends you who can raise the dead
[1:11:37] except God
[1:11:40] see
[1:11:42] so I've I've seen too many experiences
[1:11:45] one of the things that I've looked for
[1:11:46] and I would just say it like this
[1:11:49] one of the things that when I look in
[1:11:50] the book of Acts
[1:11:52] and I see
[1:11:54] you know the various Miracles and and
[1:11:56] the the shadow of Peter and and and you
[1:12:01] know and and laying their hands in many
[1:12:03] many miracles and the power of God
[1:12:05] one of the things that always has
[1:12:07] intrigued me
[1:12:08] was when I come to the house of
[1:12:10] Cornelius
[1:12:12] now Peter is on a roof
[1:12:14] he's praise and prayer his daily prayer
[1:12:18] and here comes a vision
[1:12:19] and a blanket is let down by the Four
[1:12:21] Corners and upon it is all manner of
[1:12:24] unclean beasts that as a Jew he's not
[1:12:27] supposed to eat
[1:12:28] and he hears a voice saying Peter slay
[1:12:30] and eat and he says not so Lord no
[1:12:32] unclean thing has touched my lips and
[1:12:34] the Lord said to him don't call unclean
[1:12:36] what I've called clean
[1:12:38] now the Lord's trying to he's about to
[1:12:40] to do something and he's trying to give
[1:12:43] Peter the word so that when it happens
[1:12:45] it'll make sense to him see I want to
[1:12:48] tell you something Friends The Rapture
[1:12:49] is going to make sense to me because
[1:12:51] I've already got the word in this hour
[1:12:54] you say how you know you're you're an
[1:12:57] overcomer I know I'm an overcomer and I
[1:13:00] understand how I am because the word
[1:13:01] said I would be and it sent me what I
[1:13:04] would need to be that
[1:13:05] say Do you ever make mistakes that's the
[1:13:08] beauty of it I do all the time then how
[1:13:10] are you an overcomer listen brother
[1:13:12] branham's taught us that that that when
[1:13:15] you are knocked down that doesn't mean
[1:13:17] you're defeated
[1:13:19] it's only when you lay there that you're
[1:13:22] defeated
[1:13:25] Hallelujah I said brother Jack I said to
[1:13:28] my church some time ago I walked out
[1:13:29] from my poop and I said you're looking
[1:13:31] at a man undefeated in battle
[1:13:34] because I've never laid there I always
[1:13:36] get back up and get back up and get back
[1:13:39] up I've never actually been defeated
[1:13:42] I've been knocked down but I'm not
[1:13:45] defeated I'm 59 years old I'm 59-0 I've
[1:13:49] never been defeated
[1:13:52] Hallelujah
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:58] and it makes sense to me because he's
[1:14:00] given me the word
[1:14:02] the world doesn't scare me my heart's
[1:14:05] not failing for fear
[1:14:06] because the greatest fear is the fear of
[1:14:08] the unknown
[1:14:10] that's why little kids won't go in a
[1:14:11] dark room even adults won't sometimes
[1:14:13] because you don't know what's in there
[1:14:15] especially if you're in there and you
[1:14:16] can't see and you hear a noise then he's
[1:14:18] supposed to be there
[1:14:19] oh my goodness my my oldest grandson
[1:14:22] Gideon big big is brother Smiley and 19
[1:14:26] could probably press me with one arm
[1:14:30] and he spent the night at our house me
[1:14:32] and sister Debbie were out of town
[1:14:33] people can I stay at your house yes sure
[1:14:35] gee and so he's he he calls me up and I
[1:14:38] and I looked at my phone I said Gideon's
[1:14:40] calling me and I answered he goes Peppa
[1:14:42] your house makes a lot of weird noises
[1:14:45] I said get in it you're fine you're I
[1:14:48] mean I'd be terrified if I come and
[1:14:50] broke in the house and you were in there
[1:14:52] and so you know but but but but but
[1:14:55] men's Hearts failing for fear my heart's
[1:14:59] not failing for fear because not only do
[1:15:01] I know what's going on I understand it I
[1:15:05] understand what's going on I understand
[1:15:08] what God's up to I understand the why
[1:15:11] and that's the question that plagues man
[1:15:13] is the why even if he understands the
[1:15:16] what he but the why but I know the what
[1:15:18] and the why and I know the end and I
[1:15:21] know the plan and I know what's I know
[1:15:23] what we're doing
[1:15:24] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:15:26] this crazy world makes perfect sense to
[1:15:29] me because of the Bible I know that man
[1:15:33] has to go off into insanity and Destroy
[1:15:36] himself
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:38] amen and so when the world sees what's
[1:15:41] happening in Russia or Ukraine or North
[1:15:43] Korea or China there there you Wall
[1:15:45] Street gets all nervous and the stocks
[1:15:47] go up and down and the president makes
[1:15:49] all kinds of speeches and and people do
[1:15:51] all kinds of things I just sit back and
[1:15:53] turn the next page yeah I knew it and
[1:15:56] there it is there it is and there it is
[1:15:59] I see what the devil's doing I know what
[1:16:02] the plan is hallelujah we're privileged
[1:16:06] tonight friends
[1:16:10] and I and here goes Peter it happens
[1:16:13] three times he says now there's men
[1:16:15] coming doubt nothing go with them
[1:16:17] he goes with them
[1:16:19] he goes into the house of Cornelius
[1:16:21] and he's still he's still unaware what's
[1:16:23] going on there's a gentile he's
[1:16:25] definitely not supposed to be hanging
[1:16:26] out with him and he goes in and
[1:16:29] Cornelius starts to tell him a testimony
[1:16:31] I was in prayer just like Peter and a
[1:16:34] man in shining garment stood in front of
[1:16:36] me and said send a Joppa for a man named
[1:16:39] Simon Peter and he it is who will give
[1:16:43] you the words of life and so I sent
[1:16:45] Messengers and they got you and here you
[1:16:48] are and now my whole household is
[1:16:50] assembled and we want to hear what you
[1:16:53] have to say
[1:16:55] and Peter
[1:16:57] began preaching and I've always looked
[1:17:00] at this brother Jack because it's one
[1:17:02] thing you know brother Brian I'm talking
[1:17:03] about the laying on of hands and he said
[1:17:05] that's a Jewish thing the Gentile was
[1:17:07] just say the word you know as you
[1:17:09] believed so be it unto you and and
[1:17:11] brother Branham used prayer lines that
[1:17:13] we use them I use them all the time I'd
[1:17:15] hold one tonight if the Lord told me to
[1:17:16] uh we're not not nothing against that
[1:17:19] don't misunderstand me that's not my
[1:17:20] point but but but while Peter was
[1:17:24] speaking while the word was going
[1:17:26] forward suddenly the Holy Ghost fell
[1:17:29] down and baptized everyone in the house
[1:17:32] and when Peter got back they bring him
[1:17:35] up you know call him on the carpet you
[1:17:36] know when he gets back to Jerusalem and
[1:17:38] you know what were you doing and Peter
[1:17:40] said listen here's what happened I was
[1:17:42] on the roof I saw a vision I went to see
[1:17:44] him he told me he saw an angel and I
[1:17:46] started preaching and the Holy Ghost
[1:17:48] failed just like it did on us what you
[1:17:50] want me to do about it I'm not God God
[1:17:53] can do whatever he wants to do I'm just
[1:17:55] here to be a servant
[1:17:57] see he didn't warn me he didn't tell me
[1:17:59] what was happening I might not have went
[1:18:01] if he'd have warned me he told me to go
[1:18:03] and doubt nothing see
[1:18:05] and while Peter yet spank these words I
[1:18:07] was in I was in Moscow probably I think
[1:18:10] 2018 Maybe 2019. and I I had always
[1:18:13] looked at that scripture brother Jack
[1:18:15] and I like I say many times I'd seen
[1:18:17] Devils cast off laying on of hands
[1:18:19] calling on the name of the Lord epilepsy
[1:18:22] demon possession blinded eyes you name
[1:18:25] it deafness it didn't matter
[1:18:27] um you know and see people baptized with
[1:18:29] the Holy Ghost those kind of things you
[1:18:31] accumulate we were we were we were
[1:18:34] baptizing in the Philippines one time
[1:18:36] after a set of meetings and a man a
[1:18:38] native man can't the the native
[1:18:40] Filipinos are not Asian that's who
[1:18:43] settled the island the native Filipinos
[1:18:44] are dark skinned they live up in the
[1:18:46] mountains and he actually come down
[1:18:48] walked for days to get to the meetings
[1:18:50] and sat in the meetings I didn't even
[1:18:52] know he understood English I don't know
[1:18:53] if he had an interpreter but at the end
[1:18:55] he wanted to be baptized and that man
[1:18:58] came when he stepped out to be baptized
[1:19:01] we realized this man's entire body was
[1:19:04] covered in sores and in and for and and
[1:19:08] I I don't know I'm not a doctor but I'm
[1:19:11] going to tell you every symptom suggest
[1:19:12] tested it with smallpox he was covered
[1:19:15] in them now that's supposed to be
[1:19:17] eliminated pretty much in the world but
[1:19:19] in those upper mountains that's what it
[1:19:21] looked like this man had little sores
[1:19:23] all head to toe
[1:19:25] when he come down in the water and
[1:19:27] brother walls baptized him in the name
[1:19:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ that man came
[1:19:31] up with baby skin
[1:19:33] those sores literally washed right off
[1:19:36] of him
[1:19:37] see
[1:19:39] so don't I already know you've come too
[1:19:41] late to tell me God don't keep his word
[1:19:44] you know I had an I had an 80 year old
[1:19:46] lady come up you'd think you know why
[1:19:48] would God here she is 80. why don't she
[1:19:51] just be happy with what she's gotten
[1:19:52] going to be with the Lord but God cares
[1:19:54] about 80 year olds
[1:19:56] my mother's 81 and I'm glad he cares
[1:19:59] about her
[1:20:01] and she'd come up blind and we prayed a
[1:20:04] prayer for her one of one of her eyes
[1:20:06] was completely blood blind she couldn't
[1:20:08] see out of it at all and this eye was
[1:20:10] not doing so good and this one was
[1:20:12] totally blind and we just prayed a
[1:20:14] simple prayer for her that night in the
[1:20:16] meeting and she went home she left the
[1:20:18] prayer line still blind but that doesn't
[1:20:20] matter
[1:20:21] that never matters see she she comes
[1:20:25] back the next night when we're walking
[1:20:26] up and I'm walking up into the building
[1:20:28] big big Auditorium and and the
[1:20:31] translators with me and all of a sudden
[1:20:33] you wouldn't think an 80 year old woman
[1:20:34] could run
[1:20:36] Here Comes This lady running screaming
[1:20:39] and as soon as I saw her coming I knew
[1:20:42] what must have happened and she come
[1:20:43] rolling up speaking and speaking in
[1:20:45] Russian and and she she she she's doing
[1:20:48] this right here and she's going you know
[1:20:50] and I just started praising God and
[1:20:53] she's telling the translator and the
[1:20:55] translator said oh my brother Jason last
[1:20:57] night after you prayed she went back to
[1:20:59] her room and she went to bed and in the
[1:21:01] middle of the night a light came into
[1:21:03] her room and went inside her eye and
[1:21:05] came back out and now she can see
[1:21:09] Hallelujah
[1:21:11] God keeps his word friend
[1:21:14] to tell you he's reliable
[1:21:17] you can believe him for anything
[1:21:23] so I've seen cases where we laid hands
[1:21:26] we had a beautiful five-year-old little
[1:21:28] girl beautiful oh my goodness she was

[1:22:01] dressed very fine she was in very
[1:22:03] expensive clothes and they just brought
[1:22:05] her up into the prayer line
[1:22:07] and you know what I just prayed a simple
[1:22:09] prayer listen there was no thunderclaps
[1:22:12] or lightning flashes I just simply
[1:22:15] commanded the devil to leave her
[1:22:17] she was healed that instant she stopped
[1:22:20] having seizures that moment
[1:22:22] and she didn't need medicine anymore she
[1:22:25] walked up Bound by a devil and without

[1:23:29] we didn't pray for anybody he said no it
[1:23:30] was while you were preaching
[1:23:33] and I thought about the book of Acts
[1:23:34] while Peter yet spake these words
[1:23:37] and I said what happened he goes there
[1:23:39] were several people who had been
[1:23:41] battling disease and sickness and while
[1:23:44] you were preaching the word they stood
[1:23:45] up healed completely
[1:23:47] and he said they're totally healed
[1:23:49] and I said my that's a that's wonderful
[1:23:52] the very next night same thing happened
[1:23:54] again the very next night same thing
[1:23:55] happened again young people who had been
[1:23:58] seeking the Holy Ghost were standing up
[1:24:00] full of Holy Ghost
[1:24:02] people who had been bound and and all
[1:24:05] kinds of of weaknesses in their lives
[1:24:07] and bound by evil spirits stood up free
[1:24:10] we I there was a man who came in off the
[1:24:13] street when he walked in off the street
[1:24:15] I would brother Jack he was a sinner and
[1:24:18] he had been in a far City and he was
[1:24:20] drugs and alcohol and spent all his
[1:24:22] money and his last rubles his last
[1:24:24] rubles something told him get on a train
[1:24:27] and go to this city where we were
[1:24:29] holding the meetings and he got off the
[1:24:32] train he has nothing he's just walking
[1:24:33] down the street and he walks past our
[1:24:35] building and he hears uh he hears uh
[1:24:38] singing and he comes walking into the
[1:24:41] building and by the time he walks in I'm
[1:24:43] not even preaching I'm just reading my
[1:24:46] text
[1:24:47] I'm just reading my Bible I'm reading
[1:24:50] the text and that man threw his hands up
[1:24:52] and hit the floor and gave his heart to
[1:24:54] the Lord on the spot
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:24:58] and he said God is in this place and I
[1:25:01] want a part of that God in my life
[1:25:03] and that and the Lord turned his life
[1:25:06] around let me tell you something friends
[1:25:07] God can turn your life around and it
[1:25:10] doesn't take him very long
[1:25:14] Hallelujah he can do it in five minutes
[1:25:19] and I was standing there and and then
[1:25:22] the third night and then the fourth
[1:25:23] night and it just kept happening it kept
[1:25:25] happening Brother Jack we lost count how
[1:25:27] many people were coming up saying I've
[1:25:28] had this for years I'm free I've had
[1:25:30] this for years I'm free I've had this
[1:25:32] for years I'm free
[1:25:34] and on the last night the very last
[1:25:36] night
[1:25:38] after after the uh it was actually the
[1:25:40] next morning it was the Sunday morning
[1:25:42] service we had
[1:25:43] Services leading up to the Sunday
[1:25:46] and I finished preaching I never called
[1:25:48] a prayer line
[1:25:49] I didn't need to
[1:25:52] I never even called one
[1:25:53] just just that preaching
[1:25:56] and and after the Sunday service
[1:25:59] there was an elderly lady who came with
[1:26:02] brother Sergey with the pastor because
[1:26:05] the story was a little strange and I
[1:26:07] think brother Sergey knew it would make
[1:26:09] me feel better if he actually related
[1:26:11] the story
[1:26:12] and this woman was elderly I would she
[1:26:15] was certainly older than me not as old
[1:26:17] as my mom but somewhere uh in that in
[1:26:20] that range
[1:26:21] and this poor woman
[1:26:25] had been bound by a spirit of dark
[1:26:30] debilitating depression and
[1:26:33] oppressiveness and she had been that way
[1:26:35] for years and she couldn't shake it
[1:26:37] she's been to doctors and had medicines
[1:26:40] and had all kinds of treatments and and
[1:26:42] and and and and nothing would help her
[1:26:44] and she just she walked around in a
[1:26:46] Perpetual Darkness
[1:26:49] she had a dream one night
[1:26:52] she fell asleep
[1:26:55] and in the dream
[1:26:57] now she's telling me this through the
[1:26:59] pastor and the pastor's relating the
[1:27:00] story to me that in the dream she found
[1:27:03] herself
[1:27:04] in a in a basement
[1:27:07] in Pitch Black
[1:27:08] she said there were no windows no doors
[1:27:11] no lights I couldn't see the hand waving
[1:27:15] in front of my face and she said I was
[1:27:17] going along the wall trying to feel
[1:27:19] where am I where what's going on how how
[1:27:21] did I get down here and she couldn't see
[1:27:23] no way out
[1:27:25] and she said something come over her and
[1:27:29] she started crying out Jason help me
[1:27:33] Jason help me
[1:27:35] and when she said that
[1:27:38] a light from up high suddenly appeared
[1:27:42] and she looked up and it was a door that
[1:27:45] had been opened and there was a little
[1:27:47] girl standing there looking at her and
[1:27:49] there was a spiral staircase in the very
[1:27:51] middle she couldn't see in the dark
[1:27:53] I actually think that the dream was
[1:27:55] pretty much self-explanatory I think
[1:27:57] that that that that little girl was her
[1:27:59] and that's where she caught that see
[1:28:02] somehow she got trapped down in that
[1:28:03] basement
[1:28:05] and she said she took her opportunity
[1:28:07] and ran while that light was shining and
[1:28:10] she hit the stead the spiral staircase
[1:28:11] and up and up and up and up and she
[1:28:13] burst through the door and woke up
[1:28:16] she thought to herself why would I dream
[1:28:20] such a dream and who why would I cry out
[1:28:23] Jason help me I don't know it Jason
[1:28:26] and then she thought to herself she said
[1:28:28] you know I remember years ago there
[1:28:32] wasn't a young American preacher named
[1:28:34] Jason something who came to Family Camp
[1:28:37] and it's about probably 15 years prior
[1:28:40] to this and she said that's the only
[1:28:43] Jason I've ever heard of she said I
[1:28:45] wonder she said I went around my house
[1:28:47] seeing if I had an old tape anywhere of
[1:28:50] those Services he said I had nothing
[1:28:52] and she said I sit down on the couch and
[1:28:54] wondered why would I have this strange
[1:28:56] dream and call out Jason help me and she
[1:28:59] said in my phone rang and it was her
[1:29:02] friend in Moscow
[1:29:03] and she said guess who's coming to
[1:29:06] preach our family camp in Moscow she
[1:29:08] says who Jason Watkins from America
[1:29:11] she said I've just had a dream and in
[1:29:14] the dream I was calling out now you can
[1:29:15] understand how that made me feel a
[1:29:17] little awkward
[1:29:18] a little awkward I'm glad she was
[1:29:21] elderly
[1:29:22] and I'm glad the pastor was the one
[1:29:24] telling me the story all right I just
[1:29:26] had to start backing up a little bit but
[1:29:29] but but she was so sincere in it and she
[1:29:34] was telling that her friend said oh you
[1:29:36] must come out and she said well I have
[1:29:38] no money she said I'll send you the
[1:29:40] train ticket I'll send it to you you
[1:29:42] must come to the meetings and she came
[1:29:43] and she had been there the first night
[1:29:45] second night third night and all these
[1:29:47] people about rounder jumping up healed
[1:29:49] and she sat there in her darkness and on
[1:29:51] the last day on Sunday morning and I
[1:29:53] don't remember now what I couldn't tell
[1:29:54] you for anything what I was preaching
[1:29:56] and all of a sudden while I yet spake
[1:29:59] these words she said suddenly the
[1:30:02] darkness shattered over the top of her
[1:30:04] the light broke through and she stood to
[1:30:06] her feet for the first time in 40 years
[1:30:09] free
[1:30:11] and she was free she said I don't mean
[1:30:15] light at the end of the tunnel I mean I
[1:30:17] was out
[1:30:18] I was free and I left her free and she's
[1:30:22] still free and I'm here to tell you
[1:30:24] while he spanked these words the Holy
[1:30:27] Ghost fell I don't know what your
[1:30:29] problem might be tonight but while the
[1:30:31] word is going forward
[1:30:33] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:30:34] there's power in the word of God it's a
[1:30:37] Living Word and he wants you to live it
[1:30:49] how are we doing
[1:30:51] got 20 more minutes
[1:30:54] so
[1:30:55] when we think about the inheritance of
[1:30:58] the Saints
[1:30:59] you know you don't want to give away an
[1:31:01] inheritance
[1:31:03] and and you know when when Jefferson
[1:31:05] wrote the Declaration of Independence he
[1:31:09] used a a very archaic old word called
[1:31:12] unalienable now we changed it modern day
[1:31:14] we call it inalienable means the same
[1:31:16] thing he wrote in the original wording
[1:31:18] the unalienable rights that we we have
[1:31:21] certain unalienable rights and that we
[1:31:23] are endowed by our creator
[1:31:25] see and unalienable means that that it
[1:31:30] it basically means that that no one
[1:31:34] needs to give you permission
[1:31:36] no one can take it from you you don't
[1:31:40] have to ask
[1:31:41] it's your unalienable right given to you
[1:31:45] by God
[1:31:46] and so we have these unalienable rights
[1:31:49] because of the purchase price that Jesus
[1:31:53] Paid at Calvary and these rights are I I
[1:31:57] want to really emphasize this to you
[1:31:59] tonight that unalienable means natural
[1:32:03] and legal so Jefferson wasn't just
[1:32:06] declaring a legal document I'm not just
[1:32:09] saying you know legally King George
[1:32:11] legally we have the right to be free
[1:32:13] people but what he was saying is we have
[1:32:16] unalienable rights that are given to us
[1:32:18] by our creator and we don't need your
[1:32:22] permission
[1:32:23] right we don't need any validation God
[1:32:26] gave it to us it is my inheritance and
[1:32:30] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:32:31] you have an inheritance at Calvary and I
[1:32:35] just say to the devil don't try to hold
[1:32:37] me back from my unalienable rights
[1:32:40] purchase for me and Calvary
[1:32:43] it's your inheritance to be healed is
[1:32:46] your inheritance to be delivered as your
[1:32:49] inheritance to be free to have the Holy
[1:32:52] Ghost to have your nature changed it's
[1:32:55] your inheritance
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:59] Hallelujah
[1:33:02] I have a right to be healed
[1:33:04] I have a right to be delivered I have a
[1:33:08] right to be free from sin
[1:33:10] Hallelujah I'm not here to beg God for
[1:33:13] it it's already mine
[1:33:19] Hallelujah
[1:33:22] this is exactly why we needed the full
[1:33:25] word
[1:33:26] we had to have the full word and the
[1:33:28] Saints this is
[1:33:30] this is this is this was the real
[1:33:32] problem
[1:33:33] and I and I I'm not going to spend a lot
[1:33:35] of time on this because I don't wanna I
[1:33:36] don't want to go down the line but
[1:33:39] you know I grew up in this message and
[1:33:41] my parents were in the meetings of
[1:33:43] brother Branham and I grew up at the
[1:33:44] Branham Tabernacle and I saw all the
[1:33:46] camps rise up and I saw these super
[1:33:49] preachers and brother Branham kept
[1:33:52] telling us don't chase supers don't do
[1:33:54] that but it's human nature to do that
[1:33:57] and this super preacher and this super
[1:33:59] camp and this super preacher and this
[1:34:00] super Doctrine and this super and my
[1:34:02] goodness the whole the whole message
[1:34:04] through the 70s was being divided into
[1:34:06] camps
[1:34:07] now granted they had a lot of wonderful
[1:34:10] people in them and a lot of those men of
[1:34:12] God were great men of God running with a
[1:34:14] partial understanding when they should
[1:34:15] have waited for it to mature
[1:34:17] there's there's not any of those camps
[1:34:19] that didn't have a truth that it was
[1:34:21] based on I get that I understand that
[1:34:24] the problem that I had then and the
[1:34:28] problem I have now with any Kingdom
[1:34:31] Builder type Ministry who's trying to
[1:34:33] build a kingdom to himself is here's
[1:34:36] what here's one common denominator that
[1:34:39] all of those camps had in common they
[1:34:41] had various doctrines and various angles
[1:34:43] on various doctrines various ways of
[1:34:46] going about things various worship
[1:34:48] various this various that but one of the
[1:34:50] things they all had in common was they
[1:34:53] told you and gave you what you must
[1:34:56] believe and they not only told you what
[1:34:59] you must believe but they fixed limits
[1:35:01] on what you could not believe and
[1:35:04] therefore this is our camp and you need
[1:35:06] to believe everything inside of here and
[1:35:09] don't go outside of this circle or
[1:35:12] you're not or you're out of the word
[1:35:15] well I'm here to tell you something
[1:35:16] friends I never needed their permission
[1:35:19] to believe God I never needed their
[1:35:22] permission to accept my inheritance I
[1:35:25] never needed their permission to believe
[1:35:27] that I could be free that I could be
[1:35:30] full of the Holy Ghost and I couldn't
[1:35:32] believe all the word of God I didn't
[1:35:35] need it then I don't need it now
[1:35:39] whom the son is made free is free indeed
[1:35:43] Hallelujah
[1:35:46] okay
[1:35:49] amen hallelujah and this is where we
[1:35:52] come to friends tonight
[1:35:54] the challenge of faith
[1:35:56] the challenge to believe every word of
[1:35:58] God and we're some messed up people
[1:36:02] we are
[1:36:03] I mean if you think about everything
[1:36:05] that's made you you up to this point
[1:36:09] I mean things we inherited by our
[1:36:11] heredity brother man talks about that
[1:36:14] he talks about a man who comes up in a
[1:36:16] prayer line and
[1:36:18] the man suffering a lot of anxiety and
[1:36:19] worrying he says now he says I I see
[1:36:22] that one of the problems you have sir is
[1:36:24] you're always crossing a bridge before
[1:36:26] you get to it
[1:36:27] see he says now you get that from your
[1:36:29] mother
[1:36:31] that came to you through through
[1:36:32] heredity
[1:36:33] and then you know he got it here's a
[1:36:35] lady and he talks about her he goes
[1:36:37] right into his own family and uh brother
[1:36:39] Jack I don't know if you knew it but
[1:36:41] those quotes you were reading about that
[1:36:42] young man
[1:36:43] that brother Brandon was saying you know
[1:36:45] I think it was you who was saying the
[1:36:47] young man should never get married
[1:36:49] and uh and and and and and and what was
[1:36:52] happening was he said because he's got
[1:36:54] the nature of his dad and his dad is of
[1:36:57] his whole his dad's whole family that
[1:37:00] whole tribe are Fighters and drunks and
[1:37:03] killers and the mother and her whole
[1:37:05] clan were from Germany and they were
[1:37:07] very arrogant and they never would
[1:37:09] apologize and this boy had the double
[1:37:11] barrel shotgun of it all
[1:37:13] right he had both of them now brother
[1:37:15] Brandon was saying that to the dad he
[1:37:18] said now you're not like that and to the
[1:37:21] mother you're not like that you're not
[1:37:22] like your family sir you're not like
[1:37:24] your family now the way brother random
[1:37:26] knew that is this young man was his
[1:37:28] nephew and the man was his brother
[1:37:31] and the woman was the mother was his
[1:37:33] sister-in-law I didn't know if you knew
[1:37:34] that I started to tell you that at
[1:37:35] Family Care I mean at at men's meeting
[1:37:37] and that's how brother Branham could
[1:37:39] speak so authoritatively this is how he
[1:37:41] knew their family see he come from this
[1:37:43] Man's family he said you know we're all
[1:37:45] a bunch of Fighters and drunks brandons
[1:37:47] are always that way wow see he said but
[1:37:50] now you're not like that she's not like
[1:37:52] that she's sweet and humble and you're
[1:37:53] sweet and humble he said what did that
[1:37:55] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:57] see now you're not living your life
[1:37:58] you're living the life of Christ
[1:38:01] and he says now this young man's got to
[1:38:03] have that same experience or I'd
[1:38:04] recommend he never get married or he'll
[1:38:07] make some girl's life on a hell on Earth
[1:38:10] he'll make her life hell on Earth see
[1:38:13] because he and his dad said well Bill I
[1:38:16] know my son has has given his heart to
[1:38:19] the Lord and brother Brown said yes
[1:38:20] mentally he has but he's got to have
[1:38:23] that hard experience I'm here to tell
[1:38:25] you something friends you can't just be
[1:38:27] convinced of it you got to be revelated
[1:38:29] it's got to become a living reality this
[1:38:32] is a Living Word and God wants to live
[1:38:35] it in you
[1:38:37] my God Amen
[1:38:40] so we have things that we inherit in our
[1:38:44] heredity we have our various
[1:38:45] temperaments and I want to get into all
[1:38:47] of that those are all sermons brother
[1:38:49] Beckett is an expert in those things we
[1:38:51] have our birth sign we have our I mean
[1:38:53] those things affect your life
[1:38:56] we have our raising
[1:38:57] see
[1:38:59] we have our social culture that we were
[1:39:02] raised in
[1:39:03] that's right you know and then as we
[1:39:04] grow older into adulthood we have our
[1:39:06] educational and our political and our
[1:39:09] religious influences and it all just
[1:39:11] piles up
[1:39:13] yeah
[1:39:15] I'll tell you something if it weren't
[1:39:16] for God we're just some broken people
[1:39:19] the world is filled with broken people
[1:39:22] and and and how much how many zeros are
[1:39:26] in your bank account don't matter
[1:39:27] millionaires still jump out of 50-story
[1:39:30] Windows
[1:39:31] movie stars and sports stars with all
[1:39:34] the fortune and glory and the fame and
[1:39:35] everything they could want burn their
[1:39:37] life out and kill themselves
[1:39:39] yeah
[1:39:41] wow
[1:39:42] the world has gone insane
[1:39:45] and there's only one place of sanity and
[1:39:47] that's the mind of Christ
[1:39:49] see but the Bible says
[1:39:51] let this mind
[1:39:54] be in you
[1:39:55] in other words allow it
[1:39:58] permit it
[1:40:00] the Bible says in another place let the
[1:40:03] word of God dwell in you richly
[1:40:06] allow the word of God to dwell in you
[1:40:10] richly
[1:40:11] and so we find I I was reminded about
[1:40:14] when Solomon built was building the
[1:40:17] Temple and of course the temple the
[1:40:18] Tabernacle in the wilderness the temple
[1:40:20] it was all foretelling Christ when God
[1:40:23] would come and live in a temple but then
[1:40:25] ultimately it was also his bride his
[1:40:27] body because that's what Peter says your
[1:40:29] Lively Stones you're the Temple of the
[1:40:32] Living God brother Brandon preached
[1:40:33] you're the brother Brad and preach that
[1:40:35] that you're the Tabernacle of the living
[1:40:37] God's presence see and so so we are
[1:40:40] Lively Stones we're built up we're a
[1:40:43] habitation of the Holy Ghost so when so
[1:40:46] when it's not a stretch then to see
[1:40:48] Solomon building his Temple and he's got
[1:40:52] all of these parts that David his father
[1:40:54] has put together and laid out all the
[1:40:57] material but Solomon don't know how to
[1:40:59] build it he don't know how to put it all
[1:41:01] aparts and pieces together and so he
[1:41:04] writes a letter to the king of tire and
[1:41:05] he says listen you are friends with my
[1:41:07] dad and and there's nobody like the
[1:41:09] cydonians who are skilled and cutting of
[1:41:12] of rock and and gems and blue and purple
[1:41:16] and all of these things you guys are are
[1:41:18] artists and you're you're you're
[1:41:19] anointed and I need you to any and he
[1:41:22] writes to the king he says you know this
[1:41:24] Temple must be great it's going to it's
[1:41:27] going to be the dwelling place of God
[1:41:28] and how can I even begin to approach it
[1:41:31] and I and I and I got all these parts
[1:41:33] and all these pieces but I don't know
[1:41:34] how to fix it and arrange it all and he
[1:41:37] says to him send me therefore a man
[1:41:40] skilled and cunning and cutting and gems
[1:41:45] and stones and blues and purples a man
[1:41:48] who who understands how the parts go
[1:41:51] because the parts the temple is
[1:41:53] representing you
[1:41:55] and I'm here to tell you something
[1:41:57] friends God put you here but you got a
[1:41:59] bunch of scattered parts and I don't
[1:42:00] know maybe they came by hereditary maybe
[1:42:02] they came by social maybe they came by
[1:42:04] political maybe they came by religious
[1:42:06] maybe there's your birth sign maybe it's
[1:42:08] your temperament I don't know I just
[1:42:10] know this I need somebody
[1:42:12] who understands me somebody who could
[1:42:16] come and take all the pieces and fix me
[1:42:19] and put me together
[1:42:21] Hallelujah friends that's what this word
[1:42:24] has done in this hour God has sent a
[1:42:27] message and a messenger to do what to
[1:42:29] put the pieces together
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:35] brother Branham said Faith finds a
[1:42:37] source that others don't see
[1:42:41] Faith finds a source
[1:42:43] and the message persevere and he
[1:42:45] preached it a bunch of times this is
[1:42:46] June 1964. he in perseverance Faith
[1:42:51] finds a source
[1:42:53] that others don't see
[1:42:55] I think about the scription I'm going to
[1:42:57] close with this
[1:42:59] for God who commanded this is second
[1:43:01] Corinthians 4.
[1:43:03] verse 6 for God who commanded the light
[1:43:07] to shine out of Darkness
[1:43:09] hath shined in our hearts
[1:43:11] to do what to give light
[1:43:15] to give light so there's a purpose
[1:43:17] behind it you understand
[1:43:19] he had shined in our hearts to give
[1:43:21] light amen of the knowledge of the glory
[1:43:24] of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:43:28] see you are his glory
[1:43:30] you are the manifestation of his life
[1:43:33] that was the that was always the plan
[1:43:35] see
[1:43:36] but we have this treasure in Earthen
[1:43:38] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:43:40] may be of God and not of us
[1:43:43] here's an honest confession I think we
[1:43:45] could all relate to
[1:43:47] we are troubled on every side
[1:43:50] yet not distressed we are perplexed but
[1:43:54] not in despair persecuted but not
[1:43:57] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[1:44:01] always bearing about in the body the
[1:44:04] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[1:44:07] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:44:11] our body
[1:44:13] for we which live are always delivered
[1:44:16] unto death for Jesus's sake that the
[1:44:19] life also of Jesus might be made
[1:44:22] manifest in our mortal flesh
[1:44:28] say brother Jason
[1:44:31] stand with me have my musicians come
[1:44:33] back let me let me just
[1:44:37] I'm just going to push a pause button
[1:44:38] tonight
[1:44:39] and uh there's no way to finish this
[1:44:42] I've got this whole burden we'll carry
[1:44:44] on with it tomorrow
[1:44:45] but let me let me just push a pause
[1:44:47] button after this
[1:44:50] and you can just play sister whatever
[1:44:52] just something softly please
[1:44:57] it's a fair question when we read these
[1:45:01] passages for we which live are always
[1:45:03] delivered unto death for Jesus sake
[1:45:06] that the life also of Jesus
[1:45:09] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:45:12] flesh
[1:45:14] how it's a fair question to say
[1:45:17] how can I possibly brother Jason you
[1:45:20] just don't know
[1:45:21] the battles that I'm battling
[1:45:24] you don't know what's happened in my
[1:45:27] life and you'd be right I don't but he
[1:45:30] does
[1:45:32] the one who I represent here tonight the
[1:45:34] one who's who led me to accept the
[1:45:37] invitation of brother Jack the one who
[1:45:39] has dealt with my heart for days
[1:45:42] the one who has who woke me up early
[1:45:44] this morning at 3 30 and began dealing
[1:45:47] with me in a very special way for this
[1:45:49] service tonight knowing each one of you
[1:45:52] that would be here in this service
[1:45:54] I don't know
[1:45:56] what brought you here I don't know what
[1:45:58] you're facing when you leave here but
[1:46:00] I'm here to tell you something friend
[1:46:02] God who's rich in Mercy
[1:46:05] I believe with all my heart in this
[1:46:07] service tonight I don't care what is
[1:46:10] your Affliction or what your bondage you
[1:46:12] can leave here delivered
[1:46:14] you can leave here free if you'll accept
[1:46:16] it God has dealt with me very strangely
[1:46:19] all day long flying coming laying in the
[1:46:22] motel studying preparing praying has
[1:46:25] dealt with me
[1:46:26] and I I have felt that that this is how
[1:46:30] what I wanted to deliver to you tonight
[1:46:31] say brother Jason how can I possibly get
[1:46:34] victory in these battles and I read to
[1:46:37] you the answer for God who commanded the
[1:46:40] light to shine out of Darkness
[1:46:43] that same God you know why that light
[1:46:45] shined out of Darkness because God
[1:46:47] commanded it
[1:46:49] God commanded the light to shine out of
[1:46:53] Darkness I'm here to tell you something
[1:46:55] friends bow your heads with me all over
[1:46:57] the building now
[1:46:58] this is a very serious time because this
[1:47:00] is the time and I I told the Lord I said
[1:47:02] Lord I'm going to challenge the people
[1:47:04] to believe it
[1:47:06] I've given you enough evidence tonight
[1:47:07] I've told you stories are from from from
[1:47:09] Christ around the world Miracles that
[1:47:12] have taken place I've given you
[1:47:14] testimony of testimony I've proven it to
[1:47:16] you in the scriptures proven it by the
[1:47:17] quotes of the Prophet I'm here to tell
[1:47:19] you something friends this is an hour
