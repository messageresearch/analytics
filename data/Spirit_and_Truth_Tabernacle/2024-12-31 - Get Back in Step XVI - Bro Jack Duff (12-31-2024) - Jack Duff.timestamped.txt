[35:46] today well it started last week um you
[35:50] know during the holidays you know the
[35:52] devil come with like depression and
[35:54] sadness but I know um the the Lord took
[35:58] me back to when I first started this
[36:00] journey alone and I said to him I said
[36:03] God I've never been alone how am I going
[36:05] to do this and he said to me forget
[36:09] about you and think about
[36:13] others so down through these years I've
[36:15] been a caretaker for so many family
[36:18] members been there for other people and
[36:21] and throughout that and I've just seen
[36:24] so much but like sister Brown say it's
[36:27] not easy being alone but I just want to
[36:30] thank God for his grace and his Mercy I
[36:33] want to thank God for most of all how
[36:37] I've been a caretaker for so many people
[36:40] and I just want to thank God up until

[37:12] they have their own lives and I just
[37:14] thank God for how he kept me and blessed
[37:17] me to be able to do that my daily prayer
[37:21] is Lord blessed me to be a blessing so
[37:24] in order to be a blessing you have to be
[37:26] healthy hold your right mind you know
[37:30] sometime I'm driving down the road and I
[37:32] think to myself I'm a
[37:34] senior and I'm flying down the road I
[37:37] can really take care of myself I'm in my
[37:40] right mind you know I can do for me you
[37:44] know I can still do for others and help
[37:46] others and Saints that's a blessing
[37:49] that's really a blessing because now in
[37:52] this age it's so much going on so much I
[37:56] mean in all areas of your life in all
[37:58] areas of the world is so much going on
[38:01] and to say that you're whole you're
[38:03] healthy you're in your right mind is
[38:06] truly God Amen not not me not us it's
[38:11] God and to be here another year and be
[38:14] gathered together to still give him the
[38:17] Glory Hallelujah it's a blessing and I
[38:20] just want to give him all the praise and
[38:22] all the honor amen
[38:27] [Applause]
[38:37] God bless you
[38:39] Saints uh just want to thank God for um
[38:44] uh an
[38:45] incredible 2024 for uh my family uh my
[38:50] my household um so three about 3 years
[38:54] ago um brother Jack spoke to me uh um
[38:58] and asked me to start praying about
[39:01] potentially uh being a deacon now this
[39:04] is something that I've never desired in
[39:07] my life um where where I come
[39:10] from um the deacons are normally the the
[39:14] Elders of the church and normally
[39:16] growing up the deacons of the people you
[39:17] dislike the most so it's not something
[39:20] that I ever desired and even when he
[39:22] asked me to pray about it it's I can't I
[39:25] can't say I I when he told me that I was
[39:28] praying hard about it because it's hard
[39:30] to pray for something you don't really
[39:31] want um but I I would pray um and you
[39:36] know you know year a year passed uh
[39:39] brother Jack uh checked checked back in
[39:41] with me and I told him I wasn't ready um
[39:44] you know time kept
[39:46] passing um and like I said it was it I I
[39:49] did pray but it was hard to you know
[39:51] pray for something that I didn't really
[39:53] desire um but in 2023 brother Jack uh
[39:57] spoke a lot about yielding to the
[39:59] perfect will of God and um my wife and I
[40:02] were just were talking and we were just
[40:04] wondering like why why us you know why
[40:07] why me when you know I I don't feel
[40:10] worthy for for that but uh I remember I
[40:13] believe my wife said something along the
[40:14] lines of you know brother brother Jack
[40:16] is you know a spiritual man so if it's
[40:19] put it was put upon brother Jack's heart
[40:21] to ask you for that he didn't just wake
[40:23] up and do that God God probably spoke to
[40:25] him about that um so we started looking
[40:28] at it differently and by the end of the
[40:30] year um we brother Jack checked checked
[40:33] back in with us and I told him that
[40:36] while I wasn't thrilled about it I would
[40:38] just yield to the perfect will of God
[40:41] and so the amazing thing about it was
[40:44] once I yielded to the perfect will of
[40:47] God God blessed us with the most
[40:49] incredible year that we've had since
[40:51] we've been married um beginning of
[40:54] 2024 um
[40:57] uh our green cards came out and we
[40:59] became permanent residents of this
[41:02] country
[41:05] [Applause]
[41:07] um and that's that's that was a a long
[41:10] journey for us and it it's like the
[41:12] devil just kept fighting bringing thing
[41:15] after thing after thing that just kept
[41:17] blocking us from becoming permanent
[41:19] residents up until you know we had to
[41:21] try and shift certain things almost had
[41:23] to leave the country but God just worked
[41:26] it out that after we yielded within I
[41:29] think about 30 days or so uh our green
[41:31] cards were
[41:32] approved um so I thank God for that and
[41:36] um I was also able to uh to travel with
[41:39] my family for the first time we went to
[41:41] England for Easter had the most
[41:42] incredible time there uh when we when
[41:45] when we got back um we were both blessed
[41:49] um with you know with with with
[41:51] financial increase on our jobs which we
[41:54] were praying for um with thank God for
[41:57] that because it allowed us to be in a
[42:00] position where we could uh purchase a
[42:02] new home and so we thank God for
[42:05] blessing us with the new home um he gave
[42:10] us he did he did exceeding abundantly
[42:13] above uh all we could ask for um we were
[42:15] looking for uh a five-bedroom home but
[42:19] by God's grace he gave us uh six
[42:21] bedrooms uh so we thank God for that
[42:25] um and I also want to thank God cuz I
[42:28] was able to finish uh my second Masters
[42:32] this year as well and
[42:37] so 20 2024 has been an incredible year
[42:41] and we're just under great expectation
[42:43] for what God has for us in 2025 so thank
[42:51] you hallelujah thank you thank you Lord
[42:55] a good evening Saints um I just want to
[42:58] thank the Lord first of all I thought I
[43:00] was going to be going live I um pray on
[43:02] Facebook and I thought I was going to be
[43:04] going live to pray tonight um but the
[43:07] Holy Spirit put in my heart to come to
[43:11] church and I was when I got out the park
[43:15] out the truck I said I was glad when
[43:16] they said when you said unto me let us
[43:19] go into the house of the Lord and when I
[43:21] came in I saw testimony you know I don't
[43:24] you don't see that anymore in the
[43:25] churches testimony meeting it's so very
[43:29] important you know to have testimony
[43:31] meeting so as I was sitting here I
[43:33] wasn't goingon to say anything
[43:36] but God has been really good to me in
[43:40] 2024 you know um it's been a very very
[43:45] for me I think since 2000 every year has
[43:49] just gotten worse and I've just wanted
[43:53] God to just take me from this Earth so
[43:55] many times and
[43:57] he just refused uh he saved me from a
[44:00] heart attack at
[44:02] 42 uh he delivered me from blood clots
[44:05] in my lungs I wouldn't even take the
[44:08] medicine cuz I wanted to to die and um I
[44:12] remember the one time the doctor a team
[44:14] of doctors they said Miss Clark you know
[44:16] you have several clots you have several
[44:18] pockets in your lungs and you have
[44:20] several clots in your pockets and if one
[44:23] burst you could die and I was just like
[44:25] saying why can't it just burst and I
[44:29] never knew that um God wanted to use me
[44:32] in the way he's been using me on my
[44:34] different
[44:36] platforms um I went through so much I
[44:39] just didn't feel like I had anything to
[44:41] contribute
[44:43] but I didn't realize I was an olive
[44:46] being
[44:47] pressed and so I thank God for keeping
[44:50] me when I didn't want to be
[44:52] kept I thank him for everything that I
[44:56] went through
[44:59] I still can sing and praise His
[45:02] name you know the enemy has tried to get
[45:04] me to just stop praising God all
[45:07] together and uh there was one time I
[45:09] told the Lord if I ever go back I'm not
[45:12] coming back no more I've been out left
[45:15] him and come back and left him and come
[45:17] back and I just felt like a
[45:19] yo-yo but I thank God for loving me when
[45:22] I didn't know what love
[45:24] is and uh I just thank God for this
[45:27] beautiful church cuzz I've been to
[45:30] several churches and the testimony of
[45:33] those churches is a bad report this
[45:35] church has the spirit of the Lord in it
[45:38] it has the spirit of the Lord in it and
[45:40] so I thank God for the fire that burns
[45:42] here and I ask the Saints to just pray
[45:45] much for me that I will continue
[45:47] to seek God like never before I want to
[45:51] read my Bible more I want to fast more
[45:54] um I just want to be sold out to God
[45:57] more Hallelujah because I don't have
[46:00] anything else in this earth my name is
[46:02] Angela so my greatest investment is in
[46:04] people and not in things so I just thank
[46:07] God for my place here tonight I thank
[46:09] God for being alive with the land of the
[46:12] living and uh I just want to just tell
[46:16] you all stay encouraged Hallelujah stay
[46:21] encourage Hallelujah I I I said to
[46:24] somebody a while ago that
[46:28] that God looked over at Jesus and said
[46:30] this girl really is crazy she want to
[46:32] die for real she don't want to take her
[46:34] medicine let me go ahead and heal
[46:38] her and so I'm so thankful that he loved
[46:41] me y'all pray my strength in the
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:53] Lord God bless
[46:55] you um I just want to thank God for this
[46:59] year it has been a wonderful year um
[47:05] like sister Smith and sister Brown has
[47:07] said you know sometimes you go through
[47:09] things and it's not easy when you're
[47:12] alone but we're never alone um because
[47:16] even when we don't have anybody there
[47:19] physically we have somebody there that
[47:21] we can just pray to and um just Comfort
[47:25] us and during that time where you don't
[47:27] feel like you you you just don't feel
[47:30] like yourself I'll say it like that um
[47:33] but I also want to thank God for our
[47:36] church because brother Jack not only
[47:39] preaches natur uh spiritually but he
[47:41] also preaches natural things we we have
[47:43] to learn how to live naturally while
[47:46] we're here but while we're here
[47:48] naturally we also have to get ready to
[47:51] to to leave here so that's where the
[47:53] spiritual part comes in and um I had put
[47:57] my house on the market and I was just
[48:01] like uh whatever um at first I was like
[48:04] yeah yeah yeah I want to sell it then as
[48:06] it didn't sell I just got to the point
[48:10] where I was just like well I ain't got
[48:11] to move I'm fine and um I had two
[48:16] contracts to fall through and that was
[48:19] kind of
[48:20] discouraging and um when I kind of got
[48:23] to the point of whatever I really don't
[48:26] have to move I'm fine you know this this
[48:29] big house I just stay in here by myself
[48:30] is fine um somebody came through and
[48:35] they they offered us um you know a
[48:38] certain amount and I thank God for
[48:41] brother Jack and sister Erica just
[48:44] helping me navigate through something
[48:46] like this um I haven't purchased a home
[48:49] in almost 30 years so to navigate
[48:53] through all of that it was like I I
[48:57] don't know what I'm doing and just to
[48:59] see how not my brother-in-law but my
[49:02] pastor not my sister but my my my
[49:06] pastor's wife they encouraged me they
[49:09] helped me they helped me go through all
[49:12] of it and I just thank God that um I was
[49:17] able to sell my house in the morning and
[49:21] purchase another house in the afternoon
[49:24] and I'm I'm really grateful for that how
[49:27] God just worked everything out so
[49:31] smoothly and uh you know I I I also
[49:35] thank God because during all of this
[49:37] time I just didn't feel good in my body
[49:40] was sick here sick there just not really
[49:42] knowing what was going on and things
[49:44] like that and through it all God just
[49:47] bought me through it all through it you
[49:49] know just a whole bunch of things were
[49:51] going on just with the house and still
[49:54] trying to work and just just trying to
[49:57] figure everything out and uh God just
[50:00] bought me through through through it all
[50:03] and the other thing that brother Jack
[50:05] tells us is you know you don't need to
[50:08] be financially strapped you know that
[50:12] you get out of debt if you can you know
[50:16] and I thank God that I've paid off my my
[50:19] car I don't have any
[50:21] bills and all I have is a very small car
[50:25] uh house note that's it that's all I
[50:27] have you know and I thank God for being
[50:31] financially
[50:33] stable where as Sister Sister Smith was
[50:36] saying I want to bless others the more
[50:40] you bless the more you open the door for
[50:43] God to bless you and I have seen that in
[50:46] so many ways in my personal life but now
[50:51] God has put me in a position where I can
[50:54] bless people
[50:57] and and and not saying you know Lord
[50:58] okay I'mma bless this so now you got to
[51:00] bless me but you know just being able to
[51:03] say you know here's a little something
[51:05] here's a little something and also given
[51:08] of my time and and everybody that's
[51:09] worked at the pantry you know I'm so
[51:12] grateful for that where we've gone out
[51:14] and blessed the people of the community
[51:16] and and just how God has opened so many
[51:18] doors that I have been able to be
[51:20] affiliated with and just all in all I
[51:24] thank God for 2024 it has
[51:27] truly exceeded my
[51:30] expectations and I I just thank God I'm
[51:33] getting comfortable in my little house

[59:36] you brother Smiley my
[59:38] testimony um I just thought it'd be
[59:40] robbery if I didn't you know just thank
[59:42] the Lord for just what he's done
[59:43] throughout the
[59:45] year um uh there's so much that I can
[59:48] think about that the Lord has done for
[59:50] my family and I but just uh just several
[59:54] weeks ago this this really
[59:56] uh Quicken my heart and uh just speaking
[1:00:00] with my wife through a few things and
[1:00:02] just thinking about how God has just
[1:00:05] dealt with me throughout my life and I
[1:00:08] just was brought back to some 13 years
[1:00:10] ago when I I accepted his invitation to
[1:00:13] serve
[1:00:14] him and I just realized that uh when I
[1:00:18] accepted that invitation um it was also
[1:00:20] the birth of certain complexes in my
[1:00:24] life and I was reminded of the word of
[1:00:27] God where it says where Christ spoke to
[1:00:29] his disciples about the parable of the
[1:00:32] field and he said uh he sowed seeds but
[1:00:35] the enemy came and and seeds as well his
[1:00:39] disciples asked them uh shall we pluck
[1:00:41] them out and Christ answered no let them
[1:00:44] grow together and he'll do the
[1:00:45] separating at the Harvest Time and just
[1:00:48] through the years I I've just seen how
[1:00:50] God has has been allowing uh certain
[1:00:53] things uh to mature in my life um
[1:00:56] concerning the the gifts he's given uh
[1:00:59] and the the responsibility he's called
[1:01:02] me to and just this year I I really feel
[1:01:06] like he's allowed me to really come to a
[1:01:10] place of of yielding to his perfect will
[1:01:13] um where I can see him doing the
[1:01:16] separation uh between what he calls me
[1:01:19] to do and the trials uh that the enemy
[1:01:22] would bring on my in my life so thank
[1:01:24] God for the Deliverance uh from the
[1:01:27] complexes um and thank God that he's
[1:01:29] given uh us a spiritual Pastor uh to
[1:01:33] speak about these things and and to
[1:01:35] bring awareness of of what the word of
[1:01:38] God is doing um in each season of our
[1:01:42] lives and the other thing I want to
[1:01:44] thank God for is each of you all um the
[1:01:48] love that I've received throughout the
[1:01:50] year the
[1:01:52] fellowship um it it means more to me um
[1:01:56] then you'll never know and my desire is
[1:02:00] is the desire that I've heard from many
[1:02:02] you know is to be able to give more and
[1:02:06] more of myself so I want to thank God
[1:02:09] for that and and trusting that as we
[1:02:11] Embark the new year he open up those
[1:02:13] doors God bless
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:21] you God bless you
[1:02:24] all sounds like uh we a blessed Church
[1:02:28] man I I'm pretty sure that I could
[1:02:32] uh repeat many of the things that people
[1:02:37] are the Saints are thanking God for um
[1:02:41] as the testimonies we're going um I
[1:02:45] every single year since I've been
[1:02:48] serving him he's been more than good to
[1:02:50] me even on my worst year that I've ever
[1:02:55] could think that I've had he was good
[1:02:58] enough for that year cuz he kept me you
[1:03:00] know and and ever since the day 15 years
[1:03:04] ago when I gave my life to the Lord I
[1:03:07] haven't taken a step back I fought
[1:03:09] through it and it hasn't been it's been
[1:03:11] because of him but um um out of all the
[1:03:15] things I can think of it's one thing
[1:03:16] that um helped me with and and and I
[1:03:20] told that I would share and and and it
[1:03:22] just kind of got upet it was a testimony
[1:03:24] in the last day of the year was like I
[1:03:27] did Lord that I would share this little
[1:03:29] thing that he helped me with and um uh I
[1:03:33] guess the the as you're walked with God
[1:03:35] the the devil uh I believe that brother
[1:03:38] brandham said that the the devil and the
[1:03:40] and his angels are not just throwing
[1:03:42] like some crazy punches they they're
[1:03:45] studying each and one of us and they're
[1:03:48] making a plan on how they're going to be
[1:03:50] effective in what they throw at us so as
[1:03:53] we go through our walk and go through
[1:03:56] different uh uh uh uh stages he
[1:04:00] different battles you know maybe at the
[1:04:02] beginning he's you struggling with
[1:04:03] drinking smoking and he throw some of
[1:04:05] that and then maybe it's a and and then
[1:04:08] after that it could be music or I can
[1:04:10] think of so many things but this the
[1:04:13] devil uh was was fighting me and and I
[1:04:16] think that's a pretty good place to
[1:04:19] attack if you can actually do some
[1:04:20] damage if you can get somebody's then
[1:04:23] then you mess up some stuff
[1:04:27] um it was happening for for for a couple
[1:04:29] of months and and I remember um uh a
[1:04:34] couple of years ago because it goes some
[1:04:37] sometimes you know like that scripture
[1:04:38] they were saying that that sometimes you
[1:04:40] you you got to pray and kick a devil out
[1:04:44] and the brother Jack brought that he
[1:04:45] said you you I'm kicking you out and
[1:04:48] you're and come back no more you know so
[1:04:51] so I never heard that like that and
[1:04:53] that's a big big one for me a big
[1:04:56] Revelation when I heard that but one
[1:04:58] year I was going through something like
[1:04:59] that and and and the Bible tells you to
[1:05:02] uh uh confess your faults to one another
[1:05:04] so I I spoke to brother Jerry and I was
[1:05:08] telling him what was going on talking me
[1:05:10] with prayer and and we got to talk and
[1:05:13] he actually told me what brother I thank
[1:05:15] you so much for coming and talking to me
[1:05:17] because I'm going through the same thing
[1:05:18] right now and and both of us exposed the
[1:05:21] devil at that moment and I I got
[1:05:23] deliverance from it and I'm pretty sure
[1:05:25] that he also did we never went back and
[1:05:27] talked about it but um point this year
[1:05:30] was going through for a couple of months
[1:05:32] and and it's hard because it's not that
[1:05:34] you don't want to pray it's hard it's
[1:05:36] not that that that you're trying to get
[1:05:38] away from it it's actually you have a
[1:05:40] desire to pray you want to see the Lord
[1:05:43] you know that that's what you're looking
[1:05:44] for this is not a situation whether I'm
[1:05:46] like debating whether I want to serve
[1:05:48] the Lord or whether I want no this is a
[1:05:50] full complete surrender to God in in in
[1:05:54] everything do myself and and and and
[1:05:57] when it gets to the prayer time it it's
[1:05:59] interrupted in many different ways uh
[1:06:02] things you don't even think about and
[1:06:06] they come to that H H uh children come
[1:06:09] across wife uh uh phone uh every
[1:06:12] everything possible and and and the
[1:06:14] place where I started talking talking to
[1:06:16] the Lord not praying every time I tried
[1:06:18] praying I talk I said you know what's
[1:06:20] going on like can you please help me out
[1:06:22] so then I'm study this you know I had
[1:06:24] that thought about the devil say stud to
[1:06:27] attack I'm going to study what's going
[1:06:28] on so at this point we get to PTO we're
[1:06:31] going to the trip in PTO and I'm asking
[1:06:33] the Lord said Lord we were praying for
[1:06:35] the trip and I maybe my Deliverance is
[1:06:37] not here maybe it's over there you know
[1:06:39] we over there and first night there uh
[1:06:42] they give us a a really nice little
[1:06:44] apartment and and and it's just me and
[1:06:46] the girls they give us a whole house for
[1:06:48] us and I said here it is you know
[1:06:50] there's no girls got their own room you
[1:06:52] know because I the conclusion that it
[1:06:54] was that was really busy that we had CH
[1:06:56] young children that that live stuff that
[1:07:00] and I couldn't I I couldn't like come to
[1:07:03] say okay it cannot what's holding me
[1:07:05] from being able to pray cannot be the
[1:07:07] things that God has blessed me with it
[1:07:09] kind it it wouldn't make any sense to me
[1:07:11] but um so anyways so that night I tried
[1:07:14] to enter we we're in the when you go
[1:07:16] outside it was just like woods and it
[1:07:19] was dark and and I put some prayer music
[1:07:21] I couldn't couldn't same thing again um
[1:07:25] service that night and and I came back
[1:07:28] the next night and the same thing again
[1:07:31] you know um the the next night after
[1:07:33] that the girls asked me if they can stay
[1:07:36] over the pastor's wife uh the pastor's
[1:07:38] house with the daughter and I was like
[1:07:41] this is this is it now now I'm here I'm
[1:07:43] by myself it's going to happen and I'm
[1:07:45] asking the Lord I say Lord help me I I I
[1:07:48] want to spend some time I don't just
[1:07:49] want to I didn't want to just KN and
[1:07:51] pray I wanted to spend time with the
[1:07:52] Lord couldn't happen so that night when
[1:07:54] when when when I it couldn't happen I
[1:07:57] was like this is it you know I I I've
[1:07:59] came to the place where I it's not all
[1:08:01] those it had to be the devil putting
[1:08:03] those things in my head like is this is
[1:08:05] this is this is this um uh and and and
[1:08:09] so we went to the to the service and
[1:08:11] when we came out of the service I I
[1:08:13] asked brother quu and brother Mark I
[1:08:15] said man I need to talk to y'all right
[1:08:17] now like I need you guys to pray for me
[1:08:20] right now because the devil has not is
[1:08:23] not attacking my prayer life he has Tak
[1:08:25] prayer life so um they said no problem
[1:08:29] we're going to pray right now so we got
[1:08:30] we went to a little corner and and and
[1:08:33] they land on me and they started praying
[1:08:34] for me as we were
[1:08:54] praying e
[1:09:44] I I felt like a a third
[1:09:47] hand on my back and and and and when
[1:09:50] when when we finished praying I I didn't
[1:09:53] call this third person this third person
[1:09:55] just popped up and was also praying cuz
[1:09:58] when I asked them there was nobody
[1:09:59] around they didn't hear that I needed
[1:10:01] prayer and when I finished when we
[1:10:03] finish praying uh I I start talking to
[1:10:06] to the the brother that came up and and
[1:10:08] I started telling him you know because
[1:10:10] he didn't know what we were praying I
[1:10:11] had told the other two brothers so I
[1:10:13] started talking to him and I telling him
[1:10:14] and I can't believe this and and I got
[1:10:16] to the point where I had to expose the
[1:10:18] the expose the devil and he then starts
[1:10:21] talking to me and telling me that he is
[1:10:23] actually going through the same thing
[1:10:25] at that moment um
[1:10:28] so um after the brothers pray for me you
[1:10:33] know
[1:10:34] um that night I was I was able to
[1:10:38] pray it I can't say that it was a full
[1:10:41] Deliverance but I accepted it as uh when
[1:10:45] when they're in the meetings and
[1:10:46] somebody came through a prayer line and
[1:10:48] and and and and the prophet uh uh uh uh
[1:10:52] told them that they were healed go home
[1:10:54] and and receive your healing maybe they
[1:10:56] didn't feel the healing at the moment
[1:10:58] but it was already spoken it was a
[1:10:59] spoken word um and and and and going to
[1:11:03] that um uh uh today uh I for for for
[1:11:09] about about a month I've been I've been
[1:11:12] asking the Lord you know brother Jack
[1:11:13] one time he said you know the Lord don't
[1:11:15] speak as much people say he speaks you
[1:11:17] know and and a lot of times people maybe
[1:11:20] they think that the Lord is speaking to
[1:11:22] them he's speaking all this in my in my
[1:11:24] walk with the Lord the the when he when
[1:11:28] he does when I feel that he actually
[1:11:30] speaks to me is it's it's it's big you
[1:11:32] know um um and and and I've
[1:11:37] been seeking the Lord for for for for
[1:11:40] for certain answers and and and I just
[1:11:43] wouldn't hear back you know but but but
[1:11:46] I never my faith was never never wavered
[1:11:49] it was just like a concern that I was
[1:11:51] having uh um and why the Lord is not
[1:11:55] speaking to me and I'm I'm really
[1:11:57] seeking and really asking and and
[1:11:59] getting no answer back and kind of just
[1:12:01] holding back you know W with with
[1:12:02] certain examples in the Bible where uh
[1:12:05] certain uh prophets have spoke to the
[1:12:07] Lord and he has not spoken to them for a
[1:12:09] certain time so I've been been
[1:12:11] patient and um uh the other day about 5
[1:12:16] days ago um I I was read I'm reading in
[1:12:20] a certain place in the Bible and and all
[1:12:22] of a sudden something led me to read
[1:12:25] somewhere else and in in actually in
[1:12:26] second chronicles and and and I was like
[1:12:29] why am I going over here this is kind of
[1:12:31] throwing off where where I'm at and and
[1:12:34] I started reading for a couple of nights
[1:12:35] I kept reading there and and just you
[1:12:38] know kind of not uh uh not knowing what
[1:12:41] was going on but today
[1:12:45] um I was reading
[1:12:48] another in that same uh uh uh scripture
[1:12:52] a little lower and the Lord spoke to me
[1:12:55] today directly in that scripture and I
[1:12:58] can see how for a few days I've been
[1:13:01] reading there and it was just the Lord
[1:13:03] kind of just see uh guiding me to where
[1:13:07] he was going to speak to me because I
[1:13:10] truly believe that that's one of the
[1:13:11] ways that he speak to you is actually
[1:13:13] through his word and and and today it is
[1:13:18] he spoke to me directly to what I the
[1:13:21] answer that I was looking for I mean so
[1:13:23] directly that it almost kind of like
[1:13:26] like shook me a little bit but it but it
[1:13:29] didn't shake me because I I contained
[1:13:31] myself and I said you know this is what
[1:13:32] he promised that he would do this is
[1:13:34] exactly what he said that it would do
[1:13:36] and and we shouldn't be surprised but we
[1:13:38] should be grateful and we should be
[1:13:41] joyful and and and and receive it and
[1:13:43] today I I believe that that's what he
[1:13:45] gave to me as a gift a word from the
[1:13:48] Lord directly and and and a part of that
[1:13:51] scripture said that when when when uh uh
[1:13:53] uh uh uh uh a Affliction not afflictions
[1:13:56] when when when uh uh uh uh Trials come
[1:13:59] come to you if you stand in his house
[1:14:03] which is uh uh in his house in the name
[1:14:06] of the Lord he will hear you and he will
[1:14:09] help you paraphrasing what the scripture
[1:14:12] said but but the scripture directly
[1:14:14] spoke to my situation and I just so
[1:14:17] grateful for that and I think that
[1:14:18] that's probably one of the biggest thing
[1:14:20] that could happen to us is for the Lord
[1:14:23] to speak to us amen God bless you
[1:14:26] [Applause]
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:29] [Applause]

[1:20:43] want to thank God for being here tonight
[1:20:46] definitely it's good to be back home um
[1:20:49] I was away for a couple days and of
[1:20:53] course when you're going away especially
[1:20:55] as a young woman you start to have fear
[1:20:57] um especially going to a new state that
[1:20:59] I'd never been to and you're hearing all
[1:21:00] these bad things about California so it
[1:21:02] was it was definitely uh I was
[1:21:04] definitely nervous going but I'm
[1:21:06] thankful to God that he kept us safe uh
[1:21:08] me and Jessica as we went and everything
[1:21:10] was fine um without a hitch um but I
[1:21:13] definitely want to thank him uh even
[1:21:16] today I um we get to the airport at 5:00
[1:21:20] in the actually it's 4:00 in the morning
[1:21:22] and I don't know what was I I don't know
[1:21:24] what happened but we missed our flight
[1:21:27] um we were literally there and I don't
[1:21:30] know what was going on but we missed our
[1:21:31] flight and it was very stressful for
[1:21:34] both of us cuz I was like I had done it
[1:21:36] so early so I could get back home and
[1:21:39] get some rest before coming to church
[1:21:40] tonight but because it was missed I
[1:21:42] didn't end up Landing till about 6:40 in
[1:21:45] Fort laale so we had to drive up didn't
[1:21:47] get home till 8:00 but um I was I was
[1:21:50] very annoying um having to go through
[1:21:53] that but
[1:21:55] I had to thank God as well because you
[1:21:57] know in the last couple days all you
[1:21:59] hear in the news is about plane crashes
[1:22:01] and I was like you know what everything
[1:22:02] happens for a reason and I'm pretty sure
[1:22:05] the other plane didn't crash but it's
[1:22:06] like sometimes God wants you to stop and
[1:22:08] think and like I know what I'm doing
[1:22:11] stop worrying about it and so I was had
[1:22:13] to really thank God for that because I
[1:22:15] was like even though I was annoyed he
[1:22:17] knows everything that we go through and
[1:22:19] why we go through those things um so I
[1:22:21] just really want to thank him for that
[1:22:23] and I just want to thank him for this
[1:22:24] year it was definitely very stressful
[1:22:26] year for me um a lot of things that I
[1:22:28] kind of wanted to happen were just not
[1:22:29] falling into place the way I wanted and
[1:22:32] I just through it all I had to really
[1:22:35] just trust God and remember that
[1:22:38] everything is is in his timing and when
[1:22:40] the timing is right he will make it
[1:22:41] happen and so I had you know I wanted to
[1:22:45] actually go to school this year and I
[1:22:47] was like it just wasn't working out I
[1:22:49] don't know I don't know what I was doing
[1:22:51] really but it just didn't work out but I
[1:22:53] thank God that will be able to go next
[1:22:55] year and like I said pay for it um and
[1:22:59] and I just I'm thankful for that and I
[1:23:01] know that even like with my car that I
[1:23:04] have now that was not something I wanted
[1:23:06] at all I did not want a new car but God
[1:23:08] worked that out and even when I had my
[1:23:10] issue just a couple uh months ago with
[1:23:12] my transmission I was looking and I'm
[1:23:15] like there's no way I can pay for a
[1:23:16] transmission and I was just like you
[1:23:18] know I I can't I can't handle this and
[1:23:20] it I was very very upset but I just kept
[1:23:23] hearing God tell me you know like stop
[1:23:25] worrying stop worrying stop worrying and
[1:23:27] of course we're human so it's like no
[1:23:29] I'm going to worry
[1:23:31] anyway but um in the
[1:23:34] end in the end he really did take care
[1:23:36] of it I didn't have to pay a thing and
[1:23:38] it was like and I was like you know I
[1:23:40] was I was talking to the lady who did my
[1:23:43] hair and we were just talking about the
[1:23:44] goodness of God and I was like you know
[1:23:46] what like it just he just really goes to
[1:23:49] show all the time even for me it's like
[1:23:52] you continue to worry and you continue
[1:23:54] to stress over things and it's like I
[1:23:56] already told you I will take care of it
[1:23:57] even if you don't have the money there's
[1:23:59] still going to be money coming from
[1:24:01] somewhere even if you don't see you know
[1:24:03] a way through the valley like there's
[1:24:04] going to be a path made for you you just
[1:24:06] have to trust me and I honestly felt
[1:24:08] like what that's what God's message to
[1:24:10] me this year was learning to uh really
[1:24:13] have faith because you know the Bible is
[1:24:15] not just saying words it what it says is
[1:24:18] it's true you have to walk by faith and
[1:24:20] not by sight you have to walk in the
[1:24:22] spirit you have to do these things
[1:24:24] because without it you're not going to
[1:24:25] make it and so I just I thank God you
[1:24:28] know for his grace towards me this year
[1:24:30] cuz so I was a mess a lot and but I
[1:24:33] thank God that he really did help me
[1:24:35] sorry through this year and just brought
[1:24:38] me to the end and I I'm looking forward
[1:24:40] to next year you know sometimes you get
[1:24:41] a little scared you're like what is the
[1:24:42] next you're going to bring but I know
[1:24:44] whatever he takes us through is his love
[1:24:45] towards us and he will be with us even
[1:24:48] through if we have to go through some
[1:24:50] dark valleys he said that he'd be with
[1:24:51] us so I just thank God and I know that
[1:24:53] he'll give us great next year as
[1:24:58] well praise the
[1:25:02] Lord Brother Jim
[1:25:09] Hallelujah I'm sorry guys I really don't
[1:25:12] need a mic loud um but I truly thank God
[1:25:16] for being in the presence of God tonight
[1:25:20] um the devil really tried to um hinder
[1:25:23] me tonight but but I just that's just
[1:25:25] something just was wouldn't let me not
[1:25:27] just starting the Year this this is how
[1:25:29] I was raised and I was born
[1:25:32] um honestly I have a whole lot of
[1:25:34] testimonies I can give for the year and
[1:25:36] I could truly thank God cuz I always
[1:25:37] tell my friends I say friend you know
[1:25:40] even when I encourage them I always say
[1:25:41] you know what one thing about God he
[1:25:43] always let me fall but when it be it be
[1:25:45] on my
[1:25:46] knees um he never lets me fall to the
[1:25:49] ground I I I try to be as faithful as I
[1:25:52] can to him I'm not always in service no
[1:25:54] I'm not um honestly you guys truthfully
[1:25:58] I can just tell you the truth it's been
[1:25:59] my haircut um I love my church that much

[1:26:08] have alipa but that's that's nothing to

[1:26:32] ministry the 54 Ministry how we said it
[1:26:35] I love I have to I have to sometimes
[1:26:38] argue with my my friends even about the
[1:26:40] message and they say I'm in the C yeah

[1:26:44] God he going to judge me on my cup you

[1:29:19] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:29:29] God bless you Saints I think it'll be
[1:29:32] robbery if I didn't give God
[1:29:35] Praises um just uh picking back on when
[1:29:39] um brother Solomon had an issue with his
[1:29:43] the passport for his daughter and I just
[1:29:46] grabbed hold of Faith cuz I said Lord if
[1:29:49] you can do it for brother Solomon way
[1:29:51] over and I think
[1:29:52] Dubai and I was I requested for a prayer
[1:29:56] for a
[1:29:57] car and it didn't come right then but I
[1:30:00] had to keep the faith and you know the
[1:30:02] devil coming cuz when you uh sending out
[1:30:05] for a prayer request or anything you
[1:30:07] know he's coming he ain't going to stop
[1:30:09] coming he's going to keep coming and
[1:30:13] then sometime you have battles in your
[1:30:15] mind you know the word of God is real
[1:30:17] but you just still having mind battles
[1:30:20] cuz we still in this flesh here but I
[1:30:22] say God I just trust you that you're
[1:30:25] going to do this for me and God gave me
[1:30:27] a
[1:30:29] car
[1:30:31] and I want to I want to thank God even
[1:30:35] though a lot of other details haven't
[1:30:37] worked out for me with the car I still
[1:30:40] trust God for the
[1:30:42] process and um I think this is our first
[1:30:45] uh Night Watch service here I I believe
[1:30:48] it is yeah but
[1:30:50] um I've been on jobs where you can't
[1:30:54] come to can't come to church and you
[1:30:56] tied to the job just like they got their
[1:30:59] foot on your neck you can't do anything
[1:31:02] but just you got to keep going because
[1:31:04] you know you got to pay your bills right
[1:31:07] and I was in a dark place at Walmart
[1:31:10] overnight and I encourage anybody do not
[1:31:12] get a job overnight because it take from
[1:31:14] you from the presence of the Lord we
[1:31:17] know God to make a way but it has to be
[1:31:20] a it is a better way and uh you know
[1:31:23] just you just have to choose and pray
[1:31:26] and let God direct you cuz I look back
[1:31:30] over 15 years overnight it was a
[1:31:33] nightmare cuz I lost contact with God
[1:31:37] but when you get a hunger and a thirst
[1:31:39] and if God ever touch your life you
[1:31:42] going to start digging you going to
[1:31:44] start praying and that's what I did I
[1:31:47] had to take time I to go to the bathroom
[1:31:49] and pray on my way going home when I was
[1:31:51] off I prayed and God brought me so now I
[1:31:55] have another chapter in my life where my
[1:31:58] finances is not where it was but I have
[1:32:01] to trust God and I tell you this year I
[1:32:05] tell you we've been coming off of Faith
[1:32:09] cuz it it just been faith that we've
[1:32:12] been getting here Lord I'm not going in
[1:32:14] detail but I know it's God bringing us
[1:32:16] here by faith cuz when you look in your
[1:32:19] account there's nothing there you know
[1:32:22] it's God doing it and I have to testify
[1:32:25] God been doing it this year in
[1:32:27] 2024 and I thank God for Pastor Jack and
[1:32:30] his his wife and the whole body of
[1:32:33] Christ for the many blessings I can't
[1:32:36] tell you who all but it's not nobody's
[1:32:38] business but I know God been using
[1:32:41] different ones in the body to bless us
[1:32:44] and I want to give God
[1:32:46] praise uh last week on Christmas day um
[1:32:50] I have a neighbor that he had a stroke
[1:32:52] of a year ago
[1:32:54] and God pressed upon me to start just
[1:32:57] giving him a plate of food I didn't
[1:32:59] think n of it and cuz I family grew up
[1:33:02] we always help people so it wasn't no
[1:33:05] big deal to me so the Lord pressed upon
[1:33:08] me to help him and I got a knock on my
[1:33:11] door Christmas Day his daughter came and
[1:33:13] she asked my name and everything and I
[1:33:16] you know I was talking to her and
[1:33:17] everything she said I really appreciate
[1:33:18] you for helping my dad I can't give you
[1:33:22] a whole lot but here's something
[1:33:24] to help you I was blown away because you
[1:33:27] know sometime when you do things you not
[1:33:28] looking for nothing in return but you
[1:33:32] know sometime we think God have
[1:33:34] abandoned us he haven't been thinking
[1:33:36] about us cuz I get up early in the
[1:33:38] morning cuz I have more time to pray and
[1:33:41] I had more time to fast cuz when I was
[1:33:43] on the job I couldn't do any of that but
[1:33:46] now I have more time to do it and it
[1:33:48] blew me away I'm like God just thinking
[1:33:50] about me it it really touched me it
[1:33:54] really touched me cuz sometime you think
[1:33:57] God has left you even though you come to
[1:34:00] the building and fellowship sometime you
[1:34:02] just still feel like you out there by
[1:34:05] yourself and I tell you it's been a
[1:34:08] tough year and um you know I come here
[1:34:11] and I I try to just absorb the word as
[1:34:14] much as I
[1:34:15] can the devil's still coming yes he's
[1:34:18] still coming and I know you know the
[1:34:21] service has been going on different
[1:34:23] sermons and thing you know get back and
[1:34:25] step so I said Lord you help me get
[1:34:28] closer to you cuz sometime you feel like
[1:34:30] you're still distant even though you
[1:34:31] come you sometime you still feel like
[1:34:33] you distance and I said God you got you
[1:34:35] got to help me cuz this is personal yes
[1:34:39] God going to judge us individually but
[1:34:41] we come here as a whole but you know we
[1:34:44] have to take it personally I mean put
[1:34:47] your whole heart and mind and soul into
[1:34:49] when you come here yes cuz it's so
[1:34:52] important cuz once you leave out the
[1:34:54] devil's still coming that's right I
[1:34:56] don't care how much you have in the
[1:34:58] natural and sometime things
[1:35:01] that you wasn't struggling with but
[1:35:04] sometime things happen that you do have
[1:35:06] a struggle with at the present time and
[1:35:09] I said Lord I can't give up you have to
[1:35:11] encourage yourself and I've been
[1:35:14] encouraging myself and a lot of times I
[1:35:16] fail at it too but I say no I can't quit
[1:35:19] cuz God has brought me too far he has
[1:35:22] brought me too far to give
[1:35:24] up and pastor Pastor Jack said write
[1:35:27] everything down that you need God to do
[1:35:29] I said God I need you to do
[1:35:32] everything everything I just tell God I
[1:35:35] need you to fix everything cuz I can't
[1:35:38] fix nothing when I tell you we've been
[1:35:40] coming on faith it's been nothing but
[1:35:43] Faith this year in 2024 but I look for
[1:35:46] God to open The Impossible doors I say
[1:35:49] bigger doors because I want to take them
[1:35:52] flight to London wherever the Saints are
[1:35:54] going I am going I'm going by
[1:35:59] faith I am going by faith and I speak it
[1:36:04] into existance I don't care what the
[1:36:06] devil doing I say I'm walking by faith
[1:36:09] in
[1:36:10] 2025
[1:36:19] H
[1:36:21] Hallelujah either you prophesy or Tes
[1:36:30] Hallelujah well thank you Lord I was
[1:36:33] going to say some anything but sister
[1:36:36] zma and everyone else and even Aisha was
[1:36:39] saying about trusting God and um a few
[1:36:42] months ago I had an interview here um in
[1:36:46] Palm uh Palm Beach downtown and out of a
[1:36:50] hundred people I was two of the hundred
[1:36:53] that was um
[1:36:55] Chosen and um the fourth interview when
[1:36:59] I went um I just had such a funny
[1:37:02] feeling like almost like you know I
[1:37:04] prayed I said Lord if this is for me you
[1:37:07] will open the door so while I was
[1:37:09] sitting there I was just going to meet
[1:37:12] the head bosses and um just to introduce
[1:37:15] myself so while I was sitting there
[1:37:20] um they came an a person and I looked
[1:37:23] like a woman dressed like a woman
[1:37:27] everything looked like a woman and while
[1:37:30] the person was sitting there with a
[1:37:32] coworker the person started speaking and
[1:37:34] it was a male so I'm sitting there and I
[1:37:37] was like oh and here comes the boss that
[1:37:41] hired me already for this job and he
[1:37:44] said hey Naomi and he was just giving me
[1:37:46] tips and tell me this is just an
[1:37:48] introduction to the two people the main
[1:37:51] people that's over the whole place and I
[1:37:53] was like okay and I just still didn't
[1:37:55] feel right and as he was talking to me
[1:37:58] he introduced himself to the two people
[1:38:00] that were sitting there and uh I just
[1:38:04] like oh my gosh this is not going to be
[1:38:06] good so anyway so while I was going in
[1:38:08] my uh my third interview well it's a
[1:38:11] fourth interview but it was two 15
[1:38:13] minute interviews um the lady was
[1:38:16] telling me well you know you have to
[1:38:19] participate in all these things like um
[1:38:22] everything you have have to participate
[1:38:24] in this like a and I sat there I said oh
[1:38:28] okay and I sat there and I was like no
[1:38:31] this is just not for me but I didn't say
[1:38:34] anything well a couple days later I just
[1:38:37] didn't feel right the money was good it
[1:38:41] was what I wanted and they sponsor you
[1:38:43] with everything they even told me Naomi
[1:38:45] if you need clothes there's a store
[1:38:46] downstairs we pay for everything you
[1:38:48] could pick up what you want and
[1:38:50] everything and they were just so excited
[1:38:51] we all were excited there supposed to
[1:38:53] send me an offer letter that Friday cuz
[1:38:55] I got the job and then 2 days or 3 days
[1:38:59] went by and I contacted the lady I said
[1:39:02] what happened I didn't get my offer she
[1:39:04] said oh we decided to move on with the
[1:39:07] different person I was like oh thank
[1:39:12] you cuz it looked good it sound good and
[1:39:15] everything was just good so I was like
[1:39:17] oh thank you and then I just got a
[1:39:19] little discouraged and I was like Lord
[1:39:21] we've been trying to move here and the
[1:39:23] door seem to open up and then it just
[1:39:26] shuts and it opens up and then it just
[1:39:29] shuts so I laid that Friday I was just
[1:39:32] laying Thursday cuz brother Jack
[1:39:34] mentioned something sometimes we ask God
[1:39:37] for things and we just we don't wait for
[1:39:39] God to answer back so I sat there and I
[1:39:42] was just like I woke up at like 3:00 in
[1:39:44] the morning and I was like all right
[1:39:46] Lord you got to have to tell us what to
[1:39:48] do cuz Solomon was like I'm just going
[1:39:51] to stay here you know he was just giving
[1:39:53] up and everything so I was like
[1:39:57] no I was like Noom mm I'm not giving up
[1:40:01] that easily we've been doing this for 10
[1:40:03] years I I'm I'm not giving up this easy
[1:40:06] so I was just laying there and um I fell
[1:40:09] asleep at the Thursday I fell asleep
[1:40:11] Lord didn't say nothing I said okay well
[1:40:14] so I did I woke up again at 3:00 a.m.
[1:40:17] Friday morning and I just sat there and
[1:40:20] I said Lord what do you want us to do
[1:40:22] what do you want want me to do is there
[1:40:24] something that it's not right what you
[1:40:26] want us to do and I could clearly hear
[1:40:29] like I heard it say
[1:40:32] believe and I sat there I said Lord I
[1:40:36] don't
[1:40:37] believe I said I'm
[1:40:39] believing and then the Sunday on our way
[1:40:42] to church I told someone what happened
[1:40:45] that Friday Sunday went on our way to
[1:40:47] church we was listening to brother
[1:40:48] whisper preaching and brother wper said
[1:40:51] sometimes we ask God Lord what it what
[1:40:54] is it that you want us to do he said all
[1:40:57] God wants you to do is just
[1:40:59] believe and I said that's a
[1:41:01] confirmation so I'm resting on that and
[1:41:06] I'm resting on this scripture right here
[1:41:09] uh it was Mark
[1:41:11] 10:29 and Jesus answered and said verily
[1:41:14] I say unto you there is no man that had
[1:41:16] left house or Brethren or sisters or
[1:41:19] father or mother or wife or children or
[1:41:22] lands for my sake
[1:41:23] and the gospel but he shall receive a h
[1:41:26] hundredfold now in this time houses and
[1:41:30] Brethren and sisters and mothers and
[1:41:33] children and lands with persecution in
[1:41:36] the world to come Eternal so I said I'm
[1:41:39] resting on that CU God gave me brothers
[1:41:41] and sisters and family here so I'm just
[1:41:44] waiting for my land 2025
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:41:53] God bless you um
[1:41:56] so sorry I'm like standing up in front
[1:41:59] of people okay um God bless um so I um
[1:42:04] in
[1:42:06] 2022 I think
[1:42:10] I um no sorry when was the first
[1:42:16] Camp yeah 2022 so I went to the camp I
[1:42:21] uh I enjoyed myself and
[1:42:23] um every I hope everyone has enjoyed
[1:42:25] thems um and I came back from the camp
[1:42:31] and I actually had an experience at the
[1:42:35] camp
[1:42:36] um and I went up to the altar nobody
[1:42:39] else was up there so I was like not
[1:42:41] going up there there's nobody there so
[1:42:44] instead I was like okay I'm just going
[1:42:46] to go up anyways so I went up and
[1:42:48] brother Jason Watkins came up and he's
[1:42:50] like well what are you why are you
[1:42:52] coming up sister and I told him
[1:42:56] I I want to receive the Holy Spirit and
[1:42:59] he he said okay we'll start praying and
[1:43:03] he said well lift your hands and I was
[1:43:05] like
[1:43:06] oh okay so I lifted my hands and he
[1:43:11] started praying and um he said don't
[1:43:14] leave until you feel like you've got it
[1:43:17] I was like okay so I didn't feel like I
[1:43:20] got it but I still left um
[1:43:23] and um I just kept he kept saying that
[1:43:27] to keep saying it until I felt like I
[1:43:29] got it so I kept saying well I have it
[1:43:31] so I went to tell poppy well my Dad
[1:43:34] sorry I went to go tell my dad and he
[1:43:37] was he just starts crying I'm like okay
[1:43:39] what are the Waterworks for um why
[1:43:42] crying and he's like he's just he said
[1:43:44] he was happy so then I say about 3 days
[1:43:48] after I came
[1:43:50] back I had started
[1:43:55] feeling I was like okay well that camp
[1:43:57] was nothing I started getting mind
[1:43:59] battles left and right and um started
[1:44:04] feeling like I didn't need to be here
[1:44:08] why am I he like I kind of don't want to
[1:44:13] do this be Christian why there's so many
[1:44:17] better things better
[1:44:20] and in 2023
[1:44:23] um I was still having the same thing but
[1:44:25] instead it was getting stronger so
[1:44:27] instead of it being on the inside it was
[1:44:29] coming out on the outside and I started
[1:44:33] doing things that Christians don't do
[1:44:38] and even through all of what I was
[1:44:42] doing um I couldn't see any way out or I
[1:44:47] couldn't see God in any of it and I
[1:44:51] still felt
[1:44:54] like you like a glimpse like I could see
[1:44:57] a glimpse of me still serving God like I
[1:44:59] would have a dream of me serving God and
[1:45:01] I would have a dream of me in a box and
[1:45:04] dark and I try to climb out of the box
[1:45:07] and I couldn't get out
[1:45:10] so then in 20 this year it kept going
[1:45:15] and I um it started getting even
[1:45:18] worse um but I I tried to keep like a
[1:45:22] smile and I tried to L it and lo lock
[1:45:25] everyone out kind of just keep it
[1:45:27] insulated in myself
[1:45:30] but it it at that I would I it was kind
[1:45:33] of difficult and I was crying
[1:45:36] and I want I don't want to say depress
[1:45:39] cuz I don't I don't want but yeah I kind
[1:45:43] of was
[1:45:45] and I kept feeling like that and I got
[1:45:48] to the point I was like I went outside
[1:45:50] and I would walk around the yard and I
[1:45:53] was just like okay I was crying and
[1:45:57] nobody was there and I would look into
[1:45:59] the it was like Sunset and I I looked
[1:46:02] into the sky and I was like if you're
[1:46:04] there if you're God then where are you
[1:46:07] cuz I feel nothing and I walked back
[1:46:11] inside and lad's like yo what's wrong
[1:46:13] with you and I'm like you don't want to
[1:46:15] talk to me right now
[1:46:17] and we I heard the concert was going on
[1:46:21] so uh we decided to go to the concert
[1:46:25] and um brother tumba and brother Joe
[1:46:28] they started singing he won't fail I've
[1:46:32] seen it with my own eyes and and that
[1:46:35] song it it was kind of like
[1:46:38] boom so he was like ever since you were
[1:46:43] seven things happened and I still
[1:46:46] brought things to come to pass you lost
[1:46:49] something and I brought it and
[1:46:53] from and I cuz a lot of things from my
[1:46:57] mom and all that stuff um but I lost it
[1:47:02] and he brought it back and he gave me
[1:47:04] more he gave me three brothers and um so
[1:47:09] I kept singing that song and I got to
[1:47:12] the point I was just like okay I give up
[1:47:15] I give up I'm done fighting cuz um
[1:47:18] really I was fighting to stay out and I
[1:47:21] was rather thinking maybe I should fight
[1:47:23] to stay in so am I wasn't able I was
[1:47:29] able to write songs not during the two
[1:47:32] years of all that going on from the 3

[1:51:56] year of my whole entire life
[1:51:59] um
[1:52:01] but um since I was like probably like 14
[1:52:05] I did struggle with depression for a
[1:52:07] very long time so throughout the year I
[1:52:10] was just very like discouraged
[1:52:13] very low I guess and um I was just like
[1:52:19] it kind of piggyback so Abby was saying
[1:52:20] like God are you real like are you you
[1:52:22] really here do you like really care
[1:52:24] about me like why am I why am I here
[1:52:27] like am I I just felt like I'm
[1:52:30] just just here for no reason basically
[1:52:34] so um I didn't talk to brother Jack
[1:52:37] about it he did encourage me or whatever
[1:52:41] and then a couple weeks later maybe a
[1:52:44] couple weeks later the interpretation
[1:52:46] comes and Sh we sng the song be still
[1:52:48] and know that I am God and then
[1:52:50] interpretation comes and I was like just
[1:52:52] asking God like just speak to me like
[1:52:54] let me know that you're actually a real
[1:52:56] thing and the interpretation comes and
[1:52:59] he says
[1:53:02] um I am God um hearken unto
[1:53:06] me something like that and I will
[1:53:09] speak and I was just like that was my

[1:58:43] scene because um she thinks that they
[1:58:45] were drunk so um sister Ashley had to go
[1:58:50] to the hospital and and um and they're
[1:58:53] just doing some some observations so we
[1:58:55] want to have a word of prayer uh on
[1:58:59] behalf of our sister and um you know we
[1:59:03] just thank God I appreciate all the
[1:59:06] testimonies I know that uh even on
[1:59:10] Sunday night after we left church uh
[1:59:13] somebody hit sister Bernice uh on the
[1:59:15] way home too but she walked out of that
[1:59:19] situation and she's in the house of the
[1:59:21] Lord
[1:59:25] tonight and you know just um as my
[1:59:28] mother-in-law was just sharing there
[1:59:30] just a accident that that could have
[1:59:32] happened at our home could have been
[1:59:33] much worse uh a different story tonight
[1:59:36] but I thank God for his promise the
[1:59:38] promise says the angel of the Lord
[1:59:43] encampeth round about them that fear Him
[1:59:48] and deliver them from all their troubles
[1:59:53] amen so we thank God for his delivering
[1:59:55] power Amen in all these situations that
[1:59:58] could have been another way but God is
[2:00:02] faithful amen praise the Lord uh
[2:00:05] musicians thank y'all so much amen for
[2:00:09] your uh service on tonight uh I'm going

[2:00:14] that scripture we will uh have a word of
[2:00:17] prayer for sister
[2:00:18] Ashley and uh just pray over the word I
[2:00:22] was just sitting back there thinking
[2:00:23] said man the way the testimonies are
[2:00:25] going I really don't need to preach

[2:00:44] we I mean months go by and we forget
[2:00:46] that God did that so it was a a really

[2:02:20] word

[2:04:50] uplifted and encouraged
[2:04:52] and Lord we just believe that if you did
[2:04:54] it this year you'll do the same next
[2:04:56] year whatever it is that we have need of
[2:04:59] God you will do it so we commit it all
[2:05:01] into your hands it's in Jesus name we
[2:05:03] pray amen amen God bless you praise the
[2:05:07] Lord you can be seated amen I uh I won't
[2:05:11] uh stand before you uh too long uh
[2:05:15] tonight but uh I did have just a little
[2:05:19] something in my heart that I wanted to
[2:05:22] share amen uh with with with the church
[2:05:26] the a few weeks ago we were standing
[2:05:29] here and we were reading this scripture
[2:05:33] out of Joel chapter 2 and you know the
[2:05:36] the theme for the year has been get back
[2:05:39] in step and uh typically what I do uh is
[2:05:45] I I try to you know find what the will
[2:05:49] of the Lord is for us for the next year
[2:05:52] and what is the theme that God wants us
[2:05:54] to have for the next year like two years
[2:05:56] ago uh well one year you all remember we
[2:05:59] talked about replication that was the
[2:06:01] word that God gave us and God did that
[2:06:05] uh and then you know brother Simba was
[2:06:06] just talking about how uh the Lord had
[2:06:09] given us uh uh the last year uh yielding
[2:06:12] to the perfect will of God and uh and
[2:06:15] how you know the Lord just kind of
[2:06:17] blessed I was so happy that he shared
[2:06:19] his testimony with you all because uh I
[2:06:21] noticed after he yielded how God just
[2:06:25] opened up doors amen and and it's
[2:06:28] something about being obedient uh to the
[2:06:30] Lord that releases blessings Amen in our
[2:06:34] Direction uh but you know this year the
[2:06:36] Lord had given us uh get back in step
[2:06:40] and um and then the inspiration of I
[2:06:43] will restore sayith the Lord so I was
[2:06:44] praying and seeking the Lord about Lord
[2:06:46] what will happen for next year what is
[2:06:48] it that you want us to um
[2:06:52] uh what's going to be our theme and I
[2:06:54] just could not get a
[2:06:56] release uh from where we were because I
[2:06:59] knew I still had sermons still connected
[2:07:03] to that theme so when when I saw that I
[2:07:06] said okay Lord I'm just going to yield
[2:07:08] to that and not not be so concerned
[2:07:10] about trying to find something new but
[2:07:13] just keep moving on with what God had
[2:07:15] already given us until we until we get
[2:07:18] it to an end and um so you know with
[2:07:22] that uh being said what I was feeling
[2:07:26] amen is that uh next year would be what
[2:07:31] we call an overlap
[2:07:33] year and um so there's things that that
[2:07:37] lap over and I mean they go from this
[2:07:39] year and they lap over until next into
[2:07:41] the next year and I was looking for
[2:07:43] different words to uh kind of Express
[2:07:47] that overlap and uh one of the words
[2:07:50] that came to me amen was
[2:07:56] overflow so um when I start thinking
[2:08:00] about
[2:08:01] overflow and and I don't I don't like to
[2:08:04] just give words and not necessarily be
[2:08:06] able to put it back in scripture
[2:08:09] appreciate brother hose's testimony that
[2:08:12] he was reading the word of God and God
[2:08:15] spoke to him in the word right that
[2:08:17] you'll always hear his voice when you
[2:08:19] read his word right so uh you know what
[2:08:21] you're standing on when you when you got
[2:08:23] scripture so you know I was like well
[2:08:25] Lord you I feel like you overlap
[2:08:27] overflow I feel like you're putting this
[2:08:29] in my in my in my spirit but I just
[2:08:31] don't know um you know how am I going to
[2:08:35] tie this in so I was standing in the
[2:08:37] pull pit a few weeks ago
[2:08:40] reading Joel 2 and and I said to y'all
[2:08:45] oh my goodness it's right here I've been
[2:08:47] reading it the entire year and missing
[2:08:51] it and and there in verse 24 it said and
[2:08:56] the
[2:08:57] floors shall be full of
[2:09:00] Wheat and the fats
[2:09:06] shall amen shall
[2:09:09] overflow with wine and oil now before I
[2:09:11] go too far the title of the sermon
[2:09:14] tonight and this is a
[2:09:16] declaration and uh it is it's you can
[2:09:19] you can receive it for self or you can
[2:09:22] just let it be another title but the
[2:09:24] title tonight is year of
[2:09:29] overflow
[2:09:31] Hallelujah yes sir year of
[2:09:36] overflow praise the name of the Lord
[2:09:39] amen and we write in the scripture
[2:09:42] because Joel prophesied that uh the the
[2:09:46] floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat
[2:09:49] shall overflow
[2:09:52] and the reason that we had to go into
[2:09:53] the next year with the same theme
[2:09:56] because God wants us to
[2:09:59] experience Hallelujah
[2:10:01] [Music]
[2:10:03] somebody oh blessed be the name of the
[2:10:05] Lord now I I have to take my time and
[2:10:08] just kind of break down a couple things
[2:10:10] for you uh so that you understand this
[2:10:13] this you know there there's churches
[2:10:15] today um tonight that a meeting and and
[2:10:17] somebody else probably got the same them
[2:10:19] you know about overflow and you know and
[2:10:21] and and and everybody look at it from uh
[2:10:23] maybe just the the the natural blessings
[2:10:25] but when we talk about what Joel
[2:10:27] prophesied now Joel prophesied about
[2:10:30] wine and oil yes sir Hallelujah so you
[2:10:34] need to understand that first come on
[2:10:37] because the natural will type the
[2:10:39] spiritual so let's let's understand the
[2:10:42] spiritual aspect first and then we're
[2:10:45] going to move into the natural is that
[2:10:46] all right so let's understand what this
[2:10:49] uh this this this this oil is
[2:10:51] um and and I was looking in the Hebrew
[2:10:54] lexicon just the word uh overflow there
[2:10:59] it means um the the the Hebrew word is s
[2:11:04] h u w
[2:11:07] k s h u w k that's the Hebrew word now
[2:11:13] if you ask me what does that how does
[2:11:15] that sound uh that they give me what it
[2:11:19] sounds like what does s hu w case sounds
[2:11:22] like and they say it sounds like
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:27] shook
[2:11:31] Shook and what shook means is to be
[2:11:37] abundant to give abundance
[2:11:40] to uh to overflow that's what shook mean
[2:11:44] so if somebody say brother you shook
[2:11:47] hello sister you shook it means I'm
[2:11:49] walking in the Overflow
[2:11:53] praise the Lord glory to God Amen so
[2:11:56] here uh just a a quick definition so we
[2:11:59] can get this understanding of what uh
[2:12:02] what this overflow is all about the wine
[2:12:04] and the oil coming from the the sermon
[2:12:07] the fourth seal coming from that sermon
[2:12:09] um here we get a just a little glimpse
[2:12:13] of it it says now we left off uh let's
[2:12:16] just for a few moments review of that
[2:12:18] now he says then we left off on the
[2:12:20] power
[2:12:21] of the wine he says what the oil
[2:12:25] represented spirit so when we when we
[2:12:27] see amen an overflow of wine and oil the
[2:12:30] oil itself represents Spirit hallelujah
[2:12:34] amen so there's supposed to be an
[2:12:36] overflow the next year of the spirit
[2:12:39] Hallelujah and
[2:12:42] overflow my God that's something you
[2:12:44] can't contain hallu hello church I'm
[2:12:47] under expectation for overflow something
[2:12:50] you can not contain Lord amen he say he
[2:12:54] he goes on and says um uh the oil
[2:12:56] represented spirit I guess you all got
[2:12:58] it all down you'll find it on tape if
[2:13:00] you didn't and where to find the
[2:13:02] scriptures that the oil always
[2:13:04] symbolizes the Holy Spirit like the
[2:13:06] foolish virgins with no oil wise virgins
[2:13:10] with oil whiches the Holy Spirit and
[2:13:12] then on back in the prophets and so
[2:13:14] forth uh he says now of course I don't
[2:13:17] try to pull out every scripture in there
[2:13:19] and there's things that you can't even
[2:13:21] even speak about it'll take too much
[2:13:23] time he says but I try to place out here
[2:13:25] with scriptures and so forth just enough
[2:13:28] to give the people so it'll let them
[2:13:31] know and see the picture of it he says
[2:13:34] but if you sat down with one of them
[2:13:36] seals why my you could take a month's
[2:13:39] sermon every every night right on the
[2:13:41] seal and still not even touch it see on
[2:13:45] one of them that's how much there is to
[2:13:47] it but I just hit the high spots of it
[2:13:50] then you can see what it's all about now
[2:13:52] let's keep going it says now as oil
[2:13:55] symbolize the Holy Spirit we find out
[2:13:59] that oil and wine is connected in
[2:14:03] worship oil and wine is connected in
[2:14:08] worship see always connected in worship
[2:14:13] my God he says in the wine I said which
[2:14:15] come to me that the wine symbolizes that
[2:14:20] it was the power or it was the power of
[2:14:24] stimulation by
[2:14:27] Revelation oh this is so important right
[2:14:30] because see when the when when there's
[2:14:31] an overflow of wine that means there's
[2:14:33] an overflow of Revelation that's coming
[2:14:36] questions that you might have had God is
[2:14:38] going to send you the answer there's an
[2:14:41] overflow of wine coming your way than
[2:14:45] you Hallelujah and when you when you
[2:14:48] find the Holy Spirit vindicating amen
[2:14:51] the wine then you know you're in the
[2:14:53] right place at the right time amen when
[2:14:56] the Holy Spirit vindicates the
[2:14:57] Revelation and gives you stimulation on
[2:15:00] Revelation here here you know even just
[2:15:02] the the title tonight year of
[2:15:05] overflow there's a revelation that
[2:15:07] strikes your heart because like Lord you
[2:15:08] speaking that over me you speaking that
[2:15:11] over my situation you speaking that over
[2:15:14] my
[2:15:15] circumstance somebody say I come to get
[2:15:17] a word from the Lord that's exactly what
[2:15:19] God want to give you that's right amen
[2:15:21] but you got to be able to catch what
[2:15:23] he's speaking to you yes sir Hallelujah
[2:15:26] watch it now let's let's go he says
[2:15:28] always connected in worship and and the
[2:15:30] wine said I said which come to me that
[2:15:32] the wine symbolizes that it was the
[2:15:34] power of stim stimulation by Revelation
[2:15:37] see and that's when something has been
[2:15:40] revealed it gives stimulation to the
[2:15:42] believer because it's presented by
[2:15:46] Revelation I like that yes sir I was
[2:15:48] listening to sister ke's uh testimony in
[2:15:51] somebody said well you you in the cult
[2:15:52] she said God going to have to judge me
[2:15:54] by the cult that I'm in that was a
[2:15:57] revelation yes right amen that is a
[2:16:00] revelation that God gave her she can
[2:16:02] stand on her own two feet no matter what
[2:16:05] nobody else say God going have to judge
[2:16:08] me by my
[2:16:09] cult brother that is powerful
[2:16:13] hallu that's powerful amen amen L he
[2:16:17] said he says it gives stimulation to the
[2:16:19] believer because is presented by
[2:16:22] Revelation stimulation comes from
[2:16:25] Revelation so even as we as we go
[2:16:27] through this tonight amen there'll be
[2:16:29] some things that'll be brought out but
[2:16:31] but it's going to have you're going to
[2:16:32] have to catch it by Revelation and then
[2:16:35] when you catch the Revelation it gives
[2:16:36] you stimulation yes
[2:16:39] siren come on now you know in the
[2:16:41] natural when people get stimulated by
[2:16:44] wine they act a little different yes sir
[2:16:48] they talk different they walk different
[2:16:52] right because of the stimulation they
[2:16:54] they even think different because of the
[2:16:56] stimulation same thing it should be in
[2:16:58] the spiritual Hallelujah on the on the
[2:17:01] day of Pentecost when they were
[2:17:03] stimulated praise God because when the
[2:17:05] Holy Spirit came down was manifest in
[2:17:07] the scripture right before the very
[2:17:08] midst he said this is that which the
[2:17:11] prophet Joel spake about they were all
[2:17:14] stimulated by what God had done in their
[2:17:17] midst and I like what the Bible say the
[2:17:19] bible say that all them were fed yes
[2:17:22] sir come on I mean not just some of them
[2:17:25] but everybody that was sitting in that
[2:17:26] Upper Room everybody got something from
[2:17:30] God everybody got some stimulation and
[2:17:33] I'm believing praise God that that's the
[2:17:35] type of year we're going to have you
[2:17:37] might come here one way but you're going
[2:17:38] to leave here another way because of the
[2:17:41] Overflow of the wine and the
[2:17:44] oil you can't stop God's promise from
[2:17:47] being made manifest we know where we
[2:17:50] standing at
[2:17:52] am this is the
[2:17:55] year I ain't talking about a season I'm
[2:17:58] declaring the whole year as a year of
[2:18:01] overflow from the first of the of
[2:18:04] January to the the
[2:18:06] 31st of December I'm receiving
[2:18:12] overflow overflow in the spirit and in
[2:18:15] the
[2:18:16] natural thank you
[2:18:18] Lord thank you Lord it gives stimulation
[2:18:21] to the believer every when y'all when
[2:18:24] y'all amen and and glory to God and all
[2:18:26] that what you doing you operating under
[2:18:28] the stimulation yes sir truth that that
[2:18:31] you're operating under the stimulation
[2:18:33] amen praise God watch it said it was a
[2:18:35] it says uh uh when something has been
[2:18:37] revealed it gives stimulation to the
[2:18:39] believer because it's presented by
[2:18:42] Revelation right it says see it's
[2:18:44] something that God has said it's a
[2:18:46] mystery they can't understand it and
[2:18:49] then after a while after a while God
[2:18:53] comes down and reveals it and then
[2:18:56] vindicates it praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:19:00] right amen uh sister D's testimony she
[2:19:03] had she had the question is Lord are you
[2:19:05] real speak to
[2:19:07] me and she happened to be sitting right
[2:19:09] there next to her mama praying that
[2:19:10] prayer and her mama takes off in an
[2:19:13] unknown tongue Lord now Sister D didn't
[2:19:16] know what what was being said none of us
[2:19:18] knew what was being said glory to God
[2:19:21] amen but but as we waited on the Lord
[2:19:24] Brother brother Jerry didn't share the
[2:19:25] whole testimony with y'all but he said
[2:19:27] it came to him in his ear he heard what
[2:19:29] God was saying he heard the
[2:19:31] interpretation but as he waited on the
[2:19:33] Lord all of a sudden it went from just a
[2:19:35] voice to actually a
[2:19:37] vision and when they went to Vision he
[2:19:39] just began to read what he was seeing
[2:19:42] Hallelujah yes sir and when he read what
[2:19:44] he was seeing it was an answer to the
[2:19:47] prayer up
[2:19:49] front yes oh my
[2:19:55] god oh let me just keep I you know I I
[2:19:59] want to kind of say like this we are
[2:20:00] church that believe in all the gifts but
[2:20:03] they have to be in order right amen oh
[2:20:07] let me just share this testimony because
[2:20:08] I'm I'm I'm I I I would almost forgot
[2:20:11] about it praise the Lord for the the
[2:20:13] opportunity to go to Philippines and and
[2:20:16] and when I went there to the Philippines
[2:20:18] I I um I've been taking everywhere
[2:20:21] everywhere I go uh this this year that I
[2:20:24] preach I I preach um get back and step
[2:20:28] at least once at least once they didn't
[2:20:30] get the full 15p part sermon that y'all
[2:20:32] getting and I I'm I'm on my way to 16
[2:20:35] but they got the first one and uh so I I
[2:20:38] I I preached it that morning and then uh
[2:20:42] you know Wonderful atmosphere and then
[2:20:43] brother Diggs came in the afternoon
[2:20:45] Service uh and he preached you know that
[2:20:48] afternoon service and and as he was
[2:20:50] preaching you know Holy Spirit still
[2:20:52] moving you know amongst the people and
[2:20:55] um uh at the end of his at the end of
[2:20:58] his sermon he kind of felt led to have
[2:21:01] like an altar call and not necessarily
[2:21:03] calling people up but just maybe in your
[2:21:04] chair you know just kind of dealing with
[2:21:06] them in their situations and as he was
[2:21:08] just kind of working all of a sudden the
[2:21:10] Holy Spirit came down upon a sister and
[2:21:13] uh and she began to speak in tongues now
[2:21:15] when I say things got to be in order
[2:21:17] that's what I mean the preaching had
[2:21:19] already gone forth right you don't
[2:21:21] interrupt the preacher while they
[2:21:23] preaching right because the scripture
[2:21:25] tells us that the spirit of the prophets
[2:21:27] is subject to the prophets we got to
[2:21:30] keep things in the word yes sir right so
[2:21:32] so so so this sister she she she she
[2:21:35] went she she actually uh spoke in
[2:21:37] tongues and then she interpreted her own
[2:21:39] tongues because the scripture also tells
[2:21:41] us that if you speak in tongues in
[2:21:44] public you pray that God gives you the
[2:21:46] interpretation so it's just not chaos
[2:21:51] amen and um and I remember telling the
[2:21:53] church that you know when we're in
[2:21:55] public now it's one thing when you're in
[2:21:57] private it it's a different it's a whole
[2:21:59] different story but when you're in
[2:22:00] public there's a way that God
[2:22:01] establishes for us to do these things
[2:22:04] and it's and and one of the things that
[2:22:05] Paul taught us says if the if if tongues
[2:22:08] go forth in the church he says Let It Be
[2:22:10] by two or at most three that's the Bible
[2:22:14] yes sir right so so so so here I am
[2:22:16] standing there in the Philippines and
[2:22:18] and this sister breaks out in tongues
[2:22:19] and she interp
[2:22:21] and all of a sudden after she finished
[2:22:23] another sister breaks out in tongues and
[2:22:25] then that sister interprets her
[2:22:27] tongues so I'm just kind of looking now
[2:22:31] Hallelujah I'm in the spirit but I'm
[2:22:33] watching too yes sir right so so so next
[2:22:35] thing you know amen I watched I watched
[2:22:38] I watch I said cuz I know what the
[2:22:40] scripture tell us now two or at most
[2:22:42] three so here here I said now if it's a
[2:22:45] third one then I know it'll stop right
[2:22:47] there but no God stopped at the two and
[2:22:49] the pastor went up and took the mic and
[2:22:51] just kind of carried on the service when
[2:22:52] I saw that I said they right on the word
[2:22:55] sir Hallelujah I say they right on the
[2:22:57] word I said this is exactly what we've
[2:22:59] been teaching the church and and I saw
[2:23:02] it manifested in the Philippines prise
[2:23:05] Lord you think God is just the god of
[2:23:07] the
[2:23:08] Philippines no God is God in West Palm
[2:23:10] Beach and if we've established things by
[2:23:12] the word we're going to see God manifest
[2:23:15] himself by the word exactly right
[2:23:16] brother let me go on a little further
[2:23:18] with this now he says he says uh
[2:23:21] it gives stimulation to the believer
[2:23:22] because it's presented by Revelation he
[2:23:25] says it gives stimulation uh he says
[2:23:27] it's something that God has said it's a
[2:23:29] mystery they can't understand it see and
[2:23:31] after a while God comes down and reveals
[2:23:33] it and then vindicates it watch it says
[2:23:36] remember the truth is revealed here's
[2:23:39] the first thing the truth is revealed
[2:23:41] the truth is also Vindicated God
[2:23:45] constantly no matter how smart the
[2:23:47] person might be how Brant he might be in
[2:23:49] his mind if God don't back up what he's
[2:23:53] saying there's something wrong and and I
[2:23:56] just wanted to pause real quickly on
[2:23:58] that I I heard tonight through your
[2:24:02] testimonies how God backed up the thing
[2:24:06] of get back in step and I will restore
[2:24:09] sayth the Lord I heard that in your
[2:24:12] testimonies that God backed up that
[2:24:15] thing for this year yes he and let me
[2:24:17] just and now am I the only one heard
[2:24:19] that
[2:24:21] okay so if God backed up that theme this
[2:24:23] year he's going to back up this little
[2:24:25] inspiration Hallelujah that I'm giving
[2:24:27] you tonight to go into next year he's
[2:24:29] going to back up year of the Overflow
[2:24:33] yes sir I believe it
[2:24:36] hallelujah amen oh my God my God my God
[2:24:41] he said that's right cuz that's the word
[2:24:43] cuz it's the word now now I'm going to
[2:24:45] uh uh move down to paragraph 64 on that
[2:24:49] but I want just mentioned just a couple
[2:24:51] things that the Lord did you know uh in
[2:24:53] this restoration year Sunday school is
[2:24:57] restored uh communion was restored feet
[2:25:01] washing was
[2:25:02] restored
[2:25:03] Souls were
[2:25:06] restored am I and when I when I heard
[2:25:10] sister aby's testimony she was a
[2:25:12] confirmation but i' had already been
[2:25:14] looking at some others that I that I
[2:25:16] know I know they were part of the
[2:25:19] restoration they have to testify God
[2:25:21] testify for him
[2:25:23] Hallelujah from the beginning of the
[2:25:24] year all the way to now you you are the
[2:25:29] restoration praise the Lord amen
[2:25:32] spiritual gifts was restored yes sir
[2:25:36] finances restored Health was
[2:25:40] restored y'all heard sister Tanya's
[2:25:42] testimony Health was restored sister
[2:25:45] sister uh cap was at going through a few
[2:25:47] things at the at the end of uh
[2:25:50] the year before but look at how God
[2:25:52] restored her and and she come right on
[2:25:55] up in here every time she could come on
[2:25:58] somebody we saw restoration all around
[2:26:00] us yes sir brother God backed up what he
[2:26:03] what he put us under and and if he's
[2:26:06] allowing us to overflow into it I don't
[2:26:08] you your expectations are to rise right
[2:26:11] yes
[2:26:13] sir let me just let me just read this
[2:26:15] one out of this and I want to I want to
[2:26:17] change gears here really quick and and
[2:26:19] it says in paragraph 64 the power of
[2:26:22] Revelation brings stimulation to the
[2:26:24] believer it says for the power of wine
[2:26:27] natural wine is to stimulate is to bring
[2:26:30] a person that's all slumped down to
[2:26:34] stimulation and and and and you know and
[2:26:36] sometimes in your spirit you can get
[2:26:37] slumped down but what God want want you
[2:26:41] to understand that he's going to bring
[2:26:43] stimulation of Revelation to pull you
[2:26:45] out of your your your your your slump
[2:26:48] amen amen am
[2:26:50] amen he says this he says well then now
[2:26:53] there's a power revelation of the word
[2:26:55] give stimulation of Joy to the believer
[2:26:58] stimulation of satisfaction stimulation
[2:27:01] that is Vindicated it's proved it's
[2:27:03] called in the scripture as we want to
[2:27:04] refer to it as new wine Hallelujah all
[2:27:08] right it says we all always refer to it
[2:27:10] like that these are drunk on new wine
[2:27:12] all right or spiritual wine I think is
[2:27:14] the best interpretation we would uh
[2:27:16] would be on spiritual wine now as um as
[2:27:20] we understand that this this this oil
[2:27:22] and wine oil typifying the spirit the
[2:27:25] wine stimulation of Revelation this is
[2:27:27] what will be an overflow for this next
[2:27:31] year I I'm declaring that it's going to
[2:27:33] be an overflow but it's not just a
[2:27:36] overflow of just the spiritual things
[2:27:38] let me just read a a a quote out of a
[2:27:42] prayer line and and I'm going I'm going
[2:27:44] to set you up uh for something else here
[2:27:47] uh Jehovah Gyra is where I want to read
[2:27:49] from so just stay with with me I'm I'm
[2:27:50] giving you laying this foundation so
[2:27:52] that we can lay some scripture in for
[2:27:53] you and uh and help you see where you
[2:27:56] where we're where we're standing this
[2:27:58] message on this overflow is something
[2:28:00] that I've had tucked away in my in my
[2:28:03] notes
[2:28:04] for a while and I was waiting on the
[2:28:08] right time to release it and the only
[2:28:10] time when I saw God taking us into this
[2:28:12] next year with the same thing that's
[2:28:14] when I knew this was time to release it
[2:28:17] praise God so as we're going into this
[2:28:19] next year we're going in with an
[2:28:20] expectation but I want you to catch
[2:28:22] something here out of this message I'm
[2:28:24] turning a corner out of Jehovah gy says
[2:28:26] now this is this is a prayer line he
[2:28:27] says now it's making me weak of course
[2:28:30] you could see it and even this cold
[2:28:32] night and the pers perspiration running
[2:28:34] from my hand it says it's his presence
[2:28:37] Visions Jesus said I perceive virtue is
[2:28:39] gone not from not from the God that was
[2:28:42] in him but from his physical body the
[2:28:44] Son of God who he was that's the same
[2:28:46] thing here it just makes you real weak
[2:28:48] it's Visions he says if you have faith
[2:28:50] and can believe with all your heart
[2:28:52] while you can receive what you ask for
[2:28:55] if you have faith amen and believe with
[2:28:57] all your heart you can receive what you
[2:28:59] ask for I believe sister s s s sister Z
[2:29:02] say I'm going to
[2:29:05] London amen I'm getting a passport I'm
[2:29:08] going to London Hallelujah my God and
[2:29:11] and and I tell you with faith like that
[2:29:13] going to push everybody out there to
[2:29:16] London we we we ought to ask God for big
[2:29:18] things yes sir the same God that can
[2:29:21] take you to Orlando can take you to
[2:29:27] London he say he say he says if you have
[2:29:29] faith and believe with all your heart
[2:29:31] you can receive what you ask for now
[2:29:33] Sister maybe I can talk to you just a
[2:29:35] little do you believe me to be a servant
[2:29:37] the servant of the Lord Jesus you know
[2:29:39] that there's nothing in your in your
[2:29:41] brother could do anything for you to
[2:29:43] help you to heal you if you're sick but
[2:29:46] um but you know believe me that I am his
[2:29:48] servant that I'm only trying to come
[2:29:50] here because he spoke to me and told me
[2:29:52] to come and he be with me and do these
[2:29:54] things just like you see there in the
[2:29:57] audience now listen to this he says now
[2:29:58] you know that I don't know you I know
[2:30:00] nothing of you but God knows all about
[2:30:04] you he said he says doesn't it says well
[2:30:07] if he can tell me here what you're here
[2:30:09] for then will you believe him with all
[2:30:13] your heart it says will and will accept
[2:30:15] whatever whatever you're whatever you're
[2:30:17] here for now the latest stand there in
[2:30:20] the prayer line brother brandom hasn't
[2:30:21] discerned yet the Holy Spirit hasn't
[2:30:23] told him what she's there for but he
[2:30:25] says it's a possibility that you could
[2:30:27] be standing in the prayer line for
[2:30:36] finances it's a possibility sister I
[2:30:39] don't know what you're going through but
[2:30:41] it's a possibility that you come to this
[2:30:42] prayer line because you need
[2:30:45] finances now why would the prophet say
[2:30:48] that because God's concerned about your
[2:30:51] finances oh my my my my we're going
[2:30:54] somewhere now God is actually concerned
[2:30:57] about your Finance the same way God is
[2:30:59] concerned about your health he's
[2:31:01] concerned about your
[2:31:03] finances it says you could be here uh
[2:31:06] you're here for whether it's finances or
[2:31:07] whether it's a spiritual troubles or
[2:31:09] whatever it is you will accept it now
[2:31:12] may he Grant it is my sincere prayer now
[2:31:17] now now now and I'm like well now uh um
[2:31:20] let's just kind of look at a few things
[2:31:22] here in scripture you as it pertains
[2:31:25] pertains this because we call this the
[2:31:27] year of overflow give me Luke

[2:31:47] how you you you you you you're you you

[2:32:09] this way but when it's given back to you

[2:32:41] overflow Hallelujah running over shall
[2:32:43] men give into your bosom for with the
[2:32:47] same measure that you meet with all it
[2:32:49] shall be measured to you again this is a
[2:32:52] promise in the scripture for an overflow
[2:32:55] yes it is brother amen hallelujah let me
[2:32:58] go on a little further here because this
[2:33:00] is you know I I I um I got a a a couple
[2:33:04] things there's a scripture that I want
[2:33:05] to make mention of and I'll I'll just
[2:33:08] kind of you'll find it in Second Kings
[2:33:11] but I won't I won't read it I won't read
[2:33:13] it uh you can you'll go back and you
[2:33:15] read 2 Kings 4: 1-7 you can read it but
[2:33:19] but what happened here there was a a
[2:33:22] woman that came to the prophet Elisha
[2:33:25] she was in a a an indebted situation I
[2:33:30] mean thatb was probably piled up to here
[2:33:33] and uh this lady really didn't know how
[2:33:35] to get out of this situation that she
[2:33:37] was in Hallelujah glory to God and uh so
[2:33:42] she goes to the prophet Elisha and
[2:33:43] Elisha says you know um what kind of U
[2:33:47] uh containers you have in the house get
[2:33:48] as many containers as you got you know
[2:33:51] and and then and and and and and you
[2:33:53] know and after you get all the
[2:33:54] containers out of your house then go
[2:33:55] borrow some containers from some of your
[2:33:57] your neighbors and that lady went and
[2:34:00] got all these containers he said okay I
[2:34:01] got the containers he says now what I
[2:34:03] want you to do is go and and fill those
[2:34:06] containers with
[2:34:08] oil praise God Amen with oil amen fill
[2:34:12] all those those vessels amen he said and
[2:34:14] he told he said don't just borrow a few
[2:34:15] containers borrow as many as you
[2:34:18] possibly can yes sir Hallelujah said and
[2:34:20] fill them with oil and so so they went
[2:34:22] and you know and as her and her boys
[2:34:24] because being that she was in debt the
[2:34:26] creditors was coming to take her boys
[2:34:27] from her sir Hallelujah the devil don't
[2:34:30] try the devil trying to take your family
[2:34:32] from you that Devil's a liar is right
[2:34:35] but but here say say no no just take
[2:34:37] your boys y'all fill up all these
[2:34:38] containers with oil and they got all the
[2:34:40] oil in the containers and and she said
[2:34:42] okay give me another container I said
[2:34:44] she said they say mama that's it we
[2:34:45] ain't got no more says okay so they went
[2:34:47] to the prophet says okay we got all
[2:34:49] these say us f with the oil what should
[2:34:51] we do oh my my my my my my let me read
[2:34:55] this one for you cuz I I want the
[2:34:57] scripture to to come alive to you amen
[2:35:01] amen verse uh uh verse six verse 6 in 2
[2:35:05] Kings chapter uh 4 verse 6 says and it
[2:35:09] came to pass Glory when the vessels were
[2:35:12] full Hallelujah that she said unto her
[2:35:16] son bring me at a vessel and it said
[2:35:18] unto her there is not not a vessel more
[2:35:21] and the oil stayed watch this now says
[2:35:25] then she came and told the man of God
[2:35:27] and he said go sell the oil and pay thy
[2:35:36] debt and live thou and thy children off
[2:35:42] the rest sir now the prophet already
[2:35:44] knew that this lady was going to get
[2:35:46] more than just the debt paid off
[2:35:50] amen this lady was going into a season
[2:35:54] of overflow there was a time where she
[2:35:57] was
[2:35:58] lacking and maybe this year was a year
[2:36:01] that you went lacking but by faith I am
[2:36:04] speaking over the
[2:36:06] congregation last year was a year of
[2:36:08] lack but this year a year of
[2:36:13] overflow hallelujah hallelujah
[2:36:18] am amen
[2:36:20] let's read another one out of the
[2:36:22] scripture amen and and and let me tell
[2:36:25] you something God is concerned about
[2:36:26] these areas of your life he was
[2:36:28] concerned about it for this this woman
[2:36:30] and and she's not no one off in the
[2:36:31] scripture God got others that he wanted
[2:36:33] to bless so I I I'm looking for God to

[2:38:40] what Peter did yes he did amen praise
[2:38:43] God all right here's your here's your
[2:38:45] script scripture out of Luke 5 now I'm
[2:38:48] going to tell you something about the
[2:38:49] overflow Lord before you can experience
[2:38:52] it you got to learn how to obey
[2:38:56] that's that's
[2:38:57] it and I'm going to we going to read
[2:39:00] this out of Luke 5 because there was an
[2:39:01] overflow that happened
[2:39:05] here this the the the the the gist of
[2:39:07] this or the the the um the background is
[2:39:12] that Jesus was on the shore preaching
[2:39:15] this day and uh Peter was not a member
[2:39:18] of Jesus ch church but Peter wanted to
[2:39:22] you know he come from a situation if if
[2:39:25] I can put it this way he had a rough
[2:39:27] year in the past
[2:39:30] year he he he wasn't things wasn't just
[2:39:33] moving the way that he needed to move
[2:39:35] and he come to church that day and and
[2:39:37] when he got to church uh he was a little
[2:39:40] discouraged and uh and and the way that
[2:39:42] he approached the service according to
[2:39:44] what the the prophet tells us he sat
[2:39:46] there and he saidwell let's see what
[2:39:47] this this fell got to say
[2:39:50] I mean I you I mean it ain't it ain't
[2:39:52] might as well just hear my before I go
[2:39:54] home let me just see what this fell got
[2:39:56] to say so as as Jesus is there preaching
[2:39:59] uh all of a sudden the crowds just got
[2:40:01] greater and greater it was an overflow
[2:40:04] with the
[2:40:05] crowd crowd got greater and greater that
[2:40:08] it caused Jesus to have to ask Peter can
[2:40:12] I stand in your boat right and can I
[2:40:15] preach to the people from your boat well
[2:40:17] yeah I mean you know just a boat go
[2:40:18] ahead you can get in my boat not knowing
[2:40:21] Jesus had a
[2:40:24] plan after I dismissed this crowd I
[2:40:28] already know what you just went through
[2:40:31] last night I already know what you
[2:40:34] actually experienced last year but I'm
[2:40:37] getting ready to change the situation
[2:40:39] but you it's going to take a step of
[2:40:41] faith in order for you to get the
[2:40:43] Overflow right right right
[2:40:46] Amen Hallelujah to the Lamb of God
[2:40:49] now let's see what happens here in Luke
[2:40:53] 5 says uh and it came to pass that as
[2:40:57] the people pressed upon him to hear the
[2:40:59] word of God he stood by the lake of
[2:41:03] jasarat and saw two ships standing by
[2:41:06] the lake but the fishermen were going
[2:41:08] out of them and were washing their Nets
[2:41:12] it says and he entered into one of the
[2:41:14] ships which was Simon's and prayed him
[2:41:19] that he would Thrust out a little from
[2:41:22] the land it says and he sat down and
[2:41:25] taught the people out of the
[2:41:28] ship he says now when he had left
[2:41:31] speaking he said unto
[2:41:34] Simon launch
[2:41:36] out into the deep and when you get there
[2:41:41] let down your
[2:41:43] nets for a drought
[2:41:49] Oh Glory to God I feel like telling
[2:41:51] somebody lunch out into the deep after
[2:41:53] the day and let down your nets get ready
[2:41:56] for the drought get ready for the
[2:41:58] Overflow get ready for it get prepared
[2:42:01] for it Hallelujah they already had the
[2:42:03] Nets ready to go right so now all I need
[2:42:06] to do is get get I mean launch out and
[2:42:08] then let's get ready now watch what
[2:42:10] Peter does kind of like what my my
[2:42:12] daughter was saying you know God tell
[2:42:14] them don't doubt don't this don't worry
[2:42:16] but I'm human I'm going to worry anyway
[2:42:19] and then God just say I told you I had
[2:42:21] it look at it he said and Simon
[2:42:24] answering said unto him Master we have
[2:42:28] toiled all the night or can I say we had
[2:42:32] a rough year Lord last year amen and
[2:42:36] have taken
[2:42:38] nothing oh my God my God but watch this
[2:42:41] now
[2:42:45] nevertheless I don't feel like doing
[2:42:47] this but nevertheless
[2:42:49] at Thy word I will let down the net now
[2:42:54] he didn't say let down the net for the
[2:42:55] drought he said I'm just going to let
[2:42:57] down the net but Jesus knew what he was
[2:42:59] speaking right it says and when they had
[2:43:02] this done they enclosed a great
[2:43:05] multitude of fishes and their
[2:43:08] net
[2:43:10] [Music]
[2:43:13] break and they beckon unto their
[2:43:15] Partners now here's the beautiful thing
[2:43:17] now you you know any y'all ever went
[2:43:19] fishing and um and you get a good fish
[2:43:23] on the line maybe you got your drag a
[2:43:25] little bit too tight and all of a sudden
[2:43:26] that fish done pop the line and and it's
[2:43:29] G you don't have that good fight I mean
[2:43:31] sometime you get a good bass you can
[2:43:33] just see them coming up out the water
[2:43:34] like boy I got my got myself a good one
[2:43:36] and get all the way to the end and that
[2:43:38] thing just pop and he just go swimming
[2:43:40] away it's it's one of the most deflating
[2:43:42] feelings that that you ever ever could
[2:43:45] have when you're going fishing the net
[2:43:50] but they still caught the fish yes sir
[2:43:54] hallelujah
[2:43:56] hallelujah if I can just put it this way
[2:43:59] when God has an overflow for you come
[2:44:03] on your nets can't stop
[2:44:06] it your unbelief can't stop it nothing
[2:44:10] you can do can stop God from manifesting
[2:44:12] in your on your behalf
[2:44:16] hallelujah amen like my daughter say to
[2:44:19] going to come from
[2:44:21] somewhere I'm just going to keep walking
[2:44:23] by faith right that's the truth and
[2:44:27] there there are seasons where we go
[2:44:28] through life where you know we barely
[2:44:30] getting by but when we get to the
[2:44:32] Overflow
[2:44:34] season now we're able to give to
[2:44:36] somebody
[2:44:37] else and let me tell you something you
[2:44:39] got to have the right the right approach
[2:44:41] the right amen the right uh uh uh mental
[2:44:44] approach when it comes when it comes to
[2:44:46] the Overflow you can be self fish with
[2:44:49] an
[2:44:52] overflow you can't just be thinking
[2:44:54] about yourself when you enter the season
[2:44:56] of overflow you got to think about how
[2:44:59] you going to bless
[2:45:01] God oh Hallelujah somebody I know what
[2:45:04] I'm talking
[2:45:06] about Hallelujah you got to think about
[2:45:08] the things that you can do for God for
[2:45:09] God's people listen listen listen don't
[2:45:12] let blessings just come to you and stop
[2:45:15] let blessings come through you not just

[2:45:34] multitude of fishes in their Nets break
[2:45:37] and they beckon unto their Partners
[2:45:41] which were in the other ship that they
[2:45:44] should come and help them and they came
[2:45:48] and
[2:45:50] feel both the
[2:45:53] ships look when I'm stepping the

[2:45:59] want this to go for everybody in the
[2:46:02] church come get some of
[2:46:05] this amen and and you need to understand
[2:46:08] the reason I say now this was their way
[2:46:10] of living and providing for their family
[2:46:12] this was their
[2:46:14] business so if if the disciples could
[2:46:17] have their business

[2:46:40] get blessed as well yes sir amen that's
[2:46:42] what happens when we enter into an
[2:46:44] overflow you ought to be expecting to
[2:46:46] hire more people this year yeah
[2:46:49] other families would be blessed because
[2:46:51] of your business hey people ain't just
[2:46:54] got to work for Microsoft to be blessed

[2:47:10] says they begin to he says and it says
[2:47:13] and they should come and help them and
[2:47:15] they came and filled both the ships so
[2:47:17] that they Fe that they began to
[2:47:21] sink you talking about an
[2:47:24] overflow when Simon Peter saw it he fell
[2:47:28] down at Jesus knee saying depart from me
[2:47:32] for I'm a simple man remember his
[2:47:34] attitude was bad before the service
[2:47:36] started and now even with a bad attitude
[2:47:39] God has blessed them beyond
[2:47:43] measure let me just say it like this
[2:47:45] some of y'all sit here and you just look
[2:47:47] into one another faith sermon okay good
[2:47:49] good good faith
[2:47:50] sermon God going to override all of that
[2:47:53] and still give you a
[2:47:56] blessing you didn't even say Amen that
[2:47:58] night to the word god going to still
[2:48:00] give you something the Lord hallelujah
[2:48:03] and when he give it to you come act like
[2:48:05] Peter Lord I was sitting there
[2:48:07] criticizing I was in the seat of the
[2:48:09] scornful I I Lord that just went where
[2:48:12] my where my mind was Jesus Hallelujah
[2:48:17] but God will still give you something be
[2:48:18] like Peter look at Peter look at Peter
[2:48:20] had a bad attitude and everything but
[2:48:22] yet God blessed him and not not just a
[2:48:24] blessing drought
[2:48:28] overflow when Simon Peter saw it he fell
[2:48:30] down at jesus' knees saying depart from
[2:48:32] me I for I a sinful man oh Lord for he
[2:48:35] was
[2:48:36] astonished and all that were with him at
[2:48:39] the drought of the fishes which they had
[2:48:42] taken and so was also James and John the
[2:48:45] sons of Zebedee which were partners with
[2:48:47] Simon and Jesus said in Simon fear not
[2:48:51] and this here's the other part to the
[2:48:52] Overflow here's the other part now here
[2:48:56] y y'all ready for this one because God
[2:48:58] God God moved from the natural back to
[2:49:01] the spiritual and they got an overflow
[2:49:04] of fish in order to show what was going
[2:49:07] to happen spiritually now watch what

[2:53:00] long amen preach us right into the new
[2:53:03] year but let me just sh you this to
[2:53:05] share this quick
[2:53:06] testimony um one time I was thinking
[2:53:10] about this
[2:53:11] overflow and then you know this this
[2:53:13] this this little testimony came back to
[2:53:14] me something that happened in brother
[2:53:15] Brandon's Ministry and um
[2:53:20] we know the scripture said that we'll
[2:53:22] overflow wine and oil but there was a
[2:53:25] time that was spiritual that was talking
[2:53:27] spiritual but there was a time in
[2:53:30] brother brandom's Ministry where he had
[2:53:32] told some
[2:53:34] brothers if you go to
[2:53:37] Kentucky you will find natural
[2:53:41] oil yes sir he said you'll find natural
[2:53:45] oil if you just go to Kentucky he says
[2:53:47] what happens that the brothers just they
[2:53:48] didn't want to take it you know they
[2:53:50] actually told the prophet said well tell
[2:53:52] us exactly where it is and then we'll go
[2:53:55] get it he said no no no God don't work
[2:53:56] like that God don't work that work like
[2:53:59] that it say God show me by Vision where
[2:54:01] it is now God could tell me exactly but
[2:54:03] why would I tell that to y'all so y'all
[2:54:04] can y'all Y y'all don't put no no no
[2:54:06] sweat into it right he say you when you
[2:54:09] walk in by faith you going to put some
[2:54:11] sweat into it right right so so he he
[2:54:13] say he said no just go to Kentucky
[2:54:14] brother y y'all you will find the oil he
[2:54:17] says so they were just kind of go go
[2:54:19] sporadically and when they would go
[2:54:20] sporadically they said they would get a
[2:54:22] little bit of oil and uh he says he says
[2:54:25] uh but the order they was getting was
[2:54:28] actually oil in the
[2:54:32] Overflow so you just catching the
[2:54:34] Overflow he said but there's a main
[2:54:36] spring yes sir that leaks into the
[2:54:40] Overflow and what you want to do is tap
[2:54:42] into the main spring because if you get
[2:54:44] into the main spring my brother you
[2:54:47] won't have to worry about money for the
[2:54:49] rest of your
[2:54:51] life so he told he told said so y'all
[2:54:54] need to go down there so so they there
[2:54:55] was very uh uh uh uh just not faithful
[2:54:59] in going down there so all of a sudden a
[2:55:01] company came in from Texas and start
[2:55:03] drilling in in in Kentucky when they saw
[2:55:05] this company drilling like we better get
[2:55:07] down there we better get down there and
[2:55:08] try to do something he said brother
[2:55:10] brand said they just got they they they
[2:55:11] got to a point where they they first

[3:07:42] you you brought us through another year
[3:07:48] you allowed us to enter into this new
[3:07:53] year we enter under
[3:07:57] inspiration and encouragement and
[3:07:59] strength to our faith to believe you God
[3:08:02] for
[3:08:04] overflow for that's what you have
[3:08:07] declared and we simply say
[3:08:11] Amen it's not us it's not up to us to
[3:08:15] try to bring these things to pass but
[3:08:17] it's up to us just to receive and to
[3:08:19] walk in and do the part that you have
[3:08:21] called us to do help us to have the
[3:08:22] right motive and objective in this
[3:08:25] upcoming
[3:08:26] year we don't want to be selfish with
[3:08:28] what you do for us blessings will flow
[3:08:32] through us help us to be sensitive to
[3:08:34] the voice of God in areas where we may
[3:08:37] need to give or to help somebody let us
[3:08:41] be sensitive to those
[3:08:45] needs God you wouldn't bless this bless
[3:08:47] us with it if you didn't have a purpose

[3:09:02] online we declare the same over them
[3:09:04] that are streaming those God that were
[3:09:07] not able to be here that this would be a
[3:09:08] time a year of overflow and God the most
[3:09:11] important overflow is that what happens
[3:09:14] spiritually Lord that every every time
[3:09:17] we come together that the spirit of God
[3:09:19] would be so welcome to move in this
[3:09:22] place that the glory of God would be
[3:09:25] manifested father we uh we trust that uh
[3:09:28] you would have the preeminence in this
[3:09:31] church and we we we've heard testimonies
[3:09:34] of others like I just shared on Sunday a
[3:09:37] church that that put on a meeting and

[3:10:01] when it comes to a church we're not just
[3:10:02] looking at the price tag and and and
[3:10:04] doubting that it can happen father no
[3:10:07] you can do whatever you desire to do you
[3:10:09] can touch any heart that you want to
[3:10:11] touch and give us favor so Lord lead us
[3:10:14] and guide us and direct us to where you

[3:11:12] church and believing God that they would
[3:11:14] get a church they found a building
[3:11:18] they were asking about $900,000 for the
[3:11:20] building and the church didn't really
[3:11:23] have the
[3:11:25] money um only had maybe a couple hundred
[3:11:28] th000 but the people wanted 900,000 so

[3:14:58] shook praise God I'm looking for Moments
[3:15:01] Like That Shook moments this year amen
[3:15:05] brothers are going to come at this time
[3:15:07] um we want to turn the service uh now
[3:15:12] towards our communion our feet washing
[3:15:14] this is one of the things that the Lord
[3:15:16] restored
[3:15:17] this year for us and um we do have open
[3:15:21] communion it's for all um but as we go
[3:15:25] through the scripture what I um the
[3:15:29] scripture just tells us to examine
[3:15:30] ourselves before we would partake in
[3:15:33] communion that means if if our life is
[3:15:35] not up to par with God then we got to
[3:15:38] make sure that we get those things right
[3:15:41] before we take communion uh so we want
[3:15:44] to just read the scripture amen as it
[3:15:47] pertains uh to communion and uh we want
[3:15:50] to enter into that portion this is one
[3:15:53] of the uh ordinances or Commandments
[3:15:56] that the Lord Jesus leaves for us uh
[3:15:59] three things that he left for us to do
[3:16:00] one is water baptism uh the other is
[3:16:04] communion and uh the third is feet
[3:16:07] washing these are things that we're
[3:16:08] supposed to do until the Lord returns
[3:16:11] amen uh so I want to just uh take a
[3:16:15] moment to read the scripture and uh as
[3:16:18] it pertains to communion and
[3:16:22] um we'll go from
[3:16:25] there um turn with me to 1
[3:16:31] Corinthians chapter
[3:16:41] 11 everyone standing that can stand 1
[3:16:43] Corinthians chapter
[3:16:45] 11 in verse
[3:16:50] 23 praise the
[3:16:56] Lord 1 Corinthians 11 verse
[3:17:00] 23 says for I have received of the
[3:17:05] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[3:17:07] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[3:17:09] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[3:17:12] when he had given thanks he Breo it and
[3:17:14] said take eat this is my body which is
[3:17:17] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[3:17:19] me after the same manner also he took
[3:17:22] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[3:17:25] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[3:17:28] ye as of as you drink it in remembrance
[3:17:31] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[3:17:34] and drink this cup you do show the
[3:17:35] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[3:17:39] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[3:17:40] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[3:17:42] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[3:17:45] so again if we do this unworthy life is
[3:17:47] not where it should be with god um
[3:17:50] unworthy you're guilty the body and
[3:17:53] blood the Lord the script says this but
[3:17:55] let a man examine himself and SE that
[3:17:58] bread and for that eateth and drinketh
[3:18:00] unworthily eateth and drinketh and to
[3:18:03] himself not discer the Lord's and Paul
[3:18:07] goes on and say for this C many are
[3:18:10] weakly among you and many sleep for if
[3:18:14] we would judge we should not be judged
[3:18:17] but when we are
[3:18:30] judged we are chasing of the Lord uh
[3:18:34] that we should not be condemned with the
[3:18:35] world wherefore my brethren when you
[3:18:38] come together eat Terry one for another
[3:18:41] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[3:18:43] home that he come not together into
[3:18:45] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[3:18:49] order when I
[3:18:51] come so uh before we would enter uh this
[3:18:56] time of
[3:18:57] communion um we want to just take a
[3:19:01] moment and uh silently
[3:19:04] pray and while we're praying um I'm
[3:19:08] asking that you pray for me and uh and
[3:19:11] I'll be praying for you because we we
[3:19:14] want to make sure that the examination
[3:19:17] has been done in our own personal hearts
[3:19:19] and that we are approaching this amen
[3:19:22] sincerely um and it's and when you're
[3:19:25] taking communion you're pretty much
[3:19:26] saying I'm living the best I can before
[3:19:30] God and my brothers and sisters I'm
[3:19:32] living and following the word of God the
[3:19:34] best I can that's what you're saying
[3:19:36] when you come to take this communion
[3:19:39] amen let's pray you pray for me while I
[3:19:41] pray for you

[3:20:41] tonight uh is not round but the bread
[3:20:44] has been broken

[3:20:50] that Christ's body was broken uh for
[3:20:53] [Music]
[3:20:59] us

[3:21:44] remembrance of you as we Fellowship as
[3:21:45] it was in your presence around the
[3:21:47] communion of God's grace as we think
[3:21:49] within our own hearts that one day we
[3:21:51] were unworthy but now the blood of Jesus
[3:21:54] Christ has cleansed us from that sin
[3:21:57] that we stand together in Heavenly
[3:21:59] places in Christ Jesus this kosher bread

[3:22:05] sanctify it Lord that in the
[3:22:07] representation of your broken body the
[3:22:10] sacredness the pain the suffering that
[3:22:12] you did at Calvary when your body was
[3:22:14] broken you were wounded for our
[3:22:16] transgression you are bruised for our
[3:22:18] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[3:22:20] is upon you and with your stripes we are
[3:22:23] healed that's why we take this broken
[3:22:25] bread tonight and God bless the

[3:22:39] cup and when he had SED he said take and
[3:22:42] drink this is the cup of the New
[3:22:43] Testament as often as you do this you
[3:22:45] show forth the Lord's death till he
[3:22:47] come and as uh we
[3:22:51] hold uh in our hand tonight the wine
[3:22:55] made from the life of the grapes that's
[3:22:58] been brought together here to represent
[3:23:01] the blood of Jesus
[3:23:02] Christ there's never a time yet that I
[3:23:05] ever picked up the communion tree but I
[3:23:08] looked in there and see my sins gone I
[3:23:12] say if it hadn't been for that well
