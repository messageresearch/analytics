[37:15] minutes
[37:16] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[37:18] lord
[37:20] um
[37:21] the schoolhouse of the lord
[37:24] amen we thank god
[37:27] um
[37:29] for all that he is doing this uh
[37:32] you can do uh
[37:34] grateful for the things he's done
[37:35] display that softly
[37:37] um
[37:39] for those that are streaming
[37:42] we
[37:43] um
[37:45] realize that there is
[37:46] an issue there and
[37:48] for some reason it's just not stable
[37:50] just keeps dropping
[37:51] and
[37:52] we're not 100 sure what is the cause of
[37:56] that problem but
[37:58] um
[37:59] we ask that you do try to bear with us
[38:01] and
[38:02] uh if it doesn't work out
[38:06] we'll we'll be recording here uh anyway
[38:09] and and we'll put the
[38:11] we always put it up on on youtube so
[38:14] you'll be able to to get to it but we do
[38:17] want you to be a part of the service
[38:19] amen you
[38:20] you are a part of this journey
[38:22] amen with us so we we we thank god for
[38:25] you but just just bear with us we are
[38:27] doing all we can to ensure
[38:30] that uh the stream works and i do know
[38:33] that we are
[38:34] sharing this facility with another
[38:36] church and i'm not sure if they're also
[38:38] streaming and
[38:39] sometimes the bandwidth becomes a
[38:41] problem
[38:42] uh like that so we have to kind of work
[38:44] with the school on things like that but
[38:48] god knows all things
[38:49] amen amen i was telling the brothers i
[38:53] feel like the lord is
[38:55] making us very uncomfortable
[38:59] so that we don't feel like we need to
[39:06] praise the lord
[39:08] and and sometime we have to put some
[39:12] uh
[39:13] fasting and prayer
[39:16] with what we're trying to do
[39:18] and uh so we we want to encourage the
[39:20] church be a part of
[39:22] amen the the prayer services as you can
[39:25] i was blessed this morning
[39:27] as i pulled up hey man sister dixon was
[39:30] getting out of the car at nine o'clock
[39:32] and i want to want to put emphasis since
[39:34] the dixon was getting out of
[39:37] okay yeah yeah i heard it sticks was
[39:40] getting out of her car
[39:43] sitting in the parking lot waiting to
[39:45] see who was coming who almost here
[39:48] praise the lord
[39:55] and you know that means a lot you know
[39:57] uh those pillows that you're sitting on
[40:02] trying to make it look comfortable for
[40:04] you years ago god gave sister dixon
[40:07] the vision to put those pillars together
[40:10] so that you could
[40:12] use them for prayer
[40:13] [Music]
[40:15] but they still serve a dual purpose
[40:18] right and so we we thank god for her and
[40:21] amen we just appreciate her and uh so we
[40:24] just want to encourage the church let's
[40:26] all just try to join in together do all
[40:28] we can amen for
[40:30] this season so good to have brother
[40:32] quaker home
[40:34] praise the lord
[40:37] return from bearing his father
[40:40] and uh we're just we're just very very
[40:42] happy you know that that he made it back
[40:44] safely got a chance to do some ministry
[40:47] over there as well and and i will
[40:50] certainly uh make room for him amen
[40:52] within the next couple weeks just to
[40:54] kind of share amen with us all that the
[40:56] lord was doing so
[40:58] but we appreciate having him amen back
[41:00] home
[41:01] with us
[41:02] praise the lord
[41:04] um
[41:04] i want to
[41:06] uh
[41:07] have a
[41:08] a uh
[41:11] a little something here that i feel is
[41:13] very significant
[41:16] um
[41:18] new life is
[41:21] uh coming into our midst
[41:24] a new life
[41:26] and uh and i don't think it's by
[41:28] accident or by chance that
[41:30] uh this is happening now because i think
[41:33] it's i think it's got something to do
[41:35] with
[41:37] you know just us as a church you know
[41:39] and and i'm on the expectation but i
[41:42] want to ask amen
[41:43] uh first before i do that that song um
[41:47] uh uh
[41:50] sister amanda song
[41:53] what a friend we have in jesus lord had
[41:54] that song in my spirit all week long
[41:58] and uh yesterday we were we went to uh
[42:02] orlando we had to
[42:04] bury a man the the son of
[42:07] brother ray and sister bethany they had
[42:10] a son he was born prematurely his name
[42:12] was josiah he lived for nine days and uh
[42:16] and they had to bury him on yesterday so
[42:18] they asked me to sing a song amen for
[42:20] the for the service and and i had that
[42:22] in my spirit what a friend we have in
[42:24] jesus
[42:26] all our sins and griefs to bear what a
[42:29] privilege it is to carry
[42:32] everything to god in prayer
[42:34] and as i was thinking on that you know
[42:36] the uh the the that song was birthed
[42:38] because a man went through some
[42:40] tremendous trials
[42:42] and uh and what had happened this this
[42:44] man had found the love of his life
[42:48] and he says i'm gonna marry this lady
[42:50] and uh he you know they set their date
[42:53] to get married
[42:54] and uh
[42:56] uh just before the wedding i want to say
[42:58] days a week before the wedding somehow
[43:01] an accident occurred and this lady died
[43:04] so you know you can imagine the grief
[43:07] that he was going through and what he
[43:08] was feeling
[43:10] and
[43:11] probably thought he'd never love again
[43:12] and then
[43:13] somebody else came into his life and he
[43:15] fell in love again
[43:17] and he
[43:19] engaged this woman's gonna marry her and
[43:22] weeks before days before
[43:24] another accident occurs
[43:27] and she dies
[43:30] i believe it was after this moment the
[43:31] man
[43:32] began to think
[43:34] it's just something about the
[43:35] relationship that people back then had
[43:37] with god
[43:39] versus the relationship we have with god
[43:41] now but after this man had this
[43:43] particular trial the words came what a
[43:45] friend we have in jesus
[43:48] all our sins and griefs to bear
[43:51] what a privilege it is to carry
[43:54] everything to god in prayer
[43:58] hallelujah so the song was birthed out
[44:00] of a tremendous trial amen that he went
[44:03] through trials that he went through and
[44:05] i believe uh you know god uses things
[44:08] like that for his glory and i think even
[44:10] right now as we are i don't want to call
[44:12] it a trial i just call it a transition
[44:15] right but god is using it all for his
[44:17] glory
[44:19] i am
[44:21] sure of that
[44:22] but uh new life
[44:25] is coming into our midst
[44:28] uh
[44:29] through the union of brother josue and
[44:32] sister amanda
[44:34] praise the lord
[44:36] [Applause]
[44:41] how we thank the lord for them
[44:44] and you all know
[44:46] uh just a portion of sister amanda's
[44:48] testimony and
[44:50] uh how the enemy was attacking her with
[44:52] cancer
[44:54] a couple different times but god has
[44:56] brought healing to her body
[44:59] praise god
[45:02] and i was telling them that when you see
[45:05] uh god bringing healing like that
[45:07] there's a there's a purpose and a reason
[45:09] for this child to come forth
[45:11] a satan was fighting even before the
[45:13] child was conceived so there's a purpose
[45:16] and reason for the child to come forth
[45:18] and and then just ask this brother jack
[45:20] would you mind just praying over us and
[45:22] praying over the pregnancy
[45:24] uh that god would just keep us during
[45:26] this time so i said we sure will and i
[45:29] was going to invite them to come up at
[45:30] this time and we want to pray
[45:33] over
[45:36] them as a couple it's okay
[45:38] thank you so much
[45:41] i'm telling you joseph is ready
[45:45] and i appreciate you joseph

[46:07] we know god that the enemy was fighting
[46:11] uh time and time again to
[46:14] lord try to prevent this from happening
[46:16] but god you have a greater purpose
[46:19] thank you for your healing
[46:21] and sister amanda's body
[46:24] lord and just allowed her to get to this
[46:26] point lord that she could conceive this
[46:28] child
[46:29] father we know that you're already here
[46:32] uh in the beginning we trust that you
[46:34] would also be in the middle of the
[46:37] process
[46:38] and she carries the baby to full term
[46:41] we're claiming that there will be no
[46:43] issues
[46:45] none out of the ordinary
[46:47] and father we believe that you'll be at
[46:49] the end of the process when the child is
[46:51] delivered and comes into this world god
[46:53] give them lord all that they need to
[46:56] create a home in an environment that a
[46:58] child would be loved
[47:00] be raised in a christian atmosphere
[47:03] and i pray god that you just watch over
[47:05] them father the family as they stand
[47:07] together through this time and lord just
[47:09] ask that you would be with them we thank
[47:11] you for new life coming forth

[51:06] amen and see i i i might as well just
[51:09] release this while uh you know sometimes
[51:12] i watch little concerts and stuff like
[51:14] that and i see man they they'd be on
[51:16] stage with dude dramas
[51:18] seen dude dramas i've seen do bass
[51:20] players i've seen dude everything i say
[51:22] lord bless us but we can do doom
[51:26] amen so uh we
[51:28] got everything under control but but
[51:31] i've been a part of this little um uh
[51:33] group studying amen the book of
[51:35] revelation and
[51:36] uh in the mornings um usually seven days
[51:39] a week eight o'clock in the morning i'm
[51:40] getting on a call when i can make it
[51:43] sometimes i'm asked to teach and uh a
[51:46] lot of times i'm there listening to
[51:47] others and i am truly uh blessed by uh
[51:51] many of the things that i that i that i
[51:53] hear and uh so i'm taking us to the book
[51:56] of revelation five today uh just a
[51:59] little something that i was looking at
[52:01] while i was teaching and then i say i
[52:03] think i want to take this one little
[52:04] statement and go into a different
[52:06] direction with if i can
[52:08] and uh uh you know we'll just see what
[52:10] the lord does so i know as soon as you
[52:12] say turn to the book revelation people
[52:13] like oh my that's getting ready to be
[52:15] deep
[52:16] well maybe uh but it's for you amen and
[52:19] and i trust that the lord would just
[52:20] help us amen and just kind of sort
[52:22] through it uh here revelation uh i'm
[52:25] sorry revelation six amen that's where i
[52:27] want to read from revelation six
[52:29] verse nine
[52:31] amen revelation 6
[52:33] and verse 9.
[52:35] uh let's just start reading there
[52:38] and it says and when he had opened the
[52:40] fifth seal
[52:42] i saw under the altar
[52:44] the souls of them that were slain for
[52:46] the word of god and for the testimony
[52:49] which they held now just so that you are
[52:52] clear this scripture is speaking
[52:54] specifically about the jews
[52:57] amen is speaking speaking specifically
[52:59] about the jews
[53:02] and let me also just add well let me
[53:04] just read
[53:05] so they cried with a loud voice saying
[53:07] how long o lord holy and true
[53:09] thus thou not judge and avenge our blood
[53:12] on them that dwell on the earth so these
[53:15] people looking for revenge
[53:17] uh and verse 11 says and white robes
[53:20] this is the part that's uh that's that
[53:22] that that blesses me and i pray to be a
[53:25] blessing to you
[53:27] this is speaking about the jews white
[53:30] roads were given unto every one of them
[53:33] and it was said unto them that they
[53:35] should
[53:37] rest yet for a little season
[53:40] until their fellow servants also and
[53:42] their brethren that should be killed as
[53:44] they were should be fulfilled
[53:47] all right
[53:48] amen so that's uh
[53:50] all we want to read let's just have a
[53:52] word of prayer uh father we thank you
[53:54] for the reading of the word we also
[53:56] thank you for a prophet that has brought
[53:58] to us
[54:00] amen revelation so that we can
[54:02] understand what we read
[54:04] how we appreciate it we don't have to be
[54:06] afraid god we have clarity uh and uh so
[54:09] lord we just we we're we're grateful for
[54:12] uh these things and pray that you just
[54:14] open up our understanding and father
[54:17] i also want to just
[54:18] uh pray for the stream
[54:21] god we know that you're even involved
[54:22] with technology there's saints that are
[54:24] depending on that string and god we
[54:26] actually just work all things out you
[54:28] know all the details so god we just pray
[54:31] and we release it uh to you exit to it
[54:34] just sort through all the details and
[54:36] allow the saints to be able to enter in
[54:38] right where they are and receive the
[54:40] word of god uh satan we blind you and
[54:43] all of your attack
[54:45] and uh we just released the holy spirit
[54:47] to have its way thank you for allowing
[54:48] us to gather this place again this day
[54:50] it's in jesus name we pray amen amen you
[54:54] can be seated
[54:56] i am
[54:57] battling a man uh a little head cold uh
[55:00] so you all just bear with me here today
[55:03] uh
[55:04] just got a little stuffy nose uh but but
[55:07] just just battling that and and and it's
[55:09] it's okay i mean
[55:11] coles have been around for years
[55:13] and uh so as soon as you say something
[55:15] like that people always think covet but
[55:17] i ain't claiming covet i said it's a
[55:19] head coal
[55:20] and uh that's we're just gonna get
[55:22] through it
[55:23] uh so here i want to use the title today

[56:02] here because we're we're talking about
[56:04] accepting the pardoning grace

[56:28] and i love this amen grace is old
[56:31] grace is as old as the world is
[56:34] so as grace was first shown
[56:37] to the human race when
[56:39] uh we had the beginning of the human
[56:42] race hallelujah when the human race was
[56:45] first created in the garden of eden
[56:48] on that dark morning when that little
[56:51] woman had stepped across the separating
[56:53] line so he's going taking us back to
[56:57] genesis and we can see uh in this as he
[56:59] gives us you know just just uh just like
[57:02] a little vision of it we see uh eve
[57:06] stepping across the separating line we
[57:08] see her partaking of this tree of
[57:11] knowledge good and evil right and as she
[57:14] uh partakes of this this tree of
[57:16] knowledge uh good and evil she steps
[57:18] across the separating line so he says
[57:20] this he says uh
[57:22] on that dark morning when that little
[57:24] woman had stepped across the separating
[57:26] line and had gone against god's
[57:28] commandments and enticed her husband to
[57:32] do the same thing then the law was
[57:34] broken right and the law was the day you
[57:37] eat thereof
[57:39] the date that day you die
[57:41] right so this was the law so so when
[57:43] they when they when she partook of it
[57:45] then she introduced it to her husband uh
[57:47] this is when she crossed the line
[57:50] hallelujah hallelujah now let's go on a
[57:52] little further he says um uh the law
[57:56] must have a penalty or it isn't no law
[58:00] the law was the day you eat there that
[58:03] day you shall surely die remember the
[58:05] first judgment seat what that was upon
[58:08] the earth it was in the garden of eden
[58:11] and the last judgment seat will be upon
[58:14] the earth at the end time will be the
[58:15] white throne judgment all right says but
[58:18] when jehovah
[58:19] come down i could imagine there was even
[58:22] there wasn't even a star look at how he
[58:24] describes this there wasn't even a star
[58:26] to shine
[58:27] it was so dark in that little that light
[58:30] little garden that once was because sin
[58:33] had blotted it out
[58:35] had had taken the light from among them
[58:38] you know and and i want you to go a
[58:39] little further than just looking at what
[58:41] happened to to adam and eve but look at
[58:43] your own life hallelujah look at amen
[58:46] maybe some things that that we're not uh
[58:48] uh we're not we're not uh uh we'd be
[58:51] ashamed of let's put it that way if we
[58:52] had to tell the public what we did we'd
[58:54] be ashamed we had crossed a separating
[58:57] line
[58:58] hallelujah but the reason that you're
[59:00] sitting in the place that you're sitting
[59:02] this morning because somehow grace
[59:05] stepped in
[59:07] glory to god amen grace stepped in
[59:11] sometimes amen we found ourselves in
[59:13] amen and very dangerous situation i
[59:16] heard a brother this week talk about how
[59:18] he had many gun barrels pointed in his
[59:20] face amen but he lived to tell about it
[59:23] it's because grace stepped in when you
[59:25] think about maybe that accident that you
[59:27] could have had and lost your life
[59:29] hallelujah was nothing you did but grace
[59:32] stepped in
[59:34] grace is what delivered you grace is
[59:37] what sets you free
[59:39] hallelujah sometimes we don't realize
[59:42] that even if we're not serving god the
[59:43] way that we're supposed to serve god we
[59:45] don't realize how the grace of god is
[59:47] still protecting us the grace of god is
[59:50] still keeping us
[59:52] hallelujah
[59:54] i thank god for grace
[1:00:02] glory hallelujah amen here you know the
[1:00:05] prophet goes on and says uh
[1:00:07] uh uh uh
[1:00:09] because sin had blotted it out and taken
[1:00:11] the light from among them
[1:00:12] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:00:14] today that's what's the matter with the
[1:00:15] people today sin has blotted out the
[1:00:18] light of the living god to show that
[1:00:20] christ is still the same yesterday today
[1:00:23] and forever and he lives to save the
[1:00:25] uttermost uh to heal the lowest sick
[1:00:28] person hallelujah you know sometimes
[1:00:30] that's what happens with folk when they
[1:00:32] kind of come to church and then leave
[1:00:34] church and they back in church and all
[1:00:36] that the reason that we have an unstable
[1:00:38] life because we haven't recognized the
[1:00:39] grace of god to us right hallelujah
[1:00:43] and i'm gonna tell you when you truly
[1:00:45] recognize god's grace it caused you to
[1:00:47] want to serve him a little bit more
[1:00:49] it caused you to love him a little bit
[1:00:51] more
[1:00:52] amen but i pray this morning that the
[1:00:53] light will come on in somebody he goes
[1:00:56] on he says this oh how it was terrible
[1:00:59] that morning
[1:01:00] darkness hanging in the garden
[1:01:02] uh he says i'll imagine fog a black
[1:01:04] sackcloth i'd imagine every
[1:01:07] every leaf never moved
[1:01:09] says there was no wind stirring it was
[1:01:11] darkness and terrible because sin had
[1:01:14] blotted it out and think about it when
[1:01:16] we're in a life of sin amen we can't
[1:01:19] feel the move of god we can't feel the
[1:01:20] spirit of god we can't feel these things
[1:01:22] because sin blots it out but when we get
[1:01:24] sin corrected
[1:01:27] then you start feeling the spirit of god
[1:01:28] all over again
[1:01:30] says there came jehovah down like a roar
[1:01:32] of thunder
[1:01:33] walking through the garden crying adam
[1:01:35] where are thou
[1:01:36] notice adam didn't go looking for god
[1:01:39] but god came looking for him
[1:01:41] and there's many of us glory to god that
[1:01:44] are sitting here this morning it's not
[1:01:45] because we started looking for god but
[1:01:47] it's because god came looking for us
[1:01:50] and i'm gonna tell you when god start
[1:01:52] looking for you ain't a place you can
[1:01:53] hide on this earth
[1:01:55] hallelujah amen the best thing you can
[1:01:57] do is just surrender to his will
[1:02:00] glory hallelujah hallelujah he says adam
[1:02:03] where now that's when adam realized he
[1:02:05] was naked
[1:02:06] and had sinned before god he hid himself
[1:02:09] and tried to make himself a religion but
[1:02:11] it didn't work
[1:02:12] god killed some sheep took the skins and
[1:02:15] showed that something had to die to
[1:02:17] cover sin
[1:02:18] right joining church will never cover
[1:02:22] sin
[1:02:23] no dry out confession will ever cover
[1:02:26] sin it takes sorrow and repentance and
[1:02:30] the grace of god
[1:02:32] to cover sin three things sorrow
[1:02:34] repentance and the grace of god
[1:02:38] get that now amen you got to be sorry
[1:02:40] for what you've done
[1:02:42] when you're really sorry for it you
[1:02:43] don't go back out there to keep doing it
[1:02:45] all over again but god i'm stopping
[1:02:47] right here i'm i'm placing my steak down
[1:02:50] and i'm stopping this life of sin
[1:02:52] and i repent because i realize that
[1:02:54] these things displease you
[1:02:57] right so it takes sorrow and repentance
[1:02:59] and the grace of god to cover sin
[1:03:02] for the blood of jesus christ the one
[1:03:04] that god killed at calvary to cover sin
[1:03:06] and let me go on a little further in
[1:03:07] this message of grace it says there in
[1:03:09] the garden that morning
[1:03:11] when sin was so black jehovah came in
[1:03:14] there stood this couple standing
[1:03:16] condemned
[1:03:17] adam and eve there would be no more

[1:03:46] here to praise god the way that we're
[1:03:48] worshiping right now we had to come
[1:03:50] through adam and eve but here they are
[1:03:52] standing in a condemned state
[1:03:55] standing in in a place where they have
[1:03:58] crossed the line and now death has to
[1:04:00] enter in
[1:04:01] oh hallelujah but the grace of god
[1:04:05] intervened over on their behalf which
[1:04:08] allowed us to be here as expressions of
[1:04:11] god
[1:04:13] we're here by grace
[1:04:15] we're here by grace we live by grace
[1:04:19] hallelujah look at this go on let's go
[1:04:21] and he says says there would be no human
[1:04:23] race they had to die death on the human
[1:04:25] race
[1:04:26] give the world back to the wild beasts
[1:04:28] and there had been no human race but in
[1:04:31] the darkness of our

[1:05:13] triumph

[1:05:41] grace
[1:05:42] let's go a little further he says what
[1:05:45] could the uh what could they show to
[1:05:47] merit grace
[1:05:49] what could they show to do it the the
[1:05:51] army expression excuse it i only want to
[1:05:54] make it from my poopy here to make a
[1:05:55] point passing the book adam said the
[1:05:58] woman you you give me did it the woman
[1:06:00] said the serpent began me one laying it
[1:06:02] to another there was no hopes for them
[1:06:05] but god provided grace
[1:06:08] and it come breaking through and he said
[1:06:11] but i make a way somehow i'll save you
[1:06:14] regardless
[1:06:15] i am so happy
[1:06:17] that god saved me
[1:06:20] regardless
[1:06:23] you ought to just take a trip down
[1:06:25] memory lane
[1:06:27] some of the stuff that you got yourself
[1:06:29] into
[1:06:30] god still saved you regardless
[1:06:34] wasn't even looking at all them things
[1:06:37] grace is greater than that
[1:06:40] oh they have a song grace grace god's
[1:06:43] grace
[1:06:44] a grace that is greater
[1:06:46] than all our sins
[1:06:48] i thank god for this grace let's go on
[1:06:50] let's go and it says god provided grace
[1:06:54] uh it come breaking through
[1:06:56] and he said but i'll make a way somehow
[1:06:58] i'll save you regardless you've done
[1:07:00] wrong you've trespassed by laws
[1:07:03] you uh uh and my laws will have to be
[1:07:05] judgment from my laws will have to be
[1:07:07] executed therefore
[1:07:09] there'll be there have to be death
[1:07:11] because i've said death
[1:07:13] hallelujah so but but but what what we
[1:07:15] get from that is that
[1:07:17] god intervened and they didn't die
[1:07:19] immediately
[1:07:20] it took years before actually death
[1:07:22] settled in
[1:07:23] hallelujah they didn't die immediately
[1:07:24] but but it was god's grace that changed
[1:07:27] the situation
[1:07:28] you know grace i was looking at this
[1:07:31] uh from the the luminous software that i
[1:07:34] use sometimes they have some fun facts
[1:07:37] about grace
[1:07:38] and they say what is grace
[1:07:40] grace is god's mercy
[1:07:42] toward us even though we don't deserve
[1:07:44] it
[1:07:46] see adam and eve didn't deserve it
[1:07:49] right they they broke they broke the law
[1:07:51] there had to be a punishment for
[1:07:53] breaking that law and they didn't
[1:07:55] deserve but god gave it to him anyway
[1:07:57] god gave it to him regardless
[1:07:59] and i want you to think it wasn't just
[1:08:01] adam and eve broke the law we broke the
[1:08:03] law
[1:08:04] we broke god's law but god still gives
[1:08:06] grace regardless
[1:08:10] here's another one uh where in the bible
[1:08:12] did grace begin and here in the luminous
[1:08:14] software they say from the very
[1:08:16] beginning with adam and eve
[1:08:18] that's where grace began hallelujah god
[1:08:21] mercy towards us even though we don't
[1:08:22] deserve it it began in the garden of
[1:08:24] eden with adam and eve it says there is
[1:08:26] the evidence of god's grace says who
[1:08:28] gives grace
[1:08:30] god is the one that gives grace amen
[1:08:34] when do we when do we
[1:08:36] when do we receive god's grace when we
[1:08:39] repent of our sins and turn to him in
[1:08:42] faith we can receive grace
[1:08:46] hallelujah amen and here's here's a
[1:08:49] another one how do we receive god's
[1:08:51] grace is by putting our faith in the
[1:08:53] lord jesus christ because he was god's
[1:08:56] grace
[1:08:57] and here's the last one that i love
[1:08:59] it says why does god give grace
[1:09:04] why
[1:09:06] and they're answering the luminous
[1:09:07] software because it's part of its nature
[1:09:11] i like that that that's that tells me
[1:09:13] there's an attribute in god
[1:09:15] an attribute called grace
[1:09:17] and there takes certain circumstances in
[1:09:20] certain situations before that attribute
[1:09:22] is actually expressed and i'm so glad
[1:09:25] that he found me where i was and he
[1:09:28] expressed the attribute of grace
[1:09:31] i've accepted the pardon and grace
[1:09:34] of the living word
[1:09:36] i want to just pick up a scripture here
[1:09:38] in ephesians 2. i'm just
[1:09:40] blessed by this this thought we thank
[1:09:42] god for grace
[1:09:43] ephesians 2 verse 1. let's just read
[1:09:45] this
[1:09:48] oh glory to god
[1:09:50] amen the bible says in you
[1:09:54] hath he quickened
[1:09:56] amen who were dead
[1:09:58] in trespasses and sins now brother
[1:10:00] smiley came up here this morning and
[1:10:02] opened the service in prayer and and
[1:10:04] when he in his prayer he quoted one of
[1:10:06] the verses right out of this scripture i
[1:10:08] said ain't god good
[1:10:09] uh another thing that happened uh i was
[1:10:11] at home i guess it was friday night and
[1:10:14] and you know i was thinking about you
[1:10:15] know coming out of this fifth seal here
[1:10:18] and um and my daughter approached my
[1:10:20] daughter sarah approached me saying you
[1:10:21] know she had some questions from some
[1:10:23] lady on the job that sent her this video
[1:10:24] to watch about the seal being broken and
[1:10:27] i said oh so these people out here
[1:10:29] studying the seals
[1:10:30] i say all right well we need to look at
[1:10:32] this then it was a confirmation to me
[1:10:33] that we need to go in this direction
[1:10:35] because there's a lot of people confused
[1:10:37] out there
[1:10:38] oh my goodness
[1:10:40] oh lord just let me let me stay with
[1:10:42] they they they
[1:10:44] they got the vaccine as the mark of the
[1:10:46] beast that ain't true y'all i just have
[1:10:48] to tell you that ain't true that that is
[1:10:49] not true i'm not telling you got to take
[1:10:52] the vaccine i say that but i'm telling
[1:10:54] it's not the mark of the beast
[1:10:55] i am telling you that that anybody tell
[1:10:57] you that they are absolutely wrong
[1:11:00] brother branham didn't teach that
[1:11:02] hallelujah hallelujah hey man it's your
[1:11:04] choice what you do but don't don't don't
[1:11:07] don't say i ain't taking it because the
[1:11:08] mark of the beast don't say that please
[1:11:10] that's that's that's off the word
[1:11:13] all right let me keep going
[1:11:15] amen says and you have the quickened who
[1:11:17] were dead in trespasses and sins
[1:11:20] wherein in time past you walked
[1:11:22] according to the courses of this world
[1:11:24] that see you got to see yourself in the
[1:11:26] scripture amen according to the prince
[1:11:29] of the power of the air
[1:11:31] my the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:11:33] children of disobedience among whom also
[1:11:37] we all had our conversation in time past

[1:11:51] do i don't do no more the people i used
[1:11:54] to hang with i don't hang with them
[1:11:56] anymore
[1:11:58] something happens when you come in
[1:12:00] contact and you begin to have a
[1:12:01] relationship with jesus christ
[1:12:04] it changes your associations
[1:12:07] it changes

[1:12:10] a certain atmosphere that's come around
[1:12:12] christians and that's why i want to be
[1:12:14] around christians

[1:16:37] there dancing and i i got i'm sorry
[1:16:40] brother brad say well let's pray
[1:16:43] and at that same time there was a drunk
[1:16:45] man in the house
[1:16:47] hallelujah just got drunk as i don't
[1:16:49] know what so brother branham say let's
[1:16:51] pray and and that drunk man was in the
[1:16:53] room and laying down and brother branham
[1:16:55] was praying with the young lady outside
[1:16:56] and and uh in the living room and all of
[1:16:59] a sudden a spirit came out of that girl
[1:17:02] she don't even know how it came in
[1:17:05] she never saw it come in it came in
[1:17:07] through music
[1:17:10] through a little dance
[1:17:12] and that spirit came in and said say the
[1:17:14] spirit came up out of that girl and went
[1:17:17] straight to the room where the drunk man
[1:17:19] was
[1:17:20] now i'm going to tell you
[1:17:22] he might have been drunk but he wasn't
[1:17:23] that drunk
[1:17:26] because even a drunk man
[1:17:28] could identify that the atmosphere that
[1:17:31] changed it it's rude
[1:17:33] and now that spirit was looking for
[1:17:35] somewhere to go
[1:17:36] and that man had he had he was open to
[1:17:39] that spirit
[1:17:40] because he's under the influence
[1:17:44] so here here the man the man's man
[1:17:46] jumped up so quick ran out the house i
[1:17:48] don't know it was a spirit went running
[1:17:50] you know coming in this room it looked
[1:17:51] like a bat
[1:17:56] and this girl got it because of what
[1:17:58] she fell back into
[1:18:01] see that's why we want to be careful and
[1:18:02] see and that's why paul can say this uh
[1:18:05] in whom also we had our conversation in
[1:18:07] time past in the lust of our flesh
[1:18:10] verse 3 fulfilling the desires of
[1:18:11] deflection of the mind and we're by
[1:18:13] nature the children of wrath even as
[1:18:15] others
[1:18:16] oh my god my god my god yeah that was my
[1:18:19] testimony
[1:18:21] glory to god but this is the next verse
[1:18:24] but god
[1:18:27] but god but god
[1:18:29] see that that t-shirt my daughter
[1:18:31] created that but god
[1:18:33] see i can tell you my testimony it was
[1:18:35] this way but god delivered me god set me
[1:18:38] free yeah adam and eve should have been
[1:18:40] cut off in the beginning but god
[1:18:42] it was nothing that adam did nothing
[1:18:44] that he did but god
[1:18:48] but god who is rich in mercy
[1:18:52] for his great love wherewith he had
[1:18:53] loved us
[1:18:55] even when we were dead in sins
[1:18:58] hath quickened us together with christ
[1:19:00] by grace
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:08] no not because you did something not
[1:19:10] because you grew up in the church no by
[1:19:12] grace ye are saved
[1:19:16] [Applause]
[1:19:19] and have raised us up together and made
[1:19:22] us sit together in heavenly places in
[1:19:25] the christians i just love the scripture
[1:19:28] amen i don't have to sit in my memories
[1:19:30] i don't have to sit in my failures and
[1:19:32] in my thoughts and my mistakes i can be
[1:19:35] seated together in heavenly places with
[1:19:39] christ jesus
[1:19:41] living above sin
[1:19:45] even my thoughts are above sin my
[1:19:48] actions are above sin
[1:19:55] and i don't think i'm no higher than
[1:19:56] nobody
[1:19:58] it's just where he placed me
[1:20:04] verse 7 says that in the ages to come
[1:20:07] the reason he did this reason he showed
[1:20:09] me grace that in ages to come he might
[1:20:11] show the exceeding riches
[1:20:14] of his grace i'm a trophy of god's grace
[1:20:17] you are a trophy of god's grace
[1:20:21] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:20:23] kindness towards us through christ jesus
[1:20:24] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:20:26] and not of yourselves
[1:20:28] and i love that paul repeated it twice
[1:20:30] for by grace are you saved
[1:20:32] through faith
[1:20:34] that not of yourselves nothing you did
[1:20:36] nothing i did it is the gift of god
[1:20:41] how god gonna give you a free gift
[1:20:44] and you're gonna withhold it from others
[1:20:50] like you did something to get the gift
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:54] and then you tell other people ain't no
[1:20:55] grace for them
[1:21:01] one guy was teaching out there about the
[1:21:03] this vaccine being the mark of the beast
[1:21:05] and he said
[1:21:06] you know if you if you if you took the
[1:21:08] jab that's what he called it took the
[1:21:10] jab
[1:21:11] just pray
[1:21:12] because you you know i don't know like
[1:21:14] ain't no grace for nobody
[1:21:17] all right just you hate you just want to
[1:21:19] say you stop teaching
[1:21:24] you you just stop teaching
[1:21:28] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:21:30] and that not of yourselves it is the
[1:21:31] gift of god not of works it's not even a
[1:21:33] works
[1:21:34] but i tell you grace will produce works
[1:21:37] amen not of works lest any man should
[1:21:39] boast for we are his workmanship
[1:21:44] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:21:47] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:21:49] should walk in them i thank god for
[1:21:52] this grace i was thinking on this grace
[1:21:55] is what saved noah and his family
[1:21:58] it's the grace of god that came down and
[1:22:00] revealed the will of god of what was
[1:22:02] getting ready to happen with this great
[1:22:03] flood and grace is what saved knowing
[1:22:06] it's fair not that noah did anything you
[1:22:07] can tell noah still has sin nature in
[1:22:10] him even after he come through a flood
[1:22:13] what's the first thing he'd do when he
[1:22:15] get on the other side the man should be
[1:22:16] thanking god and i think he did set up
[1:22:18] an altar or something like that but uh
[1:22:20] but but after he finished setting up his
[1:22:21] altar you know how we do
[1:22:23] after we go to church then we go get
[1:22:25] involved in something
[1:22:29] i did my due diligence just by showing
[1:22:31] up to church now i'm gonna go out here
[1:22:33] no god don't want that type of life from
[1:22:34] nobody
[1:22:36] god won't 24 7 service
[1:22:39] amen but no one got drunk after the
[1:22:43] after coming through you know this uh uh
[1:22:45] this great flood after he goes and gets
[1:22:47] drunk the man should have just been
[1:22:49] thanking god that he made it through and
[1:22:51] his family made it they're the only
[1:22:52] human beings on the earth and he'd go
[1:22:55] get drunk
[1:22:59] it was grace that saved
[1:23:01] him and his family
[1:23:03] and i want to say this is great save
[1:23:04] save knowing his family grace gonna save
[1:23:06] me and my family
[1:23:09] grace gonna save you and your family
[1:23:13] oh i feel jesus in this place
[1:23:17] oh there's a scripture that i had and i
[1:23:19] i i meant to read it i think i am going
[1:23:21] to read it i think it's sec second
[1:23:23] corinthians uh y'all
[1:23:25] somebody might have to help me with this
[1:23:26] one uh what paul said as such were some
[1:23:29] of you
[1:23:34] thank you
[1:23:35] i just read it and i didn't write it
[1:23:37] down i thought about it and i i knew
[1:23:40] that this could happen to me i knew that
[1:23:42] this could happen
[1:23:43] that this scripture is going to come
[1:23:45] back and hear the holy spirit yeah first
[1:23:48] corinthians 6
[1:23:50] uh
[1:23:51] and nine
[1:23:52] grace save knowing his family
[1:23:56] my god my god god grace grace
[1:24:04] amen
[1:24:13] grace is what's allowing paul to write
[1:24:17] this scripture the way he's writing it
[1:24:20] and let's let's look at this i i
[1:24:22] lord jesus just let the lord have his
[1:24:24] way
[1:24:25] uh know ye not
[1:24:28] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[1:24:31] the kingdom of god that means you ain't
[1:24:33] going to heaven any way you want to live
[1:24:37] you can't do it that way you have to
[1:24:38] come god's way look it says be not
[1:24:41] deceived
[1:24:42] neither fornicators
[1:24:44] people having sex without being married
[1:24:48] right you're not going to heaven like
[1:24:50] that right nor idolaters
[1:24:53] nor adulterers
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:56] right uh nor effeminate
[1:25:00] now i want i want you to understand uh
[1:25:03] what what
[1:25:04] now let's talk about inheriting the
[1:25:05] kingdom of god effeminate is a person
[1:25:08] that's practicing homosexuality
[1:25:12] oh glory to god i'm gonna just get ahead
[1:25:14] of myself
[1:25:15] because it's not that i mean we gonna
[1:25:17] read the rest of this paul actually
[1:25:19] makes a statement says but such
[1:25:22] were some of you
[1:25:25] and what i got from that is that god can
[1:25:27] deliver
[1:25:28] a person that's in homosexuality
[1:25:31] god can deliver an adulterer god can
[1:25:34] deliver a fornicator but such were some
[1:25:38] of you
[1:25:41] so there's still hope for anybody out
[1:25:43] there who said grace can cover it
[1:25:46] grace can separate you from it grace can
[1:25:50] clean your life up
[1:25:56] don't give up on nobody
[1:25:58] i just got to share this testimony
[1:26:01] i i recently i got a a friend of mine
[1:26:05] whose daughter had you know taken a a a
[1:26:08] alternative lifestyle and
[1:26:10] and um
[1:26:12] and the daughter the lord started
[1:26:13] dealing with her heart her and her
[1:26:14] partner
[1:26:15] both of them got their hearts dealt with
[1:26:18] god started dealing with them and and uh
[1:26:21] and the the they were
[1:26:23] trying to figure out some things and
[1:26:25] and uh they asked this minister to
[1:26:27] baptize them i mean this
[1:26:29] the partners asked the minister of the
[1:26:30] baptism like okay i i
[1:26:33] i'm not sure about this
[1:26:35] uh i'll uh i'll do it but before i do it
[1:26:37] i need to sit down and talk to you
[1:26:41] so they you know sat down and just
[1:26:43] explained what baptism is all about you
[1:26:45] know it's about that that old man being
[1:26:48] buried in the water and rise into the
[1:26:50] newness of life and walking according to
[1:26:53] the word of god
[1:26:54] so so so so so the minister just began
[1:26:57] to talk and say you know
[1:26:58] um
[1:26:59] this love that y'all have for each other
[1:27:02] is a perverted love
[1:27:05] it's a perverted love that you have for
[1:27:07] each other and that's not the love that
[1:27:08] god wants you to have and saying what
[1:27:11] god's gonna have to do is he have to
[1:27:12] take that love from you so you're gonna
[1:27:14] as you go through this process of
[1:27:15] baptism you're gonna start feeling god
[1:27:17] take that love those desires he's going
[1:27:19] to start taking that from you
[1:27:22] and uh and and and and and the partner
[1:27:24] said just start breaking broke down in
[1:27:26] tears so you know god already started
[1:27:29] that process
[1:27:32] we don't we don't do the things we used
[1:27:34] to do see this is this is when god is is
[1:27:37] is doing something things change
[1:27:41] you when you become a christian you
[1:27:42] don't live the same old
[1:27:45] when you come in contact with grace and
[1:27:48] grace is a person
[1:27:51] his name is jesus
[1:27:55] oh god help me
[1:27:57] but here when paul says that some of you
[1:28:00] were effeminate that means that there
[1:28:02] were some people practicing those
[1:28:03] lifestyles but were delivered
[1:28:07] so if you got a loved one that's in that
[1:28:08] condition they can be delivered
[1:28:14] let me keep reading
[1:28:17] no effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[1:28:19] with mankind
[1:28:21] nor thieves let me stop there
[1:28:24] because i was looking at this in the in
[1:28:25] your mind you think somebody's just
[1:28:27] stealing you know and and and god god
[1:28:30] steve isn't gonna make it to heaven but
[1:28:32] when you look at it in this particular
[1:28:34] verse it's not just talking about
[1:28:36] somebody stealing
[1:28:37] it's actually talking about somebody in
[1:28:39] the pulpit
[1:28:41] that's actually abusing the people
[1:28:44] and taking advantage of the people
[1:28:47] right abusing their power
[1:28:50] they're stealing from the people
[1:28:55] if you just click on that word in the
[1:28:56] greek dictionary you'll find it it's
[1:28:58] talked about somebody that's in the
[1:28:59] pulpit actually stealing
[1:29:03] stealing with the the abuse of their
[1:29:05] power over the people
[1:29:07] and there's many churches out there i
[1:29:09] mean you know
[1:29:10] they they they rule the people in fear
[1:29:14] oh my god
[1:29:16] i mean you know if a person decides that
[1:29:19] they don't want to come to the church
[1:29:20] anymore the first thing they say they
[1:29:21] went out from us because they were not
[1:29:23] of us
[1:29:25] they abused it and then they make
[1:29:27] everybody afraid to leave the church
[1:29:31] hallelujah you don't want your you don't
[1:29:32] want to be called out when you leave oh
[1:29:35] my god
[1:29:37] right amen see this is an abuse of power
[1:29:39] who who god is ordained to be there in
[1:29:42] the church they're gonna be there and
[1:29:44] sometimes folk may come for a season and
[1:29:46] they have to leave for another season
[1:29:48] but may come back for another you just
[1:29:50] keep showing the love of god
[1:29:54] but when we look at thieves
[1:29:57] in this verse we're talking about people
[1:29:59] standing behind the pulpit abusing the
[1:30:01] people
[1:30:03] and you know a thief won't enter in
[1:30:10] northeast nor covetous
[1:30:13] nor drunkards
[1:30:14] nor revilers
[1:30:16] nor extortioners and i'm just you know
[1:30:18] i'm laying all this out because i'm
[1:30:19] gonna say this while i got a
[1:30:22] chance to say it we're gonna need help
[1:30:25] with all that we're doing here and i'm
[1:30:27] looking for some some brothers to rise
[1:30:29] up and help i need that we're gonna need
[1:30:31] the help but i can't use you
[1:30:35] if you ain't living right
[1:30:42] i can't use you
[1:30:45] hey man
[1:30:47] right i mean we got to have a standard
[1:30:49] when it comes to people singing in the
[1:30:51] church we only want people that's got a
[1:30:53] life now i'm not talking about you
[1:30:54] making a mistake here and there all of
[1:30:56] us go through things like that but but
[1:30:58] i'm talking about you you you living
[1:31:00] ungodly
[1:31:01] and you know you living ungodly
[1:31:04] you're gonna leave here and then go pull
[1:31:05] up get a cigarette soon as you get out
[1:31:07] no no no no no no or you're gonna go get
[1:31:09] a drink no
[1:31:11] no
[1:31:13] you want to know probably the the the
[1:31:15] the most potent thing i drink
[1:31:17] soda
[1:31:21] praise the lord
[1:31:22] but now this is what and here the
[1:31:24] scripture is telling no re no no no
[1:31:26] coverages nor drunkards
[1:31:28] nor revilers and say well i don't drink
[1:31:30] to get drunk
[1:31:33] you probably don't even know if you're
[1:31:34] drunk
[1:31:35] and your body got so used to drinking
[1:31:38] it's a truth in the eye you can absorb a
[1:31:40] lot now
[1:31:42] somehow you got down that path
[1:31:45] but the grace of god want to stop that
[1:31:48] it's the truth and how great the god
[1:31:50] will take that from you
[1:31:52] amen
[1:31:53] nobody violence nor extortionists
[1:31:56] shall inherit the kingdom of god and
[1:31:57] this is the diversity level and such
[1:31:59] were some of you
[1:32:02] but you are washed
[1:32:05] but ye are sanctified
[1:32:08] and here's a here's another one ye are
[1:32:10] justified you know what that means just
[1:32:13] as if i never beat it
[1:32:18] what did that for you the grace of god
[1:32:20] did that for you
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:23] but you justified in the name of the
[1:32:26] lord jesus
[1:32:27] and by the spirit
[1:32:29] of our god all things are lawful unto me
[1:32:31] but all things are not expedient
[1:32:34] all things are lawful for me but i will
[1:32:36] not be brought under the power
[1:32:39] of any i don't want any of those
[1:32:41] influences in my life to bring me
[1:32:42] underneath the power of it i want to be
[1:32:44] free from that i thank god for it it was
[1:32:46] grace that saved noah and his family and
[1:32:48] i just wanted to inject even if you got
[1:32:50] family members that's tied up in some of
[1:32:51] these scriptures grace will step in and
[1:32:54] deliver them as well i don't care what
[1:32:55] they tied up in
[1:32:57] i don't care what they're tied up and
[1:32:59] grace can deliver
[1:33:02] grace is what saved abraham and his seed
[1:33:07] you see when abraham got down there with
[1:33:09] abimelech and gave his wife over to
[1:33:11] abimelech and had no sense of doing
[1:33:13] anything he shouldn't have done nothing
[1:33:14] like that but when he gave gave his wife
[1:33:16] over and told told a lie that this is my
[1:33:19] sister the man getting ready to take
[1:33:21] this take this woman making his wife and
[1:33:23] he was thinking about having children
[1:33:24] from her both of them live abraham and
[1:33:27] sarah lied but but god gave a dream to
[1:33:29] bim like i said don't touch that man
[1:33:31] don't touch his wife he said i thought
[1:33:33] they both said it was a sister they said
[1:33:35] no i know what he said but i i don't
[1:33:38] touch him and i want you to go and have
[1:33:39] him pray for you because he's my prophet
[1:33:41] god didn't even call him a liar god
[1:33:43] called him his prophet
[1:33:45] hallelujah i want to tell you it's
[1:33:47] because god was looking through the eyes
[1:33:50] of grace
[1:33:53] how does he see you this morning
[1:33:56] how does he see me this morning when he
[1:33:58] looks through the eyes of grace he sees
[1:34:00] me as a son he sees you as a daughter of
[1:34:03] god
[1:34:07] i thought about this a little bit more
[1:34:10] christ
[1:34:11] was the living word when he walked on
[1:34:13] the earth
[1:34:15] and and and and we have this scripture
[1:34:17] of the woman that was
[1:34:19] caught in adultery
[1:34:21] there in john chapter 8 and and i won't
[1:34:23] i won't take time to read all of that um
[1:34:25] well maybe maybe we can catch a little
[1:34:27] bit uh john 8 verse 1.
[1:34:30] oh hallelujah
[1:34:32] he was the living word at this time he
[1:34:35] was the manifested word of god
[1:34:38] hey glory
[1:34:40] and see she had to accept grace through
[1:34:42] the living words
[1:34:45] hey man
[1:34:47] amen here you know um the verse verse 1
[1:34:50] and john 8 says jesus went unto the
[1:34:53] mount of olives
[1:34:55] and early in the morning he came again
[1:34:57] into the temple
[1:34:58] and all the people came unto him and he
[1:35:00] sat down and taught them in the scribes
[1:35:03] and the pharisees brought unto him a
[1:35:06] woman
[1:35:07] taking an adultery and and i just you
[1:35:09] know can you imagine this this is an
[1:35:11] interruption
[1:35:12] of the service
[1:35:14] this is an interruption all the people
[1:35:16] gathered want to hear jesus
[1:35:18] preach and hear the scribes and
[1:35:19] pharisees these are religious leaders
[1:35:21] they interrupt the service
[1:35:24] and they brought unto him a woman taken
[1:35:26] in adultery
[1:35:27] and when they had set her in the midst
[1:35:30] just imagine them just dragging her
[1:35:32] through the door and just sitting right
[1:35:34] down here and
[1:35:37] all eyes are on her
[1:35:40] imagine you being that woman
[1:35:44] and all the eyes are on you right there
[1:35:46] in in in in jesus presence and and here
[1:35:49] you know they say uh uh now moses in the
[1:35:52] law they taking them to the word oh my
[1:35:55] god
[1:35:56] moses and the law commanded us
[1:35:59] that such should be stoned but what say
[1:36:02] is thou
[1:36:04] look at it now
[1:36:06] and notice now and the bible's just kind
[1:36:08] of giving us a man amen some inside
[1:36:11] information discernment of spirit this
[1:36:13] they said
[1:36:16] tempting him that they might have to
[1:36:18] accuse him but jesus stooped down and
[1:36:22] with his finger wrote on the ground as
[1:36:24] though he heard them not ignoring
[1:36:27] everything they were saying
[1:36:29] ignoring the entire situation that is
[1:36:31] before but look at this so when they
[1:36:33] continued asking him he lifted up
[1:36:35] himself and said to them he that is
[1:36:37] without sin among you let them cast let
[1:36:41] them first cast a stone at her
[1:36:43] what wisdom
[1:36:48] verse eight says and again he stooped
[1:36:49] stooped down and wrote on the ground and
[1:36:51] they which herded a man being convicted
[1:36:54] by their own conscience went out one by
[1:36:57] one beginning at the eldest even until
[1:36:59] amen the last and jesus was left alone
[1:37:03] and the woman standing in the midst i
[1:37:05] just love this
[1:37:07] see what you just saw happen here was
[1:37:09] grace entered into this this lady's
[1:37:10] situation
[1:37:12] she was an adulterer
[1:37:14] and she should have died but grace
[1:37:17] stepped in
[1:37:19] and see there are some things that we
[1:37:20] have done we should have died for
[1:37:23] but grace has stepped in
[1:37:27] amen
[1:37:30] verse 10 says when jesus had lifted up
[1:37:32] himself and saw none but the woman he
[1:37:34] said and her woman
[1:37:36] where are those down accuses
[1:37:39] hath no man condemn thee
[1:37:42] she said no man lord and jesus said unto
[1:37:44] her neither do i condemn thee go and sin
[1:37:48] no more not not what he says i'm not
[1:37:50] excusing you from what you just did
[1:37:53] see grace don't come in to washington
[1:37:55] allow you to go right back out and keep
[1:37:56] doing the same old thing all over again
[1:37:59] no grace wants you to stop what you was
[1:38:00] doing when you come in contact with
[1:38:02] grace because grace is a person this
[1:38:05] lady came in contact with the person of
[1:38:08] grace
[1:38:09] his name is jesus
[1:38:12] i can guarantee you this much had she
[1:38:14] gone out and kept sinning
[1:38:17] it would have been a different story
[1:38:20] see don't don't don't make grace
[1:38:25] a disgrace
[1:38:29] oh i just love the lord can i go a
[1:38:31] little further
[1:38:33] you know
[1:38:34] as i thought just on this this this
[1:38:35] woman here you know and and john 8 i
[1:38:38] also talk about thought about the woman
[1:38:39] in in luke 7. i won't read her story but
[1:38:42] you know she's the woman that that uh
[1:38:44] was not invited to the party
[1:38:47] and as she come to the party amen she
[1:38:49] saw jesus sitting there with unwashed
[1:38:52] feet
[1:38:52] with dirty feet and actually saw jesus
[1:38:54] sitting in the closet she said i can't
[1:38:56] believe that nobody washed his feet i
[1:38:58] can't believe they let them sit there
[1:39:00] unattended too and she went and got all
[1:39:03] of her earnings from living this ungodly
[1:39:05] lifestyle and she went and bought a
[1:39:07] perfume glory to god and uh and when she
[1:39:10] she used all the money to buy this
[1:39:11] perfume then she somehow snuck into the
[1:39:14] party and when she got to the party
[1:39:16] jesus just so happened to be sitting in
[1:39:18] a position where she could break a box
[1:39:21] glory to god pour her perfume out on his
[1:39:23] feet and begin to wash those feet with
[1:39:26] her tears glory to god and and the bible
[1:39:29] she didn't have a towel like the fish
[1:39:30] foot the foot once uh foot washed flunky
[1:39:33] with a head of top all she could use to
[1:39:35] dry his feet was her hair
[1:39:39] jesus say your sins are forgiven
[1:39:43] i want you to know that when that woman
[1:39:45] did all of that
[1:39:46] she didn't realize
[1:39:48] that grace was about to step in in her
[1:39:50] situation
[1:39:54] sometimes we get to a place where can't
[1:39:56] nobody else help us
[1:39:58] but grace
[1:40:04] grace
[1:40:05] has to be accepted
[1:40:07] in the living words i want to read a
[1:40:09] little a couple things here
[1:40:11] and uh we'll turn this corner and
[1:40:14] we'll go on from there
[1:40:17] brother branham
[1:40:19] when he preached the marriage of
[1:40:20] marriage and divorce and i was telling
[1:40:22] you all on wednesday night that uh
[1:40:25] there was a uh five sermons that brother
[1:40:27] branham preached and i don't remember
[1:40:29] them all but i know marriage and divorce
[1:40:31] was one and who is this melchizedek was
[1:40:33] another uh but uh they went to a middle
[1:40:36] school
[1:40:37] in
[1:40:38] jeffersonville and they preached he
[1:40:40] preached that series of five sermons so
[1:40:42] you know brother brianna went to middle
[1:40:44] school and preached and there was
[1:40:45] purpose for him being at the middle
[1:40:47] school i thought it was quite
[1:40:49] uh special for us to come to a middle
[1:40:51] school
[1:40:52] somebody said y'all should've went to
[1:40:53] the high school no we came to the middle
[1:40:55] school
[1:40:56] amen and and like i said on wednesday
[1:40:59] it's they designed this room just for us
[1:41:03] storage
[1:41:05] nursery
[1:41:06] office
[1:41:10] chairs everything everything just
[1:41:12] designed for this season
[1:41:14] for us
[1:41:16] amen i i know god i know god loves me i
[1:41:19] know that
[1:41:20] i told the church on wednesday night
[1:41:21] that i never wanted to actually go to
[1:41:23] school to have to do the setup and
[1:41:24] breakdown set up and break down but you
[1:41:26] know no they told us that nobody has
[1:41:28] used this room for the last year and a
[1:41:29] half
[1:41:30] so that means we really don't have to
[1:41:32] break down that much
[1:41:33] now i want to also just mention to you
[1:41:36] that as soon as i said that on wednesday
[1:41:37] somebody came on thursday i'm gonna
[1:41:39] start using the room
[1:41:41] ain't got no students
[1:41:42] but just want to use the room
[1:41:45] who y'all think that is
[1:41:49] but let's just show some grace
[1:41:55] but in marriage and divorce
[1:41:57] when brother branham preached it
[1:41:59] there is a law element of marriage and
[1:42:01] divorce that is so strict
[1:42:04] that if it's not handled correctly we
[1:42:07] have no preachers
[1:42:09] it's the truth anyhow
[1:42:11] when you really look at the scripture
[1:42:12] now we'll have no preachers because if a
[1:42:15] preacher lose his hair
[1:42:17] he's not supposed to preach
[1:42:19] i'm just telling according to scripture
[1:42:21] right so brother branham brother branham
[1:42:24] you know comes and he brings this truth
[1:42:25] to us to to get us back to the word we
[1:42:28] have to stand with the words stay stay
[1:42:31] solidly with the word hallelujah but in
[1:42:34] the end at the end of marriage and
[1:42:35] divorce there was a grace element
[1:42:38] that came into marriage and divorce and
[1:42:40] and most people missed the grace part
[1:42:42] they caught the law apart but they
[1:42:44] missed the grace
[1:42:46] see hearing this innocence in the cell
[1:42:48] that's the story of the woman that they
[1:42:50] brought to jesus they had the law moses
[1:42:53] in the law said
[1:42:55] oh good god almighty but grace was
[1:42:58] standing in the form of a person and
[1:43:00] what that woman did she walked in the
[1:43:03] revelation of grace that came to her
[1:43:05] she accepted the pertinent grace
[1:43:08] that came through jesus
[1:43:10] because the other people want the stoner
[1:43:12] i'm going to tell you something you have
[1:43:13] to accept the part and grace
[1:43:16] of the living word
[1:43:19] brother branham brought a living word
[1:43:21] even in marriage and divorce he brought
[1:43:23] a living word and and people have to be
[1:43:25] able to accept the partnering grace
[1:43:27] that is in the living word
[1:43:29] now that don't mean everybody just do
[1:43:31] whatever they want to do i ain't saying
[1:43:32] that
[1:43:34] hallelujah ain't saying that right amen
[1:43:37] there's still some things we got to work
[1:43:38] through in scripture glory to god but
[1:43:41] but but i am saying there is a grace
[1:43:43] element it's not all law there is a
[1:43:45] grace element there now let's look at
[1:43:48] this
[1:43:48] brother branham got accused
[1:43:51] of a a by a woman preacher
[1:43:55] because of the grace that he brought
[1:43:58] in marriage and divorce and this is out
[1:43:59] of the message it is rising of the sun
[1:44:02] and um
[1:44:03] it says as in the marriage and divorce
[1:44:08] case
[1:44:10] as in the marriage and divorce case the
[1:44:13] other day
[1:44:15] when the holy spirit
[1:44:17] had had told me that i come and said
[1:44:20] just what he told me what happened he
[1:44:22] was in the mountain praying and the
[1:44:23] spirit of god just going up and down the
[1:44:25] mountain and told him go tell the people
[1:44:28] that they're caught in this condition
[1:44:30] because of misinterpreted theology he
[1:44:32] said he says now uh he says go pretty
[1:44:35] much he says go and don't teach your
[1:44:36] children never to do nothing like that
[1:44:38] he says i'm gonna let you stay in the
[1:44:40] conditions you are
[1:44:41] misinterpreted theology caused the
[1:44:43] people to get into conditions grace came
[1:44:46] out and said i'm gonna let you stay the
[1:44:47] way that you are but don't teach your
[1:44:49] children never to do nothing like this
[1:44:53] so brother branham said that based on a
[1:44:55] supernatural experience from the angel
[1:44:57] of god look at this says as a marriage
[1:44:59] divorce case the other day when the holy
[1:45:00] spirit told me
[1:45:02] that i come and said it just the way he
[1:45:05] told me some minister lady gave me a
[1:45:07] right
[1:45:08] sharp little balling out
[1:45:13] first of all minister lady don't sound
[1:45:15] right
[1:45:17] but she had to correct the prophet
[1:45:19] said she she said i guess you take the
[1:45:22] place of god
[1:45:25] i said no ma'am
[1:45:27] said well you told them their sin is
[1:45:30] forgiven said where say only god has
[1:45:34] power
[1:45:35] he said see
[1:45:36] another pharisee
[1:45:41] i said you see that you might know
[1:45:44] just to kind of get put back in the
[1:45:46] scripture that you might know that jesus
[1:45:48] told peter and the apostles after he had
[1:45:50] the revelation of who he was he told
[1:45:52] them thou art the christ the son of god
[1:45:55] he said blessed up thou see son of jonas
[1:45:58] flesh and blood never reveal this to you
[1:46:00] but my father which is in heaven has
[1:46:02] revealed it upon this rock i'll build my
[1:46:04] church the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:46:06] against it and i give unto thee the keys
[1:46:09] what whatever you bind on earth i
[1:46:12] abounded in heaven what you loose on
[1:46:14] earth
[1:46:16] and it just left it right there for
[1:46:18] what you loose on earth out loose in
[1:46:19] heaven pretty much the church had the
[1:46:21] power to bind and loose
[1:46:24] that was matthew 16 that he was quoting
[1:46:28] let me see uh
[1:46:30] i'm going to this quote it says
[1:46:33] that's the divine revelation of the word
[1:46:35] made flesh
[1:46:37] if it was flesh in that day by the son
[1:46:41] jesus met this woman a man that was
[1:46:43] accused of adultery and uh and he and he
[1:46:46] forgives us it was the word was made
[1:46:48] flesh in jesus
[1:46:50] we gotta we gotta bring it forward now
[1:46:52] we gotta bring it forward i'm turning
[1:46:54] the corner but you got to stay with me
[1:46:55] because the word is still made flesh i i
[1:46:57] i ain't got the quote but i can tell you
[1:46:59] right now brother branham said the word
[1:47:00] that was made flesh in christ has now
[1:47:03] become our flesh
[1:47:08] glory to god says that's the divine
[1:47:10] revelation of the word made flesh it was
[1:47:13] if it was flesh in that day by the sun
[1:47:15] the groom is fleshed today by the bride
[1:47:19] see whosoever says you remit to them
[1:47:21] they are remitted whosoever says you
[1:47:23] retain to them they are retained now the
[1:47:26] catholic church picked that picked up
[1:47:27] picked that up and takes it to their
[1:47:29] priests but that's carnal watch it was a
[1:47:32] spiritual it was the spiritual
[1:47:35] a word
[1:47:37] that did it
[1:47:39] that's the reason
[1:47:40] he told them to go baptize in the name
[1:47:42] of the father son of the holy ghost he
[1:47:44] knowed
[1:47:45] they knew
[1:47:46] who he was
[1:47:48] the spiritual revealed word
[1:47:52] is what's providing the grace
[1:47:55] i want to say that again it's the
[1:47:57] spiritual revealed word
[1:48:00] that's providing the grace and you have
[1:48:01] to be able to accept
[1:48:04] the pardoning grace
[1:48:07] of the living word
[1:48:11] now
[1:48:12] let me just
[1:48:13] switch back over
[1:48:16] oh my to revelation 6.
[1:48:20] bear with me
[1:48:22] verse 9 through 11.
[1:48:26] oh jesus
[1:48:41] we read revelation 6 verse 9 through 11.
[1:48:44] we're talking about the fish seal
[1:48:47] um
[1:48:48] just
[1:48:49] a quick highlight when we're looking at
[1:48:51] the seals
[1:48:53] uh
[1:48:53] especially when we get to the fifth seal
[1:48:55] the the church ages are now over
[1:48:58] the first four seals actually deal with
[1:49:00] all seven church ages the first four
[1:49:03] seals have included all seven church
[1:49:05] ages and after the church ages are over
[1:49:08] god's no longer dealing with the gentile
[1:49:10] people now he begins to deal with the
[1:49:12] jews
[1:49:13] and this is where we pick up the jews
[1:49:15] that their time is coming here and
[1:49:16] revelation 6 verse 9 through 11. so a
[1:49:19] lot of times when we read the book of
[1:49:21] revelation this is why it's so important
[1:49:23] it's one thing to read your bible
[1:49:24] nothing wrong with that i think that's
[1:49:26] great i read my my bible i've been
[1:49:28] reading it for uh uh over 20 years and
[1:49:31] i've been on a bible reading plan every
[1:49:32] year and i've read the bible through and
[1:49:34] through over 20 years the problem is
[1:49:36] that you're running to things and
[1:49:37] reading your bible you're running to
[1:49:38] things that you cannot understand
[1:49:40] and you're gonna need somebody to give
[1:49:42] you some instruction so most people
[1:49:44] they'll start going to google
[1:49:46] and they'll look here they look there
[1:49:47] and like this you know the door this
[1:49:49] this lady my daughter uh uh sent over a
[1:49:52] little link to us and listening to this
[1:49:54] man teaching on the scene all like this
[1:49:55] man so far off he said donald trump was
[1:49:57] the antichrist i say i don't believe
[1:49:59] that i just you know and he said if it's
[1:50:02] not donald trump it's probably donald
[1:50:03] trump jr he don't know who it is
[1:50:06] and then he said he said if it's not
[1:50:07] them to i got somebody else but i'm just
[1:50:09] not saying it yet we're not following
[1:50:11] nothing like that we we want to know we
[1:50:13] want to know thus saith the lord
[1:50:16] right don't give me none of that it
[1:50:17] could be the incident could not i don't
[1:50:19] want none of that i got thus saith the
[1:50:21] lord through a prophet
[1:50:22] right so so when you come to try to
[1:50:24] understand scripture you have to take
[1:50:26] some source
[1:50:27] i choose to take a vindicated prophet as
[1:50:30] my source
[1:50:33] amen so when i'm when i'm when i'm
[1:50:35] reading to you out of revelation i can
[1:50:37] go back to what the prophet said and
[1:50:38] give you what what what it is and i can
[1:50:40] show you that there's things that's
[1:50:41] already happened there's things
[1:50:43] happening now and there's things that
[1:50:44] will happen in the future and when you
[1:50:46] read the bible let me especially when
[1:50:47] you read the book of revelation let me
[1:50:48] just drop this in it is not like reading
[1:50:51] any other normal book
[1:50:58] revelation 6
[1:51:01] does not come after revelation 4.
[1:51:06] let me know i'm sorry revelation
[1:51:07] revelation 5
[1:51:09] it don't come after in your bible it do
[1:51:12] but the events surrounding it don't come
[1:51:14] after it like that
[1:51:16] hallelujah hey man then you got to be
[1:51:18] it's a it's a puzzle and you got to pick
[1:51:20] this piece up and pick this piece up and
[1:51:23] pick that p and put it all together in
[1:51:25] order to get the puzzle right that's why
[1:51:27] i was written mysteriously like that and
[1:51:29] it take a profit to reveal what is there
[1:51:34] because if you try to put it all linear
[1:51:36] you'll be all lost like this like this
[1:51:39] this man i want i ain't gonna call his
[1:51:41] name i just i just we pray for the
[1:51:43] brother that's all i can say
[1:51:45] but but but uh i want to just show
[1:51:49] if i was to go back and read it because
[1:51:51] we picked up when the fifth seal fifth
[1:51:53] seal but there was four other seals
[1:51:54] before that all those four seals deal
[1:51:56] with the church ages
[1:51:59] it deals with us and let me tell you we
[1:52:02] we are in laodicea but we're not leo the
[1:52:04] sians
[1:52:06] we are the bride living in laodicea
[1:52:09] but this church age is not over it won't
[1:52:11] be over until we leave
[1:52:14] all right let me go a little further all
[1:52:15] right
[1:52:17] oh god help us here i'm i'm winding up
[1:52:20] um so when we're looking at the seal
[1:52:23] especially this this fifth seal we're
[1:52:25] looking at hey man this is not the bride
[1:52:28] uh this is the jews that god is dealing
[1:52:31] with at this time amen this is the jews
[1:52:34] uh there's many reasons why we can we
[1:52:37] can see this and i'm i'm trying not to
[1:52:39] get too deep into this but i'll just say
[1:52:41] when the first four says there was a
[1:52:42] beast that rose up and said come and see
[1:52:45] but when we got to the fifth seal there
[1:52:47] was no beast that rose up and said come
[1:52:49] and see what those beasts were were
[1:52:51] actually the cherubim
[1:52:53] my god hallelujah the cherubim is what's
[1:52:56] when adam and eve got kicked out of the
[1:52:58] garden of eden the cherubim blocked
[1:53:00] their entrance from coming back into it
[1:53:03] but in this hour the cherubim are
[1:53:06] pointing the way through the reveal
[1:53:08] world
[1:53:09] come and see
[1:53:13] hallelujah
[1:53:15] so you have to be able to accept pardon
[1:53:17] and grace as it's coming through the
[1:53:20] living world
[1:53:22] watch this now let's go a little further
[1:53:24] here we see this heavenly scene these
[1:53:26] souls under the altar
[1:53:29] are jews that were killed for the word
[1:53:30] of god and for the testimony they held
[1:53:33] and brother branham said they were you
[1:53:34] know when the jews rejected christ at
[1:53:36] the cross they said let his blood be on
[1:53:38] us and upon our children they had
[1:53:40] self-fulfilling prophecy years later
[1:53:42] underneath stalin underneath eichmann on
[1:53:44] the lease underneath hitler their
[1:53:46] children suffered simply because they
[1:53:49] were jewish believers
[1:53:52] they were slain for the word of god and
[1:53:54] the testimony which they held pull up
[1:53:55] verse verse nine uh revelation six times
[1:53:58] i'm just referring to this i'm not i'm
[1:54:00] i'm giving you a a overview and i know
[1:54:03] it's like before we just don't worry
[1:54:05] don't worry you have something you can
[1:54:06] go back and and feast on and when you're
[1:54:08] listening to the seals it'll make sense
[1:54:11] to you glory to god amen uh and and
[1:54:14] verse 10 says and they cried with a loud
[1:54:17] voice saying how long o lord holy and
[1:54:19] truth dost thou not judge and avenge our
[1:54:20] blood on them that dwell on earth so
[1:54:22] here they're they're looking to get
[1:54:23] revenge for all the suffering that was
[1:54:25] done right and uh uh but here the bible
[1:54:28] says and white robes were given unto
[1:54:31] every one of them and it was said unto
[1:54:33] them that they should rest yet for a
[1:54:35] little season until their fellow
[1:54:36] servants also and their brethren that
[1:54:38] should be killed as they were should be
[1:54:40] fulfilled now i want to just kind of
[1:54:42] inject
[1:54:43] just a couple things white robes
[1:54:46] were given
[1:54:48] unto them these were jews that went
[1:54:51] through the tribulation period they
[1:54:53] received their white robes on the other
[1:54:55] side of the tribulation period
[1:54:58] but i want i want i want you to know
[1:55:00] something that we as the bride
[1:55:03] already had
[1:55:04] our white robes
[1:55:07] oh glory and the way that we got our
[1:55:10] white robes i'm gonna read it for you in
[1:55:11] a sec in a second the way that we got
[1:55:14] our white robes is because we accepted
[1:55:16] the pardoning grace that came through
[1:55:19] the living word
[1:55:22] oh glory glory glory now watch this
[1:55:25] let's just read a couple things here i
[1:55:26] i'll show it to you
[1:55:28] amen
[1:55:29] i'm reading from the fifth seal
[1:55:32] i'm reading from the fifth still i want
[1:55:33] you to understand that when the jews
[1:55:36] say let his blood be on us and on our
[1:55:38] children when they rejected christ at
[1:55:40] the cross grace was coming in at that
[1:55:43] time
[1:55:44] for the gentiles
[1:55:47] the reason you hear today
[1:55:49] is because god blinded the eyes of those
[1:55:51] jews
[1:55:52] so they could not recognize him as
[1:55:55] savior
[1:55:56] as messiah the reason you sit in church
[1:55:58] today is because of what god to the jews
[1:56:01] that what god allowed to happen to jews
[1:56:03] that was god's grace coming to the
[1:56:06] gentiles don't make grace a disgrace
[1:56:12] i want to read something out of fifth
[1:56:13] seal this says
[1:56:15] notice now
[1:56:18] i want you to watch this real close
[1:56:22] they were given
[1:56:24] robes that's what we just read they were
[1:56:25] given ropes it says they were given
[1:56:27] robes they didn't have them
[1:56:30] they were given ropes they didn't have
[1:56:32] them they were giving rose white robes
[1:56:34] each one of them it says now the saints
[1:56:38] already have one
[1:56:41] us we already have one now the saints
[1:56:43] already have one he says they get it
[1:56:46] here
[1:56:48] but here they were given robes and the
[1:56:51] saints already had theirs and going on
[1:56:54] that means they they was raptured away
[1:56:56] it said seeing go no see and had not
[1:56:58] seen they had not a chance because they
[1:57:00] were blinded by god their own father so
[1:57:03] that the grace of god
[1:57:06] could be fulfilled so the bride could be
[1:57:10] took away from the gentiles is that
[1:57:12] right by grace are ye
[1:57:16] saved and i want to i'm gonna go a
[1:57:18] little further by grace you have been
[1:57:21] introduced to a message
[1:57:27] this ain't got nothing to do with you
[1:57:29] you can be that good
[1:57:32] but by grace you've been brought to a
[1:57:35] message a revealed word for this date by
[1:57:39] grace
[1:57:41] think about the plaza that we was in and
[1:57:43] all the churches that was in that plaza
[1:57:46] but by grace we were there with the
[1:57:49] revelation that we had when we come here
[1:57:51] to the school is by grace
[1:57:54] that we're still walking underneath the
[1:57:56] revealed word of god
[1:58:02] i've accepted the pardoning grace
[1:58:07] through the reveal word
[1:58:11] i'm i'm i'm finished with that quote i
[1:58:13] don't let's see what paragraph okay 229.
[1:58:16] um
[1:58:17] i'm i'm going to an insane uh sermon i'm
[1:58:20] going down to paragraph 432 it might be
[1:58:22] a little off might be 4 31 for you of
[1:58:24] 433 i'm not sure but you'll find it in
[1:58:26] that 430 area
[1:58:28] uh brother branham said the saints get
[1:58:30] theirs here so what had happened
[1:58:33] as the holy spirit was opening up this
[1:58:36] uh this revelation of the fifth seal to
[1:58:38] the prophet just showing them what it
[1:58:39] was all about and and every day
[1:58:41] supernaturally the angel of god would
[1:58:43] come in and reveal to him what the seal
[1:58:45] meant
[1:58:46] every day right so uh uh there's many
[1:58:49] that picked up the bible reading like
[1:58:51] you know like the one
[1:58:53] this just i'm back to this guy again i
[1:58:55] can't get away from it get in my spirit
[1:58:57] sometimes you can't listen to stuff
[1:58:59] just get in your spirit this man said in
[1:59:01] the first seal the rider took his bow
[1:59:03] and shot an arrow he said that was the
[1:59:05] coronavirus
[1:59:09] in the vaccine you know he's oh he said
[1:59:11] that was a vaccine his arrow was the
[1:59:13] vaccine when you read the bible my
[1:59:16] brother
[1:59:17] he had a he had a bow
[1:59:23] but he don't have arrows
[1:59:26] this is what the prophet told us he has
[1:59:28] a bow but no arrow so that is not the
[1:59:30] vaccine
[1:59:32] that's not the rider of the of the in
[1:59:34] the seal there that's not it and they
[1:59:37] try to be so deep and people so confused
[1:59:40] but we got a prophet we got to reveal
[1:59:42] word we ain't got to be confused by none
[1:59:44] of this
[1:59:45] not afraid afraid of any of it
[1:59:49] amen a vaccine is very very common
[1:59:53] i don't know when did it become so
[1:59:55] uncommon i've traveled overseas many
[1:59:57] times i had to take a vaccine
[1:59:59] i got no problem with that
[2:00:01] hey man it's a choice every and i'm not
[2:00:03] going to take nobody's choice from them
[2:00:05] you got a choice you got four choices
[2:00:08] you got modern
[2:00:10] you got
[2:00:10] pfizer you got johnson and johnson or
[2:00:14] you can choose not to do it
[2:00:19] it's your choice
[2:00:21] praise the lord
[2:00:23] amen and i ain't gonna let none of that
[2:00:24] stuff divide a church
[2:00:28] i'm gonna let none of that divide no
[2:00:30] church
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:34] don't don't look down on nobody because
[2:00:36] they didn't get the one you got off or
[2:00:38] they didn't get it at all don't do that
[2:00:39] don't let the devil get in like that you
[2:00:41] you made your decision let them make
[2:00:43] their decision
[2:00:44] amen praise god
[2:00:46] amen if they choose not to do it that's
[2:00:48] fine
[2:00:49] praise god god's still protecting us all
[2:00:51] it's the grace of god
[2:00:53] amen amen
[2:00:55] all right but but but brother branham
[2:00:57] was as the angel lord was revealing
[2:00:58] these things to him i'm coming too close
[2:01:01] uh the angel showed him that this group
[2:01:04] in in in revelation 6 the fifth seal
[2:01:07] says this was jews because there was
[2:01:09] many uh bible teachers that thought it
[2:01:11] was the bride he said no it's not the
[2:01:13] bride they had already left they left
[2:01:15] after the fourth uh the fourth seal
[2:01:17] right they left they left they left
[2:01:19] after the seven turkeys was over they
[2:01:20] left they went into a rapture but now
[2:01:22] god is dealing with the jews
[2:01:24] when we look at this from the fifth seal
[2:01:26] sixth seal we're looking at god dealing
[2:01:27] with the jews
[2:01:29] now
[2:01:30] while he was meditating on that god
[2:01:32] showed him a little vision took him back
[2:01:34] in his mind and showed him a vision and
[2:01:37] he says uh and this is why i make the
[2:01:38] statement they already got theirs they
[2:01:41] got it here that's why i said it say the
[2:01:44] church the bribe they got it here they
[2:01:45] didn't have to get a rope here in in
[2:01:48] this verse verse 10 say they received
[2:01:50] the robe i believe it was in verse 10.
[2:01:52] uh uh is that right uh verse
[2:01:54] i'm sorry verse 11. and white robes were
[2:01:56] given unto every one of them and it was
[2:01:58] said unto them that they should rest yet
[2:01:59] for a little season so they were given
[2:02:01] robes during the tribulation period my
[2:02:04] god but here the bride had already
[2:02:06] received their robes their white robes
[2:02:10] and brother branham said the angel lord
[2:02:12] just kind of showed him saying now that
[2:02:13] was for the jews but my people already
[2:02:15] had him god took him to a vision
[2:02:18] and in a vision he was in heaven
[2:02:21] and this is where he met his his little
[2:02:22] daughter
[2:02:23] hallelujah glory to god uh she died as a
[2:02:28] baby
[2:02:29] and uh and there she was 20 years old
[2:02:31] and she walked and said god bless you
[2:02:33] daddy say daddy say yeah i'm your sharon
[2:02:36] rose that was on earth with you know
[2:02:38] when you lost man a little bit i'm your
[2:02:40] sheriff say oh my he say she said here
[2:02:42] in heaven ain't no little babies up here
[2:02:44] daddy ain't no little baby say saying
[2:02:47] then his wife coming to him god bless
[2:02:49] you my brother all these saints came up
[2:02:50] to god bless my brother and all the
[2:02:53] saints was dressed in white robes
[2:02:56] glory to god amen
[2:02:59] all the saints were dressed in white
[2:03:00] robes and they began to have a little
[2:03:02] conversation with the angels saying i
[2:03:04] want to see jesus
[2:03:05] he's saying say now you can't see him
[2:03:07] he's a little bit higher another
[2:03:08] dimension that he was in you can't get
[2:03:10] it but he will come to you one day he
[2:03:12] will judge you for the things that you
[2:03:13] preach he says it's paul here said yeah
[2:03:16] paul said all the people that paul
[2:03:18] preached who are they here yes they're
[2:03:19] here will paul have to be judged what he
[2:03:21] preached
[2:03:23] yes paul got to be judged what he
[2:03:25] preached he says i preach
[2:03:27] the same
[2:03:28] thing that paul preached and he said
[2:03:31] millions screamed out
[2:03:33] we're resting on that
[2:03:36] [Applause]
[2:03:41] and i'm crazy enough to believe that i'm
[2:03:42] one of the millions
[2:03:45] that was saying we're resting on that i
[2:03:47] i i'm i'm so happy you preached the same
[2:03:50] thing paul preached
[2:03:51] because i come from god and i'm gonna
[2:03:53] make it back to god on this revealed
[2:03:56] word
[2:03:59] [Applause]
[2:04:02] look at this
[2:04:04] in this message the fifth seal this is
[2:04:06] where the angel just began to
[2:04:07] uh after he showed him all these things
[2:04:09] this way he makes the statement
[2:04:12] he says now notice
[2:04:14] but i was just thinking as his precious
[2:04:15] godly brother john
[2:04:18] i just thought it'd be good place to
[2:04:19] inject that just before closing
[2:04:22] see if john looked over there
[2:04:25] and then was of his brethren
[2:04:28] see his brethren that had to suffer a
[2:04:30] little then see the lord god permitted
[2:04:33] me so john in the book of revelation is
[2:04:35] looking at his brother and john is
[2:04:36] caught up in the isle of patmos looking
[2:04:38] at this vision unfold for a future event
[2:04:41] it says god allowed john to see his
[2:04:43] brethren now look at what brother brown
[2:04:44] said god also allows me to see
[2:04:47] he permitted me to see
[2:04:49] my brethren
[2:04:50] and the saints that were waiting for the
[2:04:52] coming of the lord
[2:04:55] notice they were not under the altar of
[2:04:57] sacrifice mine wasn't
[2:05:00] but these was they were martyrs see mine
[2:05:03] wasn't under the martyr's altar now i
[2:05:06] want you to listen real close and i'll
[2:05:08] close honest just about in 10 minutes at
[2:05:10] 10 o'clock says if i just have to cut it
[2:05:13] off and finish it tomorrow look they
[2:05:15] were not the ones that that that the
[2:05:18] ones that the lord showed me the bride
[2:05:20] she was not under the martyr's block
[2:05:23] she's not identified here in revelation
[2:05:25] 6 verse 9 through 11 fifth seal she's
[2:05:27] not identified there see she was not
[2:05:29] under the martyr's block no the
[2:05:31] sacrifice all to the martyrs look at
[2:05:33] what he says
[2:05:35] but had received white robes
[2:05:38] by accepting
[2:05:41] the pardoning grace
[2:05:44] of the living
[2:05:46] word
[2:05:48] she got her white robe
[2:05:51] because she was able to accept
[2:05:53] the part and grace
[2:05:55] of the living word
[2:05:57] and it just came to me i didn't think
[2:05:58] about this till right now
[2:06:01] adam and eve
[2:06:03] got a white covering
[2:06:06] lamb skin

[2:06:56] message in this hour special word that
[2:06:58] he's given us and this is not something
[2:07:00] to be just
[2:07:02] trampled on
[2:07:05] if i could just put it this way god gave
[2:07:06] you his best
[2:07:10] when he brought to you the full
[2:07:12] revelation
[2:07:13] you know and in in in in abraham's day

[2:07:17] full revelation of what was getting

[2:07:31] to happen no we don't have to worry
[2:07:32] about being here but if you want to miss
[2:07:35] it

[2:07:38] the pardon and grace
[2:07:40] that come through the living word
[2:07:45] there's a story
[2:07:49] um
[2:07:50] this you can try to try to search it
[2:07:52] like this grace was promised in the
[2:07:54] garden of eden
[2:07:56] and grace came just look for that and
[2:07:58] that i'm going to be
[2:07:59] at the message of grace
[2:08:01] there was a story of a of a young man
[2:08:04] that was
[2:08:06] um in a cell
[2:08:10] and his friend thought he was wrongly
[2:08:11] accused and should not have been in jail
[2:08:13] for what he did and
[2:08:15] and and and he went running to the
[2:08:17] president so and just for the man to be
[2:08:19] able to get audience for the president
[2:08:21] was a miracle he got run to the
[2:08:22] president explain the story to the
[2:08:23] president
[2:08:24] president didn't have time to get his
[2:08:27] letterhead he just took took his
[2:08:29] signature sign on the paper and said
[2:08:30] pardon
[2:08:33] so the friend was so excited i got a
[2:08:35] word from the president my friend
[2:08:36] getting out of jail today boy i'm
[2:08:38] running and he ran to the jail as soon
[2:08:40] as he could i got told the jail i got
[2:08:43] something signed from the president uh
[2:08:45] my friend can be pardoned so he uh you
[2:08:47] know he he he went to the friend and in
[2:08:49] the cells like look i got something
[2:08:51] signed from the president you can be
[2:08:52] pardoned you ain't got to worry about
[2:08:53] this you're going to go free friend
[2:08:55] looked at the little sheet of paper
[2:08:57] didn't see no letterhead from the
[2:08:58] president
[2:08:59] they say this thing from the president
[2:09:01] why you come mess with me at a time like
[2:09:03] this man you know i'm getting ready to
[2:09:04] die why don't you mess with me like that
[2:09:06] they took him i executed him
[2:09:09] then the president found out about why
[2:09:10] they execute that guy i thought after i
[2:09:12] signed an apartment from why they do
[2:09:13] that and they had to come up with a new
[2:09:15] statement
[2:09:17] that said pardon
[2:09:19] is not a pardon
[2:09:21] unless it's received
[2:09:26] and i'm telling you i'm walking in
[2:09:28] the grace i've accepted
[2:09:31] the pardon and grace that has come to me
[2:09:34] in the living word
[2:09:38] just like that woman that was accused of
[2:09:40] adultery she did it
[2:09:44] but when she came in contact with grace
[2:09:47] she didn't go to do it no more
[2:09:50] look at this last quote
[2:09:52] the grace
[2:09:53] was promised in the garden of eden and
[2:09:55] grace came
[2:09:58] grace to adam and eve
[2:10:01] nowhere to go
[2:10:03] know which way to turn
[2:10:05] and yet grace

[2:10:48] in this dark hour
[2:10:50] if you'll just accept it

[2:11:51] shouldn't have been in
[2:11:53] but grace protected us
[2:11:55] grace kept us
[2:11:58] think about
[2:12:02] lord jesus needing a savior because of
[2:12:05] how much sin we found ourselves in and
[2:12:07] how grace stepped in and
[2:12:10] made the difference

[2:12:14] god even when it comes to this revealed
[2:12:16] word that we have an opportunity to

[2:16:32] [Music]
[2:16:38] [Applause]
[2:16:39] amen
[2:16:42] i just want to take this moment
[2:16:46] and uh just share
[2:16:48] what the lord just
[2:16:50] shared with gave me
[2:16:52] he's preaching on this grace
[2:16:57] and uh
[2:16:59] he made mention of the vaccine and how
[2:17:03] people are trying to avoid
[2:17:05] the market obese
[2:17:08] so they're running
[2:17:09] and
[2:17:10] and instead of
[2:17:13] see you see sometimes your focus can be
[2:17:15] wrong
[2:17:16] a good offense
[2:17:18] is a good defense or should i say a good
[2:17:20] defense is a good offense
[2:17:22] okay
[2:17:23] so don't focus on avoiding
[2:17:26] the mark
[2:17:28] because see if you focus on the seal of
[2:17:30] god
[2:17:31] which is the grace
[2:17:34] then you won't have to worry about the
[2:17:35] mark
[2:17:37] see
[2:17:38] adjust your focus don't don't focus on
[2:17:40] what the devil is doing focus on what
[2:17:42] god is doing
[2:17:44] so he preached on the took this message
[2:17:47] of grace and talked about it from the
[2:17:48] fifth seal
[2:17:50] [Music]
[2:17:52] and in revelation 9 it says
[2:17:56] and the fifth angel sounded
[2:17:58] and i saw it start fall from heaven unto
[2:18:01] the earth and it was to him that was uh
[2:18:03] of to the earth and to him was given the
[2:18:06] key to the bombless pit
[2:18:08] and he opened the bottomless pit and
[2:18:10] arose a smoke out of the pit as the
[2:18:13] smoke of a great furnace in the sun and
[2:18:15] the air was darkened by reason of the
[2:18:19] smoke of the pit
[2:18:21] and it came
[2:18:23] out
[2:18:24] of this of the smoke locust upon the
[2:18:26] earth and up and unto them was given the
[2:18:29] power
[2:18:31] as the scorpions of the earth's earth
[2:18:34] have power now i appreciate a while ago
[2:18:36] about this locus that that the prophet
[2:18:39] had told me that how the the leaves of
[2:18:41] the trees are the fellowship of the
[2:18:43] saints
[2:18:44] and how people are churches are being
[2:18:46] divided because of this vaccine and all
[2:18:49] of these different things and i just
[2:18:50] appreciate how he brought that out about
[2:18:52] i won't let it divide a church
[2:18:54] see that's what the devil is trying to
[2:18:56] do he's trying to divide and conquer
[2:18:58] amen
[2:19:00] now i want to go on i want to say here
[2:19:02] and it came out of the locust upon the
[2:19:04] earth and unto them was given the power
[2:19:06] and as the scorpions of the earth and
[2:19:08] her power and
[2:19:10] the fourth verse
[2:19:12] and it was commanded them that they
[2:19:14] should not hurt the grass of the earth
[2:19:17] neither any green thing neither any tree
[2:19:20] but
[2:19:22] only those men
[2:19:24] which have not
[2:19:26] the seal of god
[2:19:28] in their foreheads
[2:19:30] that's revelation
[2:19:33] 9
[2:19:34] 4
[2:19:36] what's today's date
[2:19:41] september 4th
[2:19:43] [Music]
[2:19:44] 5th i'm sorry today's the 5th
[2:19:46] september 5th amen so uh
[2:19:51] i believe there's some relevance to it
[2:19:53] amen i believe there's some relevance to
[2:19:56] it
[2:19:57] and
[2:19:58] and to them
[2:19:59] it was given that they should not kill
[2:20:02] them
[2:20:03] but they
[2:20:04] but but that they should be tormented
[2:20:08] five months in their torment of the
[2:20:09] torment of scorpions when they strike
[2:20:12] like it's a man
[2:20:13] so my whole point i thought it was the
[2:20:15] fourth i'm sorry
[2:20:17] that just took my whole thing away
[2:20:20] amen
[2:20:21] but what i'm saying don't focus on
[2:20:24] the mark of the beast focus on the seal
[2:20:28] of god
[2:20:30] because truly i believe it was the grace
[2:20:33] is the grace and the whole matter the
[2:20:35] grace in the thing is the only way to
[2:20:36] have that seal of god is by receiving
[2:20:40] the grace that god has given us in this
[2:20:43] hour and and it just touched my heart
[2:20:45] when he said what is that grace now we
[2:20:48] have grace
[2:20:49] he when he when he when he saved when he
[2:20:52] saved me from sin
[2:20:53] when he when he when he when when when
[2:20:55] when he
[2:20:56] took marijuana away from me
[2:20:59] when he when he saved me from the
[2:21:01] accident
[2:21:02] but the greatest thing was when he
[2:21:04] revealed this message
[2:21:12] and gave me something you know i didn't
[2:21:14] i didn't choose or just but i
[2:21:16] what was it about me that i believed so
[2:21:18] many people struggled to believe this
[2:21:19] message
[2:21:21] struggled to believe it it wasn't hard
[2:21:23] for me to believe it
[2:21:26] so there was something on the inside
[2:21:28] there was a deep calling out
[2:21:32] something made a connection
[2:21:36] something made a connection in my heart
[2:21:38] to what
[2:21:39] what was happening that made it relevant
[2:21:41] that made it live
[2:21:43] it was real it was right now it wasn't
[2:21:47] it gave the bible relevance
[2:21:51] into my life and into the to today
[2:21:55] i would it was it no longer was a book
[2:21:57] of history
[2:21:58] but it was a book of right now
[2:22:01] amen you love the lord
[2:22:05] amen y'all pray for me amen
[2:22:07] i i was um
[2:22:09] [Music]
[2:22:11] over at the wedding with my son
[2:22:13] and uh there was a relevance to the date
[2:22:17] of his
[2:22:19] uh wedding and and
[2:22:21] and the lord just gave me a scripture
[2:22:23] relevant to that date and uh
[2:22:26] amen
[2:22:27] and i said lord you're doing this again
[2:22:29] amen
[2:22:30] so uh
[2:22:31] but i believe it's still uh uh needed
[2:22:35] amen
[2:22:36] amen so let us pray amen
[2:22:40] most gracious heavenly father
[2:22:44] lord god i thank you
