[28:21] here and worry about that
[28:23] so the doctor came in and he said well
[28:26] mrs capers
[28:27] i think we'll send you home it's okay
[28:31] so some of the nurses that was waiting
[28:33] on they said you wouldn't do much better
[28:35] at home you don't want to go to rehab
[28:38] and when we got home oh we had got so
[28:41] many phone calls
[28:42] for home health service i said look at
[28:45] god
[28:46] you know and also i did get help
[28:51] and even when they came they looked at
[28:54] me
[28:55] oh lady you had open heart surgery
[28:58] we don't need to be here you're doing so
[29:01] well
[29:03] we don't see patients like you much you
[29:06] know and all but
[29:07] uh like i say i just thank the lord for
[29:11] for bringing me through because actually
[29:12] really i want to share just a little bit
[29:14] how it started
[29:16] with me i thought i was having heartburn
[29:19] real bad and i didn't know
[29:22] so i stopped my
[29:26] doctor and uh she gave me a prescription
[29:30] for heartburn
[29:32] and she said i think that might be where
[29:34] the deals so before i left out the
[29:36] office she said well
[29:38] you know she said let me tell you this
[29:40] she said women's symptoms of heart
[29:43] attack is a lot different from a man
[29:45] and i said well i do know a little about
[29:48] that
[29:48] so she said um
[29:52] mrs cable she said if you uh
[29:56] have this episode again she said i want
[29:58] you to go to the emergency room
[30:01] so i think that was on a wednesday
[30:04] yeah it was on a wednesday we got home
[30:08] and i said well honey
[30:09] i said well i feel all right maybe we
[30:11] get ready to go to church
[30:13] i went let's get myself ready
[30:17] i had just took a little quick shower
[30:18] that i told
[30:20] wham but this thing hit me like
[30:24] a bum and i was in the bathroom and i
[30:27] said oh god
[30:28] and i was having some chest burning
[30:30] burnt burning
[30:31] shoulder breasts sweating and i said
[30:34] lord if i
[30:35] ever need you i need you now
[30:39] help me lord now i need you
[30:43] so i called brookhaven he was in the
[30:45] kitchen
[30:47] you know he came and i told him how i
[30:48] was feeling
[30:50] so when i did i took one of the uh
[30:53] the things for the heartburn that doctor
[30:55] had gave me
[30:56] and it helped it eased it off a little
[30:58] bit i went and got in bed
[31:02] and i went to sleep i slept all night i
[31:05] didn't have any more problems
[31:07] i got the next day and then eventually
[31:10] it did start again
[31:12] so um i said i don't want to go in the
[31:16] emergency room
[31:17] i don't want to go to the hospital
[31:20] but anyway i said no lord i guess i
[31:23] better go
[31:24] i went on and i'm glad i did it because
[31:27] they kept me there for quite a few hours
[31:29] they did all kinds of tests on me and
[31:31] everything blood work blood pressure all
[31:33] that stuff
[31:34] so um way after a while the doctor came
[31:37] back in and he said
[31:38] well mrs cable he said that uh
[31:42] we are going to tell you that your ekg
[31:45] came back
[31:46] you had a heart attack i looked at me
[31:49] like
[31:50] are you crazy
[31:53] what he said yes ma'am he said you had a
[31:57] slight heart attack
[31:59] i just couldn't believe it so he said
[32:02] well we're gonna have to send you over
[32:04] to
[32:04] londwood over in fort pierce that's the
[32:06] big medical center where they do heart
[32:08] surgery
[32:10] and so he said that well we are
[32:14] have to send you by ambulance because
[32:16] your husband can't drive you
[32:18] so they did they sent me my ambulance
[32:20] and everything and took me over there
[32:22] and everything and also
[32:24] um that's the way i stayed until all
[32:27] this happened
[32:28] what they had to do the surgery and
[32:30] everything and all and uh
[32:33] uh like i said it was telling me that
[32:35] the different arteries i had blah
[32:37] one time they thought about doing a
[32:38] stint but the arteries that they were
[32:41] looking at they said
[32:42] no we got to do a bypass
[32:45] and that's okay all right lord

[37:10] find light in every room

[37:19] what else will you build me
[37:39] praise the lord certainly appreciate the
[37:42] lord jesus for
[37:43] touching our sister capers and
[37:47] just bringing her through this this this
[37:49] procedure and
[37:51] it's the many testimonies that came out
[37:53] of it i was telling you all that many of
[37:54] the young
[37:55] nurses would it wouldn't even be an
[37:57] eighth floor but they want to go up to
[37:59] see where brother and sister campus were
[38:01] because they just appreciate seeing how
[38:04] he was just
[38:05] there for his wife and just a real
[38:08] example of what a husband's supposed to
[38:09] be
[38:11] sometimes god allows us to go through
[38:13] things like this so we can be a
[38:14] testimony
[38:16] to somebody so some folk might not come
[38:18] to church
[38:20] but you being the church can go to where
[38:22] they are
[38:23] all right so we thank god for everything
[38:25] that he allows us to go through it all
[38:27] works together for his good
[38:29] as she was testifying and reminding me i
[38:31] heard earlier this week from sister irma
[38:33] scott she had called me to say pastor i
[38:36] had hip surgery and
[38:37] i got a report from the doctor the
[38:39] doctor told me that i am
[38:40] healing faster than anybody he's seen
[38:43] heal
[38:43] [Music]
[38:45] um so it's a common thread
[38:49] and i just believe before you before you
[38:51] let them touch you
[38:52] surgery sometimes is necessary but
[38:54] before you let them touch you have
[38:55] somebody pray over you
[38:57] before they touch you right and uh you
[39:00] just never know maybe god will touch you
[39:01] before the doctors touch you
[39:03] like he did for sister branham so we
[39:05] just thank god for all things
[39:07] amen i um i want to
[39:10] um just let me give the announcements
[39:13] and
[39:13] and a couple of things there
[39:16] and we'll kind of just move on in the
[39:20] service
[39:21] the lord is good amen um
[39:24] so wednesday night we'll be streaming
[39:28] service through twitter and facebook so
[39:30] keep that in mind
[39:31] and then uh sister's prayer will be on
[39:34] this tuesday
[39:35] at 7 30 and um we are doing
[39:38] our back-to-school backpack distribution
[39:41] on saturday july 31st
[39:43] here at the church it'll start at 10 a.m
[39:45] and anyone that would like to be a part
[39:47] of that we want to give flyers out
[39:50] to some of the people here just maybe at
[39:52] the store and you know the other store
[39:54] across the way and
[39:55] let these churches know about it and
[39:57] they can bring their kids but we have a
[39:59] number of backpacks that we want to give
[40:00] away just to try to be a blessing
[40:03] to the to the children of going back to

[53:59] working behind the scenes for quite some
[54:01] time and
[54:02] and uh yesterday they they he he shocked
[54:05] us
[54:05] shocked her real good uh and uh
[54:08] you know we're grateful but to me was
[54:10] very significant because
[54:12] um 13 years old
[54:17] all of my girls when they reached age 13
[54:21] i did something with all of them uh
[54:24] we bought them promise rings amen
[54:27] and um and that was a promise that they
[54:30] would keep themselves until they get
[54:31] married
[54:33] and yesterday when uh brother aaron was
[54:35] sliding on his ring before he could
[54:36] slide it on
[54:38] this one had to come off
[54:44] so i told him that i i cherish that
[54:47] and uh it means a lot to me and uh
[54:51] and i'm i'm just so happy uh that um
[54:54] my brother aaron is coming to life and
[54:56] and made a difference
[54:58] and uh we're just praying for them and i
[55:00] and i want you i want you all to hear
[55:02] this from
[55:03] me um in the bible
[55:08] what did rebecca do when she met isaac
[55:15] i will go so
[55:20] i don't want anybody i don't want
[55:23] anybody
[55:25] interfering with what god's plan is
[55:30] and that's from either side right i told
[55:34] them i want them to be led of the lord
[55:36] uh you got two ministries that you're
[55:39] part of
[55:40] and very fruitful and successful
[55:42] ministries
[55:43] so uh let god be the one that does what
[55:47] god does
[55:48] and uh and just leave it all in god's
[55:50] hand but don't don't
[55:51] don't don't get in the way of god just
[55:54] pray for him and
[55:55] amen release him into the care of the
[55:57] lord and uh we know that if god
[56:00] calls her to go then the other thing i'm
[56:02] expecting that god gonna have somebody
[56:04] that will replace her right
[56:08] so y'all just watch the hand of the lord
[56:10] he he at work he at work
[56:12] and we give him all the glory and all
[56:13] the praise in advance so
[56:15] amen amen the lord knows what she means
[56:18] to us but i will never put pressure
[56:20] on on them in that way i want god to be
[56:23] the one to do it so
[56:24] i want to make sure the rest of the
[56:26] church know my heart so i don't want to
[56:27] hear anybody saying
[56:29] or someone so told me this so

[1:04:38] trip originally we came here for aaron
[1:04:41] and just to support him but it turned
[1:04:43] out to be
[1:04:45] just to preach so we're just
[1:04:48] thankful for that philippians the third
[1:04:50] chapter in the 13th verse and then
[1:04:53] after that we just want to turn to
[1:04:54] revelations 10
[1:04:56] verse 7 amen brethren
[1:05:00] i count not myself to have apprehended
[1:05:02] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[1:05:04] things which are behind
[1:05:06] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:05:08] which are before
[1:05:10] i press towards the mark for the prize
[1:05:12] of the high calling
[1:05:14] of god in christ jesus let us therefore
[1:05:16] as many as be perfect
[1:05:18] be thus minded and if anything you be
[1:05:20] otherwise minded god shall reveal
[1:05:22] even this unto you god shall reveal this
[1:05:28] even this unto you then revelations the
[1:05:31] 10th chapter and the seventh verse
[1:05:33] i just want to turn there quickly but in
[1:05:35] the day
[1:05:37] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:05:39] he shall begin to sound
[1:05:42] the mysteries of god should be finished
[1:05:45] as he had declared it to his servants
[1:05:49] the prophets we just want to speak on
[1:05:51] this little thought
[1:05:52] for a few minutes here on moving forward
[1:05:56] in the promise moving forward in the
[1:05:57] promise let's just bow our heads
[1:05:59] shortly here heavenly father lord we
[1:06:01] just come before you this morning lord
[1:06:03] not to
[1:06:04] lift ourselves up or to to say some nice
[1:06:07] words and
[1:06:08] that are going to tickle our ears father
[1:06:09] but we come lord it's to worship you
[1:06:11] lord we come to just
[1:06:13] magnify your name father that's what
[1:06:14] it's about this morning it's not about
[1:06:17] us lord but it's all about you father
[1:06:19] and we ask lord that you would just come
[1:06:20] lord anoint this
[1:06:21] this word father lord jesus and just
[1:06:24] anoint
[1:06:25] us just to speak father anoint the here
[1:06:27] is lord to receive father
[1:06:29] we're thankful for that this morning
[1:06:31] jesus name amen
[1:06:34] amen you can be seated amen
[1:06:38] moving forward in the promise
[1:06:41] i believe we're living in an age where
[1:06:43] every believer
[1:06:45] must come to a place of decision
[1:06:46] everyone is
[1:06:48] is going to come to this place where
[1:06:50] they must make a decision and the world
[1:06:52] is looking to the left and the world is
[1:06:53] looking to the right and
[1:06:55] and politics are going down hollywood's
[1:06:57] going down everything is going down
[1:06:59] and the world is looking to things
[1:07:01] around them but i believe that this
[1:07:03] bride is not looking at
[1:07:04] what's around them but the bride is
[1:07:06] looking what's in front of them the
[1:07:07] bride is looking to move forward
[1:07:10] and i believe that it's time to make a
[1:07:12] decision it's not you know everyone has
[1:07:13] a choice we're living in an age where
[1:07:15] everyone is having a choice you know
[1:07:17] you have the um lg t
[1:07:20] something something that you have then
[1:07:22] they all have a choice each one of us
[1:07:24] have a choice
[1:07:25] and you either have a choice to move on
[1:07:27] or you have a choice to go back
[1:07:28] you have a choice to either to keep
[1:07:30] serving christ and to
[1:07:31] to stay in this message or you have a
[1:07:33] choice to either go back to where you
[1:07:34] came from
[1:07:35] but we're not called this morning to go
[1:07:37] back to where we came from but i believe
[1:07:38] we are called
[1:07:39] to move forward into the promise that
[1:07:41] god has ordained for us and
[1:07:43] brother branham would say here at cadiz
[1:07:44] barnea he said the people
[1:07:46] at the hour of decision now you've got
[1:07:48] to make up your mind this church has got
[1:07:50] to make up its mind
[1:07:51] every man comes to a place where there's
[1:07:53] a crucial hour
[1:07:55] there's a crucial time come when you had
[1:07:56] to make up your mind a judgment seat
[1:07:59] you was that you had to say i'm guilty
[1:08:01] or i'm not guilty
[1:08:02] so brother branham here is is is talking
[1:08:04] about about
[1:08:05] the decision and that how you're going
[1:08:07] to come to a crucial hour you're going
[1:08:09] to come to a crucial
[1:08:10] time where in your life where you must
[1:08:12] make a decision
[1:08:13] and it's a decision to go on or go
[1:08:15] forward as we were saying but he goes on
[1:08:17] to say he says
[1:08:18] when you're standing before the judge
[1:08:20] you've got to make up your mind and
[1:08:22] tonight the brahm
[1:08:23] tabernacle has got to make up his mind
[1:08:25] and i would say this morning that
[1:08:26] spirit and truth tabernacle has got to
[1:08:28] make of its mind we each have to make up
[1:08:30] our mind
[1:08:31] he said and and you're either going to
[1:08:33] go on or go back that's right you're
[1:08:35] going to go back to garlic in the leak
[1:08:36] and stuff of egypt
[1:08:38] or you're gonna go on to angel's food to
[1:08:40] the promised land where god
[1:08:41] made a promise we're going on to an old
[1:08:44] fashioned holy ghost revival
[1:08:46] or you'll be a wish-washy packing around
[1:08:48] and pecking like a robin on an apple
[1:08:50] until the day you lie
[1:08:52] until the day you die so we see here as
[1:08:54] i was just studying this thought last
[1:08:56] night
[1:08:57] you see a lot of people around the
[1:08:59] message are are like
[1:09:01] and and there are and have came from the
[1:09:04] world and we've all come from the world
[1:09:06] but
[1:09:07] a lot of people around the message
[1:09:08] they're they're packing and pecking like
[1:09:10] a robin
[1:09:11] on an apple they're looking for
[1:09:12] something but i don't know
[1:09:14] i do not believe that the bride is
[1:09:15] looking to go back but the bride is not
[1:09:17] packing
[1:09:18] and the bride's not pecking around like
[1:09:20] a robin but the bride
[1:09:22] is packing something the bride's packing
[1:09:24] a message that will carry them
[1:09:25] up abroad the bride is carrying
[1:09:27] something that will carry them into a
[1:09:29] rapture
[1:09:30] and and he says you've got to make a
[1:09:32] decision you can't go on why
[1:09:34] halt you be before two opinions said
[1:09:37] elijah if god
[1:09:38] be god serve him if he's not god then
[1:09:41] don't serve him so i would say this
[1:09:42] morning why are we halting between two
[1:09:44] opinions
[1:09:45] why are we still standing here and
[1:09:47] saying we're listening to the critics
[1:09:48] and
[1:09:49] different ones saying oh the message is
[1:09:50] right or i don't know if we're going to
[1:09:51] be able to believe the message or
[1:09:53] is a prophet vindicated but i would say
[1:09:55] to you don't look at the words of the
[1:09:57] critic but look what the promise is
[1:09:59] look what the promise is in front of you
[1:10:01] and moses
[1:10:02] you i want to speak on the children of
[1:10:04] israel hill just for a few moments
[1:10:06] moses had sent spies into the land to
[1:10:08] come back and tell the people
[1:10:10] and we all know this story but he had
[1:10:11] sent spies and these spies came back
[1:10:14] with something they came back
[1:10:15] with uh two things they came back with
[1:10:18] uh the fruit of the land the evidence of
[1:10:19] the land and they also came back with
[1:10:21] a negative testimony and and and they
[1:10:24] said well there's a land and and if you
[1:10:26] read here they brought back the fruits
[1:10:27] of the land
[1:10:28] but they came back saying that there's a
[1:10:30] land but the walls are too great the
[1:10:32] giants are
[1:10:33] are too big and and there's no way that
[1:10:35] we can take this land
[1:10:37] and there's a lot of people around us
[1:10:39] that are saying well you know
[1:10:40] um um it's hard to obtain the the
[1:10:43] promise it's hard to
[1:10:45] to move into a rapture if you just stick
[1:10:46] with me for a moment just to continue in
[1:10:48] this but
[1:10:49] people have said that the message is too
[1:10:51] hard to live or there's too many rules
[1:10:53] it's become a set of rules it's become
[1:10:55] a set of laws but if you ever really
[1:10:58] grasp
[1:10:59] the meaning of the message it's not a
[1:11:01] set of rules
[1:11:02] it's not a set of laws but what it is
[1:11:05] this morning
[1:11:06] it is to carry you into a rapture if you
[1:11:08] ever grasp the meaning it'll become more
[1:11:10] than just words on a page
[1:11:12] but it will become your life it will
[1:11:14] become your everything you will be able
[1:11:16] to give your all and sacrifice
[1:11:18] everything in your life for this message
[1:11:20] and for the lord amen
[1:11:22] but there's a lot of critics that throw
[1:11:23] down the word a lot of critics around us
[1:11:26] to throw down but i would say this
[1:11:28] morning brother jack
[1:11:29] let the critics come let him come let
[1:11:31] him say what they want to say
[1:11:32] but we're not looking what the words of
[1:11:34] a critic are saying but we're looking at
[1:11:36] what the word of god
[1:11:38] has been ordained for us and we're and
[1:11:41] but we're looking
[1:11:42] at the promise and numbers 11 in the
[1:11:44] fifth
[1:11:45] chapter if you could just put that on
[1:11:47] there for me
[1:11:48] back there um we remember the fish which
[1:11:50] we did eat in egypt freely the cucumbers
[1:11:53] and the melons and the leek and the
[1:11:56] onions
[1:11:57] and the garlic just i'm sorry
[1:12:01] getting a little hot already
[1:12:04] let's just read that again we remember
[1:12:05] the fish which we did eat in egypt
[1:12:07] freely the cucumbers and the melons and
[1:12:09] the leek and the onions
[1:12:10] and the garlic but now our soul is dried
[1:12:13] away there is nothing at all besides
[1:12:15] this manna
[1:12:16] before our eyes so you see they remember
[1:12:19] what they had
[1:12:20] but they were going somewhere where they
[1:12:21] were going to have it all they were
[1:12:23] going somewhere that's much greater than
[1:12:24] what they had
[1:12:25] back in egypt and i would say that we're
[1:12:28] going somewhere in this day that's
[1:12:29] greater than the world we're going
[1:12:31] somewhere
[1:12:31] we're going to a land where there's no
[1:12:33] more job there's no more
[1:12:34] sorrow there's no more hurt there's no
[1:12:36] more disappointment but
[1:12:38] we're going somewhere where there's
[1:12:40] peace there's joy and
[1:12:41] and we're just going to be around the
[1:12:43] throne of god rejoicing
[1:12:45] but you know if you just think about
[1:12:48] this
[1:12:48] they remembered what they had and i
[1:12:50] would say to us this morning
[1:12:52] don't remember what you had the devil
[1:12:54] will try to come and say
[1:12:55] remember this what you had remember that
[1:12:57] when you had when you served me
[1:12:59] but i would say what did we have when we
[1:13:01] were under the devil's
[1:13:03] reign what did we have we had nothing
[1:13:05] but when we came into this message when
[1:13:07] we came into christ
[1:13:08] we had everything amen we had dead
[1:13:10] systems we had a dead church we had
[1:13:12] a broken up families but with christ we
[1:13:15] have
[1:13:16] everything amen and you can just imagine
[1:13:19] for a moment
[1:13:19] the children of israel when they were in
[1:13:21] egypt they were slaves under pharaoh
[1:13:24] and they were under the bondage of the
[1:13:26] enemy
[1:13:27] but they remembered one thing and they
[1:13:29] had a promise
[1:13:31] and they knew that no matter how hard it
[1:13:33] got no matter how
[1:13:34] how tired they got no matter how hard
[1:13:36] the whip or the beating on their back
[1:13:38] was they remembered
[1:13:39] that they had a promise that god would
[1:13:42] deliver them
[1:13:43] and and at church this morning god
[1:13:46] has promised us this morning that no
[1:13:48] matter how hard satan
[1:13:49] comes no matter how hard satan blows no
[1:13:52] matter how hard the pressure gets
[1:13:54] god would deliver us he he he he
[1:13:57] we might feel like we're going down
[1:13:59] defeat we might feel like well you know
[1:14:01] i don't know what else to do i'm stuck
[1:14:03] but we have a promise that god is a
[1:14:05] present help
[1:14:07] in the time of trouble do you believe
[1:14:09] that and i believe that we're going
[1:14:10] somewhere as i said earlier
[1:14:12] politics politics are going down
[1:14:14] hollywood is going down
[1:14:16] the nominations are going down systems
[1:14:18] going down creeds are going down
[1:14:20] but the bride is going up the bride is
[1:14:22] packing something
[1:14:24] that will carry them up amen as the
[1:14:26] children of israel were called out
[1:14:28] we also are called out this morning we
[1:14:32] are called out
[1:14:33] with a message to keep moving us forward
[1:14:36] but this message not is not here to
[1:14:39] bring you
[1:14:40] back to where you came from or however
[1:14:42] you look back but the message is here to
[1:14:44] bring you
[1:14:45] forward just stick with me i know this
[1:14:47] is simple but simple is good
[1:14:49] maybe you've heard it before but there's
[1:14:51] another reason you're hearing it this
[1:14:52] morning
[1:14:53] but the message came to move you forward
[1:14:55] we are not following a billy graham or
[1:14:57] or a jim jones but what we are following
[1:15:00] this morning
[1:15:01] is a pillar of fire we are following
[1:15:03] something
[1:15:04] that has been vindicated this morning
[1:15:06] and and brother branham would say here
[1:15:08] he said
[1:15:08] obey the to the angel here in this
[1:15:10] message said not moses
[1:15:12] moses never performed one miracle it was
[1:15:15] the angel of god that went before moses
[1:15:17] it was a pillar of fire at night
[1:15:19] and a cloud by day and when you see the
[1:15:22] picture that we've got to show you here
[1:15:24] shortly if you haven't i believe you'll
[1:15:26] feel that it's the same
[1:15:27] pillar of fire that's leading the people
[1:15:30] today the angel of god
[1:15:32] which we know the angel that led moses
[1:15:34] was the angel of the covenant which was
[1:15:36] christ the son of god and now
[1:15:38] or the logos that came of god and the
[1:15:40] son of god
[1:15:41] then when god delivered the children of
[1:15:44] israel when they were in bondage and
[1:15:46] couldn't help themselves
[1:15:47] now this this notices god delivered the
[1:15:50] children of israel when they couldn't
[1:15:51] help themselves but
[1:15:52] i want you to picture yourself here and
[1:15:54] they're children of israel's shoes now
[1:15:56] but today god's people are not in
[1:15:59] bondage
[1:16:00] spiritually but they're delivered by the
[1:16:02] power of the holy spirit
[1:16:05] no man has to stay in bondage of sin any
[1:16:08] longer because the holy spirit
[1:16:10] brings him from the bondage of sin so
[1:16:13] israel was abound
[1:16:14] but the holy spirit and the holy spirit
[1:16:17] this morning has come
[1:16:18] to make you free if you're bound in sin
[1:16:20] if you're bound
[1:16:21] in your own ideas i would say this
[1:16:23] morning the holy spirit has come he's
[1:16:25] sweeping in this building this morning
[1:16:27] and as the word is being preached you're
[1:16:29] free you know
[1:16:30] on the cross this morning it's still
[1:16:32] saying your pardon
[1:16:34] go on keep going forward everyone in
[1:16:36] heaven around us
[1:16:38] every saint that's going on and saying
[1:16:40] to you this morning
[1:16:41] keep marching forward don't look back
[1:16:43] don't look at what you had
[1:16:45] but keep moving forward into the promise
[1:16:47] this this land that we're
[1:16:49] going to be obtaining is much greater
[1:16:51] than what we have in this world
[1:16:53] but we are moving into something that's
[1:16:55] much greater than everything else around
[1:16:57] us
[1:16:58] we're moving into a promise that god has
[1:17:00] ordained for us amen
[1:17:02] if there's sin in your life i would say
[1:17:04] cut it out get it out of your life
[1:17:06] don't let that stop you don't let that
[1:17:08] affect your walk with christ
[1:17:09] keep moving forward into something into
[1:17:12] something of god amen
[1:17:14] we gotta keep moving forward amen the
[1:17:16] holy spirit is here this morning to give
[1:17:18] you grace
[1:17:19] he's still here his blood still remains
[1:17:22] on the cross this morning do you believe
[1:17:24] that
[1:17:24] amen but god is also looking
[1:17:28] for a heart god is not looking for more
[1:17:30] church members sure it's great
[1:17:32] sure it's great to have church members
[1:17:34] but what good is it churches that have a
[1:17:36] good church
[1:17:36] what good is it to have a big body but
[1:17:38] it's not about the numbers but what it's
[1:17:40] about is your heart
[1:17:42] what is your heart like what is it what
[1:17:44] is is it blackened by the by the sin
[1:17:46] or it was your heart free and just stick
[1:17:49] with me now as we just
[1:17:50] as we go on to this but first
[1:17:52] corinthians the third chapter and the
[1:17:54] 16th verse and the 17th verse he says
[1:17:57] know ye not that she are the temple of
[1:18:00] god and that the spirit of god dwelleth
[1:18:02] in you
[1:18:03] if any man defiles the temple of god him
[1:18:06] shall
[1:18:06] god destroy for the temple of god is
[1:18:09] holy
[1:18:09] which temple ye
[1:18:13] says which temple ye are which temple
[1:18:15] are you are you the temple of
[1:18:17] of what satan has are you the temple of
[1:18:19] the holy ghost
[1:18:20] and i do not believe that god is
[1:18:22] building in a temple an or an
[1:18:24] idea or in a system but god is building
[1:18:26] in a temple
[1:18:27] of the hearts of a believer that will
[1:18:30] allow him to build in
[1:18:31] you see god cannot build in your heart
[1:18:33] if you do not allow him to build in your
[1:18:35] heart
[1:18:36] god has to have a submissive heart for
[1:18:38] him in order to build in your heart
[1:18:41] and and so you have to allow god to work
[1:18:44] on our heart so it's time that we allow
[1:18:47] god to build i would say this morning
[1:18:49] god and my prayer is
[1:18:50] god build in me lord my heart is
[1:18:54] submissive
[1:18:55] i want to surrender everything i have
[1:18:56] lord build in me
[1:18:58] amen do you believe that but it's not
[1:19:00] about how well you know the bible or how
[1:19:02] well you know the quote sure those
[1:19:03] things are good
[1:19:04] but what good is it is to know the
[1:19:06] quotes what good is it to know the bible
[1:19:08] if if you don't have christ in your life
[1:19:11] if you don't have christ in your heart
[1:19:14] and and brother branham would say here
[1:19:16] i hope it's all right just to read the
[1:19:18] prophet this morning but
[1:19:19] he says i have no education at all and
[1:19:22] i'm not
[1:19:23] when i made that remark a while ago
[1:19:24] about education i wasn't trying to take
[1:19:26] crutches for my ignorance
[1:19:28] but what i'm trying to say that it
[1:19:30] doesn't take education
[1:19:32] to know god it takes a submissive heart
[1:19:35] to know god so brother branham he didn't
[1:19:37] have all the education he didn't have
[1:19:39] all the things
[1:19:40] he didn't have the seminary school and
[1:19:41] he didn't have all these different
[1:19:43] things
[1:19:44] but what he had he was packing
[1:19:47] something else he was packing truth he
[1:19:49] was packing a message
[1:19:51] and it wasn't about his education it
[1:19:53] wasn't about how well he knew this or
[1:19:55] how well he knew that
[1:19:56] but his heart was submissive to the word
[1:20:00] so is your heart submissive to the word
[1:20:02] this morning i would say
[1:20:04] your heart is not warning the things of
[1:20:06] the world but your heart
[1:20:07] is wanting more of god and i believe
[1:20:10] it's time for the bride
[1:20:11] to possess the blessings that god has
[1:20:13] ordained for us
[1:20:15] to possess amen to possess means to have
[1:20:18] as belonging to one or own it can also
[1:20:21] mean having a right to something
[1:20:23] so if you have a right to every promise
[1:20:26] of god
[1:20:27] what is what is prohibiting you from
[1:20:29] moving
[1:20:30] forward into the promise what is what is
[1:20:32] stopping you from possessing
[1:20:34] the promise so if you're sick why are
[1:20:36] you not taking back your right
[1:20:38] to your healing if if you're if you're
[1:20:40] bound in sin why are you not taking your
[1:20:42] right to be free
[1:20:44] if you're bound by by anxiety or
[1:20:46] depression
[1:20:47] why aren't you taking your right back
[1:20:50] this morning
[1:20:51] so so if we have a right to possess
[1:20:53] something
[1:20:55] we and in order to possess something you
[1:20:58] must
[1:20:58] move forward into that first you can't
[1:21:01] just stick back and say well
[1:21:02] you know i have the right there to
[1:21:04] possess that but i don't want to i don't
[1:21:05] want to really
[1:21:06] i want to stay where i'm at i like where
[1:21:08] i'm at spiritually
[1:21:09] but but why why are we staying here and
[1:21:12] and why are we i'm just liking this
[1:21:15] where we're at
[1:21:15] spiritually but i would say if god has
[1:21:17] so many more promises if god has so many
[1:21:20] more things in store for us
[1:21:21] why aren't we moving forward into those
[1:21:24] promises
[1:21:25] what's stopping us and and and brother
[1:21:27] branham was saying an
[1:21:28] expectation says now notice when god
[1:21:31] makes
[1:21:32] a promise to you he will fulfill it you
[1:21:35] don't have to be afraid
[1:21:36] that he will not keep his word for god
[1:21:38] will keep
[1:21:39] his word that's true so let's think
[1:21:42] about the children of israel for a
[1:21:43] moment they were they were made a lot of
[1:21:45] promises they were made to be brought
[1:21:46] out of egypt they were they were made
[1:21:49] they were they were promised
[1:21:51] to be brought out of um on the things of
[1:21:54] egypt and
[1:21:55] under the reign of pharaoh and they were
[1:21:57] promised something at kirsh barnea as
[1:21:59] well
[1:22:00] but they they had many promises
[1:22:04] but they didn't move into every single
[1:22:06] promise
[1:22:07] so just think about this like i said
[1:22:09] earlier you are in the children of
[1:22:10] israel's shoes place yourself
[1:22:12] in their shoes so they did not move in
[1:22:14] the things that were promised but
[1:22:17] so i was talking last night to brother
[1:22:19] aaron
[1:22:20] and we were just talking about some
[1:22:21] different things and i was just telling
[1:22:23] him what
[1:22:24] my my what my direction i felt like to
[1:22:26] go because i told brother jack i said
[1:22:28] when i was at his house said you know
[1:22:29] brother jack i don't really know what to
[1:22:30] speak on
[1:22:31] i'm kind of in a tie between what i'm
[1:22:33] going to speak on so i was talking about
[1:22:35] their errands about some things and
[1:22:37] and um he was just saying you know the
[1:22:39] children of israel
[1:22:40] are like if we if we really think about
[1:22:43] it the children of israel are like us
[1:22:44] sometimes spiritually
[1:22:46] and and and they might have gotten
[1:22:48] satisfied with where they were
[1:22:50] at but and we get satisfied with the
[1:22:53] promise of the holy ghost we get
[1:22:54] satisfied with sanctification
[1:22:56] justification all these things
[1:22:58] and when we tend to not move forward
[1:23:00] into the promise
[1:23:02] that god has for us and we and we get so
[1:23:05] complacent that we forget
[1:23:07] what other things are ahead we
[1:23:10] we we get so caught up in well i like
[1:23:13] like i said earlier
[1:23:14] i like where i'm at but we tend to get
[1:23:16] complacent to not move forward into
[1:23:18] greater things and i
[1:23:20] i believe that the thing that some of
[1:23:23] the children of israel
[1:23:24] they didn't want to move on into the
[1:23:26] promised land it's mind-blowing to think
[1:23:28] that
[1:23:28] you were promised a land of all these
[1:23:32] things a land flowing of milk and honey
[1:23:34] a land
[1:23:35] but there's solomon where there's no
[1:23:36] more hurt no more no more
[1:23:38] sorrow but they were promised something
[1:23:40] and they didn't want to move into
[1:23:42] a promise think about that now they
[1:23:45] they liked where they were at and they
[1:23:48] did not want to move forward
[1:23:49] into a promise it's crazy to think but
[1:23:52] if you really if you really think about
[1:23:53] it
[1:23:54] we're like that we we get we we have a
[1:23:56] promise of a rapture
[1:23:58] and we get so complacent and where we're
[1:24:00] at that we tend to forget
[1:24:02] about our rapture we cannot forget about
[1:24:04] what god has ordained for us
[1:24:06] to obtain and i would say don't be like
[1:24:09] the children of israel
[1:24:10] but push forward press the mark as it
[1:24:13] says here
[1:24:14] in philippians press the mark amen
[1:24:17] so many times we're also like lot's wife
[1:24:20] and and
[1:24:21] and we look back to what's behind us and
[1:24:24] and
[1:24:24] i was thinking about law and she's just
[1:24:27] it's it's interesting that
[1:24:29] you know god would come down with a
[1:24:32] messenger
[1:24:32] and mess some messengers and tell her
[1:24:34] hey look
[1:24:36] you know tell law and his law and his
[1:24:38] wife and his family hey
[1:24:39] you know the judgment is coming i would
[1:24:41] say to you to to leave
[1:24:43] so they leave but what they did they did
[1:24:46] the opposite
[1:24:47] of what the messenger had told them to
[1:24:49] do
[1:24:51] so now they did the opposite of what the
[1:24:53] messenger told them to do
[1:24:54] a lot his wife had looked back and
[1:24:58] and and and one of the key things that
[1:25:00] the messenger told don't look back
[1:25:02] don't look back even for a moment but
[1:25:04] what they did they did not follow the
[1:25:06] messenger's
[1:25:07] word and she disobeyed what the
[1:25:10] messenger's word was and she turned into
[1:25:12] a pillar of salt and god said it and and
[1:25:16] god has a provided way in 62 says god
[1:25:19] with his messenger told lot and his wife
[1:25:21] and the children
[1:25:22] don't even look back and lot's wife with
[1:25:26] her own children and grandchildren
[1:25:28] burning in the judgments of god a mother
[1:25:31] just turned her head slightly looked
[1:25:34] back
[1:25:35] and she was cursed to a pillar of salt
[1:25:37] he says you've got to keep
[1:25:38] every word of it speaking now of the
[1:25:41] messengers you've got to keep every
[1:25:43] single
[1:25:43] word of it man shall not live by bread
[1:25:46] alone said jesus but by
[1:25:48] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:25:50] mouth of god
[1:25:51] so i would say you know a prophet has
[1:25:53] come he has he has given us an outline
[1:25:56] of what we should do
[1:25:57] and and why are we disobeying still why
[1:26:00] are we still
[1:26:00] here in in this in this place where you
[1:26:03] know the prophet has come
[1:26:04] he has brought a message he has brought
[1:26:06] a word that has been vindicated
[1:26:08] it's not what the baptists have or the
[1:26:10] pentecostals have or what or the
[1:26:12] catholics have but it has been
[1:26:14] vindicated by the word and and why are
[1:26:17] we looking back
[1:26:18] why are we doing what the total opposite
[1:26:20] of what the messenger
[1:26:22] has come to tell us what to do why are
[1:26:24] we not why are we not
[1:26:25] doing what he's saying we're disobeying
[1:26:28] what the word of the lord
[1:26:29] is but she heard the cry of her children
[1:26:32] and looked back
[1:26:33] and but no matter how hard the cry of
[1:26:36] this person is no matter how hard the
[1:26:38] cry of your family is
[1:26:39] no matter how high come and cry i'm loud
[1:26:42] and
[1:26:43] the cry of um let's say um um
[1:26:46] a church member we're just gonna we're
[1:26:48] just gonna get down and and just preach
[1:26:50] but
[1:26:51] no matter how hard the cry of a church
[1:26:53] member is i would say
[1:26:55] don't look back don't look to what
[1:26:57] they're saying like i said
[1:26:58] we're not moved by the word of a critic
[1:27:01] we're not moved by the words of an
[1:27:03] unbeliever but what we're moved by is
[1:27:05] the power and the
[1:27:06] action of the holy ghost we are moved by
[1:27:09] almighty god
[1:27:10] so don't stop for one moment but keep
[1:27:12] moving forward and keep pressing
[1:27:14] on with truth the devil was always
[1:27:17] trying to remind us of a past and trying
[1:27:19] to get us to look back
[1:27:21] but i believe that it's time that we
[1:27:23] forget about our past forget
[1:27:24] about whoa but the things that you had
[1:27:27] you know it's funny brother jack you
[1:27:28] think about it
[1:27:29] some people tend to never forget about
[1:27:31] their past they're always looking back
[1:27:32] it's like
[1:27:33] well that person hurt me and even though
[1:27:35] they uh they asked for forgiveness and
[1:27:37] and and this person this person did this
[1:27:39] and that church member did that and
[1:27:41] or even you can bring it down to the
[1:27:43] pastor you know
[1:27:44] our pastor back at home is talking about
[1:27:46] how you've been hurt by church members
[1:27:48] we've been hurt but if if it's under the
[1:27:51] blood why are we continuing to look
[1:27:52] back at things that are supposed to be
[1:27:54] forgotten why are we looking back at
[1:27:57] things that
[1:27:58] are supposed to be no more and i would
[1:28:00] say that it's not
[1:28:01] it's not time to look back at your past
[1:28:04] it's not time to look
[1:28:05] back at the things that are under the
[1:28:07] blood but move
[1:28:08] forward if you think about it you know
[1:28:10] the lord says he would put the thing his
[1:28:12] our sins in the sea of forgetfulness and
[1:28:14] and and we
[1:28:15] but we in ourselves as humans have a
[1:28:17] hard time forgetting what we did
[1:28:20] but i would say if it's under the blood
[1:28:24] try and forget it it's hard it's it's
[1:28:27] difficult to try and forget the things
[1:28:28] that you've done
[1:28:29] but if it's under the blood if it's on
[1:28:32] in the sea forgetfulness i would say
[1:28:34] don't look at what the past was but look
[1:28:37] ahead
[1:28:39] going forward amen do you believe that
[1:28:42] and
[1:28:42] and the end result of moving forward is
[1:28:45] to be with the lord and
[1:28:47] and and the devil is is trying to test
[1:28:50] you and he tests us daily
[1:28:52] and he's trying to pull you but we have
[1:28:55] a promise
[1:28:55] we have a promise to be somewhere
[1:28:57] greater than this earth
[1:28:59] and the pressure is so real i i believe
[1:29:02] that that
[1:29:02] that um we are living in age where as a
[1:29:04] young person just speaking from
[1:29:06] experience
[1:29:07] we're living in an age where pressure is
[1:29:09] so great pressure is so real
[1:29:11] and i think the past few months i've
[1:29:13] never felt pressure like i have in my
[1:29:15] own life
[1:29:16] but but when god is bringing pressure
[1:29:18] sometimes
[1:29:19] i believe he's trying to press something
[1:29:20] out as well
[1:29:22] if you think about uh a grape here for a
[1:29:25] minute um
[1:29:26] or uh um um on olive yes thank you
[1:29:30] and all of here it's pressed to bring
[1:29:33] the oil out so when a pressure comes or
[1:29:36] our test comes
[1:29:37] it's not it's not it's not coming so
[1:29:40] that you can just be defeated but what
[1:29:41] it's coming is is a teach you
[1:29:43] something something to bring you oil
[1:29:46] so so so i would say this morning let
[1:29:50] the
[1:29:50] oil of god get pressed
[1:29:53] let you let your olive be pressed let
[1:29:55] your life be pressed that everything of
[1:29:58] the world is
[1:29:59] out every idea of yourself is out but
[1:30:02] let the power of god oh hallelujah
[1:30:05] at the power of god come into your life
[1:30:07] and press everything out
[1:30:09] but let god reign in your life i believe
[1:30:12] that
[1:30:12] but also i believe that god is looking
[1:30:15] when he's when a test comes or a trial
[1:30:17] comes
[1:30:17] he's looking at your reaction think
[1:30:19] about this now brother brian i'm going
[1:30:20] to say
[1:30:21] a reaction to an act an action he says
[1:30:24] and when
[1:30:24] you're put under a test when you're
[1:30:27] fixing to be used by god for a testimony
[1:30:29] like the lady here in the wheelchair
[1:30:30] the man a little boy some of you people
[1:30:32] out there maybe you're christians and
[1:30:33] wonder
[1:30:34] why you're put under this test god's
[1:30:38] fixing the user if you use you for a
[1:30:40] testimony
[1:30:41] but he wants to see how you react so he
[1:30:44] might put pressure on if you blow up
[1:30:46] well then
[1:30:47] he can't do anything with you but if you
[1:30:49] hold on
[1:30:50] stand the test if you hold on
[1:30:54] stand the test god will use you
[1:30:57] so so i would say hold on stand the test
[1:31:01] keep marching forward amen that's the
[1:31:04] promise that we have is to move forward
[1:31:06] into a promise stand the test as the
[1:31:09] wind blows the trials come
[1:31:11] and that the critics say what they want
[1:31:12] to say but i would say
[1:31:14] sand strong stand still and see the
[1:31:17] power of god
[1:31:17] move in your life oh hallelujah
[1:31:20] the greatest testimony i believe is when
[1:31:22] a bunch of pullbacks from their jack
[1:31:24] are coming around you there's a bunch of
[1:31:26] naysayers and backbiters
[1:31:28] but when you stand for something when
[1:31:30] you stand for truth while everyone
[1:31:32] around you
[1:31:33] is backing down i believe that's a quiet
[1:31:36] testimony do you believe that
[1:31:37] that is a real testimony they're
[1:31:40] standing in an age where everyone is not
[1:31:41] looking for truth
[1:31:42] but to stand in an age for truth that's
[1:31:45] a testimony
[1:31:46] but brother brian would say in the
[1:31:48] countdown as well he would say
[1:31:49] i gotta hurry here he would say that the
[1:31:51] bride
[1:31:52] will not fail because she is pressurized
[1:31:56] so it's so so so the bride will not fail
[1:31:58] because she's pressurized brother troy
[1:32:00] we are pressurized this morning we are
[1:32:03] we we are we are not
[1:32:04] we are not under something a message
[1:32:06] that has not been vindicated but
[1:32:08] the lord this morning has vindicated
[1:32:10] something he is giving us the word
[1:32:13] to pressurize us amen like i said the
[1:32:16] winds may come but you're pressurized
[1:32:18] stand strong and see the power of god
[1:32:20] move
[1:32:21] amen we are pressurized and i just want
[1:32:24] to i just want to speak here now
[1:32:26] but i have only a few more minutes and
[1:32:28] i'm trying to hurry but
[1:32:29] because i want to give brother zion as
[1:32:31] much time as he needs
[1:32:32] so so um there's a lot of people lately
[1:32:37] i think this has been one of the um this
[1:32:39] has been on the seasons where
[1:32:41] um i was talking to their brother and he
[1:32:43] said you know as a young minister he was
[1:32:45] coming to this place where everyone was
[1:32:47] criticizing this they were saying you
[1:32:48] know don't don't don't read the don't
[1:32:50] read the quotes don't read
[1:32:52] don't read anything the prophet says
[1:32:54] only read the bible
[1:32:55] but and there's been a lot of people
[1:32:57] coming to me and they're trying to tell
[1:32:59] me
[1:32:59] that the message isn't right or the
[1:33:01] message is in this
[1:33:03] or the message isn't right because it
[1:33:04] isn't fitting their own beliefs it isn't
[1:33:06] fitting their own doctrine
[1:33:08] and and that's just been something i've
[1:33:10] been dealing with these past few months
[1:33:12] but but the message of the hour as i was
[1:33:15] thinking the other neighbor jack just
[1:33:16] studying
[1:33:17] the message of the hour is not subject
[1:33:19] to our opinion
[1:33:20] it's not subject to anyone's opinion
[1:33:22] nobody nobody has a say
[1:33:24] in what the message said do you believe
[1:33:26] that it's not subject to your
[1:33:28] own opinions the message of the hour has
[1:33:31] been proven after time
[1:33:32] after time after time it's vindicated
[1:33:35] so why are you trying to put your own
[1:33:37] opinion in it
[1:33:39] why are people trying to try to trying
[1:33:41] to have it fit their
[1:33:42] own belief that's not what it's here to
[1:33:45] do what it's here to do
[1:33:46] is help you move forward into something
[1:33:49] and to a promise
[1:33:50] and and like i said it's not subject to
[1:33:52] their opinions
[1:33:54] this is not a fake we this is this
[1:33:56] church is not built off of something
[1:33:58] that's fake
[1:33:59] but this this church i believe is built
[1:34:01] off of truth
[1:34:02] it's in the name spirit and truth
[1:34:04] tabernacle
[1:34:05] it's built off of something when the
[1:34:07] winds blow when everything comes against
[1:34:09] it it's standing on
[1:34:11] something and that something is truth
[1:34:13] you're not standing on a dead word or a
[1:34:15] dead denomination
[1:34:16] or a decree but what you're standing on
[1:34:18] is truth this morning
[1:34:20] and i believe the message is not here to
[1:34:22] carry a bunch of pullbacks
[1:34:24] and a bunch of quitters through a
[1:34:25] rapture but the message is here to carry
[1:34:27] a believer
[1:34:29] the bride to a rapture amen to carry
[1:34:32] them home
[1:34:33] to where they belong amen is this all
[1:34:36] right just for a few minutes here
[1:34:38] do you i wonder if we if we recognize
[1:34:40] that this message
[1:34:42] is christ christ has been revealed in
[1:34:44] this message
[1:34:45] you can't find christ in a dead system
[1:34:47] as i said earlier you can't find them in
[1:34:49] in in ideas but what you can find them
[1:34:52] in
[1:34:52] is in truth what you can find them in is
[1:34:54] this message
[1:34:55] and i believe we have a vision um aaron
[1:34:58] i believe we have a vision this morning
[1:35:00] that we are not under something that's
[1:35:02] that's um
[1:35:03] that's dead but we are under something
[1:35:04] that is true we're under a vision
[1:35:07] from the lord and if this message had no
[1:35:09] vision
[1:35:10] there would be no power behind it so
[1:35:13] think about this now
[1:35:14] if you're saying there's no power in
[1:35:16] this message
[1:35:17] then then what is the message but all i
[1:35:20] can see
[1:35:20] brother jack is that there has been
[1:35:22] power in this message
[1:35:24] time after time after time in my young
[1:35:26] life i've seen god
[1:35:28] move in this message he has moved in my
[1:35:30] life he's moved to my family's life
[1:35:32] because why
[1:35:33] there's power in the message amen
[1:35:36] because we are
[1:35:37] we are under a message with a vision and
[1:35:40] and this is not a buildup of emotions or
[1:35:42] ideas but it's a vision
[1:35:44] from the lord and and this message is
[1:35:46] not about brother branham
[1:35:48] opinion or what he has to say but this
[1:35:50] message is about the lord jesus christ
[1:35:52] and what he came to say through a
[1:35:54] prophet to reveal it to you
[1:35:56] amen are you thankful for that this
[1:35:58] morning that that he revealed it to you
[1:36:00] and then he chose you to speak to you
[1:36:03] amen i believe that
[1:36:05] but this message is jesus christ the
[1:36:07] same yesterday
[1:36:08] today and forever i believe that this
[1:36:11] message is here to carry us into a
[1:36:13] promise
[1:36:15] oh my hallelujah but i want to think it
[1:36:18] now as we just continue on
[1:36:20] children of israel caleb and joshua they
[1:36:23] didn't stop
[1:36:24] listening to what people had to say
[1:36:26] around them and they didn't listen
[1:36:28] they didn't have to stop to hear what
[1:36:29] people had to say about moses
[1:36:32] you really think about that they didn't
[1:36:34] stop to hear what other people had to
[1:36:36] say about
[1:36:36] moses you think about that
[1:36:40] well you know you know joshua i think we
[1:36:44] should just wait a minute before we move
[1:36:45] forward
[1:36:46] because it's kind of just moses opinion
[1:36:49] and his idea
[1:36:51] and his thought but but they didn't stop
[1:36:53] to listen to what they had to say
[1:36:55] but they were moving forward into
[1:36:57] something that was much greater
[1:36:58] amen and and because because
[1:37:02] people i always want to tie it down i'm
[1:37:04] trying to tie this down here
[1:37:06] people will come to joshua and caleb and
[1:37:08] you can just imagine here they'll say
[1:37:10] well you know the message of moses is
[1:37:12] not fitting my own opinion
[1:37:14] so i don't know if i can believe it but
[1:37:17] but
[1:37:18] or maybe this is another thing the
[1:37:19] message of moses
[1:37:21] isn't focusing on what it's really about
[1:37:23] it isn't focusing on
[1:37:25] christ so there's a lot of people around
[1:37:27] you saying well the message of the hour
[1:37:29] is not focusing on christ
[1:37:31] but i would say what it what is this
[1:37:33] focus then
[1:37:34] all i can see is that the message has
[1:37:36] been focused around christ
[1:37:38] it has been revealed by christ oh my
[1:37:42] but joshua and caleb did not did not
[1:37:44] stop for a moment but they kept
[1:37:45] on marching they knew that moses that
[1:37:48] god has spoke to moses had given them a
[1:37:50] promise
[1:37:51] to obtain a land so they kept pushing
[1:37:54] because they knew that it would all be
[1:37:55] worth it
[1:37:56] but they were going to a promise
[1:38:00] but i just want to tie this down out to
[1:38:01] move forward into something
[1:38:04] you must have a vision to have a vision
[1:38:08] in order to have in order to to have a
[1:38:11] vision you
[1:38:12] must move forward into something you
[1:38:14] must move forward into a vision
[1:38:16] and and hebrews 11 verse 8 and the 10th
[1:38:19] chapter and if you can just put that up
[1:38:20] there for me and just leave it up there
[1:38:21] for a few moments here
[1:38:23] he said it says by faith abraham when he
[1:38:26] was called to go out into a place which
[1:38:28] he should go
[1:38:29] after receive for an inheritance
[1:38:31] inheritance
[1:38:32] obeyed and he went out
[1:38:35] and not knowing whether he went by faith
[1:38:39] he sojourned in the land of promise as
[1:38:41] an estranged country dwelling in the
[1:38:42] tabernacles with isaac and jacob
[1:38:44] the heirs with him of the same promise
[1:38:48] but he looked for a city which had
[1:38:50] foundations whose builder and maker is
[1:38:52] god
[1:38:53] so notice abraham was called out to go
[1:38:55] forward to receive
[1:38:56] an inheritance he was he was called to
[1:38:59] go into
[1:38:59] a a an inheritance of a promised land
[1:39:03] so he sojourned in this slam so i
[1:39:06] i believe that abraham had a vision and
[1:39:09] and
[1:39:09] we are we are in a message this morning
[1:39:11] or as i said with a vision
[1:39:13] and brother branham here would say this
[1:39:15] is the sign of the answer he says
[1:39:18] you know the pyramid pyramid never was
[1:39:20] capped
[1:39:21] the headstone is yet to come it's been
[1:39:23] rejected
[1:39:24] could it be brother and sisters or is
[1:39:26] this that the third poi speaking about
[1:39:28] the third pool now
[1:39:29] and tying into how the second pool is
[1:39:30] now transitioning into the third pool
[1:39:33] but he says or is this that the third
[1:39:35] pool that he told me
[1:39:36] three or four years ago the first boy
[1:39:39] you remember what happened
[1:39:40] i tried to explain it he said don't do
[1:39:42] that the second boy said
[1:39:43] don't try and i pull it anyhow you
[1:39:45] remember that all of you remember
[1:39:47] it's on the tape and everything then he
[1:39:49] said now there's a
[1:39:50] third pool coming but don't try to
[1:39:53] explain
[1:39:54] it so everyone try to stop what was
[1:39:57] going on
[1:39:57] they try to stop what brother branham
[1:39:59] was saying but he says don't try to
[1:40:01] explain it
[1:40:02] you see how i approach this tonight i
[1:40:03] don't know but i feel duty bound to my
[1:40:06] church to say something
[1:40:07] you draw your own conclusions now but
[1:40:10] that
[1:40:11] the mystery that would be opened up
[1:40:14] that would bring christ bring a power to
[1:40:17] the church
[1:40:18] so i i want to speak on this for a
[1:40:19] moment he says now with this
[1:40:22] be the mystery that would open up that
[1:40:24] would bring christ
[1:40:26] bring a power to the church so
[1:40:29] notice in this quote that people are
[1:40:31] were looking for the power of christ
[1:40:34] they were looking for a vision they were
[1:40:36] looking for christ and his powers
[1:40:38] but they didn't want to listen to what a
[1:40:40] prophet
[1:40:41] had to say they they they wanted all the
[1:40:43] powers of christ in their church but
[1:40:45] they didn't want to listen to what he
[1:40:46] had to say
[1:40:47] and and but but we have heard him this
[1:40:50] morning
[1:40:51] talk about a vision we've heard him talk
[1:40:53] about the third pull it's come
[1:40:55] and he was saying a paradox in 61 it
[1:40:57] says it was about three o'clock in the
[1:40:59] morning and it was actually about three
[1:41:00] o'clock in the morning last night when i
[1:41:02] actually
[1:41:02] the lord places on my heart so i think
[1:41:04] this is ordained but it was about three
[1:41:06] o'clock in the morning i suppose
[1:41:08] i got up and i talked i looked where in
[1:41:11] front of me
[1:41:11] and i was coming down to the jordan
[1:41:14] looked like i was standing on the map of
[1:41:15] palestine
[1:41:16] and i was coming down to the jordan and
[1:41:19] seemed like all i could hear the song
[1:41:20] was
[1:41:21] i'm going down to the jordan somewhere
[1:41:24] someone was singing it and i drew near
[1:41:26] the river i looked back and seen which a
[1:41:30] way i had come
[1:41:31] and i was two-thirds of the way there
[1:41:34] to the jordan two-thirds of of of of the
[1:41:37] pools to
[1:41:39] three pools two-thirds of the way there
[1:41:41] stick with me now i know this is gonna
[1:41:43] get confusing but just stick with me
[1:41:45] two thirds of the way there three pulls
[1:41:47] and he said
[1:41:48] oh praise god just on the other side is
[1:41:51] where all the promises lay
[1:41:53] every promise lays in the promised land
[1:41:57] so the second pool now is transitioning
[1:42:00] into the third pool and when he said
[1:42:01] when he's talking about this
[1:42:03] and and that in the third pool is where
[1:42:05] every single promise
[1:42:07] lays and this morning the word has been
[1:42:10] fulfilled
[1:42:11] the third pool has been vindicated it
[1:42:13] has been brought to us
[1:42:15] every promise is in the third pool every
[1:42:18] promise is before you this morning
[1:42:20] amen let me continue on this now as i'm
[1:42:23] just talking
[1:42:24] about these things but the prophet would
[1:42:26] go on to say in the anointing once at
[1:42:27] the end times
[1:42:28] he says notice the very day when this
[1:42:31] messenger
[1:42:32] not when he starts on but when he but he
[1:42:35] belongs
[1:42:36] begins to declare his message just think
[1:42:38] about this now this is this is this is
[1:42:40] something
[1:42:41] when he begins to declare his message
[1:42:42] see the first pool
[1:42:44] healing second paul prophesying third
[1:42:47] pool the opening of the word
[1:42:49] the mysteries revealed no more there's
[1:42:52] no more
[1:42:52] higher order to be revealed in the word
[1:42:55] then the prophets
[1:42:57] oh my but they only the only way
[1:43:01] the prophet can be vindicated is by the
[1:43:04] word
[1:43:05] so remember the third pool was the
[1:43:07] opening of them seven seals to reveal
[1:43:09] the
[1:43:10] hidden truth and that days sealed in the
[1:43:13] word
[1:43:13] do you see it it is then and this day
[1:43:16] when this thing is to take place
[1:43:17] that janus and jamborees the
[1:43:19] impersonators will appear again
[1:43:22] just like they did in the days of moses
[1:43:24] they appeared with the original word to
[1:43:26] say
[1:43:27] they appeared to impersonate it so this
[1:43:30] morning
[1:43:31] let the janus and jamborees come let
[1:43:34] them come and say
[1:43:35] and try to impersonate the word and let
[1:43:37] the critic come and the unbeliever come
[1:43:39] but we are not moved as i said earlier
[1:43:41] about the by the word of the critic but
[1:43:43] we're
[1:43:44] moved by the word of the lord amen we
[1:43:47] are moved by god
[1:43:49] and as i said this this um the saints
[1:43:53] of from out the ages have been waiting
[1:43:55] for this moment
[1:43:56] they've been waiting for the vision to
[1:43:58] be fulfilled and and they're now
[1:44:00] over there in heaven but they're jacking
[1:44:02] their and they're and they're watching
[1:44:03] the vision be fulfilled
[1:44:05] we're in the vision we are standing in
[1:44:08] the vision
[1:44:09] and and brother branham would say here
[1:44:11] as i'm just wrapping this up
[1:44:12] look where jesus said so now i am going
[1:44:15] to say something to you
[1:44:16] now that i haven't said all along that
[1:44:19] this
[1:44:20] that the thing that we've been looking
[1:44:22] forward to for so long for at least many
[1:44:24] years
[1:44:25] for five years or maybe longer the third
[1:44:28] pool
[1:44:28] has now been vindicated and i am sure
[1:44:31] you all know
[1:44:32] what that is and in revelation 10 7 it
[1:44:35] says
[1:44:36] but in the days as we just as we just
[1:44:38] read here early at the beginning
[1:44:40] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:44:41] seventh angel
[1:44:43] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:44:46] of god
[1:44:47] should be finished and he shall declare
[1:44:50] to his servants the prophets
[1:44:51] so so when people ask why do you believe
[1:44:53] in a prophet why do you believe in the
[1:44:55] mysteries because
[1:44:56] it is in the word it has been revealed
[1:44:59] revelations 10
[1:45:00] 7 the third pool the mystery had been
[1:45:03] vindicated
[1:45:04] were in the vision and it's time for
[1:45:06] jack to step into
[1:45:08] the vision amen do you believe that
[1:45:10] we're not
[1:45:11] we are moving forward into this vision
[1:45:13] keep on stepping forward into the vision
[1:45:16] keep marching forward into the vision
[1:45:18] that has been
[1:45:19] vindicated by the word and he said
[1:45:23] what is this attraction on the mount so
[1:45:24] i've got my mind
[1:45:26] set on this message do you have your
[1:45:28] mind set on this message this morning
[1:45:31] that's the third pool it's that one i
[1:45:34] must be
[1:45:34] loyal and reverent to so
[1:45:37] so so he says he has his mind set on the
[1:45:40] message and he must be
[1:45:41] loyal and reverent to but listen to this
[1:45:45] by faith he's so adjourned in the land
[1:45:47] of promise as an estranged country
[1:45:49] and going back here in hebrews dwelling
[1:45:51] in the tabernacles with isaac and jacob
[1:45:53] the heirs with him
[1:45:54] of the same promise for he looked for a
[1:45:57] city
[1:45:58] which had no foundations whose builder
[1:46:00] and maker
[1:46:01] is god so he's looking for a
[1:46:04] city whose builder and maker is god
[1:46:08] we're looking for a city whose builder
[1:46:09] and maker is god i just wanna
[1:46:12] i just hope this encourages you this
[1:46:14] morning to keep marching forward keep
[1:46:16] pressing forward
[1:46:17] and to step into the vision keep
[1:46:20] stepping
[1:46:20] keep keep on your step don't get out of
[1:46:23] line but keep
[1:46:24] marching forward into the promise amen
[1:46:27] god bless you
[1:46:29] god bless you brother jack
[1:46:48] let's give the lord another hand of
[1:46:52] praise
[1:46:54] um i just noticed brother caleb um
[1:46:57] did something that i i do he has a
[1:46:59] little timer
[1:47:00] that he put on his phone uh for
[1:47:03] um for ministering is this mine of yours
[1:47:08] okay uh and uh and i love that i like i
[1:47:11] i
[1:47:11] he you know i like when when ministers
[1:47:15] can do two things bring us
[1:47:19] some truth and follow directions
[1:47:24] that mean a lot to me that that shows
[1:47:26] you trustworthy when they're in the
[1:47:27] pulpit
[1:47:28] and and and i'm sitting here blowing
[1:47:30] away a 17 year old brother
[1:47:33] talking us about this third pool
[1:47:38] all right and stepping into a vision i
[1:47:41] say well praise god
[1:47:43] uh you know this you know i i'm as i was
[1:47:46] sitting there i was just thinking i want
[1:47:47] my daughter
[1:47:48] sarah to just come um she's going to
[1:47:50] sing a song for us amen this morning
[1:47:53] but uh but there as i'm sitting there
[1:47:55] looking at it
[1:47:56] it came back to my mind you know we
[1:47:58] talked about this the fourth generation
[1:48:01] because what happens is that when it
[1:48:03] gets to the fourth generation
[1:48:05] brother branham tells us that they're
[1:48:06] just embers
[1:48:08] uh actually no no vestige of the flame
[1:48:11] no vestige of the original flame
[1:48:13] and it says uh you know when you get
[1:48:14] there it looks like a very sad state and
[1:48:17] and we've seen that uh some of the
[1:48:19] younger ministers
[1:48:20] amen that were under us and uh getting
[1:48:23] caught up in what the brother was
[1:48:24] talking about
[1:48:26] right caught up in the nonsense right i
[1:48:29] mean
[1:48:29] you know it's not based on your opinion
[1:48:32] this message was vindicated before
[1:48:33] i was born right you know so so so but
[1:48:37] it was it was a spirit that we need to
[1:48:39] recognize that comes into the land
[1:48:41] and it attacks a particular generation
[1:48:45] right that that's that's that's the
[1:48:47] thing that we didn't catch
[1:48:48] it's a spirit attacking a generation and
[1:48:51] they get they get caught underneath that
[1:48:52] spirit but we've been told
[1:48:54] press right press through the midst of
[1:48:57] all of that
[1:48:58] don't look to this and don't look to
[1:48:59] that but press through that right
[1:49:01] and that's what we're doing and then i
[1:49:03] look here because at the end of that
[1:49:04] quote brother branham
[1:49:06] says no vestige of the original flame
[1:49:08] and then they put a period there
[1:49:10] and the next statement is then
[1:49:14] god lights the fire
[1:49:17] again when i'm looking at young men like
[1:49:19] this coming up i say the fire
[1:49:22] has been lit again
[1:49:27] oh my god is good moving forward in the
[1:49:30] promise god bless you brother caleb we
[1:49:32] we really appreciate that
[1:49:34] amen on today i asked my daughter to

[2:02:06] has placed on my heart
[2:02:08] if we could turn to matthew chapter 26

[2:02:16] so i'd like to open today
[2:02:25] hey man you love the lord
[2:02:30] in verse 36 matthew chapter 6 26
[2:02:34] 36 says then jesus then cometh jesus
[2:02:37] with them unto a place called gethsemane
[2:02:40] and saith unto the disciples sit ye here
[2:02:42] will i go and pray yonder
[2:02:44] and he took with him peter and the two
[2:02:46] sons of zebedee and began to be
[2:02:48] sorrowful
[2:02:49] and very heavy then saith he unto them
[2:02:51] my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto
[2:02:53] death
[2:02:54] tear ye here and watch with me
[2:02:58] and he went a little farther and fell on
[2:02:59] his face and prayed saying o my father
[2:03:01] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[2:03:03] me
[2:03:04] nevertheless not as i will but as thou
[2:03:07] wilt
[2:03:08] and he cometh unto the disciples and
[2:03:10] findeth them asleep
[2:03:12] and saith unto peter what could you not
[2:03:13] watch with me one hour
[2:03:15] watch and pray that ye enter not into
[2:03:17] temptation the spirit indeed is willing
[2:03:19] but the flesh is weak
[2:03:21] he went away again the second time and
[2:03:23] prayed saying o my father if this cup
[2:03:25] may not pass away from me except i drink
[2:03:28] it thy will be done and he came and
[2:03:30] found them asleep again for their eyes
[2:03:32] were heavy
[2:03:33] and he left them and went away again and
[2:03:34] prayed a third time saying the same
[2:03:36] words
[2:03:38] we could all just bow our heads for a
[2:03:39] word of prayer

[2:04:12] jesus name
[2:04:13] amen so my title this morning
[2:04:18] is called the darkest day of your life
[2:04:21] don't worry it's not quite as sad and
[2:04:23] gloomy as it sounds
[2:04:25] but that's what i want to title it
[2:04:27] because this verse we just read
[2:04:29] talks about the darkest day of jesus's
[2:04:32] life
[2:04:33] and many times we would think of the
[2:04:36] darkest point of jesus's life as when he
[2:04:38] was on the cross and you could say that
[2:04:40] but
[2:04:42] this point in the garden of gethsemane
[2:04:44] was really when
[2:04:46] the defining moment came where that was
[2:04:48] what decided whether he was going to go
[2:04:50] to the cross or not so that was really
[2:04:52] where
[2:04:53] his darkest most intense moment was was
[2:04:56] in the garden of gethsemane
[2:04:58] brother branham says in a conference
[2:05:01] with god in 1959 he says
[2:05:05] after after the supper that night they
[2:05:07] crossed over a little brook said drenin
[2:05:08] or somewhere
[2:05:09] and went across the brook and went into
[2:05:11] a garden called gethsemane
[2:05:13] they they had to have a conference god
[2:05:15] and christ had to talk it over
[2:05:17] the lamb and the dove had to sit
[2:05:18] together it was the dove that had to
[2:05:20] talk to the lamb
[2:05:21] and it was the lamb's death then a
[2:05:23] little farther down
[2:05:24] the same quote he says and in that
[2:05:27] conference
[2:05:28] such a decision was made until blood
[2:05:30] dropped from his brow
[2:05:31] he was under a strain the sins of the
[2:05:33] world it was upon him
[2:05:34] and then he looked into the face of the
[2:05:36] dove and said not my will
[2:05:38] but thy will be done so this was jesus's
[2:05:43] you could say the man jesus his defining
[2:05:45] moment where
[2:05:46] every part of him was fully surrendered
[2:05:51] in the in the man part of jesus we know
[2:05:53] he was fully man and fully god but the
[2:05:54] man part of jesus still had to die to
[2:05:56] the spirit
[2:05:58] so just as each one of us
[2:06:02] we often talk about a back side of the
[2:06:04] desert experience and going out and
[2:06:05] meeting god just like moses did
[2:06:07] and the message becoming real to us and
[2:06:09] jesus becoming real to us and us
[2:06:12] having experience and being filled with
[2:06:13] the holy ghost and knowing that
[2:06:16] god is real and that we have an
[2:06:18] experience and that nothing can ever
[2:06:19] separate us or or convince us away from
[2:06:23] our experience with god
[2:06:25] just as we all have to have that kind of
[2:06:26] experience all of us
[2:06:28] who have had that experience will then
[2:06:30] come to a similar garden of gethsemane
[2:06:32] experience as jesus had where
[2:06:36] our backside of the desert experience is
[2:06:37] put to the test
[2:06:39] and we're going to see how much we
[2:06:41] really died to ourselves and god's going
[2:06:43] to show us hey
[2:06:44] you're not quite dead yet there's still
[2:06:47] some of you that might be kicking and
[2:06:48] screaming a little bit
[2:06:50] so we have to have that same conference
[2:06:52] with god that jesus did where we can say
[2:06:54] lord not my will but thy will be done
[2:06:57] often what gets us to this point is some
[2:07:00] trials that will make us realize
[2:07:02] there's still some flesh i need to deal
[2:07:10] with and so many times
[2:07:13] a trial would come and we would have a
[2:07:15] really difficult time with it
[2:07:17] often in a very intense trial it might
[2:07:19] feel like
[2:07:20] like what have we done wrong to deserve
[2:07:22] this trial or we feel like god has just
[2:07:24] left us and left us with this
[2:07:26] trial and you know that it's our fault
[2:07:29] or we've done something horribly wrong
[2:07:31] or
[2:07:31] why would he do this to us but really
[2:07:33] what it is god wants to show us
[2:07:35] something like just brother caleb was
[2:07:37] talking about when the
[2:07:38] when the graves are pressed and when the
[2:07:39] olives are pressed it's because he wants
[2:07:41] to bring something out of them
[2:07:43] amen so when the pressure comes it's not
[2:07:45] because
[2:07:46] god's mean or god wants to just throw us
[2:07:49] out on our own but really what it is
[2:07:51] there's something in us that god really
[2:07:53] wants to bring out
[2:07:55] so what it is is it's god's plan to
[2:07:58] bring us to perfection
[2:08:01] if you never had any trials in your life
[2:08:05] how would you ever grow closer to the
[2:08:07] lord if everything came easy and
[2:08:08] everything was just a flowery bed of
[2:08:10] ease
[2:08:11] there'd be no need to grow because you
[2:08:13] could just have
[2:08:15] everything right then and you'd have
[2:08:17] never have to work for something
[2:08:19] make sure i don't get ahead of myself
[2:08:21] here that's towards the end but um
[2:08:24] so even though we may not realize that
[2:08:26] god is always teaching us something
[2:08:27] specific
[2:08:28] through each trial right so
[2:08:31] if we look at different stories of
[2:08:33] different people in scripture that had
[2:08:34] trials
[2:08:35] we can see there's a there's a common
[2:08:38] pattern that
[2:08:38] is similar among some of those stories
[2:08:41] so
[2:08:42] for example i'm going to look at jesus
[2:08:44] story and joseph's story so in the story
[2:08:46] of jesus
[2:08:48] he starts along in his journey and
[2:08:50] everything's going fine he goes
[2:08:52] and he's baptized by john he starts his
[2:08:55] ministry
[2:08:56] there's a little bit of adversity with
[2:08:58] the pharisees you know but generally and
[2:09:00] then there's miracles and
[2:09:01] then everything seems to be going really
[2:09:03] well and his ministry is going along
[2:09:06] great
[2:09:06] but then it comes down to the real trial
[2:09:09] so his
[2:09:10] his ministry's been going a long great
[2:09:11] it's been three and a half years
[2:09:13] and then he gets to gethsemane when the
[2:09:15] real point
[2:09:16] the maker break point is coming and then
[2:09:19] after that make a break point then he
[2:09:20] goes down to the cross
[2:09:23] then after the cross we see he descends
[2:09:25] down to hell where it's you can't get
[2:09:27] any lower than that
[2:09:28] and then he puts the devil in his place
[2:09:30] while he's down there and then ascends
[2:09:32] back up to heaven with the keys of death
[2:09:33] in hell
[2:09:35] so we see that you know it started off
[2:09:37] well and then right before the
[2:09:39] right right at the defining moment was
[2:09:42] the biggest trial he had ever went
[2:09:43] through in his life
[2:09:45] i never would go through and then we see
[2:09:48] that he rises back up out of that trial
[2:09:52] stronger than he was before because he
[2:09:54] rises back up to heaven
[2:09:59] that darkest hour is really when the
[2:10:00] death of jesus happened
[2:10:02] the death of jesus the man jesus was not
[2:10:04] on the cross the death of the man jesus
[2:10:06] was in gethsemane because
[2:10:07] after gethsemane there was no man part
[2:10:09] of jesus left
[2:10:10] to to fight with the spirit
[2:10:17] not not to not to diminish the fact that
[2:10:19] jesus was fully god as we believe but
[2:10:21] just there was still a flesh part about
[2:10:23] him
[2:10:24] that he had to make sure was fully dead
[2:10:28] if we look at if we look at joseph's
[2:10:30] story we see the same thing can
[2:10:32] happen there it starts off well he had
[2:10:35] he had some dreams his father was happy
[2:10:37] with the dreams
[2:10:39] until his father was included in one of
[2:10:40] the dreams then he wasn't quite as happy
[2:10:41] about it
[2:10:42] uh but we see it started off fairly well
[2:10:45] you know
[2:10:45] but then his brothers aren't too happy
[2:10:47] with the dreams either and then they
[2:10:48] sell him into slavery
[2:10:50] you know and so then he goes to
[2:10:51] potiphar's house and it's not too great
[2:10:52] but he gets promoted to the top
[2:10:54] potiphar's house so it's he's he's doing
[2:10:56] okay he's doing okay
[2:10:59] then it really comes and he gets thrown
[2:11:00] into jail potiphar's wife accuses him
[2:11:02] and he's thrown into jail
[2:11:04] can't get much lower than he actually is
[2:11:07] but while he's
[2:11:08] in jail while he's down there at his
[2:11:10] lowest moment
[2:11:11] something in there happens that later
[2:11:13] allows him to rise and become second to
[2:11:15] fair
[2:11:16] if it hadn't been for what happened in
[2:11:17] the jail where he was able to interpret
[2:11:20] the dreams
[2:11:20] of the baker and the butler pharaoh
[2:11:23] would have never known
[2:11:24] about his gift he would have never had
[2:11:26] the practice with his gift
[2:11:28] to be able to exercise it maybe he
[2:11:30] wouldn't have been as good when
[2:11:31] as as as good at getting himself out of
[2:11:33] the way and using that gift
[2:11:35] when he needed to interpret pharaoh's
[2:11:37] dreams so we recognize that
[2:11:40] in those darkest trials we get something
[2:11:43] that holds us and gives us and equips us
[2:11:45] with what we need
[2:11:47] and all throughout joseph's story we see
[2:11:51] in potiphar's house
[2:11:53] he was promoted and he learned how to
[2:11:55] manage potiphar's house
[2:11:57] in the jail he went down to the jail but
[2:11:59] then he was promoted in the jail and he
[2:12:00] learned how to manage
[2:12:01] jail and get figure out how to get that
[2:12:04] working smoothly and how to get all the
[2:12:06] business running correctly and
[2:12:08] if he hadn't learned any of that it
[2:12:11] would have been a lot more difficult for
[2:12:12] him when he
[2:12:12] had to basically run all of egypt in
[2:12:15] that time he learned the skills
[2:12:17] he would later need in his life when he
[2:12:20] needed to
[2:12:20] basically rule egypt
[2:12:24] the lord the lord had blessed him with
[2:12:26] wisdom that was beyond himself we
[2:12:27] recognize this but still he
[2:12:29] learned and got the experience
[2:12:31] throughout those trials and dark times
[2:12:33] that
[2:12:34] he needed to be able to better
[2:12:38] to be able to better run egypt later in
[2:12:40] his life
[2:12:44] in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 13
[2:12:47] it says every man's work shall be made
[2:12:51] manifest
[2:12:52] for the day shall declare it because it
[2:12:53] shall be revealed by fire
[2:12:55] and the fire shall try every man's work
[2:12:57] of what sort it is
[2:12:59] so we realize that when we go through
[2:13:02] the fire
[2:13:03] it really reveals what we are and what
[2:13:05] our character is the fire revealed
[2:13:08] what sort of character these two men had
[2:13:11] when jesus went into the garden it
[2:13:12] revealed that jesus was the son of god
[2:13:15] and that he was able
[2:13:16] to get himself out of the way when
[2:13:18] joseph went through the fire
[2:13:19] in potiphar's house and in the prison it
[2:13:22] revealed
[2:13:23] that he had something on the inside of
[2:13:25] him that god had placed the seed down on
[2:13:27] the inside of him that he had very godly
[2:13:29] character because otherwise if he'd went
[2:13:31] if he had went through the uh the fire
[2:13:33] and not reacted well and been very angry
[2:13:35] and upset at his brothers
[2:13:38] why would he have been promoted
[2:13:42] one of the sermons my dad often preaches
[2:13:44] he tells the story he goes and throws
[2:13:46] and tells the story of joseph and he's
[2:13:47] just like
[2:13:48] and joseph is sold into slavery he gets
[2:13:51] into potiphar's house when he's on the
[2:13:53] slave market and potiphar goes to buy
[2:13:54] him and he goes
[2:13:55] he sees joseph and joseph is just
[2:13:56] sitting there like this
[2:13:59] so angry at my brothers can't believe
[2:14:01] they did that to me
[2:14:03] and that's why potiphar of course really
[2:14:05] wanted he's like i like this slave
[2:14:07] there's something different about this
[2:14:10] slave
[2:14:12] there's something different no that's
[2:14:15] not what it was with joseph because
[2:14:17] through the fire it revealed what
[2:14:18] character he had
[2:14:20] similar with sitting in the jail he
[2:14:22] wasn't just sitting in the jail on the
[2:14:24] rock going
[2:14:25] can't believe this has happened to me
[2:14:27] this is dumb
[2:14:28] i just this is terrible nothing is ever
[2:14:32] good everything is terrible no
[2:14:35] because then the jailer looks at him and
[2:14:37] sees him in that state and goes yes i
[2:14:38] want you to run the prison
[2:14:40] no we can see that he had a good
[2:14:42] attitude throughout this because
[2:14:46] the fire revealed what sort of character
[2:14:48] he had
[2:14:51] in the same way in the in a similar way
[2:14:53] with job it revealed what sort of
[2:14:54] character job had
[2:14:56] when job went through all his trials we
[2:14:58] see that there was something real on the
[2:15:00] inside of job
[2:15:02] often god knows how strong we are god
[2:15:05] always god knows everything he knows our
[2:15:07] character he knows what
[2:15:08] will happen but he often wants us to
[2:15:10] recognize that as well
[2:15:11] we don't often realize just how strong
[2:15:13] we are to be able to handle a trial
[2:15:16] so then god will allow something to come
[2:15:18] into our lives to show us
[2:15:19] just how strong we are the fire revealed
[2:15:23] what sort of character that the three
[2:15:24] hebrew children had quite literally
[2:15:27] they went through the fire and we saw
[2:15:29] that they weren't going to bow
[2:15:31] that through the fire through it all
[2:15:34] they would still stand for the lord
[2:15:37] so we see that in every person every one
[2:15:39] of these persons lives
[2:15:41] there was a defining moment where they
[2:15:43] had a very dark day it was the darkest
[2:15:45] day
[2:15:46] each of those times god planned that
[2:15:48] darkest day for each one of them
[2:15:50] god plans everyone's darkest day he
[2:15:53] planned joseph's darkest day when he was
[2:15:54] thrown into prison
[2:15:55] he planned jesus darkest day when he
[2:15:57] would be in gethsemane and on the cross
[2:16:01] and he'll plan yours and he knows
[2:16:04] he knows through that he has determined
[2:16:07] what will happen in that
[2:16:08] moment where it will give you what you
[2:16:10] need to go through life
[2:16:12] and he has equipped you for that darkest
[2:16:14] day he's not going to plan that darkest
[2:16:16] day and send you to it without any
[2:16:17] preparation you'll have preparation
[2:16:19] before that
[2:16:19] when you get there you will have what
[2:16:21] you need
[2:16:25] so looking at good friday the darkest
[2:16:28] day for jesus we recognize that was a
[2:16:30] terrible day
[2:16:31] it was the worst day in history i can't
[2:16:34] think you can't think of anything else
[2:16:36] you could say that would be worse than
[2:16:37] good friday where they literally killed
[2:16:39] the son of god
[2:16:40] but that was necessary that day was
[2:16:44] absolutely necessary if it wasn't for
[2:16:46] good friday we wouldn't have had the day
[2:16:48] of pentecost
[2:16:50] if it wasn't for good friday we would
[2:16:52] not have had the many outpourings of the
[2:16:53] holy ghost later because jesus had to
[2:16:55] die
[2:16:56] and we wouldn't if it hadn't been for
[2:16:57] good friday all of us would still be in
[2:16:59] sin and there would be no blood
[2:17:01] for us so often
[2:17:04] we go through dark times and we wonder
[2:17:06] why is this happening to me
[2:17:08] but sometimes those times are necessary
[2:17:11] that we can have an experience with the
[2:17:14] lord sometimes those times are necessary
[2:17:16] to equip us in our lives
[2:17:20] uh talking to my dad about when i was
[2:17:23] studying a bit
[2:17:24] over the past few weeks for this and
[2:17:27] gave me a line that he had been
[2:17:29] he had written down one time and he
[2:17:31] hadn't had a chance to use it yet so he
[2:17:32] said i could use it as long as i
[2:17:34] as as long as i as long as i cited where
[2:17:37] i got it from
[2:17:40] so he said the divine plan of god worked
[2:17:44] flawlessly on good friday
[2:17:46] and it was glorious looking back that's
[2:17:49] what we see about good friday
[2:17:51] that's not what the disciples felt like
[2:17:53] on saturday
[2:17:54] sitting there on saturday often it's
[2:17:57] more than just the one experience
[2:17:59] that's the one trial often the trial
[2:18:01] lasts a while and there's lasting
[2:18:03] effects of that trial you're sitting
[2:18:04] under the middle of that trial
[2:18:07] just almost despairing going how am i
[2:18:10] ever going to come through this how am i
[2:18:11] ever going to come out of this
[2:18:12] imagine the disciples on saturday they
[2:18:15] must have been
[2:18:16] on the verge of doubting everything they
[2:18:18] must sitting there going
[2:18:19] they've killed jesus i thought he was
[2:18:22] the one
[2:18:22] i don't understand if he was really the
[2:18:26] son of god would he have let them kill
[2:18:27] him like that and
[2:18:28] but they so they were sitting there
[2:18:30] going i don't understand
[2:18:33] and they needed something because at
[2:18:36] that point
[2:18:36] this the holy spirit hadn't come back
[2:18:38] yet so they were sitting there waiting
[2:18:40] going
[2:18:40] god what is your plan what is going on
[2:18:43] but then sunday came and they realized
[2:18:46] okay i understand now this is why that
[2:18:49] had happened then the day of pentecost
[2:18:51] came and they realized oh
[2:18:53] it's been a long time and i've gotten
[2:18:55] i've gotten through that trial but now
[2:18:57] now i really understand why that had to
[2:18:59] happen so i could have this experience
[2:19:01] right now
[2:19:02] if it wasn't for good friday i wouldn't
[2:19:04] have been able to get the holy ghost
[2:19:05] like i am right
[2:19:06] now in the upper room amen
[2:19:12] so um let's see here
[2:19:17] in the resurrection of lazarus brother
[2:19:21] in 1951 brother branham speaking of
[2:19:23] lazarus he says
[2:19:24] and so the breadwinner was gone then
[2:19:26] dark time
[2:19:27] the second day passed they went to the
[2:19:29] grave and mourned
[2:19:31] the third day passed the fourth day
[2:19:33] passed corruption sets in 72 hours three
[2:19:36] days and nights
[2:19:36] the skin worms was working through his
[2:19:38] body all hopes was gone
[2:19:40] darkest hour the little family had ever
[2:19:41] seen
[2:19:43] did you ever hit that hour i've hit it
[2:19:45] in our home loved ones be taken away in
[2:19:47] darkness
[2:19:48] darkest hour the little family had ever
[2:19:49] seen and then jesus comes along
[2:19:52] he usually comes along when the darkest
[2:19:54] hour when it's the darkest hour
[2:19:56] he's not going to leave you alone in the
[2:19:58] darkest hour sometimes at the beginning
[2:20:00] of it
[2:20:01] it'll feel like you're alone because god
[2:20:02] needs you to realize
[2:20:05] something about yourself and something
[2:20:06] that needs to die inside of you still
[2:20:09] and how that you still need to trust him
[2:20:12] he's going to sometimes leave you
[2:20:13] somewhere
[2:20:14] just where you just need to learn to
[2:20:16] trust him
[2:20:19] [Music]
[2:20:28] um i don't have this one exactly in my
[2:20:32] notes i did this
[2:20:32] at i did this at home so some of the
[2:20:35] ones visiting from here have kind of
[2:20:36] seen this demonstration before
[2:20:38] uh but i think i'm hopefully it'll be
[2:20:42] a little bit different of an angle i'm
[2:20:43] gonna sit at the piano and do a little
[2:20:45] something here
[2:20:46] so hopefully this works out well
[2:20:49] i'm gonna use this orange mic if that's
[2:20:51] okay
[2:20:54] i need both my hands
[2:21:08] praise the lord
[2:21:15] we'll get this figured out okay
[2:21:19] so many times
[2:21:23] in the dark times of our lives we don't
[2:21:24] realize why they're there
[2:21:26] and so let's take this for example say
[2:21:29] this is a dark time
[2:21:32] that sounds terrible there's certain
[2:21:33] there's certain intervals on the piano
[2:21:35] they sound terrible
[2:21:40] ow why
[2:21:42] [Music]
[2:21:46] like why some if you if i would just sit
[2:21:48] there and play those intervals you would
[2:21:49] go
[2:21:51] you would go why are you playing these
[2:21:52] these sound terrible what is the point
[2:21:54] of these
[2:21:57] what if i was to play
[2:22:10] you'd never know that there was a lot of
[2:22:11] those intervals in that
[2:22:13] they were necessary to make the whole
[2:22:15] story that much more beautiful
[2:22:20] we get there and we sit there and
[2:22:21] sometimes we're playing
[2:22:26] and we hit something in our lives
[2:22:30] and we don't understand why and it
[2:22:33] sounds
[2:22:34] awful but then god works it out
[2:22:38] that's the way it was meant to be the
[2:22:40] whole time and maybe
[2:22:42] in the moment you don't realize it
[2:22:47] it sounds terrible and you're sitting
[2:22:49] there going why god is my life this way
[2:22:52] why has this happened but then god works
[2:22:56] it back around
[2:22:56] into his plan and it was his plan the
[2:22:58] whole time
[2:23:00] working out in his perfect way to where
[2:23:02] you may not have known
[2:23:04] during the time when it hit just why it
[2:23:07] was there
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:10] but then when it works out
[2:23:13] the way god intended it to the whole
[2:23:15] time you recognize
[2:23:17] there was a reason for that trial and
[2:23:19] there was a reason that god had placed
[2:23:21] that in my life
[2:23:29] you know and think about think about
[2:23:32] uh lazarus and mary and martha after in
[2:23:35] the dark time
[2:23:36] after lazarus is dead and they're
[2:23:38] sitting there for three four days
[2:23:39] waiting on jesus going
[2:23:41] when is jesus gonna come and help us
[2:23:43] through this trial i feel so alone i
[2:23:45] feel forsaken
[2:23:46] but then jesus comes he never actually
[2:23:49] left them forsaken
[2:23:51] he just knew that they needed some time
[2:23:53] to sit and think about it for a little
[2:23:55] while
[2:23:55] but then he came and it was that much
[2:23:58] better
[2:24:00] because he waited do you think
[2:24:04] after that experience they ever doubted
[2:24:06] especially lazarus
[2:24:08] you think he ever doubted who jesus was
[2:24:11] mary and martha their brother was dead
[2:24:13] and in the grave for four days and then
[2:24:15] comes walking out do you think they ever
[2:24:17] doubted who jesus was after that
[2:24:19] experience
[2:24:23] so we recognize that all these things
[2:24:25] are for our perfection
[2:24:28] um brother wendell martin he was
[2:24:32] preaching in
[2:24:33] uh in virginia i think was about a month
[2:24:35] ago a month and a half something like
[2:24:36] that and he
[2:24:37] he said this and it really struck me and
[2:24:40] it kind of was
[2:24:41] the central building point for this
[2:24:43] sermon was
[2:24:44] he says he said the scar in adam's side
[2:24:48] was a must to bring out the perfection
[2:24:50] with eve
[2:24:51] the scar in jesus side was a must to
[2:24:54] bring out our perfection
[2:24:56] so we recognize that these scars many
[2:24:58] times the scars in our lives
[2:25:00] are a must to bring out the perfection
[2:25:03] you know we go over in the scars
[2:25:06] the scars in our life
[2:25:10] are the must to bring out the perfection
[2:25:12] of what it's supposed to be
[2:25:14] think of michelangelo's moses sculpture
[2:25:18] it wasn't perfect until after he struck
[2:25:20] it he shouted speak moses and put the
[2:25:22] scar in the knee then it was perfect
[2:25:27] brother branham talks about the stories
[2:25:29] of the gold beaters beating the gold
[2:25:32] in in 1957 and why some people can't
[2:25:35] keep the victory
[2:25:36] he says in the bible times when the gold
[2:25:39] beater used to be
[2:25:40] they used to take the gold before they
[2:25:41] had the smelters and the beater would
[2:25:43] beat the gold turn it over beat it and
[2:25:45] beat it till they beat all the dross out
[2:25:47] of it
[2:25:48] and how he knew that it got down to
[2:25:50] really good gold all the pyrite and
[2:25:52] fool's gold and so forth was beat out of
[2:25:53] it
[2:25:54] the beater could see the reflection of
[2:25:56] himself in it
[2:25:57] then he knowed he had it clean listen my
[2:26:00] dear friends
[2:26:00] today the holy spirit which is the
[2:26:02] beater will beat the church with the
[2:26:04] gospel till the reflection of jesus
[2:26:06] christ
[2:26:06] shines into the church then she's pure
[2:26:09] again
[2:26:10] that's right we've got too much pyrite
[2:26:12] and copper and other things in us yet
[2:26:14] so many times this is what the dark
[2:26:15] times of our trials are
[2:26:17] it's just god showing hey there's still
[2:26:19] some of your flesh in the way and we've
[2:26:20] got to get your flesh out of the way
[2:26:22] and he wants us to be more like him so
[2:26:24] that
[2:26:26] it may not be great when we're when
[2:26:28] we're sitting there the gold getting
[2:26:30] beat over and over but then
[2:26:32] how great is it when we when all the
[2:26:34] dross is beat out of us all the pyrite
[2:26:36] is gone and we just
[2:26:37] are a perfect reflection of jesus christ
[2:26:41] and the church age book in the late
[2:26:43] ocean church age brother branham says
[2:26:45] but there is a gold of god
[2:26:46] first peter 1 7. that is the tr that the
[2:26:49] trial of your faith
[2:26:50] being much more precious than of gold
[2:26:51] that perisheth the gold of god is a
[2:26:53] christ-like character
[2:26:55] produced in the fiery furnace of
[2:26:56] affliction that is the right kind of
[2:26:58] gold
[2:26:59] so when brother branham speaks of the
[2:27:01] gold it's our christ-like character
[2:27:04] it takes being tried in the fire to
[2:27:06] produce that character i was looking up
[2:27:07] this morning of how
[2:27:09] how that they would go about refining
[2:27:10] gold
[2:27:12] and they take the gold um sometimes
[2:27:14] people will will
[2:27:16] sell their gold jewelry or things or any
[2:27:19] old
[2:27:19] watches or whatever um to
[2:27:23] to be repurposed and they'll sell them
[2:27:24] and so what they'll do is they'll go and
[2:27:26] they'll take them and they'll melt it
[2:27:27] down
[2:27:28] they have to because when it's crafted
[2:27:30] when the gold is crafted into those
[2:27:32] different
[2:27:33] different things the the jewelry or
[2:27:35] whatever
[2:27:36] it is mixed with other things
[2:27:40] so when the refiners have to go and get
[2:27:42] the gold back out of it to remake it
[2:27:44] into something
[2:27:45] they have to put it in a furnace they
[2:27:48] have to heat it up
[2:27:49] a lot because then when it's heated up
[2:27:51] to the melting point
[2:27:52] all the other metals just separate away
[2:27:55] they will melt away and the gold will
[2:27:56] melt away and they'll
[2:27:58] separate so that it's just you have
[2:27:59] you're left with the pure gold
[2:28:03] in the ephesian church age in the church
[2:28:05] age book brother branham says
[2:28:08] but not only is the candlestick of gold
[2:28:09] is of beaten gold
[2:28:11] handcrafted of beaten gold according to
[2:28:13] her blueprints which were spirit given
[2:28:15] outside of her lord and master jesus
[2:28:17] christ was ever a people so beaten and
[2:28:20] purged as the bride of jesus christ
[2:28:22] surely she is filling up the sufferings
[2:28:24] that christ has left behind
[2:28:25] her goods are despoiled her life is in
[2:28:27] jeopardy she is accounted as
[2:28:29] sheep for the slaughter she's killed all
[2:28:31] the day long she suffers much
[2:28:33] but in it all retaliates not neither
[2:28:36] does she cause others to suffer
[2:28:38] worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[2:28:39] bride of christ and as gold is malleable
[2:28:42] whereas brass will break with the
[2:28:43] beating this gold of god
[2:28:45] will bear her suffering for the lord not
[2:28:48] bowed not
[2:28:49] broken not destroyed but formed
[2:28:52] as a thing of beauty and a joy forever
[2:28:54] by the trials and testings of this life
[2:28:56] often this is really difficult to
[2:28:58] recognize the trials of our life as a
[2:29:00] joy
[2:29:01] especially in the trial it's really
[2:29:02] difficult sometimes you're in the trial
[2:29:04] and you're getting beat
[2:29:07] it's really difficult to recognize this
[2:29:08] as a joy
[2:29:10] but then when we realize it was god
[2:29:12] forming us and we look back through the
[2:29:14] trial
[2:29:15] and i see i was that way before the
[2:29:17] trial and then the trial came
[2:29:19] and now i am that much closer to christ
[2:29:21] because of how i've been molded on this
[2:29:22] side of the trial
[2:29:24] on this way over here i was a little
[2:29:26] farther from christ i had some more of
[2:29:28] my flesh still in me
[2:29:29] but then i went into the trial and it
[2:29:31] was terrible
[2:29:32] and my flesh did not enjoy this trial
[2:29:35] one bit but god
[2:29:36] was there and he was cutting away at the
[2:29:37] flesh getting more and more removed from
[2:29:40] me
[2:29:40] now over here i am that much closer to
[2:29:42] god
[2:29:44] think of the hebrew children what
[2:29:46] happened when the hebrew children went
[2:29:47] into the furnace
[2:29:49] their bonds fell off when were the
[2:29:53] hebrew children the freest
[2:29:55] when they were in the fire they were
[2:29:59] bound before they went into the fire
[2:30:01] then they went into the fire and their
[2:30:02] captors died
[2:30:04] and they were free through the fire
[2:30:07] after they came out of the fire i really
[2:30:09] doubt their captors tried to bind them
[2:30:11] and throw them back in
[2:30:14] their bonds fell off in the fire
[2:30:20] but many so many times this happens and
[2:30:22] we get into trial and we just
[2:30:24] many times our flesh just wants to
[2:30:26] shrivel up and go oh it's so terrible
[2:30:28] god
[2:30:28] god doesn't even love me why should i
[2:30:30] even try anymore this trial is so
[2:30:32] terrible
[2:30:32] i've been praying for two weeks and
[2:30:34] nothing has changed why
[2:30:36] what it really is is god does love you
[2:30:38] and he wants to teach you some patience
[2:30:40] or he wants to teach you some virtue
[2:30:42] that you need more of and because he
[2:30:45] knows what your character is and what
[2:30:47] your weak spots are so he wants to
[2:30:49] strengthen your weak spots
[2:30:53] because sometimes sometimes we're not
[2:30:55] just delivered right off the bat
[2:30:57] of something sometimes we have to fight
[2:30:59] through to get the victory
[2:31:01] because we need to learn something in
[2:31:04] the marriage of the lamb in 1962
[2:31:08] brother branham says but that's up to
[2:31:09] you see you've got something to do too
[2:31:12] they that overcome shall inherit all
[2:31:14] things they that over to come
[2:31:16] you have power to do it but you must be
[2:31:18] willing to lay it down
[2:31:19] see she has made herself ready i like
[2:31:21] that word you see god could not push us
[2:31:23] through a little pipe
[2:31:24] pull us out on the other end and then
[2:31:26] say blessed is he that overcometh
[2:31:28] you had nothing to overcome you just
[2:31:30] pushed he just pushed you through
[2:31:32] but you've got to make decisions for
[2:31:34] yourself i've got to make decisions for
[2:31:36] myself
[2:31:36] in doing that we show our faith and
[2:31:38] respects to god
[2:31:40] so god's not just gonna push us through
[2:31:43] the trials
[2:31:44] come on this side say here's the trial
[2:31:46] okay here go into this trial okay here
[2:31:48] i'm gonna take you out you really didn't
[2:31:49] spend any time in the trial
[2:31:50] but you got through the trial no he's
[2:31:52] gonna put us in there
[2:31:54] and then we've gotta get to a place to
[2:31:55] where we trust god and we say lord in
[2:31:57] your good timing
[2:31:59] i know i'll get through this trial
[2:32:02] we're not we're not all just babies that
[2:32:06] god's going to push along in life
[2:32:07] through a stroller
[2:32:08] we're not just sitting in there letting
[2:32:10] god push us along we've got to grow up
[2:32:12] we make maybe we'll start in our
[2:32:13] christian walk and we'll start there
[2:32:15] but then we have to learn to walk and
[2:32:17] god expects us to go and walk a little
[2:32:19] bit ourselves
[2:32:20] maybe we may trip and fall a little bit
[2:32:22] as we're learning to walk
[2:32:24] but then god will just pick us back up
[2:32:26] and say here my child i'll help you
[2:32:28] i'll help you learn to walk and then as
[2:32:30] we get better and better at it
[2:32:32] he allows us to just start walking and
[2:32:34] then
[2:32:35] as brother branham preaches on why
[2:32:37] christ speak
[2:32:38] we can just keep walking you can as
[2:32:41] brother caleb was saying you can walk
[2:32:43] right on into the promise why just sit
[2:32:46] stagnant and say
[2:32:48] i don't know what to do you can walk
[2:32:50] right on into the promise because god
[2:32:52] has picked you up and taught you how to
[2:32:53] walk
[2:32:55] when jesus healed the man at the pool of
[2:32:57] the bethesda he told him pick up your
[2:32:59] man and walk
[2:33:01] he didn't just he didn't just heal him
[2:33:04] but he healed him and gave him something
[2:33:05] to do
[2:33:09] so he could grow
[2:33:12] think of when we're in school um
[2:33:16] you don't just get you know you get a
[2:33:18] homework assignment or you get a test
[2:33:20] you don't just get all the answers right
[2:33:21] there
[2:33:22] you have to sit there and work through
[2:33:23] the answers yourself because if
[2:33:26] what happens if if i'm sitting there
[2:33:29] doing school and i don't know the answer
[2:33:30] to something
[2:33:31] i don't know the answer to this okay
[2:33:32] what's the answer to it okay cool that's
[2:33:34] the answer let me write that down real
[2:33:35] quick okay next one i have no idea what
[2:33:37] the answer this is
[2:33:38] answer okay if i'm just if i'm just
[2:33:40] looking in the teacher's manual
[2:33:42] and copying down the answers i'm never
[2:33:43] learning anything
[2:33:45] never learning a single thing and then
[2:33:47] one of these times i'm not going to have
[2:33:48] the teacher's manual and it's going to
[2:33:50] go
[2:33:50] very badly so we have to sit and we have
[2:33:53] to learn something through it
[2:33:55] that's why we go through tests
[2:34:02] brother branham says in uh in an
[2:34:04] exposition of the seven church ages
[2:34:05] he's in the philadelphia church age he
[2:34:07] says this is the way god teaches his
[2:34:09] people patience
[2:34:10] why if he fulfilled his word in physical
[2:34:12] manifestations the very instant you
[2:34:14] prayed
[2:34:14] you would never learn patience but we
[2:34:16] could you would become even more
[2:34:18] impatient with life
[2:34:23] so we have to learn through the trials
[2:34:25] god has something specific to teach us
[2:34:27] through each trial
[2:34:28] through each dark day god has something
[2:34:30] specific to teach
[2:34:31] us so what we have to do is we have to
[2:34:33] not just look at the specific trial and
[2:34:35] where we're at right now
[2:34:36] and go this is difficult but we have to
[2:34:37] keep our eyes on the end like the
[2:34:39] brother like brother branham tells the
[2:34:40] story of
[2:34:41] the boy who was riding a bicycle on the
[2:34:43] board all the others fell off the board
[2:34:46] because they were
[2:34:47] got wobbly as they were riding along and
[2:34:48] they kept looking down at the board
[2:34:49] where they were at
[2:34:51] and they got wobbly and they fell off
[2:34:52] the board but what what what the secret
[2:34:54] was of the boy that was able to do it
[2:34:55] correctly
[2:34:56] he kept his eyes on the end and just
[2:34:58] kept riding he didn't worry about
[2:35:01] how close he was getting to the edge of
[2:35:02] the board he didn't worry about
[2:35:05] his his ability to stay perfectly
[2:35:07] straight he just kept his eyes on the
[2:35:08] end and rode right towards the end
[2:35:14] first corinthians 10 verse 13 says there
[2:35:17] has no temptation taken you but such as
[2:35:19] is common to man
[2:35:20] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[2:35:22] you to be tempted above that you're able
[2:35:25] but will with the temptation also make a
[2:35:27] way to escape
[2:35:28] that you may be able to bear it he's not
[2:35:30] just going to leave you alone
[2:35:32] he will make a way of escape but you've
[2:35:34] got to learn
[2:35:35] and use that way of escape for yourself
[2:35:37] you've got to grow
[2:35:38] and find that way of escape he will help
[2:35:41] you through it
[2:35:43] but you've got to overcome
[2:35:48] one thing brother timothy pruitt said
[2:35:49] when i was hearing him preach recently
[2:35:51] he was saying
[2:35:53] the devil has limitations so our trials
[2:35:55] can only go so far until they reach the
[2:35:57] end god's love is unlimited
[2:35:59] there's no there's no i think i believe
[2:36:02] he said there's no summit to god's love
[2:36:04] it never reaches a peak
[2:36:07] but the devil on the other hand has
[2:36:08] limitations so there's only
[2:36:10] so far he can take a trial on us until
[2:36:12] it has to reach an end
[2:36:14] and then god will bring us out of it and
[2:36:16] we will have learned something in it
[2:36:18] and so thinking of the boy riding the
[2:36:22] bicycle and just keeping his eyes on the
[2:36:23] end that's what we have to do
[2:36:26] think of just imagine brother john andes
[2:36:29] was speaking on this and i
[2:36:31] i loved the way he put this think of
[2:36:35] so we're looking to the rapture that's
[2:36:36] what that's what we're looking to we're
[2:36:38] looking at the end we're looking to the
[2:36:39] rapture
[2:36:40] imagine the first five minutes in heaven
[2:36:42] after the rapture
[2:36:44] after all we've gone through every time
[2:36:45] we trip and fall
[2:36:47] we just keep looking towards the end
[2:36:48] towards the rapture
[2:36:50] after all of that then it finally
[2:36:52] happens and we've arrived on that great
[2:36:55] day
[2:36:56] and we realize it was worth everything
[2:37:00] because just imagine so
[2:37:05] the we we know that heaven will be worth
[2:37:07] everything we go through
[2:37:08] yeah so every time you go through a
[2:37:11] trial
[2:37:12] every time you trip and fall and then
[2:37:13] have to get back up that's just one more
[2:37:15] thing
[2:37:16] that heaven will be greater than every
[2:37:19] time you trip and you
[2:37:20] mount up another thing that i had to go
[2:37:22] through in this life
[2:37:23] okay here's the trial mount up another
[2:37:26] thing
[2:37:27] here's a trial i tripped mount up
[2:37:29] another thing
[2:37:32] heaven will be greater than however high
[2:37:34] you can stack that up so every time you
[2:37:36] add something that stack
[2:37:37] that's just that much greater that
[2:37:38] heaven is going to be for you
[2:37:41] so just imagine how great it's going to
[2:37:44] be and that's why we're going
[2:37:46] through all of this is so that we will
[2:37:48] develop that character in us
[2:37:51] that we need to go in the rapture
[2:37:54] and that is the end goal of it all isn't
[2:37:57] it
[2:37:58] so we can spend eternity with jesus
[2:38:01] amen thank you brother jack
[2:38:19] well well well
[2:38:22] god bless you brother zion
[2:38:26] god bless you
