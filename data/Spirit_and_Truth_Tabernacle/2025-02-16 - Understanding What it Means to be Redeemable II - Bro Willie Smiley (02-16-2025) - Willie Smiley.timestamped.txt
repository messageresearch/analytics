[43:32] is verbatim words that I spoke to my
[43:34] oldest son last night only God can do
[43:38] that you know that that that didn't

[43:45] the years people that say brother SM I

[44:04] to do do things let's let's read St John
[44:08] chapter
[44:10] 4 and uh y'all pray for me this
[44:13] morning uh I'm just trying to get the
[44:16] nervousness out of the way and uh then
[44:20] we'll see what the Lord has to do for us
[44:22] this a scripture that we we uh use
[44:27] used on
[44:30] um our last time preaching here St John
[44:33] chapter
[44:34] 4 uh let's start at the sixth verse it
[44:37] says now Jacob's Well was was there and
[44:41] Jesus therefore being weary with his
[44:44] journey sat thus on the well and and it
[44:48] was about the sixth hour and there
[44:51] cometh the woman of Samaria to draw
[44:55] water and Jesus said unto he'll give me
[44:57] the
[44:58] drink for his disciples was gone away
[45:01] into the city to buy meat then said the
[45:04] woman of Samaria unto him how is it that
[45:07] thou being a Jew askes drink of me which
[45:12] am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have
[45:14] no dealings with the samarians and Jesus
[45:17] answered and said unto her if thou
[45:20] knoweth the gift of God and who it is
[45:22] that saith to thee give me the drink
[45:25] thou would have asked of him and he
[45:28] would have given thee living water and
[45:30] let's just maybe skip over to the 23rd
[45:33] verse same
[45:35] chapter but the hour cometh and now is
[45:38] when the true
[45:39] worshipers worship the father in spirit
[45:41] and in the truth for the father seeks
[45:44] such to worship him God is a spirit and
[45:47] they that worship Him must worship Him
[45:49] and spirit and Truth the woman said unto
[45:52] him I know that Messiah cometh which is
[45:54] called the Christ when he is come
[45:57] he would tell us all all things and
[46:00] Jesus said unto her I that speaketh unto
[46:03] thee am he and upon this came the
[46:09] disciples and Marvel that he talketh
[46:12] with the woman yet no man see uh what
[46:16] seeketh thou or why talk thou with her
[46:19] and let us get another scripture while
[46:21] we we have you standing this
[46:25] morning uh oh
[46:30] my St John chapter
[46:36] 3 in
[46:39] verse
[46:42] uh 15 that whosoever believeth in him
[46:47] should not perish but have everlasting
[46:49] life for God so loved the world that he
[46:52] gave his only begotten son that
[46:54] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[46:57] perish but have everlasting life for God
[47:01] sent not his son into the world to
[47:03] condemn the world but that the world
[47:06] through him might be saved he that
[47:09] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[47:12] that
[47:14] believeth not is condemned already
[47:16] because he has not believed in the name
[47:20] of the only
[47:21] begotten uh Son of
[47:24] God and this is the condemnation that
[47:27] light is comeing to the world and Men
[47:30] love Darkness rather than light because
[47:33] their deeds were evil let us uh bow our
[47:36] heads gracious father we just thank you
[47:39] once again for allowing us this
[47:41] opportunity to be in the service of the
[47:44] Living God this morning and uh we just
[47:47] want to remember the saints that um in
[47:51] Indiana this weekend trust that they're
[47:54] having a wonderful time
[47:57] there um celebrating with uh Becca and
[48:01] uh her husband oh God this weekend and
[48:04] uh we just pray that you anoint us a
[48:07] fresh Lord give us fresh anointing fresh
[48:10] inspiration oh God for this morning
[48:13] service bless your people that are here
[48:15] that have gathered not to hear from a
[48:17] man but to hear from God and uh we be so
[48:20] careful to give you praise Glory and
[48:22] Honor in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[48:25] seated
[48:27] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[48:29] Lord it uh I I want to use as uh my
[48:34] topic this morning understanding what it
[48:36] means to be redeemable part two and um
[48:41] as a
[48:43] context
[48:45] um to our our text this morning y'all
[48:49] bear with
[48:50] me
[48:52] um God comes because he cares Hallelujah
[48:57] and uh I wanna I want to just kind of
[49:00] start out saying a few things this
[49:02] morning before we just kind of um uh get
[49:06] into our our subject this morning um
[49:09] it's it's just a few things that we said
[49:11] when we was in Aransas and I've probably
[49:13] said it here uh and uh I I was just kind
[49:17] of thinking about some things that oh as
[49:20] as I'm also getting started I appreciate
[49:22] the brothers in there their Tex is uh
[49:26] this this last
[49:28] week um but uh it's a few things that
[49:31] you know um I guess for me I I think a
[49:35] certain way and and just looking at
[49:38] scripture and and just understanding
[49:41] Ministry and uh y'all probably wonder
[49:45] why sometimes I say the same thing all
[49:48] the
[49:49] time because I I I do it for a purpose
[49:53] because I want things to register right
[49:56] sometimes I remember uh brother rblo
[49:59] said this years and years ago he say
[50:02] sometimes you you something is need to
[50:04] be said a thousand times maybe in order
[50:08] for it to actually
[50:11] register uh cuz sometimes you know we'll
[50:13] hear certain things and we forget if
[50:16] y'all like me before we get out the door
[50:19] you know by the time I get out the door
[50:21] sometimes I forgot everything I done say
[50:23] it that's just how our memory works but
[50:26] I think
[50:27] sometimes um when when we hear things on
[50:30] a consistent basis it it it gives it an
[50:34] opportunity to really be implanted in
[50:37] our
[50:38] heart um and and and that's important
[50:42] because we're we're we're living in in a
[50:44] age of where we got to overcome right
[50:47] brother is that right every every
[50:51] dispensation has been a dispensation of
[50:54] of overcoming that's right brother right
[50:56] right and and and you know y'all know I
[51:00] enjoy emotions but I realize that that
[51:03] you know sometimes you don't even feel
[51:06] emotional right we sometimes we come to
[51:10] church and we don't even feel like
[51:11] giving God
[51:13] praise right but you know what I realize
[51:16] you know in our emotions it has nothing
[51:19] to do with our our understanding TR
[51:24] right cuz it takes our standing to
[51:27] elevate us that's right is that right
[51:30] when when when when we going through
[51:32] trauma and things of that nature our our
[51:36] emotions aren't a giddy not there
[51:38] something going wrong in your head y'all
[51:41] ought to talk to me this morning you
[51:43] know when when when you sad you know you
[51:47] you you're you're going through mental
[51:49] battles we know the greatest battle is
[51:51] fought is in the
[51:53] mind is that right and and and there's I
[51:57] forgot the statistics on it where
[52:00] there's so many thoughts that go through
[52:02] the human mind amen uh in the Run of a
[52:07] day yes sir how how many negative
[52:10] thoughts that that goes through our mind
[52:13] through the through the Run of a day
[52:15] Lord right how many positive right so so
[52:20] you know uh it it takes the revelation
[52:24] of the word of God right right right to
[52:27] be preached yes sir yes sir right it's
[52:31] it's it's important I know sometimes uh
[52:35] people might feel like you know well you
[52:37] guys need to tone it down a little bit
[52:40] and maybe you guys aren't you shouldn't
[52:43] say certain things is that right that's
[52:46] not the case that's not a realistic
[52:47] thought sir because I believe that God
[52:50] allows God allows the ministry to say uh
[52:55] what's necessary and what's needed for
[52:58] our benefit sir to to benefit us if if
[53:02] not now maybe somewhere down the road
[53:05] sir is that right so so you know uh
[53:09] sometimes it it it appears like man
[53:11] brother Jack is being being uh difficult
[53:15] or he's being he's being a little harsh
[53:17] no he's not no sir no he's not because
[53:21] because every every word that's
[53:24] preached right not false Doctrine but
[53:27] every word that's preached is necessary
[53:32] sir for it we we benefit amen that's the
[53:35] truth brother right I was telling
[53:37] somebody you know um I was saying that
[53:40] you know it's it's like uh the the
[53:43] pharmacist they take and and they put uh
[53:48] what's necessary in
[53:50] medication to benefit us is that right
[53:54] yeah and see we can't be
[53:58] smarter than the people who study and go
[54:01] to school for for years and years and
[54:04] years say well you know that pill don't
[54:07] take uh uh um you know all of all of
[54:11] that just maybe we'll take take some of
[54:14] this out what you trying to do kill
[54:17] yourself right because they put so much
[54:20] of you know and we we've heard this
[54:22] we've heard this from a prophet right
[54:25] what's in it is necessary right right
[54:29] that's that's like trying to take your
[54:30] radiator out your car see how far you
[54:33] going to get well this radiated ain't
[54:37] really necessary well you'll see in
[54:40] about a good five or 10 minutes how
[54:43] necessary and and the thought the
[54:46] thought that went into that yes sir
[54:49] right the actual thought that that these
[54:52] these uh uh Engineers uhuh right put
[54:56] into uh calculating and all of this kind
[55:00] of stuff right and placing all of it
[55:02] especially in the days cause with all of
[55:04] these
[55:06] computers right every every uh computer
[55:11] is necessary to the
[55:14] functioning of the car sir when one of
[55:17] them go
[55:18] out your car is affected it get to doing
[55:21] one of these numbers and you get to Lord
[55:24] what's oh God
[55:27] right y'all know what I'm talking about
[55:29] I'm still moving I'm trying to get out
[55:31] the way this
[55:32] morning right but but I I you know for
[55:36] me I I felt to say this this morning so
[55:40] because you know you you want to uh
[55:44] understand
[55:45] ministry right Ministry is not like some
[55:48] Doty uh
[55:50] grandfather right we we it's important
[55:53] for y'all to understand that we must be
[55:55] consistent
[55:58] right yes sir for for our benefit things
[56:01] things are said and and it it's so it's
[56:03] so many spirits and so many things that
[56:07] we we come in contact with so so it's
[56:11] necessary when when we were on our trip
[56:14] uh a young fell he was struggling with
[56:17] you know uh stuff on the in there I'll
[56:20] just leave it right there so y'all catch
[56:22] it if you can catch it right it it was a
[56:26] young sister got into the prayer line
[56:29] and and and she wanted prayer uh nice
[56:32] looking sister young sister but she was
[56:35] struggling in her mind with with her
[56:39] DNA Lord right right y'all know what I'm
[56:42] talking about it it was it was a real it
[56:46] was a real struggle of and it's more so
[56:50] now for this generation than it what it
[56:52] was for Our Generation right right it's
[56:55] like whether not not I'm a girl or
[56:57] whether not I'm a boy Lord right just to
[57:01] kind of make it plain of whether or not
[57:03] I supposed to like a girl whether or not
[57:05] I supposed to like a boy right right and
[57:09] I and I kind of like what brother Quint
[57:11] was talking about patterns yes sir right
[57:14] so I maybe I'll drop in there in a
[57:16] second but so that we'll we'll we'll see
[57:20] why why it's it's necessary not it's not
[57:25] something where we're trying to be
[57:27] critical right right or demeaning it
[57:31] it's words that's being preach so that
[57:35] so that we could
[57:37] stabilize and be stable and be settled
[57:41] and that that we're given something uh
[57:44] to combat come on that's it right
[57:47] brother brand talked about the combat
[57:49] Beast right well we we've been given an
[57:53] eagle anointing sir in the Eagle age and
[57:57] Eagle
[57:58] mentality right yes sir to show us
[58:02] what's necessary and and the attack upon
[58:07] the Eagles in this evil age yeah I thank
[58:11] God for an eagle anointing sir I thank
[58:14] God for the combat Beast right right
[58:17] brother the unveiling of the Mighty God
[58:19] yes sir glory to his wonderful name I'm
[58:22] starting to feel something now right
[58:25] glory to God and you ought to too yes
[58:28] sir see it it should be a complete
[58:32] support right a complete
[58:36] support uh of the ministry that's trying
[58:39] to bring you complete Insight yes sir
[58:44] cuz it it's needed when when when you
[58:46] going through your greatest battles when
[58:49] you struggling whether I to go to church
[58:52] and and and whether I not ought to go to
[58:55] church right right right glory to God
[59:00] it's it's a it's a real it's a real
[59:02] battle some of us may not have the same
[59:04] battles but we we have our we have our

[1:06:57] necessary right right and and the same
[1:07:00] goes for the young fellas you know um it

[1:07:07] thing you know when you feel like you
[1:07:09] out there you're just doing your thing
[1:07:11] and
[1:07:12] and see that just shows that just shows
[1:07:16] you the where people are in their
[1:07:18] thinking and why brother brandham talked
[1:07:20] about you know and preaching uh uh the
[1:07:24] different things of demonology and and
[1:07:27] and how people are insane see
[1:07:31] is most of the world is insane yes sir

[1:07:37] be locked up right it's the truth
[1:07:40] brother right it's the truth anyhow yes
[1:07:43] it's the truth because if if if we're
[1:07:46] basing it upon the word of God most of
[1:07:49] the world is insane and don't realize it
[1:07:52] if you listen if you listen to the the
[1:07:56] thinking of the
[1:07:59] majority of of the world and I'm talking
[1:08:03] about psychiatrists and psychologists
[1:08:06] smart so-called smart people they insane
[1:08:10] too
[1:08:13] that's and the information that they
[1:08:16] giving folk is insane information yes it
[1:08:20] is right TR amen because
[1:08:23] because outside of the Bible they're not
[1:08:27] lining people up no amen glory to God
[1:08:32] it's it's just intellectual thinking
[1:08:35] contrary to the word of God the reason
[1:08:38] why we in this condition brother Solomon
[1:08:41] is because people are are offer the word
[1:08:44] of God that's right amen amen that's the
[1:08:47] truth brother glory to God people people
[1:08:50] are are offer the word of God and and
[1:08:54] secular thinking cannot produce what
[1:08:59] folks are looking
[1:09:02] forth right amen if secular thinking
[1:09:06] could produce it we never needed Jesus
[1:09:08] that's right if secular thinking could
[1:09:11] produce it we never needed an ego that's
[1:09:15] the truth brother you preaching glory to
[1:09:19] God I feel the help
[1:09:22] now I feel powerful right now
[1:09:26] Hallelujah is that right amen secular
[1:09:28] secular thinking and in in our own human
[1:09:31] reasoning cannot am Man line you
[1:09:35] up right secular thinking and and and
[1:09:39] our emotions and feelings right cannot
[1:09:43] produce a victory in our lives brother
[1:09:46] amen y'all hear me youngsters yeah it
[1:09:49] will not it it will not produce a
[1:09:54] satisfaction right from secular thinking
[1:09:57] all you will get amen is a continual
[1:10:00] broken heart and hurt feelings exctly
[1:10:03] right amen gor our Victory comes by
[1:10:08] being behind the word of God that's
[1:10:11] that's it see we we in Genesis Adam them
[1:10:16] was fortified right right yes sir they
[1:10:19] was fortified behind the word of God
[1:10:23] right but see the enemy got uh uh Eve to
[1:10:27] come from behind her
[1:10:30] fortification he knew he had her that's
[1:10:32] right every time right yes sir it's it's
[1:10:36] kind of like the prophet talked in
[1:10:37] choosing of a bride you know him and the
[1:10:40] fellow was looking at cow and he was
[1:10:42] wondering why you know uh he was he was
[1:10:46] looking you know he said bill you got a
[1:10:49] lot of lar fell he say cuz if you look
[1:10:52] in her eyes and you see that wild
[1:10:56] St he say the reason why she looking
[1:10:58] good is because she she's pinned up
[1:11:01] she's CED up he say the moment you let
[1:11:04] her out bro you got problem she she
[1:11:06] she'll never be a mother to her Cal
[1:11:08] that's right and see we we we we trying
[1:11:11] to keep you pinned in the
[1:11:15] word fortified behind the word so so
[1:11:19] that when when you get to these
[1:11:21] Junctions you'll be what the word say
[1:11:24] that you supposed to
[1:11:27] be Oh Glory see you you you you'll know
[1:11:32] how to be a wife to your husband you'll
[1:11:34] know how to be a mother to your children
[1:11:37] right see if if not if not you all you
[1:11:43] want to do is is run out and be in the
[1:11:46] in the
[1:11:47] streets am huh and I'm here to tell you
[1:11:52] I'm a witness ain't nothing in the
[1:11:53] streets how many folk that been in the
[1:11:56] streets that know what I'm talking about
[1:11:57] ain't nothing in the
[1:11:59] streets but death cuz the wtes of sin is
[1:12:02] death yes
[1:12:04] sir glory to God glory to God and see
[1:12:09] and and no matter no matter what these
[1:12:11] young guys and these aggressive girls
[1:12:14] tell you come on Church a it's not
[1:12:18] nothing it's important that that you
[1:12:21] follow the the the the pattern uh-huh
[1:12:26] that that would set the order marriage
[1:12:30] is
[1:12:32] Honorable and and marriage is still
[1:12:34] right between a male and a
[1:12:37] female boy I can go somewhere with that
[1:12:40] cuz when you start breaking that and and
[1:12:42] getting into all of this and all of the
[1:12:45] the the theory and thought of of today
[1:12:48] then what do you what are we making
[1:12:53] God God Don't Make No
[1:12:57] mistakes right God never God never made
[1:13:00] a mistake when he made man and W man
[1:13:04] glory to God come on that's right when
[1:13:07] he made man right cuz cuz we're talking
[1:13:11] about perfect thoughts now right knowing
[1:13:14] that once he made man and once he made
[1:13:18] woman right the
[1:13:20] anatomies would be uh Co what that word
[1:13:26] they'll go
[1:13:28] together
[1:13:30] cohes
[1:13:32] right uh to for mten
[1:13:37] purposes glory to God so so how could we
[1:13:41] say God made a
[1:13:45] mess I'm going leave that alone I'm
[1:13:48] going leave that alone right but it's
[1:13:50] it's the truth yes sir and these things
[1:13:52] got to
[1:13:53] register right be because of of the
[1:13:58] influence and what's been loosed in this
[1:14:01] age from the river eph
[1:14:04] frates all those demons sir and see it's
[1:14:08] probably 50 times worse on this
[1:14:11] generation than it was on on my
[1:14:14] generation right because of the access
[1:14:19] that they have that we didn't have this
[1:14:22] ain't nothing I'm saying brother jackon
[1:14:23] said some of this just in a way right
[1:14:27] the the
[1:14:28] access and and you know things are
[1:14:32] more open yeah right and and and
[1:14:38] tolerated glory to God and so these
[1:14:42] things has to be
[1:14:44] said because of the the the influence in
[1:14:48] the struggle maybe not now for the young
[1:14:51] people right glory to God cuz they they
[1:14:55] 14 15 16 right but but when here here's
[1:15:00] the thing when they turn 18 that magic

[1:46:35] care of
[1:46:38] us come on we think it's all on us not
[1:46:41] yeah you want you want folks to have
[1:46:44] careers and all that I know things has
[1:46:48] changed I'm just a back to the Bible
[1:46:51] preacher sir on
[1:46:53] MH we we are where we are and we can't
[1:46:56] go
[1:47:00] back but you have to say things to give
[1:47:02] us a realistic
[1:47:04] view of things help me out brother Joe
[1:47:08] right a realistic view see God cares yes
[1:47:13] he does let me let me let me touch on
[1:47:14] this and then I'm going to go right but
[1:47:17] God cares yes he does God God comes
[1:47:21] because he cares yes sir when we think
[1:47:24] about that woman at the well you know
[1:47:28] when when when people around her
[1:47:30] probably didn't fully understand the
[1:47:33] depths of what she was going
[1:47:36] through it showed that that something
[1:47:39] something something was definitely wrong
[1:47:42] yes sir right we there was a
[1:47:46] thirst right here here's something that
[1:47:49] I was thinking about on my my way here
[1:47:51] this morning it it just shows you where
[1:47:56] where people don't realize how they have
[1:48:00] succumb to
[1:48:03] Spirits right that's right cuz cuz to
[1:48:07] just to just deal with all of these
[1:48:11] people right come on church to just deal
[1:48:15] with all of these personalities and all
[1:48:18] these faces and all these you know
[1:48:21] breaths and all of these all it's not s
[1:48:25] folk don't think about that it just
[1:48:27] shows you it just shows you the spirit
[1:48:30] that folk be up under yes
[1:48:32] sir right cuz it if we look back to
[1:48:36] standards it it was you know one buck
[1:48:40] and One D right that's right go back to
[1:48:43] Mar at divorce right I know what I'm
[1:48:47] talking about right polygamy didn't come
[1:48:50] in until after the fall right
[1:48:53] right right but in the beginning it
[1:48:56] wasn't
[1:48:57] so
[1:48:59] see you even look back in the day that
[1:49:03] that was a standard set mama had a
