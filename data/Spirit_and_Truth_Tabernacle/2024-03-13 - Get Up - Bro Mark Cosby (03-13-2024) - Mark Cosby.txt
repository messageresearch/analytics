and uh don't feel worthy to be up here I'm thankful brother Jack giv me the opportunity and uh let just bow our heads in word of prayer and we begin dear heavenly father we we've made it this far Lord Because of You Lord thank you Lord for just giving us breath in our bodies once again Lord just thank you for all the things that you've do in our life that we don't see or recognize at times Lord we know that you started a good work in US Lord and you promis to finish it Lord Lord may we just keep our eyes upon you the Mighty God the mighty Creator because Lord you've been so good to us Lord we we could write a a novel of the testimonies you've given us and the things you protected us Lord and Lord this evening Lord we want to just give ourselves into your hands Lord our hearts and our lives are yours Lord may you just speak to us in such a personal way Lord may you move me out the way Lord and may you speak to your children tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen a we'll turn to our Bibles in uh Romans chapter 13 and we'll read verses 11 through 13 or 11- 14 say Amen when you get there amen so the Bible says and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wanness not in strife and envying but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not Provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof and I look that word of Provisions it's the act of providing and making previous preparations so let's not try to make excuses for we're doing things we shouldn't be doing you may take your seats so title this little message is get up so so I think a lot of times we make resolutions and we make all make promises to God at the beginning of the year and then life hits us the devil hits us and we kind of fall down and we don't get up from it we don't recover from it so I think it's high time we get up the year is still young we have plenty of time to those spiritual goals you made you can still hit them don't let the devil overwhelm you and say well it's too late no it's this March so let's get up and and and and March March forward in the promises of God yes sir let's go to uh Ephesians chapter 5 and another familiar scripture and we'll start with verse uh 14 and the Bible says wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light so you notice in both scriptures it's talking about us waking up us being aware and getting up and and and and recognizing what God is trying to do in each one of our Lives verse 14 says wherefore he saith or 15 see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil we live in a very evil day where the devil is trying to take away our time any free time we have he's trying to eat it up so we can't spend time with God then if we don't spend time with God how we expect God to fulfill the promises in in his word for usen verse 16 or verse 17 wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is and how you understand what the will of the Lord is is through prayer and the word of God because the will of the Lord is always going to dovetail with the word of God and if it doesn't it's not the will of the Lord amen it says and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit verse I love verse 19 speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord always putting the Lord on your mind and your heart that's what that's trying to tell us in verse 20 says giving thanks always doesn't say giving thanks when you want to or giving thanks when the times are good but it says giving thanks always unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so it's time we get back in Step our pastors been preaching us where we get back in Step so restoration can happen not only in our church but in our personal lives as well but we got to get in step in line of God's word cuz God is can't fulfill anything unless you get in line first you got to play your part first and then God is going to move and and make things happen it's time for us to get up and fight the good fight of faith we got to fight that good fight of faith and Faith isn't something that's just it falls into your lap but you got to fight every inch for it because we're going against a devil who wants to take your faith away and the only way he can take it away if he get you to compromise with the word of God so we got to take the word of God we got to eat it we got we got to sleep we got to breathe it we got to manifest it sir amen we got to take back what's rightfully ours see the devil is trying to take things that aren't his he he's a defeated creature so don't let him take those things from you your healing is yours God is giving it to you your deliverance God is given to you Financial Freedom God is giv it to you but you got to claim it and say devil this is mine yes sir amen we got to get up we got to get up and March back in the line of the word sir you may have faltered you may have falling but if a righteous man falls seven times he get back up we've come too far to to to give up we've come too far not to get up again cuz we're going to fall in falter but we got to get up and move forward learn from the mistakes that you made and keep moving forward and marching right let's go to Romans chapter 10 amen so the Bible says in chapter 10: 8 says says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach it's not my words but it's God's words that's what we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus notice doesn't just stop there you can't just have an empty confession something has to follow that confession and it says and thou shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shall be saved so if you truly believe that then you are going to be saved yes sir but you got got to believe that not just from not empty confession but you got to believe it from the heart you got you got to believe it personally for yourself it has to be revealed to you personally verse uh let's go to verse n or verse 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness not not intellectual but unto the heart unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation right amen verse 11 for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon Him of mercy so we think about that you don't have to be a certain race you don't have to be a certain uh Prestige or a certain education level but God is looking at the heart yes sir so you don't have to worry about God being respected persons all we have to do is line up what he's calling us to line up in as God is showing you light you want to follow in that light because God isn't obligated to give you any more light until you follow the light he's already given you so we got to walk in the light as he's leading Us in the light yes sir amen let's keep it going how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed so how are we going to claim a promise if we don't believe that God can fulfill that promise in our life see you got to play the part of Faith it's simple faith is simple just take God of his word and let go yes sir that's literally what you got to do a lot of times we want to have control of the situation and wonder why God can't move God's hands are tied if you don't let him in the situation right all right how then shall they call on him if they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they shall not heard how should they hear without a preacher so you got all these ministers coming and preaching the word upon the pulpit brother Jack and all the pastor and if you don't believe that that word is for you how can ever benefit you personally your life don't make it so see God every time we go into God's presence he has something special for us God doesn't do things just to do things but he does things with a perfect purpose and his purpose is to give life to you to give you guidance to give you Revelation to help you get in line with the word of God but we got to have ears to hear and our heart to receive and we can't have those things unless we have a strong prayer life and I I think a lot of times in these days and ages we just we pray to pray sometimes I said that before but we got to pray with a purpose ask yourself why am I praying right now am I just praying just to to get it out the way or am I praying to meet with the very creator of Heaven see we don't that's how pre it is to pray it's literally the greatest thing that is put in the hands of mankind is a true sincere prayer to offer to God God has given you that gift to use it that weapon to use it so we got to utilize that weapon it's like it's like having a a bazooka but not have not using the bullets to fire it it's not going to do you any good right or having a car without an engine you ain't going to go nowhere yes sir right let's keep going verse 15 how should they preach except they be sent as it written how beautiful for the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have all not obeyed the gospel for Isaiah sayith Lord whom hath believed by report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God that's the key right there that that's the key scripture right there for us that we got to hear the voice of God personing for ourselves don't just assume you're hearing the voice of God but make sure you're hearing the voice of God because there's so many spirits out there trying to sound like God you want to make sure that it dovetails with the word of God that's your year in a Thum right there right amen so if we can't believe that God can move in a current situation right now how are we going to believe for restoration if you can't believe that God can take control whatever's going around in your household whatever's going around in your personal life in work how can you believe that God can give you restoration in your life they go hand in hand so you got to believe God in all areas of your life not just the areas you want to believe but you got to believe God in all areas because he's a God who can move in every single thing Small Things big things they don't matter to God he can move upon those situations but you got to let let him move have faith that he can move we all have testimonies of God moving in our lives then why can't we believe that God can move in our life this right now moment so we got to stop limiting God don't put God in some box he's omnipresent he's everywhere so let God do things see there's a Red Sea that's in front of you but you got to let God don't just cry about it speak speak and move forward that's what God is waiting for he said why cry speak so you speak to that amen amen so we got we got to believe that restoration is for his person God can only operate on the basis of Faith you remember when Jesus uh had to pass by this town because there was no faith it was all unbelief and Jesus had to pass by because an unbelief so sometimes God has to pass by our way because of our unbelief I like that song pass me not no Gentle Savior so as he's passing by this evening don't let him pass you by say Lord what is you have for me tonight Lord I want to hear your voice I need to hear your voice it's it's it's better than life to me I need it you see desperation is a something we need to have in in this day and age because each year each year goes by this world gets wickeder and wickeder we see politics all these things getting wickeder and we got to stay that stand that much closer to God to keep him by side amen amen amen amen so God operates by faith in his word and guing his word or one we you can't have one or the other if you have God you got to have his word you can't pick and choose what scriptures you want you got to take the whole Bible you may not certain things might hurt and cut a little bit but you need that that's how the growth happens if I'm if I'm working out if I'm working out in the gym then when I'm working out I'm actually hurting my muscles so they can grow so the same thing in our spiritual walk God has to cut certain things off of us so we can grow see see pain equals growth if it if it doesn't challenge you it won't change you I'm say it again if it doesn't challenge you it won't change you and that's why God knows exactly the words we need in due season and we got to receive those words in due season don't take an offense to it just say Lord thank you for speaking to me even a know from God is a blessing cuz God is speaking to you God knows how to protect you and shield you for certain things see we try we try to get into certain things and say and trying to make something that's not the will of God and we wind up wind up in the permissible will of God and we wonder why it's like with balum he he he said let me uh let me go and curse Israel he's like no I can't let you do that and he said all right go on ahead and he couldn't curse Israel one time amen so he said before we can't have God without his word so we got to believe that God can make a way out of your current situation right now we all have unspoken we all have unsaved loved ones we all have issues in our family whatever it is we got to believe that God can take us out of that current situation and make life into it see we're amateur creators we God has given us authority to speak life in the situation to speak peace you got to create an atmosphere that God can move in how do you expect God to move in an atmosphere that's not pleasing unto him God God doesn't dwell in an atmosphere of unbelief an atmosphere of Discord he he dwells in an atmosphere of unity so we had to make sure where they were in line with the word of God we're unified with the word of God we got to say Lord I know the situation isn't how I want it to be right now but Lord I know you can change it right now I know this use me to help bring change in my family help bring change in my workplace see we got to get serious now I don't think we get serious enough we we want change but we're not willing to do what it takes to have change and what it takes is to surrender if you don't surrender your attitude see all you trying to correct everybody else but judge yourself with the word of God that's what we got to do stoping to judge everybody else and we got to judge ourselves with the word of God where are we missing at in the word of God not not what X Y and Z is missing but what am I missing Lord amen so we got to believe that he can bring life into a situation of that has no life we serve a god who's a Creator and a maker of all things there's nothing too big or too small for him he literally created any and everything we see and we don't think that God can handle a little situation in our life a little financial situation a little Health need a little family issue or Clash we we don't think God can handle that we we limit God what he can do in our lives and we need to get back and take back what belongs to us peace in your family belongs to you restoration in your family Belongs to You Financial Freedom belongs to you healing in your body belongs to you you just got to take God at his word and say Lord you that's for me personally I see my name written right in here and you're speaking to me directly hallah we got to get we got start getting this is the year we got to get so personal cuz restoration is going to happen in your life but you just got to claim it you just got to claim it it may not look like it but it's going to happen you got to believe it it's darkest before Dawn the prophet said amen so we need to get back it's time to take back our spiritual walk it's enough of these little uh dsy prayers 5 minutes here 2 minutes there it's time to get back on our knees and mean business cuz when God is going to move when we get back on our knees and mean business say Lord I'm not moving till I feel your presence I'm not moving till I hear you speak to me personally see a lot of times we just get satisfied and Justified when we we hit our knees in the morning and say oh I said a little prayer I made a little time but that's not that's not putting God first putting God first is is taking the flesh out the way it's crucifying the flesh cuz the flesh never wants to pray it does and if it does it wants to do garbage prayers and we got to get past those garbage prayers and get back to how we used to when we first gave our heart to the Lord we were so on fire we were so desperate we we couldn't wait to testify what God did to in our life we couldn't wait to do it and now we we've got we we've grown more but we got lazier I think as the years go by we get lazier and lazier I'm talking about myself too and we need to stop being lazy and just get back to how it used to be we got to let that Spirit of Revival live inside of us we can't never die because if the spirit of Revival is inside of us we got to pray say Lord I can't leave the house I don't care if I have to be late for work or if I got to miss something Lord I I need this this connection with you because if I'm not connected with you I'm going to handle situations wrong I'm going to yell at somebody I'm going to have ill thoughts towards somebody see it's all it all it all depends on what you're connected to see we we live in an age of where social media is such a a outlet for uh for rest we have a bad day we go on social media just scroll on Tik Tok and YouTube and we just kind of decompress like that but that decompressing isn't going to help you what decompression we need is prayer message of the hour reading the word of God speak speaking the word over yourself that's what we that's what's going to decompress you that's what's going to cause life see entertainment is good for the flesh but it's going to go away but I I believe the Bible talks about how uh if if our mind is stayed on God he'll give us perfect peace right and that's the peace we need we got to keep our mind and our heart stayed on God at all times see we forfeit all this peace because our mind isn't stayed on God our minds on a million other things like what I got to do for work what's for lunch today what I got to do this at the house I got to do this pick this up but keep your mind on God we got to amen so the Lord died so we could have a personal relationship with him and he loved us so much he wanted to give us a personal intimate walk with him and I don't think we take advantage of that that offer he's given us and so we got to it's time we get back in line like I said before get back and step walk in the light as he leads us in the light am let's go to Ephesians 5:26 amen like I said before we we we come sometimes to church and we're comparing somebody's life with our life and say oh I'm a little bit better than this person they ain't going to do you no good it's unwise to do that see every person a different walk every person is a different level so if that person isn't where you're at that's okay help that person edify that brother help that brother don't cause Discord in somebody's life by by having ill thoughts towards somebody see everybody has different struggles in life we got a brother Bram said the greatest success of his ministry was was being able to fill for the people we got to feel for one another we got to pray for one another more cuz it's we all going through a spiritual battle all we fighting the same enemy we're not fighting each other we're fighting we're not fighting against flesh and blood but the the your greatest enemy is your yourself right and the devil's going to use that against you if you're not spiritually aware yes sir so Ephesians 5: 26-7 says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but as should be holy and without blemish so that's restoration right there God is trying to restore us back to that state and we got to let the word just wash us and cleanse us away because we we we live in a world where God has become a forethought in a lot of people's minds and we got all these atmospheres we go into and we got to make sure that we're prayed up to be able to handle those things because God can wash you with the word it doesn't have to be a church don't just wait the church to get washed by the word the when you reading the word of God it can wash you the message of the hour it can wash you see see we like to play Wednesday and Sunday Christians and we can't play Wednesday and Sunday Christians we got to play 7day a week Christians because that's how God's to move when you're serving him seven days a week don't just serve him three days a week so well I gave God a good three days and I'm going to take the the rest of the four off God doesn't work like that God works in he he looks for faithfulness that's what pleases God as a faithful Christian when when everything is going wrong in a Christian's life that he can still uh go on his knees and raise his hands say thank you Jesus thank you for this day thank you for my life thank you for all that you're doing even the things I don't notice you're doing that's what a true Christian to me is somebody who doesn't have to wait for when everything's all hunky dory to worship God but you can worship God when the the the greatest battle is in in in in the midst when your family's going against you and they fired you at work that's the time to really show what you got inside of you that's true worship to me anybody can worship in in a church setting where everything is all good amen amen amen amen let's go I read a quote after this amen then he can give us the restoration that we desire we all desire something from God tonight we all have a need we have before God we all can testify that right now and we got to be able to take that need before God look at the promise that's for us in the word of God and say God this promise is mine Lord help me to get in line with the promise so I can meet the the the um brother Brandon said the statement that if X Y and Z has met the same qualifications of the promise then God is obligated to give it to you if you meet the same qualifications and it it's literally simple as that and I think a lot of times we we always we let worry and fear come into our life CU When we we don't we can't have control of something we start to fear and say well maybe uh This Promise isn't for me well maybe God didn't speak to me and God is waiting for us to stand firm stand firm in the word of God that's what God's looking for be like job he could he could literally stand firm and still believe God and not curse him even when his family died when his wife when his wife said you should go curse God and died all these things was going around them but job could still stand strong because he had a strong foundation and he even have the word of God like we do we got all these promises in here we got all these examples in here but yet sometimes we can't find enough Faith to muster up just to get our knes and pray or another Faith to uh say Lord help me give me give me uh wisdom to help W witness to somebody today right amen and the thing is I love in the Book of Genesis how it talks Abraham it talks about how uh that the seed is going to possess the enemy of the gates I love how in the Book of Joshua it talks about uh footsteps means possession so the same thing in our walk right now is footsteps mean possession more restoration but we got to claim that restoration we got to walk in it cuz God has given it to you think about that God has given you the the key to Restoration and it's in this Bible right here so many scriptures talk about restoration as brother Jack has just been beautifully just setting it out for us we got all this meat that we've been uh the the Mishawaka and all these ministers we have come through get all this meat so we have no excuse to be to be down we got to get back up amen amen I'm going to read a a quote this is from Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and if his people today would only listen to him think about that and stand still to see his promise think about that if his people would only listen to him today and stand still to see the Promise he like to display the same thing to them today to deliver the people from bondage of sin and doubt frustration sickness check this right here and every Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for belongs to the people belongs to everybody in here not one person doesn't belong to you in here it's yours you got to claim it it's yours God's got the sea to stand still to watch him doing something a lot of times we'll get in front on a red sea and we don't know what to do and what you need to do is just say God you you brought me this far I'm going to March forward right cuz footsteps footsteps mean possession yes sir I'm not scared of what's behind me cuz you didn't tell me to look behind you'll protect me from my high you said look forward that's why the armor of God doesn't have something on her back it has all forward so you just March forward and God's going to part that Red Sea for you you're going to March forward and God's going to give you the strength to kill that Goliath right you see this is the year where Giants should fall down sir cuz they get they get in the way of restoration we got to take that sword and cut the Giant's head off cuz that devil has no business keeping you from restoration he has no business so you just cut his head you get your slingshot off knock him down and cut his head off he has no right amen we always get uh let's go to expectation 1950 we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what you look for so if you're expecting for for God to move and you really really mean it from your heart then God's going to move but if you're halfway in halfway out then you ain't going to get what God has for you you just can't it's impossible see well then usually you get what you look for it's the mental attitude that you have so every situation you're go into your me God is looking at the mental attitude that you have cuz that's what pleases God is your attitude of how you're acting to the situation I believe the Bible says do all things without murmurings and disputings and that's a hard thing to do because we live in a world of complainers everybody's complaining about the littlest thing everybody gets offended about the littlest thing and we got to fight through fight through those atmosphere of of unbelief and uh and doubt we got to fight through it yes sir and it says remember this and never forget this the right mental attitude towards any I'm going say it again towards any say it with me any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise look it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal sick people any person in here has a right to meet Satan anywhere you don't have to be a minister you don't have to be a deacon you don't have to be a song leader all you have to be is a surrendered Christian cuz the the brother brandom said even the weakest Christian on his knees the Devils tremble see they're not trembling because of you but they're trembling because of God inside of you and if God inside of you is not getting first place how do you expect the Devils to tremble how do you expect the Devils to fear cuz they're they're scared of God they're not scared of you not one bit right amen remember this we're leading the greatest news flash in history 1961 remember God told Joshua every place the soul of your footsteps that's possession every step not just some but every step so every time we take God at his promise that's possession possession possession brother then footsteps means possession let's just keep walking into the promised land he's promised us restoration he's promised us he's promised us let's let's keep walking into it not looking back to see what will happen back there and what somebody else is doing keep your eyes on Jesus the Joshua leader just keep moving on deeper depths and higher Heights until you're possessing everything that God has promised you in his word think about that everything he's promised in his word for you sir amen amen amen read the quote and Caleb Ste the people before Moses and said we are able to go over and take it because it depends on what you're looking at so what are you looking at in situation right now are you looking like it's a a situation that never could be changed that never could be anything better than what it was see a lot of times we get so caught up in a situation that's been bad for so long that we we lose sight of hope we like man this is never going to change I'm just going to have to live with it and deal with it somehow and then we just lose sight and hope it a God doesn't look like that God doesn't look a situation and say well I can't change this no God is looking for you to say hey I don't care how bad it's been or how bad it's going to be but it's going to be better because God promised it to be better he said if I put says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things should be added unto you it's all these things it does it didn't say particular says all these things so you got to put him first so he can change the the the family Dynamic you want to be changed whatever promise you you're going after amen because it depends on what you're looking at some of them were looking at the obstacle the great armies and the Great Walls and the great Giants and the size of the people but Caleb was looking at the promise of God and it was the hour he had come when Caleb had to get the people still before he could tell them the promises of God now I want you to notice that some times it's only going to be two people maybe that believe the promise of God you might believe it and your family might not believe it but you got to stand strong cuz think about it out of the uh 10 out of the 12 Spies only two people believe God's report they went there saw the land and only two of them believed it right so imagine that all the Israel is against you and only two of you believe it look at the odds of that but they could still stand strong because you know why there was a different Spirit within them they saw the same acts that the children of Israel did they saw the same God move but yet the others didn't have the testimony but Joshua and Caleb knew that there was no obstacle that God couldn't take him through because he seen them move he SE they seen Mana fall from they seen uh flies they seen water come out of rock they see all the ab Brazen serpent all these things they saw and they said well if God can do that then I know for sure God can do this cuz he told us exactly how he's going to do it so all we got to do is just March forward and say God I'm just following your word yeah that's you you told me to do this God so I'm going by obedience I'm going by faith that you've called me to do this amen let's go to Joshua 1 amen I I love this uh this scripture here in Joshua 1 should be encouraging to all of us amen if I can get there so obviously we know um this is the commission of Joshua Moses had just died and this is the first thing that Joshua in the book of Joshua says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses ministering saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel we can put in our our personal situation even the restoration which I do give you for every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river of Euphrates the land of the high ties unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall be not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life so there's no devil there's no gainsayer that can stand in front of what is rightfully yours if God has given it to you nobody can take it away nobody can add to it it's going to be pure and unadulterated Point Blank yes sir there shall not be any man to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee so that same guy that was with Joshua and Moses is with each one of you personally so there's nothing too big or too small for you that for the god inside of you to handle you shouldn't I me uh brother Billy Paul had this testimony about his father he said he never saw a time where his dad could not solve a problem and what he meant by that was that brother Brandon relied on the god inside of him to help him through the problem and the many stories we have of him going through that that that trap that was set and all these things cuz he was dep he was dependent upon his intellects but he's depending upon the god inside of him to get it through it to get him through it yes sir be strong let's finish this I was with Moses so I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee there's not a promise in the word of God that can fail it's not the word is forever settled in heaven line upon line precept upon precept it will not return void it can't return void be strong and of good courage For unto this people Thou shalt divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left hand that thou mayest Prosper wherever thou goest so take all the word of God yes sir as simple as that don't don't try to take what you want and and leave the rest but take all the word of God because it says if you do that it says Thou mayest Prosper wherever thou goest whatever job the Lord takes you're going to prosper wherever house he leads you to you're going to prosper what he's you're going to prosper if you put God first you're going to prosper Matthew 6:33 like we said before we all want a prosperous life but we're not willing to do what it takes to have a Pros prous life it takes you to lay aside some things it takes you to make some time for God because the devil is not going to have you make time for God he doesn't he's going to make you so busy so engulfed in your own life that you're going to forget about God all day and then and wait till the end of the day to remember him and God ain't going to honor that he ain't he's not going to honor that this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there in day and night I don't think we meditate enough in the scriptures anymore we kind of just read a do a devotion is throw it off to the side we don't when we read it we kind of just oh I'm going to read this and I'm going to do my own thing but we don't take time like as I'm reading it I'm done with it I'm going to keep thinking about it I'm going to say Lord what were you trying to say to me in this Lord how can I manifest what I'm reading in this in your word that's the type of things we need to do that's meditating upon it we we just read it real quick and just throw it off we got to stop doing that and really reading the word of God this book of the law should not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night not two days a week but day and night that thou May observed to do according to all that is written therein further Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success so it's given us a definition it's giv us a a blueprint of how to be prosperous it says day and night thou mayest observe them so you got to study it and meditate it if you want to make sure you're doing all what God is calling you to do that's how you're prosperous verse n have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whatsoever thou go is so it doesn't matter what trap the devil sets for you doesn't matter what's going on in your life God is with you he's with you and in you to the end of the world you have all you need that's a majority you have God that's all you need and the children of Israel missed that that the very thing they needed wasn't fear but was God and we got to bring God into every we got to bring Faith Love and Hope in every situation if you know that's what Jesus brought in the situations with Jerry's daughter he brought Faith Love and Hope Peter John and James so we got every situation we go to we got to bring the that situation we got to yes sir Amen Let read one more quote and I think that's the very needy thing today is for the people to stand still and see what God has promised take some time and look in the word of God and see what is Promised for you take some time look it over look at these highlight the promises of God I think brother Jack mentioned it highlight those things and say whoa there's so many promises in here for me I'm I'm going to take them I'm going to claim them it's it's the day that God's fulfilling his I love that it's the day that God's fulfilling his promise these things must be they've got to come therefore we must see God's promise and stand still and Watch God's salvation and move into it God always works according to the word stealing the people so that's the word for here is it's it's the day that God is fulfilling his promise this is the year that God is going to fulfill the promises you've been you've been asking for the the Deliverance you've been needing for the financial Freedom you you've been wanting the church that we we we need God is going to give it to us so you got to believe that God is in the in the word honoring business he has to C line certain things up for you to get that promise sometimes it's it's us staying in the way of our blessings we hold a lot of our blessings away just because of uh of the life that we live sometimes we live such a life of oh I need this now like fast food God doesn't work that way Daniel Prayed for 21 days straight and didn't hear one thing from the Lord but still kept praying as if he's going to hear something each prayer that's how we got to pray we got to if we don't hear God from three weeks for two months keep on praying with all your heart because God is looking to see if you're going to stand strong in your prayer life you it's it's you got we got to stand strong we got to we we got to we got so many uh opportunities God has given us so many doors he wants to open for us spiritually and naturally and we want to hold those things back because God wants to open the windows of heaven and just bless you but you got to give him show him that you really mean business for blessings amen amen say one more one more uh thought we we just close in a word of prayer see restoration is so key for each one of us we got to just take a different look at it now it's been preached so many times behind the pulpit and we got to just claim it we got to write it down if you have to that restoration is for me that that God died personally for me God died personally to help me in my situation God died personally that I can have faith that I can have strength from him to conquer the situation and so we got to just keep our eyes on the author and finisher of our faith keep our eyes on him there's see when Peter took his eyes off of him walking in the water he began to sink and the same thing will happen to us we take our eyes off of him will begin to sink so this is the year of restoration and we all got to make make a commitment that God this is my year this is the year where I'm giving you everything I have because it might not be a next year and God you deserve my best you gave me your best I'm going to give you my best every day even we don't feel like it give God your best because God is looking at the sacrifice you're giving him look looking at the the The Obedience you're giv him and when he sees that you're truly faithful and obedient he's going to bless you exceedingly and abundantly amen this is bwing the word of prayer almighty God we just thank you Father for this beautiful
