brother I want to thank brother Jack for allowing me to minister in this pulpit in we want to send greetings to you from the Bronx in New York City where we have a little Church there God has raised up by some miracle you know whenever the God is able to raise up a message church it really is a miracle in this last day right this church is a miracle right our church is a miracle within Bronx and out there sending the greetings but the cadre Diggs is there preaching for us right now I want to greet our friends here may the Lord bless you all just want to just take a moment to kind of introduce myself as a brother said my name is brother Vaughn we we come from Lorain Ohio that's on the North Shore there Lake Erie I was born and raised in a while my parents are cool and they moved there in 1948 I was born there a few years later and my wife also was born in Lorain Ohio in the same hospital I was born in one day apart I was first so I told her I said you know I was there one day I was waiting on you when you got there and I said that means you got to respect me and 17 years later we met you know in a ball park somewhere and the day after I met her at tolls gonna marry her all right just 17 years old of course she said you're crazy she said you scared me to death I just met you yesterday no worries ain't gonna marry me I said well she said I don't love you I said well that don't mean nothin I'm gonna love you so much you're gonna end up loving me and that's what I did see ya now the day I met her now I for the young people here you you learned from this right I would I was just a Catholic boy I didn't know nothin about Christianity I'd never read the Bible or nothin like that but when I went to that park and she turned around and said a load of me my brother had arranged our meeting and when she Terron looked at me somethin spoke to me and said ditch there's your wife now I know I heard that voice I didn't I didn't know it was God but it was gone all right you know what I did I believed it even though I didn't know her I believed it and um the next day I told her I was gonna marry her and took her to meet my mom and dad and and two and a half years later we got married I was offered a scholarship right out of high school just before I got out of high school I was offered a scholarship to the best engineering school in America that's called General Motors Institute of Engineering I had taken the test for an apprenticeship with General Motors and I did so well they offered me a scholarship all expenses paid for five years and I come home and I said well let me think about it sir I went home and I told my parents my dad cried he was so happy and my brother my oldest brother and everybody was so happy for me and I told my wife and my girlfriend at that time and she said I think it's a great idea but I saw something when she said that I saw she was trying to get rid of me I could see that her you know good riddance you know I hadn't convinced her yet and and so I thought about it and the starting pay for a graduate engineer at that time was somewhere around $80,000 a year and after for your furniture program I taught to be making about $40,000 a year so I went back to that interview again two weeks later he called me in and I went in he said what are you gonna do young man I said well I decided I'm going to I offer the partnership he's gonna turn down that that engineering scholarship I said yes sir he said why I said because there's a little girl I want to marry and she said you're going to turn down a free education five years engineering degree for a girl for a woman I said what is that just not any woman as to what I'm supposed to marry and she had told me well if you go up there and I'm going to Kent State University that we have to go our separate ways because I can't promise to be a faithful to you you know so I said sir I said I'm gonna turn that down he said you'd be able to think about it twice you know because you could you're gonna make twice as much money as a graduate engineer and I told him I said sir I've thought about that for two weeks I said I've come to the conclusion I'd rather be poor that be married to the right girl then to be rich married to the wrong one now you know that come from God right because that was just a stupid little Catholic boys all it was but it was God just leaving me right and 25 years later I met that man I was leaving for New York City to Pastor and I was working inside his machine and he happened to come by I hadn't seen him in 25 years his name was Bill Chacho and he saw me and he called to me said Yvonne Yvonne I haven't seen you years he said what about that girl you still married that girl I said I sure AM he said were you ever sorry that you turned down that scholarship I said no sir best decision I ever made outside of serving Christ and so here we are this next week I think it's well they would that be on Tuesday we celebrate 42 years of marriage and the best part of the story is she want me to Christ so far I married the wrong woman I wouldn't be a Christian today which her example led me to Jesus Christ and to this message and uh and she's been with me all these years and as I'd always tell everybody the little success I've had in the Bronx they're never rough neighborhood were in the little success we've had I owe to my wife I believe the people love her and they just put up with me they love her so much she always says no that's not true but it's true her example has given me the accessible success we've had in the church there in our little church so we've been together for 28 years now I've been pastoring 20 years I spent eight years traveling back and forth from Ohio to New York City to establish the church and finally God gave me permission to quit my job in 1998 and and moved to New York City and started pastoring so we've been together all these years God's done miracles for us we've got a good unity in the church good spirit in the church I heard you're worshiping and that's always a real thrill to me to hear a message church to worshiping God I believe that the spirit of worship is the spirit of victory people that don't have victory don't worship but if you've got victory you worship you got something out about and man you don't have to have anybody encourage you to do it they just come out of here amen and I believe I believe victory comes through the world right and as we preach the word to you and you can see what Christ did for you it will produce a spirit of victory and worship in the church I was preaching the brother stage last Wednesday and Real Estate's is my good friend and there was a young man there after the service he can murder we said well Yvonne I I was in your church five years ago I don't remember him being there he said but I never forgot he says I I was watching you preach there and you were preaching real hard and and suddenly I put my head down to pray for just a second when I looked up you were up on top of the pulpit you were standing on the pulpit brother Vaughn I remember that day and I said yeah brother I remember doing that I was preaching about Israel going into battle right against the Philistines and I said in and God told them I don't want you to take a sword I don't want you to take any weapons I want you to go down into that Valley into battle and I want your weapon to be praised I will fight your battle but you let her worship me first you gotta you gotta step out of faith and believe that the victory is yours I'm gonna give it to you so I jumped up on top of the pulpit and I said now I can just see the Philistines looking down in the valley and seeing this army walk out there with not a sword with no weapons whatsoever no shield but their weapons breaking hallelujah and say these people were crazy but they didn't know that that was their weapon yeah you know what I jumped down off the pulpit that was about maybe fifty five years old back there was a miracle I could get up there but God pulled me up there and I jumped down off the pulpit I told her translator you follow me and I took off running down the middle while off the back door of the church and as I ran out that back door everybody followed me out with a jacket we marched all the way down to the corner turned down there at the bull Vague a little little corner store and came back and next to you we had about four or five sinners in the parade people off the street just got in the guy got involved and we made about three circles on the street inside the church and back out again and we just had a glorious time a real Jericho March amen the Philistines got to die they're gonna be defeated but you've got to have a vision of what Christ has done for you so you know we don't fight with carnal weapons we fight with spiritual revelations about what Christ did for us amen so I believe in worship I I'm not that one of those old Europeans brother BAM talked about amen that's what he said white people don't like to hear that but that's the truth that's it that's the truth I believe we get up in heavenly places in Christ you'll see our victory and we'll live our victory amen day nothing that happens to you that's not ordained for eternal life you've got something to learn in this life God's gonna have you go through a tribulation but it's gonna work for your good yeah and for an eternal purpose everything that's happening your life is for an eternal purpose I really believe that let me tell you brother I've been through some battles I've had these false prophets and the message come to my church and and pass out their false literature and I've had to get in your face outside my church what my finger one big man he's about six foot four inches tall big big guy and he come passing out some literature about Joseph Branham being the eighth danger or something and you know I'm just a little fellas next to him and I walked I said what do you do it pressing this stuff out in my church I don't say this to brag now I'm just telling you my experiences right I have to watch my spirit you sure you start talking this way and the Spirit of God will get grieved after your heart's not right and I said what are you doing he said well I'm gonna pass out my revelation to you people I said that's not what the Prophet taught us right Provost deeper he told us that the Holy Ghost is a gentleman how dare you come to his church and passed his stuff out without my permission I gave my life for this church I lost all my hair on route 80 across Pennsylvania for this church so I stuck my finger about that deep in his chest brother Jack all right I just I don't have you ever come back I'd call the police on them all right I told the deacon he's not welcome to more get out of here if you don't leave right now I'm gonna call the police on you yeah of course all the people in the cell brother for the volunteer you're getting car Nolan and brother Yvonne you grieve the Holy Spirit I see you don't know nothing about the Holy Ghost I said when God gives a man a commission to watch over his flock you'll give his life for that flock you don't care about what nobody thinks the Bible said the zeal of my house has consumed me I see you don't know nothing about the Holy Spirit you got you had a lot to learn I said oh hi early we'll act that way and had a devil on the back but a man of God will panel on the back you'll tell him he's wrong yeah and I say that I know God's listening right and I really believe that I believe that's what David did right right they would wasn't afraid that God that Goliath had come knocking on his door spreading false doctrine oh he wasn't afraid of them at all let me Adam all right I'll dare you defy the armies of the Living God so we've been through some battles let me tell you brothers sister New York City is a tough place to preach the gospel but there there's a people there in my church brother yeah and I think thought for the finest people in shoe leather or the venom talked about right he says that and those people serve the Lord in this message in holiness and they love this message and they they go to church and they fight the traffic and pay the tolls and do all this stuff I told the church this is my revelation there's a special recompense for people that serve the Lord correctly in the message in New York City there's something that's before you waiting on how many of you have to pay sixteen dollars across the bridge to come to church one way sometimes in our name you know I live 12 miles from church and it's taken me two hours to get to church because somebody got a flat tire on that bridge and with Noah that whenever the Yankees are playing it takes us two hours to get to church and people are still there they still arrive and they love the Lord and then they gotta catch a train and get home at one o'clock in the morning you know because they went to church on Wednesday night I love the people for that I love I see they love the Lord every Church has their trial you know you live in a paradise here that's the truth the rats in New York City like people now I'm gonna tell you something this is the truth I was a man have one night we went to visit somebody into prison and we were coming home he was 12 o'clock at night and I stopped waiting down the lower Manhattan I stopped my car to light and there was a rat standing on the corner waiting for the light to turn green not a joke and that's the truth I saw this rattle with a great big ol rat and I stopped the car and when the light turned green he walked out us apart I mean how many of you seen that in West Palm Beach I'm not joking this is the truth few people live in paradise none of you had any reason to complain whatsoever thank god you're here in West Palm Beach amen I'm sure you got two trials tourists or a trial I know that all the sin on the beaches and all that stuff I I know what you're dealing with here also everybody's got their trials right but God has anointed you to serve God here yeah and he's anointed a pastor he's given him a certain kind of personality for your congregation and all this carnal comparisons that people doing nowadays I told brother Jack the other day I said you know was it brother Jack oh maybe yeah I think it was brother Jack I told him I said you know it's become fashionable for preachers to preach for four hours it's the new fashion trend in the message where are the people out don't think about the children you know they have their breakfast at eight o'clock in the morning they go to church and then they're listening to a preacher preach for four hours and they don't get out of church till three o'clock in the afternoon no concern about that child eating his lunch all that stuff's going on see because somebody wants to tell everybody what all they know will you go ahead and tell everybody I said that it's okay I don't matter it's the truth you know I tell people in New York City everybody that didn't like what I said raise your hands I can repeat it that's exactly right we're here to step on your toes the pastor's job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict it comfortable should I repeat that again a pastor's job is to afflict are to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable I hope the time I hope I'm not getting to coming across you hard I don't like being too religious my John the Baptist wasn't too religious brother bear I wasn't too religious we just who we are that's all God made me who I am and I can't be nothing but what I am and I gave I'm a preach to you I can't possibly be successful trying to be brother Jack trying to be somebody else see I've heard people preaching and I think they got the spirit of William Branham all right they have to preach just like them and say all the things but the Benham said and they think somehow that that's gonna bring the anointing just be who you are you can't add one cubit your stature just be who you are so I want to preach a little bit about that today if I can get you to stand we'll read a verse of scripture about you begin 1st Samuel the tenth chapter I want to preach a message here I just keep the Lord gave it to me this morning I I have preached parts of this in different places but I'm gonna preach it a little bit differently today in your church I had it in my heart to to preach a sermon I actually ministered it over at brothers Stacey's the other day on the order of the voluntary sacrifice in the Book of Leviticus but the Lord changed my mind this morning and wanted me to preach this this title anointed to lead the title is called anointed to leap first samuel chapter 10 now then samuel took a vial of oil and poured upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance now watch when thou are departed from me today now this is prophetic utterance the Prophet is is prophesying about what's going to happen to Saul and now watch whenever a prophet has a message and he has perfect utterance there's an anointing that goes with that so you can be anointed by the voice of a prophet saw was about to be anointed by the voice of a prophet to become a leader so there are people in the message that have been anointed by the voice of the Prophet and it makes them a leader in the church now watch when our departed from me today then thou shall find two men by Rachel suffer cur in the border of Benjamin edges celsa and they will say unto thee they asses which now what does the seeker found and lowlife father had left the care of the asses and sorry for you saying what should I do for my son then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the plaintive Tabar and there shall meet the three men going up to God without one caring three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine and they will salute thee the two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands let's bow our heads to pray father we ask your blessings Lord give us God a word for the people and you know Lord the things that we've shared already large and all these things are true and as always father we judge ourselves and we look to see if we have another motive in our heart other than motive to be able to encourage the people to somehow show them O Lord the battle that were all engaged in oh god by experience and but father if there's anything wicked at my heart Lord that would want me to receive any kind of glory through these testimonies please forgive me Lord this it's not what I desire you the judge the hearts of men father let the beginning of this service O God be pleasing unto thee and everything we say and do let it be pleasing and let it be that will for we ask it in Jesus name Amen you may be seated so let's go quickly to first set fuel 16:13 I think it's 16 iam 4 Samuel 15 16 and verse 13 for Samuel 16 and verse 13 then Samuel took the Horn of wall and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the Spirit Lord came upon thee and David from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to Rhema now watch these two men they both been anointed to leave now I found something in the message two years ago that kind of inspired me to start studying this subject and it was the fact that whenever brother Branham speaks of Calvary he always follows it with Pentecost Wow now you I have just one or two coats here but I think there's 40 some quotes in the message were brother Branham will speak about Calvary and then speak about the life of that sacrifice coming down on the day of Pentecost so he says here in the message in the ever-present water from the rock but the band says if everything's just not right yo you'll leave and you'll say we'll join the Baptist and then the Baptist don't treat us right we'll go to the Presbyterian or somewhere else let's go back to Calvary and get the real stock of the Holy Ghost in us then you'll know where you stand then he then he preaches an another message behold a greater than Solomon is here and he says the other president water from the rock is right here now that ever-present water from that smitten Rock at Calvary when the Holy Ghost came out of him on Calvary that come back on the church on the day of Pentecost the same Holy Ghost is present now he says here 1,900 years ago on Calvary he troubled waters all right talking about the angel trouble in the waters behold a greater than Solomon is here he says and on that day of Pentecost it really shook the thing up so the waters were troubled at Calvary and he said but when the Holy Ghost fell on the church it really shook the thing up it really got trouble then all you have to do now is step right into the waters of the Spirit so we see another message he says I think this 42 quotes he he says over and over again he tied Pentecost to Calvary now he said you can't get the first base unless you get to Calvary first you can't get the Holy Ghost and you until you have a revelation of true justification alright and the blood that was spilled you're bringing sanctification and then the true baptism of the Holy Ghost so we find in the message of the hour so few people are receiving the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe it's because we VV from the gospel pattern we have to stay with the gospel pattern yeah and maybe I'll repeat this you have been repeating it everywhere I go that the message of the hour is the inspiration for the scripture all right God anoints a message for that day for the age and the inspiration of that message is what takes us deeper into the scripture but ultimately the purpose and the motive and the aim is the scripture now I was preaching in Mexico City here a couple years ago and the Lord gave me a little something I'll share with you I said I was trying to there's simple people right I'm I'm trying to get them to understand the importance of the message but the real objective of the scriptures to take us back to the word right amen so I said the message is like a diving board come on when I was a kid in high school I try to always impressed my wife with my diving skills I was really good at it all right and I learned to walk out on the end of that diving board see and there was a power in the diving board yeah and I learned how to just step into that power all right you understand I learned how to throw my body and my faith into that into that board I never thought the board would break if I thought the what border break I would have taken the step of faith but it was always in my heart I could trust this board hallelujah so I step out there and I'd hit that board just right and I should wake up in the air until they have a lease but the purpose was nothing not so much how high I can get but how deep I can get god bless you see so the message came to take you up into the heavenlies in Christ Jesus and then shoot you down deep into the scripture what we're finding in the message is the preachers get on the inner into that board they say God send a prophet God send a prophet God sent a prophet gods but they're never going to the scripture [Applause] this is not the day for us to be saying God sent a prophet there was a time maybe 30 years where the message was going out and finished he was preaching about God sent but that's we're not living in that day anymore we're living in the days of the faith for the rapture and I told my church I hope you don't mind me saying this brother I told my church the brother brand said rapturing faith was founded on seven thunders all right and the seven thunders is a personal revelation of the scripture it's the depths of the word amen it's not something that some preacher has a franchise on I like to say it this way the seven thunders are in you Paul the Apostle said you are complete hitting him everything you need for the rapture is already inside of you but God needs to reveal it to you God has to show you what he placed in you I'm gonna give you the seal of the Holy Spirit it's the revelation of Jesus Christ in you that's gonna produce a faithful the rapture it's already in you do is getting up in the presence of God take this message and let that approach you in the air and take you into the depth of the word rapture in faith comes from this Bible you don't have a cross here but my church wherever there you are god bless you brother listen but I got some coochie from the message I'm gonna just kind of show to you this way when Jesus died in the cross brother Jack it was an ink that came down and sanctified the earth all right he was blood features are preaching when you listen to the tape well you read a book you're applying the token oh that's not what the Prophet honors you apply the blood to the lintel of the door you don't apply to ink I took a tape one day my church I took a message tape let me just this is a message tape right I put it on top of the pulpit I said they're saying that this tape right here is the voice of God for this age I said I'm going to show you it's not I took a hammer out and I went whack and I destroyed that message table I said I destroyed I just destroyed the voice of God let me change them the voice of God is the Holy Ghost yeah it always has been you can destroy all the message tapes and people still get the revelation because the revelation is inside of you the Holy Ghost you see else getting all twisted brother ah ah they're taking you away from Pentecost you need a Pentecostal experience and in order for me to get you to a Pentecostal spirit experience you need to go to calorie calorie is God's method of bringing you to Pentecost and it never changed 2,000 years and never changed the scene of the tabernacle was always the altar Oh [Music] listen brother in the tabernacle it was three kind of believers three kind of believes in every church right we all know that quote but we got to take you into the scripture and teach you that out of the Bible all right I love taking the message and teaching the people the scripture I tell the people I said if I if Bob Arum said something I can't find in the Bible doesn't mean I don't believe it but I won't preach it until I could see it in the scripture there's my commission is to take you to the world maybe I don't have as much vision as somebody else but what I've got I get from the scripture I told the church not watch the worshiper bring just sacrifice and the vid against the first chapter come out the burnt offering right right he brings that sacrifice and I said there's five things he's gonna do the worshipper and there's five things the ministry has to do Wow you can study it out look I don't have time to teach you that right now I'm sure your past you'll do that but don't see now that in other words nobody can offer the sacrifice without the help of the ministry oh I mean you can't stay home from church that means you don't have a right to worship God at home by listening to a tape the ministry is part of it [Applause] hallelujah see you see the people there being a letter straight this way is because they don't know the Bible you knew the Bible you would never break the patterns of the scripture and you watch the worship would come with a sacrifice the priesthood would participate and and worship mood for a participate and he'd say hallelujah I should forget on my sin amen but that's just the first kind the second part is the the Levite who actually cuts the sacrifice up right so we have a worshiper and we have a worker good there's people in the church did work they do all the dirty work that Levite at the other day full of blood yes don't like that ah yeah see but it was his duty to worship God by working and the word she will receive is Wesley because the worker was present hallelujah so we had the word worshipper we have a Levite but then we had the Levitical priesthood and the Levitical priesthood went beyond the curtain into the holy place you know the first thing he did when he went in there he got some anointing rolling and bathed himself an anointing wall you know why to get the stink off God didn't want this think of death in the holy place everything in that holy place had to be sprinkled with oil yes that sweet anointing oil to take the smell of death off of everything and he was in the presence of God he had a right to pray in the presence of God the altar of incense was there and just beyond the curtain was the presence of God amen so we have a we have a worshiper we have a worker and we have a man that fellowships with God so the Bible says that we be Jesus has made us kings and priests not kings and Levites but kings and priests yeah and then that place is the message of the hour the candlestick all right special bread being illuminated by by the light of the fire Amen so see we have to know where do we stand where do we worship might I believe III go beyond that that curtain all right in that in the presence of God right there just on your side and and being a Levite gives you the privilege of one day hoping to be a high priest there's only the sons of the high priests the Levites the Levitical priesthood could actually worship in that place right when you were called you go beyond the veil and be the presence that pillar of fire so we see here in 1st Samuel the tenth chapter Samuel a prophet of God for that day a perfect type of William Branham you can follow that in the scriptures of 13 judge there were three judges that were living at the same time at the time of Samuel Eli the priest and the high priest was a judge the Samuel was a judge and Samson was a judge hallelujah three living at the same time we see what happened to Samson because he never sought the counsel of the vindicated prophet oh ma Samson was born 10 years after Samuel Wow and they started your ministry had exactly the same year Samuel was 30 years old and Samson was twenty years old oh brother BAM said Samson was a Pentecostal church and he says Delilah deceived him and God he got his eyes plucked out you know why because he wouldn't go to the eye of God which was Samson Samuel if you had gone to Samuel Samuel and sought counsel Samuel said get away from Neptune a sea woman but see Samson wanted to do whatever he wanted to do cuz he had been anointed by the Holy Spirit to be a judge I got the Holy Ghost read me alone I don't have to go to church I had the Holy Ghost I don't have to have a pastor I got the Holy Ghost you see listen I saw God for these these messages I have problems in my church and I said Lord you got to show me in the scripture what's going on show me in the Bible what's going on in my church so I can I can teach the people right from wrong in the scripture I'm not gonna do battle with these demons let the word conquer them so I'm sure we got that circumstances that are similar here in West Palm Beach we probably got people here don't want to listen to counsel from from Samuel the Prophet brother Jack you think you have a right to do anything you walk but you got the Holy Ghost you end up a blind man Dalila arrived wiser than you are if you lose the anointing you sure will hallelujah I got a good I feel a good spirit in this church so you might get pastor preaches just as hard as I do god bless you brother brother Jack give the place anymore we're preachers are afraid to preach against sin I'm no hireling servant of God hallelujah I'm so glad they said via a letter one time they said believe all I want you to come faster the churches started and he said please sign the return I never did sign and return it you know what I did it put it in my safe I said Lord these same people that are on this listen the rise that begins me one day I'm not signing nothing when I went to New York City they said you're gonna be our pastor I said well I'll be here in the position yes you signed a letter absolutely not if I sign that letter I'll make you my enemy because then I'm indebted to you but I came here because God sent me here I still have it in my in my files called important letters received I haven't had to pull out a time or two - yes sir now you watch you watch first Samuel the tenth chapter you'll see some things that are important right the first thing is it was a box of oil that Sam you used to anoint the soul right the prophecy said you'll mitri men one man will have three goats one man will have a bottle of wine and one man will have three loaves of bread but the prophecy said you're only gonna receive two loaves of bread so the three goats represent the sacrifice so the anointing that that saw received had nothing to do with the sacrifice the sacrifice was not associated with the anointing because he didn't receive the three goats there was no bloodshed when he we see the anointing and he just received two loaves of bread which is justification and sanctification he never got the third loaf which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he never received the wine the bottle of wine which is a revelation [Applause] and he was anointed to lead hallelujah you see in the scripture yeah this is what's happening the message you watch preachers that go out and they get angry and jealous with other preachers and start throwing your javelin you go to scripture you'll see they never got the third loaf they have no revelation of why they're leading and they never went to Calvary but now we see in 1st Samuel 16 we see or 15 we see David was anointed by the same prophet the same voice was used the same anointing oil but now he's anointed with a horn of oil not a box of oil now in Spanish it's called our Roma rhizoma is a box it's a clay box right the clay box is a type of symbol of Samuel the Prophet himself this play box held the anointing Wow and when he spoke the anointing came forth from this play box and anointed this man all right but when David when Samuel spoke the anointing came forward from a horn which speaks of a sacrifice because only God can make a horn and order for a man to use a horn as a vessel that can change the oil of the Holy Spirit it's got to die or death so when neighbor was anointed he was anointed with a horn of oil that in other words a sacrifice of calorie was directly associated with the voice of the Prophet and with the oil what would have produced nod it's a great study in the scripture this is the revelation of the first four horse riders all right are found in the life of salt and the revelation of the statue of a perfect man are found in the life of David from the moment David was anointed with that Horn of oil God do we begin to work a work in David's life that produce a crowning in 2nd Samuel all right he was crowned with the authority of the kingdom in 1st Samuel the 2nd chapter because he had come up in the statue of a perfect man until he guy finally come into brotherly love and he could love his enemy Oh you see how important tell Ria's how important that horn is now the Bible says in Revelation there was seven horns in his hand a horn for every age God never brought a message to us that was disassociated from Calvary every age the gospel remained the same because the Holy Ghost can only come through that sacrifice the sacrifice of Calvary hallelujah now it's preaching one time in Ecuador and there was a famous message preacher that was preaching with me and I went to dedicate a church and maybe I've got better be careful I want to say too much somebody will start investigating find out who the person was you don't have to worry about who the person was but I was preaching something about Calvary I remember I know it was it was true and false repentance and I preached the message to Charles Finney preached 150 years ago Wow and I was teaching the church from second Corinthians chapter 7 that there's seven fruits of a true repentance oh wow you search it out 2nd Corinthians chapter 7 when God begins to work a work in a man's life it brings forth seven fruits of true repentance but there's also false repentance as mentioned in second Corinthians except chapter 7 chapter the Bible says our false repentance repentance according to the world works death but true repentance work works these seven different fruits the last one is vengeance when the Holy Ghost brings you to a true repentance God takes vengeance on the enemy when you come up in the stats of a perfect man and you get to a place where you could love your enemy God can now use you to take vengeance against the enemy and that's what happened with David that Amalekite thought he was gonna be recompense with gold and silver when he reported it I'm the one that killed your enemy you should rejoice he said Oh what was you you touch God's anointed right don't you know we didn't agree but I loved my brother because the anointing was on him hallelujah oh that's a great study in the scriptures brother it's right there see the message is found in the Bible now a man that backs away from this message and rejects this message I wish I was sitting on top of the Empire State Building and preaching it to the entire world right now listen brother if a man walks away from this message it's because he has no revelation of Scripture he never came to a true repentance God does not reveal himself to a man that did not repent hallelujah see I can't leave this message this message is Christ to me it's annoying sure to me this message made me fall in love with Jesus Christ because it revealed Christ - now we just we just explained - to anointings for two different men let me let me share something else with you here yeah no I want to talk about Saul and David we've already spoken about them can we go over and maybe speak about Jeroboam all right first Kings 11 all right [Music] watch this now first first Kings chapter 11 let's go over to uh verse 26 and Jeroboam the son of Neeb at the efforts height of the red up Solomon's servant whose mother's name was a real zebra zarua a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king she lifted up his hand against the pastor and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the King Solomon built built milho and repaired the breech of the City of David his father in other words he got jealous he thought Tony was getting glory to himself so he started nitpicking and criticizing the pastor all right and the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of Valor and Solomon seen young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph in other words he was like a Levite he was a worker man he would work in the church and the pastor said this boy is a real worker I'm gonna put him to work he loves to work in the ministry Wow and they came too fast at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem that the prophet Elijah the Shilin I'd found him in a way and he had Clyde himself with a new garment and they too were alone in the field now I want to stop you just for a moment and say this God hates new things and a Hodja he cleared himself in a new garment Wow God hates new things because everything he did was 18 times before the foundation of the world he spoke this work of redemption and that is the old time gospel we don't need anything new in the message we don't need any new garments we don't need any new carts remember David made that mistake with the new card we don't need any new swords remember that that giant came to kill David with a new sword but there was a valiant man said you can't kill the old time gospel David was an old man the old time gospel a new doctrine I'm gonna take your head off God hates new things God sent a song delusion to drove Jeroboam and I hide you caught the new climate that was on him and read it in 12 pieces and he said to Jeroboam take the ten pieces where thus said the Lord the God of Israel behold I will run the kingdom out of the hands of Solomon and will give Jim tribes unto thee Oh Jeroboam got anointed but notice there was no oil it was just the voice of the prophet saying that said the Lord but there was no oil and no sacrifice associated with that anointing there was not even a box of oil there was no horn there was no oil it was just the voice of a prophet coming from a cassette table we could say it that way hey brother the last 50 years of this message lots of people have been avoided anointed by message tapes he even called my name you know Jim Jones his name was mentioned in the message and he was anointed Wow when he killed all those people in Guyana they found message tapes there they found the revelation of the seals it was it was their net camp you better be associated with Calvary you better should make sure that that all comes forth from Calvary the true anointing will make your servant to God's people you will not lord over the people and you will divide the camp like Jeroboam did you see split searches all over the place everywhere I go I find a testimony of somebody's church breaking up because somebody was lifted up in their spirit and started criticizing Solomon the builder of the church I wish I had time to preach is the way I wanted to listen brother these things are real we're reading prophecy in the scripture there's jeroboams in the camp right now now you watched your bulb everything did they do did that he did was false the Bible said he had a false priesthood he can't fault a place of worship you ordained a false ministry everything he did was false but he was anointed by the voice of a Hydra the prophet Annoying to delete God said a strong delusion is he's in a proper to anoint him with his voice can we go to another verse in Scripture I know my god I know brother Jack has to leave and maybe the Lord will keep that airplane down like you did for brother BAM well let's just jump ahead yeah-hoo yeah-hoo the prophet now he was anoint you with a box of oil see there was no sacrifice associated with his anointing and he was anointed by God to go and kill all the the effects of Jezebel death Alaia in Israel in other words he was anointed to kill the denominational spirit that was in Israel that Jezebel system but he was not associated with his sacrifice of Calvary hallelujah notice he is the fulfillment of part of Elijah's ministry praise the Lord but I want you to see that he never ever showed any mercy to anyone because mercy comes from Calvary and and you gotta know in a a chariot one day should come up jump up in my chariot here and seal the seal the offer that I had so he had a supernatural zeal that caused him to overstep the bounds of his commission but the Prophet said you're gonna destroy Jezebel house and that's a lie but he never said you're gonna destroy all the prophets of bail and he killed all those prophets a male without any mercy so we have preachers in a message that can preach against Jezebel preach against that denominational system but they can't win a soul for Christ's getting angry raise your hand I'll raise my I'll repeat it again that's the truth brother I know preachers that have been preaching for 40 years they have never won one soul for Kefka Christ you know why they're not associated with Calvary oh they can preach for four hours but they'll never mention Calvary hallelujah I was telling you about this man over in Ecuador I got up and preached this message about true and false repentance and the church whate'er although the Altru is full of preachers not lagi all the preachers came forward you know is praying for them they're our wives I was shocked brother Jack my wife was there and and this is this all this old preacher that may be preaching 50 years is wise praying that God would bring in the complete repentance all the evangelists all the pastor's they're all laying at the altar weeping and that's not running everywhere it was really the Lord I was shocked myself to see what the effect of the true gospel being preached to them men that preach the gospel have never come to true repentance they still they commit adultery and they commit fornication married two or three times in pastoring churches I think the Holy Spirit no sir the Holy Spirit is righteousness and truth well the next preacher got up behind me he was more famous than me and he got up and he said well how many appreciated brother carry-ons message this morning everybody clapped amen amen they all loved me there and then he says but we know that Calvary is not necessary today we don't have to preach those things today what we have to do is bring the church up into the faith of the rapture and my translator was sitting next to me and he grabbed because you tell I take off running maybe grab him by the throat or something you know he knows how I am he said calm down believe I said well that's okay he just sealed himself outside the kingdom he just blast him the Holy Spirit I see you don't fool with people like that brother let him preach what he wants to he's outside the kingdom you you you say something against Calvary you say it's not necessary you have blaspheme the Holy Spirit you have blaspheme the gospel you have killed the effect of the gospel you're without hope there's no coming back let him say what he wants to say you watch repeal what happens with people like that they always end up in shame now you watch watch the scripture now Abraham took love with him right brother BAM said he was just huh what was he called him here in the biskits right just a problem all the time for Abraham but you know we did he gotten blessed because he was under the umbrella or the wings of a prophetic ministry and so he begin to grow and his Fox grew in his church grew until finally the two churches started arguing about what missionary camp they should go to and Abraham was a man of God he said brother you want to go to the ride go ahead and do the ride I'll go to left he gave him preference showing that he was elect he didn't fight wherever I go I'm blessed I don't I don't have to seek the green fields of Sodom but he he decided to go to Sodom see you know why he had come to a place we thought I don't need to follow this prophet no more wow I've been blessed my church has been blessed I can I can seek prosperity now and I can go the way of the world Sodom and Gomorrah when you see a message preacher leaving holiness he's headed for the green fields of Sodom I'm a holiness preacher my my experience made me a holiness preacher I believe a church has got to clean up yeah Church has got to get rid of thing all the things of the world I hope you don't get angry at me but I'm gonna preach it anyway it's the truth Abraham be stayed separated up on the mountaintop but the angel the Lord but but a lot had been deceived into believing God's with me too I can go the way the world and God is with me because look look how my church is grown but you know what he had two sons and that decision he made was reflected in his two sons and the two sons come to an illness a relationship with his daughter and the the legacy they left those two boys Ammon and Moab is you know legacy is the reputation you leave your children right you could leave your money gold and silver but what's more important is the reputation that your daddy leaves for you and people will respect you just because of who your father was or else they'll disrespect you because of who your father was you see how important it is young man to be a good father and stay under the wings of this prophetic ministry you know what the legacy was that he left Hammond in Moab it was a legacy of shame because every time Hammond and more apt talked about their father they were also talking about the grandfather and that legacy of shame begin to create a hatred between them and the elect of God and they became eternal enemies of Israel because Israel could talk about a legacy of faith but they couldn't talk about a legacy of faith their legacy was shame you watch these preachers that lead this message the legacy leader children will always end up in shame they always end up out in the world all go ahead you know there's always a aspire to in church every time I preach this kind of thing there's always somebody in the church gonna tell I'm gonna go tell so so he said there happens every single time they come along when they throw you under the bus believe on my brother brother Jack but brother Ivonne said this over brother Jack dubs Church and then the next thing I get a phone call how dare you talk that way well the truth is the truth you watch all through the scripture whenever a man leaves a prophetic ministry he always ends up leaving a legacy of shame for his children once again it's in the Bible it's prophetic word coming to to us through the scripture hallelujah so Jeroboam was deceived by the voice the prophet he received an anointing that made him tainted the kingdom and split the church and actually that was Yahoo let's go to the last one I know the Jack's gotta leave it's alright but I want you to study the Scriptures and I want you to to study the anointings that are in the Bible many different ways for men to be anointed but there's only one true way the true leadership is reflected in another quote the brother prophet give us he said here let's see if I can find it here page three like [Music] the revelation of Jesus Christ brother Baron says don't be confused because he has three offices or that he has a three-fold manifestation on earth he was a prophet in heaven he is the priest and coming back to earth he is the king of Judah he is prophet priest and King so the true leadership of the Holy Spirit must be reflected was three offices prophet priest and King in other words the Prophet must be present the priest must be present right and your deign king must present all right now notice in in in David's case the Prophet was president the King was present but the high priest was not there and we know that the war in the world must be present all right five identifications for true leadership Wow the the the Horn of oil the oil corn oil prophet priest and King we see the foreign and the oil the puppet and the King but the high priest is not present in David's life because that's why he was called a man of blood he could not build a temple because he had killed his field much blood why because the high priest was not present the high priest is a Ministry of intercession for mercy and for joy hallelujah the only place you'll find in the scripture we're all five identifications are found are in the anointing of Sullivan the King can I take you over to let's see here first I think it's first Kings [Music] first Kings I don't think I'd get this far I didn't write that verse of scripture down first Kings there's kings yes first Kings chapter one [Music] Adonai just another anointing in chapter 1 first few verses he was anointed to be king also but he was anointed lost because when he saw that shoot of mine he was anointed with lust the Bible says then he he he lifted up himself when he saw that beautiful shunammite he wanted that shoot'em eye for himself he was anointed with lust no prophet was present in the oil was president no horn was present the high priest wasn't present but what was what was present was a lustful spirit and you'll see that wherever a new church begins to rise up there's always an agonized you that won't take her he wants that beautiful shooter mic which shoot of my faith remember the shooter my woman was that the David seventh wife hallelujah but he never had a natural relationship with her he had a spiritual relationship with her Wow he never had a physical relationship with her it was spiritual and he kept the old time gospel alive David was dying he represented the old time gospel and he got this beautiful virgin woman right to keep him warm hallelujah until the time of the building came and and I denied you wanted her for himself now first kings and verse 37 as the Lord had been with my lord the King even so be he with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David so Zadok the priest the high priest and Nathan the prophet the Prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada Joya and the Cherith lights and the Pella fights went down and calls Solomon to ride upon Kings David David's mule and brought him to get your kid run so we see the Prophet Britain King or present and Zadok the priest took a hoard of oil out of the tabernacle and an anointed Solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save King Solomon so the prophet priest and King are present and the Horn of war was present right all five identifications the only King in the Bible that's identified with all five what Solomon the king Wow you know why because Solomon the King was the builder of the tabernacle and builder of the temple at a perfect type of the Holy Ghost God is building a temple during the Gentile dispensation and every man that's anointed of God to lead the church must have all five identifications in his life breathe we're not deceived anymore by gifts of preaching in Spanish the gift is called wound on the la Via you know in love years it comes to the world love you love you as your lip some people have a gift of lip they know they move their lips just right or they got tremendous memories they can preach to you and quote you a lot better and believe on and they'll preach to it three or four hours sermons to you but you'll never see them building the temple they're always tearing it down brother Jack don't have any revelation about the message come and come to my ministry double click and listen to my ministry and send the tithes here and you're gonna grow spiritually no you're not that man is deceiving you you need a pastor that can pray for your children intercede for your your marriages you need a pastor you need a plate to pay your tithing locally but the Bible said every Christian should have a local assembly and every Christian should have a pasture this is a new thing that's coming up in the message these internet pastors nothing but nonsense all it is you'll never build the Church of all that way no siree there's gonna be someone locally working there's gotta be a pastor to lead you and guide you you can't submit yourself to an authority of a man that lives 3,000 miles away it's easy brother you know today we have this new thing in the message so wake up on Sunday morning they got their slippers on and maybe a set of Pecha pajamas it's about time for church and they go over and double-click on the computer pick out a side say well let's do this one today they kick up their feet up on the recliner and they tell it their wife honey give me some ham and eggs and maybe some toast and some oatmeal and while they're listening and they're going to church they're having breakfast at the same time I think they push pause and they go to the bathroom and they come push it let's continue I don't like that sermon let me kick over here and listen to somebody else see and when you do that you don't have to submit yourself to nobody let's talk the truth now that's really what it's all about brother Jack I just don't believe in that stuff you know why is something new when I searched the scripture I just don't see that in the Bible when Paul preached to the Ephesians he was there laboring with those people the people in Corinth were listening to what he was saying you know why he had a different message for the church at Corinth if he had been preaching me to the church at Corinth it all died gagging on that meat all they could hear was milk that's what happens when when your church goes out and starts doing that stuff then they start making carnal compares these are they that compare themselves amongst themselves and they are not wise it's the identification of the foolish version when you start comparing ministries it identifies you as a foolish version you have to have a revelation who your pastor is I'd like to just finish with this there's more we could save it and break it down more for you but we don't have time 40 years of peace you know why Solomon was a wise son before you receive the gift of wisdom David told Solomon Sullivan you're a wise son before he's you see the gift of wisdom he said you know what you have to do with that Joab yeah you know he's giving me nothing but trouble he's been disobedient mighty in battle but he don't know how to conduct himself in church so he's great for killing Philistines but obeying the king he just can't do it and you can't possibly build this temple until you kill that man Wow so word he died at the at the altar holding on to the horns right holding the horn representing the sacrifice yeah four horns right holding on to that horn they're begging for mercy but the Bible says if you don't give mercy there's no mercy gonna come to you and after two have died now Solomon enjoy the reign of forty years of peace why because God said you have to put all your energy all your resources into building the temple you can't be distracted with problems in the church so sometimes pastors got me rough that Joe abs in the church I got a question for you are you a Joab or you're an Abner joab had the right doctrine but the wrong spirit I haven't had the wrong doctrine but he had the right spirit and the right spirit corrected Abner and he died because his doctrine was corrected Joab didn't believe in that God can change a man's heart and he came to true leadership and he died because of it so we have jobs in a church we have Abner's in the church in the message of the hour yeah I'll tell you when I see men jumping from church to church from pillar to post there's something wrong with them let me share this with you Ephesians the first chapter which in his way makes it makes a lot of enemies the devil hates this kind of preaching he teases the first chapter [Music] we'll start in verse 6 I'm gonna finish up now you can alway cup now in my church when I see people sleeping I always tell them well I'm finishing up and they wake right up we will be leaving pretty soon I don't want nobody catch me sleeping let me wake up verse six to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved and who we have redemption through his blood not the ink but through his blood right the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace we're in here the bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself then the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together hidden one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in other words rapture the rapture is about God coming down and gathering those that that he has revealed the mystery of his will to so the Word of God was first spoken before pintada the foundation of the world before the creation God spoke his word and then he placed it in symbolic form in the Bible amen then the symbolic form of the word is dispensed in every age as a revelation for that age the message of that age and the elect believer catches that revelation amen and that revelation becomes something called vindicated truth whether Balaam said those seven thunders would be vindicated truth truth vindicated by the voice of God personally to the individual and that voice would reveal the mystery of God's will for your life so this word this Bible and the message of the hour everything that God had been doing the last 2000 years is simply put this way he's trying to reveal the mystery of his will for your life now we have people that can quote the message and know the Bible by memory they preach it but can they can never find the mystery of God's will for their life it means there's no revelation when God we begin to reveal the word to you it's for one purpose to position you in Christ to put you in the promised land and to hold you in that piece of inheritance that belongs to you that's why you see people jumping from church to church they're never content because they've never had the will of God revealed to them and the only way you can possibly please God is to be standing in the revealed mystery of God for your life I just don't believe in it the scripture doesn't teach me that right I was asked one time but they've all we got an Internet church we want you to come down and preach for us on Saturday there's a lot of believers across the country that don't have a place to go to church and we're trying to reach those people and encourage them and your ministry would be a great blessing then would you would you would you possibly help us with to help those people I said absolutely not and they said why not I said well the first thing is why they take a job somewhere they can't go to church I never do that the Bible teaches us that Christ might have the preeminence in the church but the BAM said there was three things God was trying to do right he's trying to reveal himself have the preeminence Christ would have the preeminence and restore now we claim that that God we've received the revelation of the word and we claim to be revealed but Christ doesn't have the preeminence your career has your preeminence your bank account has your preeminence some woman has preeminence in your life so I find the problem in the messages preeminence so I told this brother I've said brother if they're they moved after some money or some job somewhere I said to me they're backslidden and I'm not gonna preach to them because what I'm doing is putting wood on your back slidden fire they need to repent they need to seek the will of God for their life find a pastor somewhere they'll tell them the truth and sit there better to be poor and be married to the right pastor that'll be rich and be married some prostitute somewhere amen don't deceive yourself if you know this message and you're still wondering about the will of God for your life you better put your knowledge off to one side that's secondary the primary thing in a Christians life is to be found in Christ on the day of the rapture and Christ means the perfect will of God for your life the anointed word cop student I'll put you in your place when Christ Paul on the skin immediately god I've called you to be a light to the Gentiles he placed him in his position immediately and three and a half years in the desert up on Mount Sinai do you know he went to Mount Sinai not just Saudi Arabia but he went to the same place Moses got his revelation Wow he went to Mount Sinai with his Buffone he began to study and all God revealed to him was what I want for you to do with your life as Christ was revealed to Paul up in that holy place the will of God was
