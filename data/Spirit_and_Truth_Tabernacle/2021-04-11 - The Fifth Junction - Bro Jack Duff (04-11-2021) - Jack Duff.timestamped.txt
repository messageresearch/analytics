[48:51] blessing to the reading
[48:52] of his word shall we pray lord jesus
[48:56] um how grateful we are
[48:59] to come and read the scripture and
[49:02] lord we're just trying to enter a
[49:06] channel lord that the
[49:07] the prophet brought when he preached his
[49:09] sermon uh the junction of time and he
[49:12] talked about
[49:12] seven different junctions but lord you
[49:15] allowed the prophet
[49:16] to read this scripture uh as he preached
[49:19] on that
[49:20] on that subject and lord just trying to
[49:23] follow the mind of christ we pray that
[49:25] you would just minister to us
[49:26] and help us lord to see the things that
[49:28] we can't see
[49:30] lord and to experience the things that
[49:32] are written here in scripture
[49:34] we realize that what was written here
[49:37] uh lord in the book of acts is a promise
[49:40] to generations
[49:42] not just to those that were there on the
[49:44] day of pentecost but even to this day
[49:46] it's a promise
[49:47] and father we're we're under expectation
[49:49] for your word to be made manifest
[49:52] uh in this place oh god
[49:55] let us not leave here the same way we
[49:57] came but may the holy spirit take
[50:00] complete control
[50:01] over all that happens from this point
[50:03] forward in jesus name
[50:05] we pray amen and amen god bless you can
[50:08] be seated
[50:20] praise the lord um so
[50:23] last sunday we preached on the fifth
[50:27] junction
[50:28] but i took it from an angle
[50:31] of easter because as uh
[50:35] brother troy told us all
[50:38] the slope has a has a slope back to
[50:41] calvary
[50:42] uh and uh and we just wanted to focus a
[50:45] man a lot on things pertaining to easter
[50:48] but i had
[50:49] some other things that i wanted to uh
[50:52] just kind of deal with in that fifth
[50:53] junction
[50:54] uh we just uh quickly
[50:57] we know uh there are seven junctions
[50:59] that the prophet
[51:00] talked about the first being noah and
[51:02] the ark uh
[51:04] where the sons of god went after the
[51:06] daughters of man and you know just
[51:08] the judgment that came upon the earth
[51:10] during that time
[51:11] um second junction was moses and
[51:13] children of israel
[51:14] god had a prophet and the miraculous
[51:17] taking place during each junction and
[51:19] moses was the prophet there in the
[51:20] second junction and
[51:22] uh so many miracles moses calling down
[51:26] flies and you know i mean turning ward
[51:28] into blood
[51:30] uh i mean uh the red sea opening up
[51:33] and you name it miracle after miracle
[51:35] happening there at the junction
[51:37] uh abraham and lot uh it was a miracle
[51:40] that lot
[51:42] and his family came out of of um
[51:45] of sodom that's a miracle amen if god
[51:49] has delivered you from some stuff that's
[51:51] a miracle
[51:52] right amen so uh you know god
[51:55] also changing the body of of abraham and
[51:58] sarah that they might bring forth the
[51:59] promised son
[52:00] a lot of things happened during that
[52:02] third junction uh we
[52:04] had uh finished that elijah and the 450
[52:07] prophets of baal that was the fourth
[52:09] junction
[52:10] and i want to go back and hit something
[52:11] there jesus came at the fifth junction
[52:13] martin luther and john wesley be the
[52:15] sixth
[52:16] junction we'll get there and the second
[52:18] coming of christ will be the seventh
[52:19] junction so we got just a couple more
[52:21] that we want to hit here
[52:22] uh before we finish this series but um
[52:26] i wanted to go back to that fourth
[52:28] junction uh
[52:29] there's a i made comments to it when i
[52:32] preached it
[52:33] and uh but i um i wanted to read a
[52:36] particular quote that went along with
[52:38] some of the comments that i made
[52:40] but let's just read here from first
[52:41] kings 17 1-6 and
[52:43] and i just felt in my spirit that as uh
[52:46] brother solomon was
[52:47] singing this song um let go and let god
[52:51] as soon as i stopped worrying
[52:52] uh how the story end and all that uh i
[52:55] i said oh what a connection to where i
[52:57] want to start
[52:58] at uh this morning it's the holy ghost
[53:01] that's in control
[53:02] amen hallelujah see you sometimes we
[53:06] come we just think of just another song
[53:08] amen but god know exactly what song to
[53:11] place where
[53:12] and he's tr sometimes if you if you if
[53:14] you listen
[53:15] with your spiritual ear god could
[53:18] actually speak a message to you
[53:20] through the song right the song itself
[53:24] will will bring you encouragement and
[53:27] and just remember that the word as soon
[53:28] as
[53:29] i stop worrying
[53:32] worrying how the see you're trying to
[53:34] write your own story
[53:37] but it ain't even your book
[53:41] it ain't even your book you can't write
[53:43] you yo you
[53:44] if it was your book you can write how to
[53:46] end and the story gonna be but this is
[53:47] god's book
[53:49] right so so so as soon as i stop
[53:51] worrying
[53:52] how the story end that's when i let go
[53:57] and i let god and god been fighting with
[54:00] some of us
[54:01] wrestling with some of us trying to get
[54:03] each other let go and let me have this

[54:32] like they won
[54:33] on paper based on the status of the
[54:36] players that they have
[54:37] but they still got to get in the game if
[54:40] you're a basketball team you still got
[54:42] to put the ball in the bucket
[54:43] if you're a football team you still got
[54:45] to score touchdowns
[54:46] right i mean you still got to work for

[56:30] all right all right all right all right
[56:33] amen
[56:34] so here i'm in first king 17
[56:38] amen and uh starting at verse one this
[56:41] is
[56:41] a tying to the fourth junction but just
[56:44] wanted to read something to you this
[56:45] morning hopefully to be an encouragement
[56:47] uh here the bible says elijah the
[56:50] tishbite
[56:51] who was of the inhabitants of gilead
[56:54] said unto ahab as the lord god of israel
[56:58] liveth before whom i stand
[57:02] there shall not be do nor rain these
[57:05] years
[57:07] look at this now but according to my
[57:10] word
[57:12] right and i mean and this man had the
[57:15] authority as a prophet of god to stand
[57:18] out there
[57:19] and say it cannot reign until i say so
[57:24] right and just think about that right
[57:26] because god is the one that controls the
[57:28] ring
[57:29] right now i mean and no matter these
[57:31] these guys could have traveled to other
[57:33] cities
[57:34] and saw rain happening all over the
[57:35] place but because that prophet was
[57:37] living there
[57:39] and that prophet said it will not rain
[57:41] until i say so then it was not gonna
[57:43] rain until he said so
[57:45] right but uh but notice now we we you
[57:47] know and
[57:48] i'm going back and because as i brought
[57:50] this a few weeks ago
[57:52] the the very next sunday y'all remember
[57:55] right the very next sunday
[57:56] the devil was attacking uh brother ernie
[58:00] on on that friday night service
[58:02] attacking him and he was just
[58:03] he was he was he was doing everything he
[58:05] could to preach on sunday morning
[58:07] and i was trying to talk him out of it
[58:09] brother don't you know i i
[58:10] i can do it i did not know brother jack
[58:12] i'm okay brother brother ernie come out
[58:14] here
[58:15] picked up and said the exact coming from
[58:18] from from washington state all the way
[58:21] on the other
[58:22] side of the usa and come and preach the
[58:24] same exact scripture
[58:26] not only that made the same comments
[58:30] hallelujah when you see things like that
[58:32] happen in church that
[58:34] tell you that jesus is in the building
[58:39] the presence of the lord is here
[58:42] we're not just playing church we come to
[58:46] experience
[58:46] christ glory to god so you know
[58:50] uh uh i was just very blessed by you
[58:52] know our brother doing that
[58:54] and and i want to just kind of go back
[58:55] i'm gonna keep reading here in verse two
[58:56] says in the word of the lord
[58:58] came unto him saying
[59:01] uh get the hints and
[59:04] turn thee eastward and hide thyself by
[59:07] the brook
[59:08] cherith amen that is before
[59:11] jordan he says and it shall be that thou
[59:14] shalt drink
[59:14] of the brook and i have commanded the
[59:18] ravens to feed thee there
[59:21] oh i just love the word of god says so
[59:24] he went and did according unto the word
[59:26] of the lord
[59:27] for he went and dwelt by the brook
[59:29] cherith
[59:30] that is before jordan and the ravens
[59:32] brought him bread and flesh in the
[59:34] morning
[59:35] and bread and flesh in the evening and
[59:37] he drank of the brook
[59:39] now now uh just a couple comments and i
[59:41] want to go to this sermon
[59:43] a trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[59:45] that's the quote that i'm going to be
[59:46] reading from
[59:47] but just a couple comments uh comments
[59:49] here the ravens were already commanded
[59:53] by god to bring food before the prophet
[59:57] arrived at the brook
[59:59] right and uh uh the other thing is that
[1:00:02] we need to understand
[1:00:03] it was elijah that caused the condition
[1:00:07] his words i hope we can catch this
[1:00:11] his words cause his condition
[1:00:16] i want you to understand amen uh
[1:00:19] saints of god sometimes it's your words
[1:00:22] that cause your condition
[1:00:26] oh hallelujah your words the way that
[1:00:30] you talk what you speak sometimes we
[1:00:32] speak
[1:00:32] hastily right we we we get ahead of
[1:00:36] ourselves and our words
[1:00:38] amen caused our condition it was it was
[1:00:41] elijah's words about it would not be
[1:00:43] rain that's what caused his condition
[1:00:45] but i need you to understand even though
[1:00:48] uh he might not have thought it all the
[1:00:49] way through
[1:00:50] sometimes we don't think it all over
[1:00:52] through we don't realize how that's
[1:00:53] gonna impact us
[1:00:54] how that's going to affect us do you
[1:00:56] realize god doesn't already
[1:00:57] win ahead of you and god is already
[1:01:01] preparing a way for you
[1:01:04] hallelujah god got a place for you to be
[1:01:06] sustained
[1:01:08] even when your words have impacted your
[1:01:10] condition
[1:01:15] watch this he says so i i was writing
[1:01:17] this before the condition
[1:01:18] worsened god had already made a way
[1:01:23] i love that before the condition
[1:01:25] worsened
[1:01:26] god had already made a way
[1:01:31] now look at this and the trumpet gives
[1:01:32] an uncertain sound prophet says now
[1:01:34] he said elijah i want you to get up
[1:01:37] there
[1:01:38] in the driest place in the country
[1:01:41] plum up on the mountain where there
[1:01:44] ain't no springs now god is sending him
[1:01:45] somewhere where there's
[1:01:47] it's almost an impossible situation for
[1:01:49] him to get anything out of this
[1:01:51] and and i love the way the prophet is
[1:01:52] able to kind of take us on the scene
[1:01:54] here
[1:01:54] right it says uh up in the driest place
[1:01:57] in the country
[1:01:58] plum up on the mountain where there
[1:02:00] ain't no
[1:02:01] springs glory but i have one up there
[1:02:05] for you
[1:02:07] oh hallelujah amen in order to
[1:02:10] be to be sustained god only needed to
[1:02:12] bribe him provide him one brook
[1:02:15] oh come on somebody amen sometimes god
[1:02:18] only

[1:16:21] i don't know well what about i don't

[1:16:29] i i don't even care all i know but god
[1:16:33] but god but
[1:16:34] god god made a promise and he's the one
[1:16:35] that's going to manifest it
[1:16:37] hallelujah to the lamb of god all right
[1:16:40] amen
[1:16:42] i just love the lord jesus thank you for
[1:16:43] your word lord thank you for your word
[1:16:46] all right so here uh i'm picking up on
[1:16:48] this fifth junction
[1:16:50] amen brother branham call this one of
[1:16:53] the main
[1:16:54] junctions one of the main junctions
[1:16:57] uh five we know is the number of grace
[1:17:01] uh uh we we know that we receive grace
[1:17:04] at the cross
[1:17:05] through what our lord and savior did uh
[1:17:07] this was a very very important
[1:17:09] junction uh there was a statement that
[1:17:11] was made i won't read it all says just
[1:17:13] before
[1:17:13] this this that great junction there come
[1:17:16] the devil out amongst the preachers and
[1:17:17] said the days of miracles has passed
[1:17:20] and there's no such a thing and that and
[1:17:22] and at that
[1:17:23] at that same time god sent angels to the
[1:17:26] earth
[1:17:27] all right so now i want to just kind of
[1:17:29] make a couple statements here because we
[1:17:30] realize that at every junction
[1:17:32] of time god sends forth his prophets and
[1:17:35] then also he sends his angels and they
[1:17:37] come to give
[1:17:38] a warning amen he sends the prophets and
[1:17:40] he says angels at the junction
[1:17:43] during this fifth junction a couple
[1:17:46] things that make it very important it
[1:17:47] was
[1:17:48] it was during this junction that
[1:17:50] omnipotence
[1:17:52] was made flesh i want you to get that
[1:17:55] omnipotence they're all all-powerful
[1:17:57] almighty god
[1:17:59] the one that's that that quenched fire
[1:18:02] in a fiery furnace
[1:18:03] the one that opened up a red sea
[1:18:07] hallelujah the one that uh uh uh
[1:18:10] uh uh that stopped lions from destroying
[1:18:13] a prophet
[1:18:14] right i mean uh you just name it the one
[1:18:16] that turned water into blood all these
[1:18:18] mighty things that we read about
[1:18:20] in the old testament it was at this
[1:18:23] junction that that
[1:18:24] god became flesh
[1:18:28] hallelujah amen it was also during this
[1:18:31] junction that god and satan finally
[1:18:33] crossed
[1:18:34] on the earth amen it was during that
[1:18:37] junction
[1:18:37] uh it was during this junction that
[1:18:39] nature met its creator
[1:18:41] praise god it was during this junction
[1:18:44] that corruption
[1:18:45] met its master oh everything
[1:18:49] changed at this junction so very very
[1:18:52] important junction now
[1:18:53] uh brother branham tells us that you
[1:18:55] know uh there was prophets
[1:18:56] uh that uh every junction god sends
[1:18:58] forth prophets and then angels
[1:19:00] and uh and here you know we know john
[1:19:02] the baptist was
[1:19:04] a prophet during that time we realized
[1:19:06] that he was a prophet
[1:19:07] but we also know jesus himself was a
[1:19:10] prophet but now
[1:19:11] uh what we also realize is that jesus
[1:19:13] ministry
[1:19:14] glory to god really didn't take off
[1:19:17] until john was called off the scene
[1:19:19] amen it was after john was called off
[1:19:21] the scene that the ministry of jesus
[1:19:23] christ
[1:19:24] really began to elevate jesus only spent
[1:19:26] about three and a half years in ministry
[1:19:28] hallelujah right so so so uh uh
[1:19:31] you know we even even though we got
[1:19:33] these two major and i don't even want to
[1:19:35] call them too major
[1:19:36] we got john being a major prophet but
[1:19:38] jesus being the prophet of prophets
[1:19:42] hallelujah the son of man this is this
[1:19:45] is who we have on the scene
[1:19:46] now um i want to just kind of pick up
[1:19:48] because there were several angels that
[1:19:50] appeared during this time
[1:19:52] before john was born as his father
[1:19:54] zechariah
[1:19:55] was visited by the angel gabriel amen
[1:19:58] that's found in luke 1 verse 11 through

[1:20:35] gloria amen uh also during that time
[1:20:37] while jesus was on the earth
[1:20:39] he went down to a man the pool of
[1:20:42] bethesda
[1:20:43] and there was an angel that came down at
[1:20:45] certain seasons
[1:20:46] and troubled the water glory you have to
[1:20:49] recognize seasons
[1:20:51] you have to recognize opportunities

[1:20:57] sometimes you can come to church and sit
[1:20:59] there and be quiet if you want to
[1:21:01] but you better recognize seasons and
[1:21:04] recognize how to open up your mouth and
[1:21:06] get god's attention
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] hallelujah somebody amen but but there
[1:21:14] was an

[1:21:17] troubled the world
[1:21:18] they had angels visiting during this
[1:21:20] time glory to god
[1:21:21] there was an angel that strengthened
[1:21:23] jesus as he was preparing himself

[1:21:28] there was an
[1:21:29] angel amen that went to the women while

[1:21:44] at paragraph e37
[1:21:47] thank you jesus says john came forth
[1:21:50] claiming the

[1:21:54] the bible said jesus said himself there
[1:21:56] never was a man born on the earth like
[1:21:58] him till that time
[1:22:00] and it says hallelujah says why he was a
[1:22:02] prophet the greatest there was
[1:22:04] till that time because this was the
[1:22:08] greatest junction of god ever made
[1:22:10] with the devil when their paths crossed
[1:22:12] and there he would strip him and rob him
[1:22:15] of everything he had
[1:22:16] hallelujah john was a prophet gabriel

[1:22:26] happened
[1:22:27] god started in plenty time to forewarn
[1:22:29] them that the junction time was at hand
[1:22:31] the unbelievers waxed worse
[1:22:33] and downed it and fussed at it and tried
[1:22:35] to get away with it
[1:22:36] and finally killed everyone that's
[1:22:38] saying anything but god moved on into
[1:22:40] miraculous just the same for he's
[1:22:41] omnipotent

[1:25:57] miracles that took place

[1:26:01] little time
[1:26:03] amen and just kind of talk about some of
[1:26:05] the miracles
[1:26:06] uh that took place oh jesus i went
[1:26:10] through this little list of mine i went
[1:26:12] on the internet
[1:26:13] and they uh they listed just you know 39
[1:26:16] miracles of jesus now
[1:26:17] there were so many more the bible
[1:26:19] actually say that there were so many
[1:26:20] things done by jesus
[1:26:22] that the books could not even contain it
[1:26:24] couldn't even contain it we don't even
[1:26:26] have everything that was done
[1:26:28] hallelujah but uh but there there were a
[1:26:30] number of
[1:26:31] you know miracles one thing they say his
[1:26:33] birth was a miracle
[1:26:35] just being born of a virgin that's a
[1:26:38] miracle
[1:26:38] if you believe that jesus was born of a
[1:26:41] virgin you already believe in miracles
[1:26:44] don't let the devil tell you that you
[1:26:45] don't believe in miracles yes you do if
[1:26:46] you believe jesus was born of a virgin
[1:26:48] you can believe anything hallelujah
[1:26:52] right amen he turned the water into wine
[1:26:56] that was another great miracle he
[1:26:58] bypassed processes
[1:27:00] in order to get that water into wine
[1:27:03] some of y'all need
[1:27:04] him right now to bypass
[1:27:07] some processes if he did it with warden
[1:27:10] to why he can do it in your situation
[1:27:15] glory amen there's another
[1:27:19] uh where he healed our nobleman's son
[1:27:22] they call it the second miracle that was
[1:27:24] done and
[1:27:25] and let's just maybe pick this one up uh
[1:27:28] this is out of john
[1:27:29] 4 uh verse 43. glory let's just pick up
[1:27:33] a couple of them let's
[1:27:34] read about uh omnipotence
[1:27:37] amen and how he operates john 4 and i'm
[1:27:40] at verse 43
[1:27:42] it says this amen uh
[1:27:46] now after two days he departed thence
[1:27:49] and went into galilee i told you we need
[1:27:51] omnipotence to speak
[1:27:53] we want him to speak to our situation
[1:27:56] it's one thing to read about him in the
[1:27:57] bible but i believe he's the same
[1:27:59] yesterday today and forever
[1:28:00] so lord speak to my condition speak to
[1:28:02] my situation
[1:28:04] speak to my circumstance right but jesus
[1:28:07] himself testified
[1:28:08] that a prophet had no honor in his own
[1:28:10] country
[1:28:12] then when he was come into galilee the
[1:28:14] galileans received him
[1:28:16] having seen all the things that he did
[1:28:19] at jerusalem at the feasts for there
[1:28:21] but they also went unto the feasts so
[1:28:23] jesus came again
[1:28:25] into cana of galilee where he made the
[1:28:28] water wine
[1:28:29] and there was a certain nobleman this is
[1:28:31] a a leader
[1:28:33] you know a certain nobleman whose son
[1:28:35] was sick at capernaum
[1:28:36] when he heard that jesus was come out of
[1:28:39] judea into galilee
[1:28:41] he went unto him and besought him
[1:28:44] that he would that he would come down
[1:28:46] and heal his son for he was
[1:28:48] at the point of death this man needed
[1:28:51] omnipotence
[1:28:52] to speak glory to god this man needed
[1:28:56] omnipotence to show up
[1:28:58] at his house he knew that if he could
[1:29:00] just get jesus
[1:29:01] to the house the situation gonna change
[1:29:04] i don't care how bad it looks with my
[1:29:06] son
[1:29:07] if i can get jesus here this thing gonna
[1:29:09] get fixed
[1:29:12] and that's the way you got to feel about
[1:29:13] it if i can get jesus
[1:29:15] involved this thing gonna get taken care
[1:29:18] of
[1:29:20] glory and the way that you get him
[1:29:22] involved is you stop worrying
[1:29:25] how the story is let go and let god
[1:29:30] that's when things gonna start happening
[1:29:32] church
[1:29:33] hallelujah he said uh verse here in
[1:29:36] verse 40 uh uh 48 then said jesus on him
[1:29:40] except you see
[1:29:41] signs and oneness you will not believe
[1:29:44] now he's about to shake this man's faith
[1:29:47] amen except you see signs of oneness you
[1:29:50] and i believe
[1:29:51] the nobleman said unto him sir i ain't
[1:29:53] got time to try to discuss this with you
[1:29:55] right now i got a
[1:29:56] son that's dying sir come down air my
[1:30:00] child die if you don't come my child
[1:30:02] gonna die
[1:30:04] hallelujah he says uh it says jesus
[1:30:06] jesus heaven him
[1:30:07] go thy way omnipotence speaking
[1:30:11] go thy way thy son liveth
[1:30:15] and the man oh glory to god
[1:30:20] i love this right here church the man
[1:30:23] didn't feel
[1:30:23] nothing the man the man was in
[1:30:27] galilee his son was in capernaum so
[1:30:30] there was no way he could face tommy
[1:30:34] they didn't have that technology back
[1:30:36] then right he had they had nothing but
[1:30:39] but here's what the bible said
[1:30:40] and the man believed the words that
[1:30:43] jesus had spoken unto him and he went
[1:30:46] his way
[1:30:48] what that tells me is that when
[1:30:50] omnipotence spoke
[1:30:52] this man had enough confidence that if
[1:30:55] jesus said it
[1:30:57] then it was all right if jesus spoke it
[1:31:03] there was no devil that could stop it
[1:31:06] sometimes that's all you got to just
[1:31:07] believe what the words say
[1:31:10] glory just believe what the word of god
[1:31:12] says
[1:31:14] look at this look at this look at this i
[1:31:16] love it i love it says um
[1:31:18] uh uh uh uh verse verse 51
[1:31:21] and as he was now going
[1:31:25] down his servants met him and told him
[1:31:27] saying thy son liveth
[1:31:31] how did he how did a man start living
[1:31:32] through the spoken word
[1:31:34] see speak on their potential your
[1:31:36] situation can change through
[1:31:38] a spoken word of god amen he said he
[1:31:41] says
[1:31:41] thy son then inquiry of them the hour
[1:31:45] when he began to amend
[1:31:46] when did he start getting better and
[1:31:48] they said to him yesterday at the
[1:31:50] seventh hour
[1:31:51] the fever left him can you imagine
[1:31:54] walking all that time
[1:31:56] hallelujah but the good news is that as
[1:31:58] he's walking he's expecting
[1:32:00] amen that when he gets there his son
[1:32:01] gonna be made whole
[1:32:03] but before he can even get home somebody
[1:32:05] was already approaching him
[1:32:07] with the news that it's already done oh

[1:32:33] gonna happen
[1:32:34] i don't know and i don't
[1:32:37] care please god as long as god manifests

[1:32:49] just believe the words it's the word
[1:32:52] that'll change that situation

[1:32:56] condition just believe the word

[1:33:06] hallelujah
[1:33:08] says uh verse 52
[1:33:11] then inquired hear them the hour when it
[1:33:13] began to amend

[1:33:16] seventh hour the fever

[1:33:21] the testimony yesterday
[1:33:22] right about 12 o'clock noon
[1:33:27] the anointing struck the words the
[1:33:30] anointing struck it i just believed it
[1:33:33] this man this man didn't think they
[1:33:35] questioned and uh not wait now you

[1:33:56] finish reading this it says
[1:33:57] uh so the father knew that it was at
[1:34:00] that same hour
[1:34:02] in which jesus said unto him thy son
[1:34:04] liveth
[1:34:05] and himself believed now there's two
[1:34:07] parts to that
[1:34:08] it's one thing for omnipotence to speak
[1:34:14] come on somebody because he's speaking
[1:34:16] even right now
[1:34:19] it's it's one thing for omnipresence to
[1:34:21] speak but it's another thing for you to
[1:34:23] believe
[1:34:24] what has been spoken
[1:34:28] jesus my my my
[1:34:31] the father knew that it was at the same
[1:34:33] hour in which jesus said unto him
[1:34:36] thy son liveth and himself believed and
[1:34:38] his whole house

[1:34:46] judea
[1:34:47] into galilee i love the way that the
[1:34:49] bible say the second miracle because the
[1:34:51] first was when he turned water into wine
[1:34:53] right but this one he never did nothing
[1:34:55] physically just spoke
[1:34:58] and it became a miracle there was a
[1:35:00] couple of miracles that took place there
[1:35:01] one is that his son
[1:35:03] was made whole another's that demand

[1:41:45] into my spirit i said let me just
[1:41:47] let's bring that out amen one of these
[1:41:50] is that jesus drove out an evil spirit
[1:41:53] all right that was one of the miracles
[1:41:56] drove out of evil spirit now i want to
[1:41:57] read it in scripture
[1:42:01] praise god uh i think i want to take it
[1:42:04] from mark chapter one
[1:42:11] glory hallelujah speak omnipotence
[1:42:28] praise the lord mark chapter one
[1:42:31] and uh reading that verse uh 21.
[1:42:35] amen it says this this is jesus casting
[1:42:38] out demons
[1:42:39] this is something that he did when
[1:42:41] omnipotence showed up
[1:42:43] miracles took place miracles took place
[1:42:46] i want you to watch this
[1:42:48] the scripture says and and uh they went
[1:42:51] into
[1:42:52] capernaum now where was the nobleman's
[1:42:55] son
[1:42:55] living capernaum
[1:42:58] he was he was in galilee but his son was
[1:43:01] in capernaum
[1:43:02] amen now now can you imagine
[1:43:05] uh by by by as soon as jesus would come
[1:43:08] to capernaum
[1:43:10] there's already some noise that's been
[1:43:12] spread abroad
[1:43:14] because this man's not not everybody can
[1:43:16] say now we saw your son dying
[1:43:18] we saw the doctors actually walk out the
[1:43:20] house with their heads hanging lower
[1:43:22] saying there's nothing more they could
[1:43:23] do
[1:43:24] you know not nothing you know and and
[1:43:26] now we see you're suddenly just
[1:43:27] up and doing all kinds of things what
[1:43:29] what happened i went to jesus
[1:43:33] i went to jesus and when i when i got to
[1:43:35] jesus i
[1:43:36] i actually missed and i asked him that
[1:43:38] and now he i asked him actually come
[1:43:40] home with me
[1:43:41] but i guess he was too busy to come home
[1:43:44] so he just
[1:43:45] sent the words
[1:43:49] that's all he did was send his words
[1:43:52] he said based on my faith and what he
[1:43:55] was
[1:43:55] able to do now my faith was that just
[1:43:59] come and do it
[1:44:01] right because i got i got confidence
[1:44:02] that if you show up
[1:44:05] sickness gonna leave my boy
[1:44:08] he says but he couldn't come he just say
[1:44:10] he say uh you know what your son is
[1:44:12] living right now
[1:44:13] and i believed it and i turned and i
[1:44:15] started walking away coming home
[1:44:17] and before i even got here my servants
[1:44:19] met me and told me that he
[1:44:21] he started living at the same time jesus
[1:44:23] spoke it
[1:44:24] the testimony was already spreading
[1:44:26] through capernaum
[1:44:27] you can imagine that no no no now if a
[1:44:30] testimony
[1:44:31] precedes a person like that you can
[1:44:34] imagine that the people gonna have an
[1:44:35] expectation when this man come walking
[1:44:38] in their city
[1:44:41] look at this look at this
[1:44:44] they went into capernaum straightway on
[1:44:46] the sabbath day he entered into the
[1:44:47] synagogue and talked
[1:44:50] and they were astonished at his doctrine
[1:44:53] for he taught them as one that had
[1:44:56] authority
[1:44:56] and not as the scribes
[1:45:00] and there was in their synagogue a man
[1:45:03] with an unclean spirit and he cried out
[1:45:08] saying let us alone what have we to do
[1:45:11] with thee thou jesus of nazareth
[1:45:13] uh thou come to destroy us i know thee
[1:45:16] who thou art
[1:45:18] the holy one of god and jesus rebuked
[1:45:21] him saying
[1:45:22] hold thy peace and come out of him
[1:45:25] now let's just stop there just for a
[1:45:27] little bit
[1:45:28] all right notice where the man is
[1:45:31] hanging out
[1:45:36] this man is not on the corner we're
[1:45:39] spirits in
[1:45:40] them right this man is not in the club
[1:45:44] we're spirits in them we know they got
[1:45:46] spirits there this man
[1:45:47] hangs out in church
[1:45:51] this man comes to church every sunday
[1:45:54] come on somebody this man comes to
[1:45:57] church with his
[1:45:58] unclean spirit and he sits inside
[1:46:01] the pews every sunday but one day
[1:46:05] omnipotence came to church
[1:46:09] hallelujah and when omnipotence came to
[1:46:12] church
[1:46:13] that devil that was inside that man was
[1:46:16] exposed
[1:46:20] and when jesus spoke he rebuked the
[1:46:23] devil said come out of them
[1:46:26] i want to tell you when omnipotence
[1:46:27] speaks to miraculous take place
[1:46:30] jesus didn't wrestle with no devil amen
[1:46:33] hallelujah
[1:46:35] amen jesus only spoke to the devil
[1:46:38] because he had authority to speak to the
[1:46:40] devil
[1:46:41] i want you to know you got the same
[1:46:43] authority
[1:46:46] parents recognize it's a devil
[1:46:49] in that child don't wrestle with them
[1:46:52] don't fight with them
[1:46:53] speak to that devil why because
[1:46:56] omnipotence is dwelling inside of you
[1:46:59] say they lose my child and let them go
[1:47:02] loose my son and let them go in the name
[1:47:05] of jesus
[1:47:06] loose my daughter and let her go in the
[1:47:08] name of jesus
[1:47:15] this man hung out in the church
[1:47:19] i'm looking for omnipotence to speak to
[1:47:22] conditions
[1:47:23] i'm looking for omnipresence to change
[1:47:25] situations
[1:47:26] we bring unclean devils to the church
[1:47:31] based on what we we look at what we see
[1:47:34] on our phone what we see on the internet
[1:47:36] what we see on tele intel on television
[1:47:39] huh all this stuff brings unclean
[1:47:42] spirits into the church
[1:47:43] and you're wondering why you can't get
[1:47:45] no victory
[1:47:47] and i'm gonna tell you another thing
[1:47:48] some people just like religion
[1:47:52] this man was very comfortable in his
[1:47:55] condition going to church
[1:47:57] just to say he was religious but jesus
[1:48:00] was not
[1:48:00] interested in the man being religious
[1:48:04] i wonder how many times he spoke out in
[1:48:05] church and nobody had
[1:48:07] no power to do nothing
[1:48:11] nobody had they just accepted him oh you
[1:48:14] got

[1:48:19] delivered and we're not going to wrestle
[1:48:21] with brother stone stuff
[1:48:28] hallelujah speak
[1:48:32] omnipotence glory glory glory verse 26
[1:48:36] and when the unclean spirit had torn him
[1:48:41] cried with a loud voice he came out of
[1:48:42] him now let's try to let's let's look at
[1:48:45] this now
[1:48:46] when you speak to the devil they're
[1:48:48] going to cut up
[1:48:50] oh yeah and you know what you do just
[1:48:52] back up
[1:48:54] you let them let them cut up let them
[1:48:57] let them cut up that's that night ain't
[1:48:58] going
[1:48:59] you ain't gonna hurt me i don't say what
[1:49:02] i had to say
[1:49:03] i said leave and let me tell you
[1:49:06] when they cut up that mean the devil
[1:49:07] heard you
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:13] the devil actually heard you when they
[1:49:15] start cutting up
[1:49:16] look i'mma just forewarn y'all this
[1:49:19] ain't being preached just to be preached
[1:49:22] people come into this church with
[1:49:24] unclean spirits
[1:49:26] and one day omnipotence will meet them
[1:49:28] and you might see something that you
[1:49:30] never saw before
[1:49:31] it's just the devil and i and all we
[1:49:33] want to see is the devil leave
[1:49:36] how he leave we don't know and we don't
[1:49:40] care just leave
[1:49:47] oh i know this makes the devil feel a
[1:49:48] little uncomfortable i want to make them
[1:49:51] feel
[1:49:51] very very uncomfortable sin ain't gonna
[1:49:54] hide here
[1:49:59] brother branham said i want to be a part
[1:50:01] of a church
[1:50:03] where sin cannot hide
[1:50:08] i i ain't crazy sometimes i know that
[1:50:10] you know why why people be doing certain
[1:50:12] things
[1:50:13] we don't for 19 years by the grace of
[1:50:17] god we've been able to keep the church
[1:50:18] clean
[1:50:19] now what people do when they leave
[1:50:21] church i ain't got nothing to do with
[1:50:23] that i can't make you go out there and
[1:50:25] live
[1:50:25] right but in here we're trying to keep
[1:50:29] the church clean
[1:50:30] where the spirit of god can be free to
[1:50:32] move
[1:50:37] praise the lord so god has been good to
[1:50:39] us by that
[1:50:40] so so sometimes we have to say things in
[1:50:43] order just to keep sin out
[1:50:46] and if you don't say it people just
[1:50:47] sneak this in and sneak that in
[1:50:49] next thing you know we got babylonian
[1:50:51] garments
[1:50:53] hidden in somebody's tent amen
[1:50:57] gold from the babylonians that we don't
[1:50:59] took we don't stole it
[1:51:01] ain't nowhere aki wear garments like
[1:51:03] that
[1:51:04] what what fellowship he's going is he
[1:51:06] going to go to with babylonian garments
[1:51:09] what fellowship will he go he can't even
[1:51:11] go anywhere like that
[1:51:13] oh glory i know i know we in there now
[1:51:17] we're in there we in there real good
[1:51:21] right now i i i when the lord showed me
[1:51:23] this this man was sitting there
[1:51:24] in church with spirits
[1:51:28] he come to church with his spirit when
[1:51:31] you go to a hospital you're looking for
[1:51:32] them to take care of things
[1:51:34] you come to church this is a spiritual
[1:51:36] hospital we should take care of things
[1:51:39] make the devil feel uncomfortable
[1:51:43] his religion could not hide his spirit
[1:51:47] all right i mean because you know we we
[1:51:49] come to church and this fellow is
[1:51:50] probably
[1:51:50] just like us we come we say a man here
[1:51:54] but when we get home we acting like a
[1:51:56] devil
[1:51:59] we ain't acting like no amen there we
[1:52:01] acting like a devil
[1:52:04] god ain't even welcome in your house
[1:52:07] because of your actions i told you
[1:52:10] at the very beginning of the sermon it
[1:52:12] was elijah's
[1:52:14] words the things that he spoke
[1:52:17] that created his condition
[1:52:21] right and sometimes in your life it's
[1:52:23] the things that you are speaking out of
[1:52:25] your mouth
[1:52:27] that's creating your condition
[1:52:30] and you want the thing to change you
[1:52:32] know how it's going to change when you
[1:52:34] change
[1:52:39] you know and i'm telling you god has
[1:52:41] already made a way he he already know
[1:52:43] he looks uh he winks at our ignorance
[1:52:46] right that's what the bible say he winks
[1:52:48] without even he already know we're gonna
[1:52:49] mess things up
[1:52:50] so we got to make a way for us to uh out
[1:52:52] of the midst of all that and i thank god
[1:52:54] for him make it away
[1:52:55] now once he clean it up don't go back
[1:52:57] and mess it up again
[1:53:03] hallelujah god getting ready to fix
[1:53:05] omnipotence is speaking
[1:53:07] he's getting ready to fix some things
[1:53:10] he's getting ready to straighten out
[1:53:11] some things i said it on wednesday night
[1:53:12] this is why we need not just a
[1:53:14] feeling of the holy holy ghost but we
[1:53:16] need refillings of the holy ghost
[1:53:19] the re the refilling uh it kind of molds
[1:53:22] us and makes us all over again
[1:53:24] amen it get it get all that bitterness
[1:53:26] out
[1:53:28] oh lord help me to talk about it it take
[1:53:30] all that hardness out
[1:53:33] amen it just melts you you need a good
[1:53:36] snot
[1:53:39] in the presence of god you you need to
[1:53:42] just be just
[1:53:43] just broken in the presence of god we
[1:53:46] need that
[1:53:46] because we get so hard so
[1:53:50] callous we need the spirit of god to
[1:53:52] kind of melt us a little bit
[1:53:54] amen glory to god we need to bathe in
[1:53:57] the holy ghost
[1:53:59] get some of the dirt of the world off of
[1:54:01] us
[1:54:02] something that'll change our thinking
[1:54:04] something that'll change our actions
[1:54:06] something that'll change our reactions
[1:54:09] it's the holy ghost and
[1:54:11] fire and it's keeping me alive
[1:54:16] hey it's all over me and it's keeping me
[1:54:20] alive brother if we didn't have the holy
[1:54:23] ghost we would have ran crazy a long
[1:54:24] time ago
[1:54:27] but if you want to keep if you want to
[1:54:28] stay kept you're going to need more holy
[1:54:30] ghosts
[1:54:31] no holy ghost glory
[1:54:35] become near potence
[1:54:39] lord have mercy let me try to finish
[1:54:42] here this man this man this man this man
[1:54:46] verse 26 and when the unclean spirit had
[1:54:48] torn him and cried with a loud voice
[1:54:50] that came out of him
[1:54:51] i told you now you're going to see
[1:54:52] manifestations like that don't get
[1:54:54] afraid when you see that
[1:54:55] sometimes you can hear people worshiping
[1:54:58] and the holy spirit is coming down that
[1:55:00] you hear this real strange sound
[1:55:02] sound like they worshipping uh oh they
[1:55:04] ain't no worship
[1:55:06] that's a spirit that's a spirit
[1:55:09] and see some of y'all young people that
[1:55:10] go out there and get messed up in life
[1:55:14] you you you you entertain these spirits
[1:55:16] and then you come to church
[1:55:17] like this unclean this man this this man
[1:55:20] he was coming to church with unclean
[1:55:21] spirits
[1:55:23] hallelujah unclean
[1:55:26] spirits the things that make you do some
[1:55:30] of the stuff you're doing is an unclean
[1:55:31] spirit that does that
[1:55:33] right and so so so so you go out there
[1:55:35] you get all mixed up and you come in
[1:55:37] here
[1:55:37] and one day omnipotence is gonna meet
[1:55:40] you here
[1:55:41] now now the good thing about this man
[1:55:43] and his condition the good thing about
[1:55:45] him the good thing about it
[1:55:46] is that this man uh actually needed to
[1:55:50] be set free
[1:55:51] and jesus was there to set them free i
[1:55:54] wonder how many other
[1:55:55] unclean spirits came to church
[1:55:58] and went home unclean the same way that
[1:56:00] they came
[1:56:06] look at this and they were all amazed in
[1:56:07] so much
[1:56:09] that they questioned among themselves
[1:56:11] saying
[1:56:12] what thing is this
[1:56:16] what new doctrine is this
[1:56:19] for with authority commandee even the
[1:56:23] unclean spirits
[1:56:25] and they do obey him now what jesus was
[1:56:28] not wrestling with the man
[1:56:29] he wasn't fighting with the man he spoke
[1:56:32] and let the devil just tell the pieces
[1:56:33] right there
[1:56:34] now look i don't care what you do it's a
[1:56:36] couple of things that you can't do
[1:56:38] you can't take his life
[1:56:42] right you can't take his life and you
[1:56:44] can't stay there no more
[1:56:46] you've been evicted
[1:56:54] and just look at you hold thy peace
[1:56:57] come out of him don't talk no more to me
[1:57:02] don't say nothing else to me hold your
[1:57:04] peace and come out
[1:57:05] don't even try to tell people who i am
[1:57:08] don't reveal nothing to nobody
[1:57:10] pretty much tell the devil shut up
[1:57:16] hold your piece and come out
[1:57:19] now he could have said uh bro you're
[1:57:21] gonna have to leave church
[1:57:24] you're gonna have to no that's not no
[1:57:25] hold your pc news the devil inside the
[1:57:27] man
[1:57:28] hold your peace come out lose him let
[1:57:30] him go i
[1:57:32] i'll tell you the truth here i'll tell
[1:57:34] you the truth here i'll tell you the
[1:57:36] truth look at this
[1:57:38] and as i was thinking about this uh
[1:57:46] the first miracle that happens at
[1:57:49] capernaum is this boy that's about to
[1:57:50] die
[1:57:51] and his daddy went to see jesus in
[1:57:54] galilee
[1:57:55] hallelujah it was a spoken word that was
[1:57:58] sent from galilee to capernaum
