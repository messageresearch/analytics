## About This Project

This site is part of an independent, non-commercial journalistic and research project that analyzes publicly available sermon content published on Message Church YouTube channels.

The purpose of the project is to support research, reporting, and public understanding by identifying patterns, recurring references, and trends in religious messaging over time.

The project transforms publicly available speech into analytical datasets that help readers understand what is being said, how often, and across which organizations.

## Source Attribution

This project emphasizes transparency and verification. Analytical outputs include direct links to the original YouTube videos so that readers can review the full source material in its original context.

The project is not intended to replace original content and encourages readers to consult primary sources when evaluating findings or claims.

## Fair Use & Purpose

This project asserts fair use under U.S. copyright law (17 U.S.C. § 107).

Any copyrighted material referenced or analyzed is used solely for purposes of news reporting, criticism, commentary, research, and scholarship. The use is transformative, focusing on analysis and aggregation rather than simple reproduction of original works.

The project is non-commercial and does not monetize content. Full transcripts are provided for research and verification purposes, but the project does not host or stream original videos and is not intended to serve as a substitute for viewing content at the original source.

## Methodology

* Analysis is based on publicly available video metadata and transcripts
* Content is categorized by church, speaker, topic, date, language, and type
* Outputs emphasize aggregated statistics and timelines
* The project is independent and unaffiliated with any church or platform

## Transparency & Good-Faith Compliance

Requests for review, correction, or removal of specific material will be evaluated promptly and in good faith.

All content remains the property of its respective owners.
