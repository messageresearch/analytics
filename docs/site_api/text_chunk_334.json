nobody could ever understand but he makes his ways known to them that love him we come to you tonight Lord [Music] speak about a testimony that's been the MST us I I ask that you would undertake for us as there's a lot of question marks around the world right now about this episode that is transpired question marks doubt and even people leaving the message but I thank you great one for for this [Applause] place where you can give us understanding and knowledge to handle whatever comes our way I pray that you died me behind the Cross pray that you would open minds I pray that you would concrete [Applause] Faith what we believe I ask it in your blessed name amen amen now I'm just going to testify tonight I'm not here to preach if I do forgive me but I'd like to just lay down a testimony and um as things are boiling outside there of what has happened I would lay down my testimony and then afterwards try and go into uh the problematic thing that's hindering people so my testimony on Billy Paul [Applause] Brenham he was the first one to call me his friend so brother Rosco you are my friend and tonight I'd like to speak about my [Applause] friend when I found uh brother Keith in Cape Town we came back and I wanted to know how things are and then the first words that he uted to me was U do you know how that man loved you I said yes kid I know he said but but do you really know in other words I said yes I know cuz he wrote to me and uh I felt it on my heart seeing those question marks or just to go through some things I I've been around him and then uh the main thing is he's death now and those angels are still standing how do you get around it amen so you may be be seated I'm not going to look for amens or nothing I'm just testifying okay I also have a testimony so uh Daniel gave me a scripture which I would like to read um proverbs 10:7 the memory of the just is blessed am the memory of the just is blessed and I would include right in there I remember Bly Paul in a happy way cuz his memories that I carry is surely blessed I believe that some people was asking isn't brother rosar going to say something about Billy Paul they wanted to know if I'm going to say something about brother luck and I didn't because I didn't feel for it I didn't feel like wasting time it's a waste of time but but I feel to say something about Billy Paul you may be [Applause] seated his name carries two Church Church age Messengers combined in [Applause] one Bly is the name for William am if your name is William in the states they call you bu amen so his name is Bully which means brother brand the last Church age messenger and Paul the first church H [Applause] messeng so brother Brena took the two names and splice it together and called him the first and the last Messengers names his mother's name was hope that was his first Union and she died when she was very very very young and brother Bram tells you how he had to carry bully all over and keep the bottle here in his to keep it warm for Bully to drink so bully was without a mother since a young young age and Sarah Rose also died Bully's only sister died at the same time sister hope died and brother brandham didn't want to marry again and the angel of the Lord told him because of the days are so bad that um woman has gone on the Rampage he says You must get married and while God was speaking to him God was speaking to his second wife and he told his second wife behold I'll send you [Applause] [Music] Elijah and one day brother brandham got bully and he said you know bully you had a queen of a mother hope she was a queen she was just something extraordinary she was not maybe a woman she was a lady and all that she wanted to see is success for a husband brother brandham and I think that's why bully was so over brother brandham you can't say anything negative in Bully's presence about his father he was the best friend to his dad and I I always admired that by him what Dad said is yeah and amen settles [Applause] it and Bully couldn't preach because of the marriage and divorce case he had and I watched him all the years he would never go in and go PR because Dad said so he always said I'm a testimony he always said I'm I'm carrying the biscuits to the Brethren brother brandham baked the biscuits but he said he took the biscuits to give it to the brethren so those are the things that I hold dear about bullying and I had the privilege for being in his company quite a few times I do not think there's a South African guy or Minister that had the Privileges I had and therefore I was so rugged in what I believe that they couldn't change my mind at all I know where I am called [Applause] in and um I will always be grateful to God that I had those privileges with brother bully the first time I met him was in 1977 he took me around Jeff took me to the Ohio River his father baptized the 17th person it took me to Spring Street and um he took me to eat at the restaurant brother Bram used to like to go to he took me to the shop where brother BR used to buy that sweets that strong sweets and he bought me a packet he took me to the grave of brother brandham I wouldn't say what happened there he took me to his mother's um grave sister hope he took me to the tour through the church brandham Tabernacle Church because the evening I testified in the church there that's when that guy walked up and told me for all these years we only felt the same anointing that was upon brother Brandon that was on you that was the time and then you know what he gave he gave me and um then he showed me The Minister's room where brother Brandon first went in before he went into the pulpit and in The Minister's room he told me he said uh uh brother Edgar you see this Photograph I said yes I see the photograph he says to me um that photo brother Coleman gave brother brandham and when I looked at the photo God bless you brother when I looked at the photo I saw it was Elijah leaving and brother Brenham hanged it right in he studied there before going into the pit and then without Ado I told Brother Coleman I saw them photograph that you sent brother uh the prophet and then brother Coleman gave me the testimony of the photo somebody drew it painted it and uh and he told me who gave it to him when he received it and looked at it the inspiration of God fell on him brother Coleman and told the inspiration told Brother Coleman wrap it up and send it to my prophet and brother Coleman took the photo wrapped it up and sent it to brother Brenham and without Ado brother Ram took the photo and hanged it in that room it's still there today and um it wasn't long then Elijah did leave and I remember brother K said when when brother random died he walked into the pulit that morning and preach on the shout of the king is in the camp so don't be dismayed the messenger is gone but the shout of the king is in the [Applause] C so many will see that photo but they wouldn't know the history behind it the next meeting with Billy Paul was in Oklahoma after the meetings that I preach we had a lunch together Billy Paul his wife brother Coleman sister Elaine Musgrove his wife and me and my wife we sat at one table and at together and U after we finish at brother bik Paul remain seated and everybody left and me and my wife got up and I said bu I have to go over to the French people there because I was flying to Paris from New York and um bu he kept on sitting I spoke to the guys from France me my wife and as we came back I had to pass B Paul cuz he was still sitting and he had some papers or whatever it is in his hand and you know and when I came close to him he jumped in front of me and my wife and he said um brother Rosco I need to tell you something and I was shocked now keman told me a few things about bully which I already picked up there I knew what it what's coming but I I was praying that it was something good and not some little devil hiding somewhere that he's going to pull out you understand how it is is when you come into the into the presence of a man of God you always have question marks hey uh he mustn't see you know my ugly [Applause] side we all have ugly sides and he told me he says brother Rosco I just want to tell you that um since I saw the angel of the Lord I said oh oh he says since I saw the angel of the Lord he left me with a gift to discern ministers I said okay so I will really know who I am and then he said brother Ros I have discerned you and I want to tell you that you have one of the best Spirits among all the ministers I ever met in this [Applause] message me and my wife's knees buckled and we said we're going to keep that one for the Millennium that me and my wife is going to talk it over how he felt when he said [Applause] that and he just said that and and and and and he left me and he walked out and uh we were really shocked when my wife we stood stood there and uh we walked out and right in the corner there brother Coleman was standing and when we started to walk out brother Coleman ran over and he says come on brother Rosco come on what did bully tell you I said um yeah you did he said I know I I was watching the whole thing when he had his stuff there and he was sitting there I knew he was Discerning one of us and he discerned you and then I gave brother colan the story but I thought it's going to end right there but it didn't end there him and um Joseph came to South Africa and they asked me to take them around so when he came to South Africa I picked them up with um Theo Erasmus and then he said brother Rosco I want to go to the hotel where I saw the angel now look how he hooks the thing up he waited I took him to the hotel he says that angel just stood here and he went through it you know the story and uh he said do you know why he said wake up your son to see me and not no no no these young pastors know nothing man must come to the Elder the Elder will tell them and he said you know why brother Rosco I said no he says on our way down to Cape Town just before CS door there was popular trees there they cut it off now just before you get into clar do brother Bram told him to stop the car and he got out and he went over to that popular of trees and he plucked off the branches and he threw the branches in front of them on their feet and he says thus sayeth the Lord I'm not supposed to go he was not supposed to go to Cape Town he was not supposed to go to csor that's why we never built a church in clor but in porch and um then you know what he said What The Minister's done wake up that brother there right next to you yeah yeah you slap like there and um he says and I told my dad I says Dad can I tell you something he says yes he says let's book our tickets back why should we listen to these ministers let's listen to God and let's go [Applause] back don't listen to this Minister's day he says and when they came back to jobber the why of the matter why he and not his brother was woken up to see the angel was because bully said let us not listen to the ministers don't listen to a minister that don't have the Holy [Applause] Ghost and he said dad told me that that pleased the angel so that I could see that angel brother osar he stood right here and he went right through the window gone and you know he described the angel exactly dark [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] skin and you hooked Oklahoma up with Joe to make sure that I understood What's Happening Now how could I listen to these past yeah want to tell me something I don't care about that I heard straight from the angel of the Lord and straight from Brother brandham when you laid hands on my head I don't listen to No Minister you're not on my level and I will never listen to [Applause] you what a testimony that [Applause] is if you look deep into this story here what he says since the angel left him he got discernment so I look deep into the thing I feel that the angel told him sit there and tell him who he is how else could it be and he sat and he waited for me and told me who I am if you have the right Spirit you have the right word I would rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my Doctrine and here's Al Tabernacle why because the blessing is on [Applause] somebody now how could guy a guy a simple black guy like this African boy have a blessing from a prophet and a prophet son that saw the [Applause] angel tell me which which black guy up Africa way can have a testimony like this [Applause] n okay that's why I can't listen to anybody brother Brown says this boy will preach exactly what I preach Billy PA said this boy has got a nicer Spirit among the Ministries he'll preach exactly the word mechanics buly comes he says you have the best Spirit Dynamics Dynamics mechanics together is that my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Ministry then then to you El Tabernacle look I'm responsible for you I'm not responsible for anybody else you pay me your ti [Music] so I need to look after [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you so I carry a heavy testimony and I can't come down that's why I'm so robust [Applause] on another meeting in Oklahoma I was cautioned by the Holy Ghost there's a trap set for me I stayed in a hotel room just went down into the now by the way the the the the hotel that brother R stayed in here they broke it down was an old old hotel and I'm so glad that it was still standing when bll and them came and I could take them there you know um the meeting was tight in Oklahoma it was stuff and Coin and I'm didn't know what to do many of times uh in Forest Hill brother K's church when I come then there is nothing I sat in a in a in a in a Minister's room and K will tell me just go up and talk and leave that people don't want to serve God and then uh Joey bomo will come down and said brother Rosco you're not going to get these people right and then I said I just thought well we'll see and then I went up and I think within 15 minutes the church was mixed up it's going on [Music] this and you you heard the statement brother Coleman said he said brother Rosco you can put brother Rosco in the middle of a graveyard you heard him say that so after he preached the dead will raise up and clap their [Applause] hands now again the the the the convention was really tight and dry and um Bly and them was there with his son and uh I went in and uh I commended and thank bully and said bully we're really glad for you and your family and many of days you were without the father so that your father can fathered us so many a days you didn't have somebody to guide you CU you W home but you were busy guiding this bride I said bully many a days you might have weeped and cried for dad while your dad was preaching to us and we were weeping and crying in front of God I said [Applause] bully today because of your dad I can live of tithes that your dad's labors brought to me I'm not worthy it's your father's tithes that I'm living on so I'm living actually of your money Bly and buly and them was crying and I started to preach and the deacons were standing you know how K posted these Deacons and uh when I was about a half an hour in I looked around and the deacons was crying standing and the tears was running all of [Applause] them all of them I then left the poopit I went up because I needed to change and uh I ran down because I wanted to speak to norga from Tucson and just before he pulled away Coleman was standing there say Isaac save Journey my brother he says yeah he says brother keman I just want to tell you something and brother keman says what he said you know where to put this guy where to preach when your meetings is dying then you know there's a Rosco that can pick it [Music] up what a [Applause] testimony and then when I went back I just see somebody jump into the lift and says brother Rosco there was a trap set for you here because I had a dream that you were going to bomb this place to pieces I had a dream but I must tell you it was from the devil because it was just the opposite and they still don't know that I know but that's when you got the Holy Ghost he [Applause] Wars then I heard bully tell somebody that you know today well brother OS was preaching my son received the Holy [Applause] Ghost the other time I preached and met bully was when I preached on identification and this message is on tape uh you know the message and after I preach as usual the Holy Ghost filled the house you can hear Brother Coleman tell brother bully bully isn't this it's right on tape isn't this the same anointing that was with your father buly rais his hand up and he [Applause] says I remember buly in a happy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] way after the meeting bully met me before we went in for lunch and he said to me brother Rosco you brought it [Applause] [Music] I remember bully in a happy [Applause] way and after this meeting was when he sent me the letter and they stole the letter in Zimbabwe with my Bible funny they didn't steal anything else in the car I had a Bible like this my name printed on and the letter was in there and I just took the Bible with the letter when they broke into the car but I ready to the church I ready to the elders I ready to the Deacons and the Rasmus read the letter and uh in the letter he asked me to send him the cloud picture with hopman's head in [Applause] Christ and then he said brother Ros will you be so kind and S Joseph one too so in other words send us two one for Joseph one for me and I send it off to them the next thing in the letter was he called me Edgar my friend I'm glad I have friends I don't have to go make friends I don't need friends I the best of the [Applause] best as a friend and in the letter he says you know but he told me this after the meeting too he says I just like to listen to you but in the letter he said I only listen to you and my dad no other [Applause] minister yes I remember bully in a happy way [Applause] the Rasmus read the letter and he gave the letter back to me he says now can I add to that letter I says yeah well add brother Theo he says I would put them down there the greatest charismatic preacher in the message and that the message ever saw is you brother rosar not F Edgar [Applause] OS now we're coming to the close here a buly Paul died and as I said there such a lot of things going on lot of people talking a lot of people criticizing a lot of people ready to leave the message again the churches has gone small as I told you on sister Sunday Monday was it Monday Monday it's going to be worse now but elter I want to tell you that you have a man of God in a poop [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] w [Applause] I ain't going [Applause] [Music] nowhere [Applause] brother bully died remember to be spiritual now I'm asking you to be spiritual now just a little thing can throw you out and offboard amen and make you believe some fault things just a little thing that's overlooked in the scripture can throw you way back in the world therefore a pastor must be very sensitive to the word of God now this thing of bully Paul in Los Angeles a small thing in that quote can make you give up deny the message reject the message reject brother brandham and yet brother brandham says sometimes things got to be said so that some may flock away exactly but El Tabernacle you're not going to flock away I am standing right there I will stop you from fing [Applause] away just a little thing that you miss in the scriptures will make you backslide or leave the message so your leader must be very spiritual because God is pruned to hide things he likes to do it he likes to do things to make you like [Music] [Applause] this one time brother Brandon was waiting for a vision to get fulfilled and he waited and he know everything was settled everything was said there and uh he was wondering now what what is wrong that thing had to break and you know what was wrong a hat was not on the on the right place a hat so a hat so perfect is your God how can we ever be [Applause] God little thing small thing ahead everything must be lined up then God moves why because the Song of Solomon Chapter 2:1 15 says it's the little foxes that spoils the vine that little intri that make you miss [Applause] God so here is a little thing that causing the stumbling block and people wanting to leave the message and as I said I'm responsible for El Tabernacle only I'm going to give an account of this what I see amen now watch be alert with every problem in this message 20 some OD years ago I found the answer to every problem that's why we could never go wrong and I'm going to tell you the [Applause] problem you want to know the problem you did hear it before but in the light that it is now you'll know it even the better amen okay let's go to 1963 721 he cares do you listen to the message he cares do you care it was on Luther King brother Braham says he's going to lead thousands of people to their death and it didn't happen and this guy wrote to brother brandham says did you prophesy because Martin Luther King just died and this is what brother brandham had to say have we got it brother listen to what he says he says now see listen listen to this now see I've always asked you to be careful little things be careful amen what you're listening to see that's Point number one he is educating the bride now to be careful what are you listening to have you got that point let's go on with that quote point two not everything is thus sayth the Lord that I say so brother brandham when he speak is not everything is thus sayth the Lord amen oh my when brother BR say throw that ball is that that say the Lord not everything he said now I didn't say it brother brandham said it and if brother Brenham said it that you have to be careful then you have to check whether the thing is thus sayith the Lord hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so before you run is it God speaking or is it William brenham's Human Side speaking brother Brenham goes on I'm going to show you further he says there's many things in the spoken word That's The Human Side not the prophetic side [Applause] so when you read the scripture and the quotes you must make sure that it is thus sayeth the Lord and not brother bram's Human Side amen am that answers all the [Applause] [Music] questions now listen what he says Point number three for everything in the message that goes forth this is what you have to do what read it for me are they doing it brother Bram speak like a human being and not thus say the Lord then they want to say listen brother Brenham is a human being not everything he spoke was thus say the Lord so he says watch when I say that say of the [Applause] Lord oh my my my my my my my my [Applause] my [Applause] he goes further point 4 five it's not me it's him if it's me it will fail but if it's him it can't fail if it's William brandham that said it and not thus sayth the Lord it will fail so now you got two streams to watch as you read the spoken word is it thus say the Lord or is it brother brandham [Applause] [Music] saying can I have a witness [Applause] [Music] [Applause] here now let's go to the next one listen to what he says and I can't say it until he tells me I could be altogether wrong in my thought about Martin Luther King and he was wrong because it was not thus sayeth the Lord how you going to rock edar Osco I have Bible and word Hallelujah I am not an ordinary Minister I am [Music] [Applause] special Point number six this is me speaking it's my opinion so I was wrong that was just the human side and not the thus sayeth the Lord that's why it didn't come to pass I want to ask you elter vano can you see where I'm going to [Applause] when he speaks it's thus sayth the Lord now I have dissected the quote from bully Paul I was in this meeting will he play the clip reach back a new shock of hair said just once more I believe that's the hour that we're living I believe that with all of us I believe that God making his final move going home if you want a little s to look at you need a little sign look at this old man he said I won't be an old sharks will be swimming where you're standing get close you seated now I want you to be honest with edar Rosco did he say th say of the Lord it says thus say the Lord bully you will not be an old man so n it is not th sayth the Lord it is brother bram's opinion in a private interview with his son it is not in the spoken word nowhere because the spoken word is for the bride so that was not for us that was for Billy Paul Point number [Applause] two point number three he spoke many of things to Brothers personally he told Brother R you'll be a preacher that's not in a spoken word and Ashley Campbell told Brother brand brother buly I was there he did tell you that but he never say you're fful Minister and bang Dev R gos he told bcll some things about a woman that Bisal told me personal you won't find it in the spook word he told home how many things about Bishop Johnson and what have you personal it's not in the spoken word so it's got nothing to do with a [Applause] bride so that is in two parts there it's in two parts the one part was human speaking to Billy Paul and not thus say the Lord the other part of the Sharks will swim is thus sayth the Lord that's going to [Applause] happen now why is it thus say the Lord is because of Los Angeles choosing of a bride am when brother brandham came to the pit Ed Hunter told me he said brother Rosco it was bad you know when brother Brown spoke about that cow how she looks and that's how some woman looks he said don't marry a woman like that that's got that cow look he says and the Pentecost was laughing and joking he says all of a sudden the atmosphere switched and it was like angel's wings coming into the church and then brother brandham got up he said thus sayeth the Lord Los Angeles Los Angeles one day you'll find yourself beneath the ocean that's thus sayth the Lord the Shark part is thus sayith the Lord but the Bully part is not thus sayith the Lord it is also not on the tapes it is also not in the [Applause] books are you clear on it so why was we worry we worry about that say of the [Applause] Lord and you know how this happened brother BR and prophesied and said thus say the Lord sister shakarian demon sharan's sister you shall die and in the same meeting a guy got up and spoke in tongues well Paul said he had Go's flesh and he was worried and the interpretation was my daughter you won't die you will love and Bully was worried brother Benham looked at him and said buly what's wrong said no nothing there he said no no no you you worried about the tongues he says yes yes Dad that was really nail biting Goose flesh stuff you could feel it brother said to him buly all did I say the same angel that told me sharks will swarm told me she's going to die then he added his own opinion he says you might not even get an old man so that was not thus sayith the Lord the Sharks was thus sayith the Lord and then two weeks after that Deus zakarian's sister died so if she died Los Angel because it's the same angel that says she's going to die said Los Angeles is going to sink it's going to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sink now can you see what God does to throw people off he makes brother Brenham say give his opinion and not thus sayth the Lord but we have a quote where brother Bram says you better listen to thus sayeth the Lord am I don't like this amen yet there's a little doubt in this [Applause] same no the cracking thing is when did Bully die what is October is October the 70th Jubilee we're going into the last part of the 70th Jubilee what's the 70th of 70th Jubilee it's Los Angeles going down because there must be an earthquake to open the graves and brother Bram takes Bly Paul and hook it up with a 70th Jubilee and he died in the time of the 70th [Applause] Jubilee [Applause] what is Jubilee going home going into eternity right am I right how old was bully what is eight [Applause] City come on man come on [Applause] amen we're going home in the midnight tree don't you want to go with me God is telling you it's time for Los Angeles to go down that's why I connected Billy's name with Los Angeles IST and how do you know the scientist says in 5 minutes or in 5 years those angels must be below the [Applause] sea Amen brother [Applause] Joel now how can I leave the message when I have the the answer to this question have you got to answer now tonight can't hear [Applause] you [Applause] no as it is above so it is below when Jesus was born it was above three stars came together and so it was below now what happened could we have it some of the US got the to see the Ring of eclipse Saturday October the 14th it showed in the heaven that the great man of God is going home few days after that but he said goodbye but it was showed in the heaven in the United States now you want to tell me this is coincidence it's not coincidence God showed it in the heaven Hallelujah that is coming to fetch his son away and I am so happy bully wait for me on the Eastern Gate wait for me on the Eastern Gate buing God bless you

sin and darkness from me oh how much he cares for me [Music] oh how much he [Music] cares oh how much he [Music] cares for [Music] me good evening El deckle we are glad we can speak to to you again and um I'll just like to um have you listen to this uh testimony and uh I will say something after it it explain um I never even spoke to the family about this type my the first time they will hear about it uh the other thing is this um uh I don't even think brother Raymond remembered this tape it's the tape that we took out of the archives there a lot of tapes in our archives and uh but uh it is um it's encouragement praise God you may be seated at the time a certain lady one [Music] time she wrote a letter to Sister Brandon she said sister bam I want to thank you for your husband says I was in a nervous condition I was taking about 24 PS a day to car my nerves to cool me down and nothing would help since it went on for weeks days months years says but praise God I'm writing this letter of appreciation says because your husband was willing to go to forsake his family forsake his children he was prepared to lay himself and stand in the Gap says he was many miles away from your home he was in our country the doctors had given up hope there was nothing they could do for me but your husband came into the country God sent you there so there I was without hope my children was rued my house was rued say but because someone was willing to go so that night I came into the meeting he called my name he told me what was wrong with me I told you not to worry sister it's all over it say ever since that day I'm a perfect Norm person sister Bram I want to tell you these words it would never have happened if your husband wasn't willing to lay all on the Altar and I believe there's many yet tonight that feels the same way about our precious Pastor I know there's many sitting here tonight who you know through his ministry you've been set free God came into your life God did something praise God [Music] hallelujah praise God when your marriage was ready to break up and in the phone call in the middle of the night he came and set for hours and spoke and brought the two together who was it my brother praise God when that seems there was no God had a man God had a man [Music] amen praise God brother say God once God called man man that's not afraid of the fire of God and this church here tonight is the most you hear what I'm saying you we going to be the most responsible people before almighty God for what God has placed in our life tonight we're going to be the most responsible people tonight in the whole of the world tonight friends praise God oh when it seems like oh Hope Was Gone someone came driving up your driveway and knocked on your door and came and spoke and says brother you're doing the whole thing why someone was willing to go I think it said our brother Bram one time he came home and his own own child didn't even know him when he knocked on the door I think the daughter says the little baby says mommy he has some man at the door and it was his own father praise God what can we say words fail us tonight I'm a witness I like to give Witness what happened in Cape Town as we drove down to brother Layman's funeral tired and we as we got there and there are so many ministers and they gave each Minister a chance to say something there was all the Pentecostal ministers each of them got up and identified themselves and gave all the titles and who they were and what the churches was under them as he went from minister to minister eventually came to the ministers in the message and there were all the ministers and they got up and each one said each thing but there was just no fear some ministers got up and said some nasty things and Tred to stick the pastor I said there since God I've seen you anointing so many times Lord I've seen God with the seems like the the other was against him I see you anointing him Lord and it came to the time where the pastor had to speak brother I never seen something like that in all my life each M had 10 minutes to speak and the pastor came and he ripped out the mic and he says praise God he says Pastor OS he says I come from Jesus Christ praise God it says I got no church but his church and brother when he spoke the anointing of God dropped on praise God in the face of the critics in the face of all the forers in the face of all the HS against him brother the power of God came down and anointed him and the glory of God was in the place in 10 minutes time in 10 minutes time the presence of God the Angels was walking up and down the aisle the glory of God was there praise God the dropped down in 10 minutes time Hallelujah I'm a witness I'm a witness I'm a witness tonight that the glory of God came down all over the building in 10 minutes [Applause] time oh my God I think I believe from tonight on we know it's the truth it's the first time the pastor spoke like he did tonight and I believe from tonight we we're going to pray more for him we believe as his body is tired and weary and the eggs begin to come in the body we're going to be like Moses when he got tired to lift up his hands in prayer and pray for him every morning you get up you remember the pastor's name every morning you get up you call upon his family's name you pray for them and say God give him new Strength God give him a new charge God restore Health God give him a new burst of faith and strength will you do that friends I believe the Bible says pray for them who watch over your souls pray for them pray for them who watches over your souls pray for them brother that watches over your Souls praise God my as apostle said all over there looking for a man to stand in a gap and you know what's going around you know what's happening all over the country the news is out people want some man like this friends people is looking for someone that can bring down the presence of God people is looking for someone that's got reality the world is sick of imitations the world is sick of brother sister Social Gospel but God wants a god call man a God man on the face of the Earth with the anointing of God upon Him Do You Believe don't you appreciate the pastor tonight don't you appreciate his wife tonight let's give the Lord a hand in Praise thank you Lord oh hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God oh Hallelujah words will fail us tonight to go through the things that has happened and transpired through all the years but we want to say we appreciate him tonight praise God want to tell him we appreciate him we're going to stand with him like never before praise God and uh the pastor wants us wants he uh to thank the deacons from his side he appreciate the deacons that have stood with him all the years he wants to say appreciate them praise God from my side I want to say I appreciate the elders the de consy praise God I want to put my appreciation in with the praise God and knowing that the hour is here brother praise God charity never faileth the brotherly kindness is here the honey is here what to stick us together like never before to love your brother with such a Godly love why because godliness is beginning to pour into the Church of God and what is God is a God man praise God to express brotherly kindness you're going to love your brother love your sister love one another and brother says let nothing come between you nothing praise God you refuse to let anything come in between you and your brother you and your sister and you watch brother and sister when that church becomes one and the Revelation becomes one among them like the day of Pentecost when they were in one Accord it says the power of almighty God will drop down and signs wonders and miracles we see it but you're going to see it in a bigger scale brother if we dedicate Our Lives to him don't you love him tonight don't you want to say Lord I Surrender tonight praise God let us stand to our feet praise God there's some uh quotes I wanted to read but praise God everything has been said what can you say brother after such a meeting what can you say to know that Mark 14 the Bible says she did she did everything she could do praise God and I believe we're going to do everything we can do from tonight on we're going to pray like never before we're going to be sincere we're going to do everything the Bible says he did everything she could do and that was to anoint her master and you have it in your power tonight to do everything I don't care what is on your job at home at school you do everything that you can for the master tonight and the Bible says that he was pleased with what he did and I believe God is pleased with what has been done in this church praise God As we sing I surrender all tonight your head bow your eye Clos Lord I surrender all tonight just before we go into the communion tonight Lord I want to surrender my life I want to dedicate it I want to anoint your head tonight God praise God lord I want to I want to anoint it God I want to break the alabaster box tonight God and let the anointing of God flow tonight Lord Jesus we can say like Paul says time fails us to tell about B and all the Great Men of old and I believe time would fail us tonight if we would say and speak about the things that God has done in the ministry of our precious Pastor time would fail us but we want to show more appreciation from our sides more respect praise good so um I was uh told by a young preacher some time ago um what did you all the guys left for us what Legacy did you leave for us and he mentioned U brother becket's name and my name especially and um he um then went on to say all that you guys has left us is fighting and jealousy and bad mouthing one another and you had unkind words all the time against one another and to him it seemed as if this message started that way and that is what we all the brothers has left behind and that made me play this tape because if you listen to this tape here's Raymond Thompson for instance we can play you a tape of Solen and what he says to and it wasn't all dark and Gloom and uh fighting and fussing and at the beginning when we started we were actually watching one another's back way back there we were one in spirit truth way back there so young man if you think that we started with what you call backbiting and fighting and being jealous of one another and had unkind words I played you this tape to show you that at the beginning there was no unkind words on this tape there's no unkind words words on this St there is no ugliness and that was way back there when we started and that's the way it was so I thought I'm going to play the tape um to show these young men or young preachers that has come in it wasn't all the time Doom and Gloom and and bad mouthing we used to have conventions and we all go went to the convention and will convention we were there when uh brother Layman down in Cape Town had conventions we were there when we had conventions out in de Gloria we were there and uh I will admit that afterwards uh things happened and maybe up till now we still have that animosity and fighting and uh because everyone went with with his little Doctrine you know uh we had the peruja doctrine with brother Billy and brother Harold Beckett and uh then we had uh brother Raymond and them and myself with a seventh underd Doctrine and all that but um then afterwards we found out the brother Brenham didn't see a thing like for instance um would say you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions and all that I wanted all the years is to see those words come out of brother brenham's mouth then I believe it but that's not a quote that's not what brother Bram says the same with the thund not so there's where the the the problem started and we started to break up and we had um our scages and uh people didn't greet one another and we don't visit one another's churches and uh because uh I think we got to a place where we were scared we going to lose members well I would say I thought that I wouldn't like to lose more members at that time but uh at before all these doctrines came we didn't have my brother all these fightings and stuff that you see so we left a legacy even our Legacy if I look at you then I ask myself how did you come in here you in the message what Legacy are you leaving have you done anything we were on fire for God we had Fellowship right through the night and uh you don't even have that anymore so uh we U we thought that we would um play this tape um so that you could um understand that when this message started we didn't have what we have today day uh we gave one another accolades like on the tap you heard brother Raymond giving out accolades he was we had conventions together and um we covered one another's backs we move freely to one another's churches if they were was other the churches and um even way back there with brother Beckett was in Joba before we went to Cape Town also we all were together so uh we don't um fight all the way from the beginning the fighting only started afterwards so I play the St to show you what happened way back there and um even the statements that brother Raymond made I'm sure there States out there too that I made statements about brother Beckett being my friend that's why he has in his um study there's nothing like old friends and I can tell you if I phone him uh all these years although we had our differences we still get together and have something to eat with his wife and what have you and we respect one another you know we have our differences so brother don't come with your own ideas about we leaving a legacy like that we didn't leave a legacy like that that's why I know that right now you know like u a certain prominent brother told me what's happening in the states there more people leaving the message than in the message I know things are very critical I know things are very bad but uh it wasn't so way back there so uh I hope that you would uh uh listen carefully how we covered one another's backs may God bless you and uh um maybe you could if you have an opportunity or a chance to uh thank brother Raymond for that accolades that he gave out on the stap may God bless you and there's nothing negative on the St thank you\n"}, {"id": "2023-02-22 - A

[Applause] You want to give the teachers a good applause. Your regret, your reward is great [Applause] from the school, the family, everyone. The school was never in a better financial place like now. [Music] Going into 2026, we were never all right with the school like now because God is in the school. &gt;&gt; Whatever this man, [Music] fruit comes. Forgive me, church, but I like the truth. And if you don't believe it, look at his fruit and worship the fruit. [Music] By the end of this year, we'll be able to give a full financial report of what God done in his school. God got a school. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember, but God's got a school. [Music] El Tabernacle. God's got to school. And both my kids made it years ago because God had a school. I don't think Edgar and Esther turned out very bad. They wouldn't have made it if God didn't have a school. Jal and Joel wouldn't have made God had a school.

We are well on our way that apostle. We want to thank King Jesus for the bonuses we gave all the workers and teachers this year. We could bless them more than any year. Everyone that is from Y tabernet the companies didn't give bonuses that most companies didn't give a year end function but God in El Tabernacle in a man in a in the leader of this blessed you though times are hard he blessed you he didn't have to do it but he did thank you king Jesus Yes, [Applause] we thank God we could some places we lifted up the bonuses by 2,000 rain. We gave more than any year in the worst time. Is God here? &gt;&gt; Are you pressing stop? &gt;&gt; But God is pressing play. That's why whoever wants to stop it will take the remote out and keep it playing. &gt;&gt; El tabernacle don't say leadership. We got leadership. And brother, the lifting up is just the natural side. How many people was lifted up spiritually this year &gt;&gt; that you can't even talk of? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

I'm Rosanne Adams and tonight we're taking a look back and reflecting on the year. Now, in the 2025 World Cup Roller Fly, we saw our local team, the MBRC, make its mark with two familiar names flying high in the face of adversity. Our senior pastor, Jonathan, took to the skies with tough winds and recording a score of 54.08, showing great composure despite the unpredictable nature of the outdoor competition. And then our apostle Edah Hill scored an impressive 125.58. Even under the strong wind conditions, the Apostle's performance stood as one of the greatest representations of our region. Even under difficult weather conditions, qualifying him for recognition on the world stage. [Music] [Music] I greet you um all I'm uh my name is Edar Rosco and um I have pictures for over 20 is. [Music] [Music] Now, we witnessed the EHR79 Cup unfold across three major tournaments, and the finale produced one of the most dramatic and intense finishes. At the end of the tournament, Shooting Stars and Volcano were level on 27 points, forcing the championship to be decided by gold defense. Shooting Stars, however, claimed the title with a superior goal difference of 114, narrowly edging out volcanoes on 92 points. Gunners FC, the reigning champions from last year, successfully defended their title, finishing the season on 22 points. Closely behind were Loft House, who mounted a strong challenge throughout the tournament and ended on just two points a drift on 20 points. More than the competition, the EHR 79 Cup stood as a collective sacrifice towards the building of the Durban Church. Every match played, every point scored, and every cheer contributed to God's greater plan. Whether winning or losing on the field, we are all winners in supporting the work of the Lord. The EL1 Racing Championship delivered excitement throughout the year, but there can only be one champion. Team Aston Martin stood victoriously on the podium after speeding through their final race. In terms of individual driver standings, pastor Edgar Karosco Jr. claimed the EL1 championship title. This season was yet another proud moment for Al Tabernacle and a testament to our excellence in every arena. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Beyond Sport 2025 was rich in teaching and guiding to our tabernacle. The women's seminar provided wisdom, encouragement, and practical instruction to the ladies of eel tabernacle. While the men's camp became a place of reflection, accountability, and strengthening. Advice given during these gatherings addressed family, faith, responsibility, and purpose, leaving a lasting impact to extend beyond the year. was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had to tell you all. Nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our florists, our decor ladies, everything proudly El Tabernacle. Not forgetting El Tabernacle's Gospel Concert held by our very own mass choir and instrumental ensemble. The seasons of praise gospel concert celebrated our unchanging praise with the changing seasons. [Music] And then at the heart of 2025 was the Apostle Ed Rosco who led eel tabernacle through a powerful sequence of services throughout the year. Our 2025 year began with the sermon the mighty angel revelations 10:1 the keystone revelation. The apostle then preached at the January combined meeting the gospel trumpet has sounded part one. On the 2nd of February, we heard the apostle preaching on the bess and beard comments. The 22nd and the 23rd of February, the apostle held the Bible study on the depths of revelations 10 part 5 all the way in Penda. On the 1st of March, the apostle preached the gospel trumpet has sounded part two. During the Easter convention, the apostle has preached the bride's Easter. And on the 31st of May, the Apostle preached part two of the bride's Easter. We then heard the foolish virgin on the 29th of June. And at the funeral of our late elder, the apostle preached after the coffin. What then? On the 2nd of August, we heard the foolish virgin part two. On the 17th of August, the apostle preached in Hebron the lost anointing. And during that August combined meeting, Handlers of the Oil was preached. On the 22nd of September, Handlers of the Oil part two was preached. The greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25. The seventh seal was preached on the 10th of October. During the Bloomfontain services, the apostle preached on the foolish church and later that week held a question and answer session for the youth at VU during the November month. And on the 7th of December, the Apostle traveled all the way to Richmond and preached on God's journalists. And during the convention, the apostle preached on part two of the greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25, the seventh seal. Our apostle has gone above and beyond to ensure that our cups are running over. As we look back, it's clear that 2025 was the year of impact for eel tabernacle. impact through sport, impact through teachings, impact through music, and most importantly, impact through the Holy Ghost. And with that, the 2025 season comes to an end. This is E News Network, keeping you informed and connected. Until next time, happy new year.

Hey, heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Elimin, &gt;&gt; how you feeling? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] You look ready for the service tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Amen. &gt;&gt; So without ado, I need to do something tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. um maybe very contrary to the feeling that you are &gt;&gt; and um I'm bringing forth a confession of a murderer. I killed a man after 60 plus years. I had to make this confession tonight. I need to repent. I call it a confession of a murderer. And they will never find his body. &gt;&gt; The guy &gt;&gt; that I killed &gt;&gt; while I was 18 to 20 years old. I killed a man. &gt;&gt; This man was water in my blood. &gt;&gt; Always against me. stood in my way if I wanted to do something. &gt;&gt; Like Paul says, the copper smid. &gt;&gt; This man done me much harm. When I was a young when I was young, he was my best friend. But he made me to dishonor my parents. You know how friends go when it comes to your parents and what your parents want you to be and then they have a way to influence you to dishonor your parents &gt;&gt; and disobey your parents. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I nearly turned out a juvenile delinquent because of him. I nearly became a renegade, disobedient to my parents. [Music] When we got older, he introduced me to the wrong company. [Music] That's why I know when I see your friends, I know your company &gt;&gt; and I know who you are. He made me run after goals. I was quite a handsome young guy. I knew how to dress and I had them flocking after me. [Music] Brother Beckard asked me one time him and his wife and all those girls that was running after you. I said I kissed them all because of this friend. He introduced me to sport that never that nearly took my heart away because I nearly went to England. [Music] I doubt there was a guy that scored as many goals as what I have and my friend boosted me. He took me to the pleasures of the world and he drove me from church. [Music] And I said to myself, \"So far, my friend.\" [Music] Then I came to a place, how can I kill this guy? [Music] I cornered him one time. I cornered him, Brother Raymond. There was no way out for him. I planned it to precision. at this place. You won't get away. I'm going to kill him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Would you like to know what corner I caught him in? &gt;&gt; It was at the altar of the Nazarene church. [Music] The guy couldn't escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I killed him at that altar. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you know what I done with his body? I took his body and threw it into the sea of forgetfulness. [Applause] And they couldn't find his body &gt;&gt; cuz his body is gone. His old life is gone. Christina [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Because I hated myself. &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched man that I am. &gt;&gt; Who can save me? Hallelujah. [Applause] And every time, every day, brother Raymond, &gt;&gt; he wants to jump up. &gt;&gt; And then I die daily. &gt;&gt; I kill him daily. And I was going to ask the church as you look at this man behind the pulpit, &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to become murderers? Let us kill ourselves. and let us have a new life. Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And that's my confession of a murderer. I can see all over the world. They say sh Never forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My confession. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if you have your Bibles with you &gt;&gt; as you prepare to die next year, &gt;&gt; you came to die today. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. today. to be. &gt;&gt; I never gave you that one, Edgar, because I didn't want you to steal my Hallelujah. There's no judge that can sentence me. &gt;&gt; He hasn't got a body. &gt;&gt; No judge can sentence you. Wow. I woke up two days ago and this thing came to me. I said, \"Oh my god, &gt;&gt; a confession of a murderer.\" [Applause] [Music] [Applause] He has no good people. He has all murderers. Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay, you've got your Bibles with you. &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to Matthew 25. Matthew 25 verse 10 to find it. I will read it. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. While the foolish virgin went out to buy the oil, the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; The half an hour silence was finished. And they that were ready went in. The ones that was ready. But the bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; They went in. And my title is as follows. And the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I like to preach on and the door was shut. I'd like you to say with me again. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] What a year we had last year, huh? &gt;&gt; I just want to say before going into the message, I really do not know about 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; I try to look into it. &gt;&gt; I try to see something like normally when I come, it looks so dumb to me because 2025 was based on Trump. He had Kalansky at him. He had most of the presidents visiting him this year. He had a lot of wars that he tries to stop this year. And he hardly stops them then they go on again. He was preaching one gospel peace &gt;&gt; which is Matthew 24 &gt;&gt; war was which is Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; In the meantime he caused war somewhere else. He lifted up the taxes &gt;&gt; money fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; He remind me of that second woman &gt;&gt; in the sixth vision &gt;&gt; representing Rome. Everything he does thus far &gt;&gt; is to do with that sixth vision. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I do not know it looks so bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. that 2026 America will be 250 years old. In 2026, Israel will be 80 years in the in the promised land. Now, I hope I'm not prophesying. &gt;&gt; I'm hoping that as things look, I hope Los Angeles sink. [Music] It is about the best time &gt;&gt; to sing &gt;&gt; because you will have the World Cup &gt;&gt; in Los Angeles &gt;&gt; next year. [Music] So remember, I say I hope. &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that don't hope the way I hope, &gt;&gt; then I'm sure you're not ready &gt;&gt; to move. I want to say even so Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; let you go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will be two years nearly after the 70th Jubilee. [Applause] [Music] There was a lot of cases in 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They never had such a lot of cases. &gt;&gt; Amen. indictments. &gt;&gt; And normally after the indictment come the prison &gt;&gt; sentence. &gt;&gt; Now why I say so? It's because when the door was shut &gt;&gt; in the time of Sodom, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; had an earthquake. So friends, &gt;&gt; you don't have to even ask your pastor about a thing like this. &gt;&gt; You got two eyes and you got two ears. &gt;&gt; Why don't you start looking around? And the king of England also wants to visit 2025 &gt;&gt; America. And Trump wants to give a big bash. [Music] And normally in the Bible when Nebuchadnezzar had a big bash, &gt;&gt; the handwriting [Music] on the wall. And that's why I chose this title. &gt;&gt; And the door is shut. [Applause] [Music] When the oil stopped and there was no more oil &gt;&gt; and there was no more Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and there was no more token. Amen. &gt;&gt; These foolish virgins, &gt;&gt; they knew they didn't have oil. [Applause] [Music] The Bible says that they went out &gt;&gt; to go look for oil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of those days say when they went out they didn't find oil. Nowhere in the Bible &gt;&gt; does it say they found oil. &gt;&gt; Now, why didn't they find oil? Is because the wise virgin bought up all the oil. [Applause] Every service she pulled up. Every service she bought oil. every service. She didn't set stone and let it pass by. She grabbed it. Every service and now there is no oil. Hey, &gt;&gt; and they ran out to try and go and find the oil. &gt;&gt; This one runs to that church and preach to that pastor. to see if he can bring oil to that church while his church hasn't got oil. How can he go to another church to bring oil and that pastor go to another pastor? They went out. Nobody goes out of El Tabernacle. We have the oil. The oil here. The oil is here. Heat. Heat. And while they running up and down to one another's churches tried to bring oil in one another's churches, the Bible says they didn't find the oil &gt;&gt; and then the Bible concludes &gt;&gt; and the doors was I don't hear you. that that same door &gt;&gt; that was shut for them &gt;&gt; was open for us. cuz the roof supposed to come Oh, love. Hallelujah. There &gt;&gt; gets locked &gt;&gt; at certain junctions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God's time. &gt;&gt; Different times in God's thoughts, &gt;&gt; doors get shut, [Applause] gets closed, [Applause] &gt;&gt; when that door closed, &gt;&gt; God don't care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're a pregnant woman, &gt;&gt; he kills you. &gt;&gt; God don't care if you dishonor your mother and your father. &gt;&gt; God is after you, young child. He's going to kill you. &gt;&gt; Because the door is closed. He don't care which church you belong to. If you hunted with brother Brennham and you slept with brother Brennham and your brother Brennham around every corner, if you do not have the oil, he's going to kill you. [Music] These foolish virgins was panomites. And I don't care what the pastor says. I don't care what your pastor says. It's what the Bible says and what brother Brham says. That's it. You don't have the oil, you die. The doors are shut. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years, God shut &gt;&gt; Noah in. Genesis 7:16, &gt;&gt; the doors were shut. &gt;&gt; 7:16, God tells Noah, \"Come into the ark.\" That means that God was already in the ark. Does that mean if the door is shut that God is in El Tabernacle? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. The second 2,000 years the Jews rejected. The Gentiles accepted it. &gt;&gt; As God says in Acts 13:46, Paul says, \"Now we turning to the Gentiles because the door for the Jews was shut and it came over to us and here we are tonight. The door was open to us. The oil came and made us walk into the door. Aren't you happy? You didn't sit outside the door. You walked into the door and behind the door Jesus was waiting for you. Come in and sap with me. Come into the wedding supper. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The third 2,000 years &gt;&gt; is Matthew 25:10. what we read &gt;&gt; after the oil, &gt;&gt; after they rejected the oil, &gt;&gt; after they knew they don't have oil, &gt;&gt; the minute they heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; they realized they didn't have oil. &gt;&gt; But these guys in the message, they don't even know they don't have oil. How bad are they? But when they look in El Tabernacle, they can see they don't have oil because the oil is here. I claim it. [Music] And I asked Daniel of Congo, said, \"Daniel, could you take me to any place outside of Eltean? that has the oil. I'll pay your fair. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for over 20 years. &gt;&gt; For 20 years, nobody came up to come and show me where the oil is. But but right here. Look at the oil flowing. And the oil is coming down. The oil is coming down. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. [Applause] Hallelujah. That makes 6,000 years. [Applause] And now the door is shut. &gt;&gt; Ministers, you can be cross with me. &gt;&gt; You know I'm talking the truth. &gt;&gt; You know the door is shut. It's closed. There's no movement of the Holy Ghost. Working of the Holy Ghost is none. Nowhere to be found. &gt;&gt; You must beg the people to worship. But when the oil come down, you don't beg anybody to dance, to shout, speak in tongues. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The other day I got a phone. I found the wrong number and um Sister Judith picked up the phone and she told me, she says, \"Uh, Apostle, I feel that the Holy Spirit told me that there's a big revival coming to South Africa.\" I kept quiet. I didn't say anything. And she says, \"Uh, what do you think, uh, Apostle I said, \"Judith, you know I'm going to tell you the truth.\" &gt;&gt; I said, \"It's finished. The door's closed.\" &gt;&gt; Shot. It's goodbye. &gt;&gt; Never again. Will the thunders fail the Gloria? &gt;&gt; The Gloria came with Dio Gloria Edgarco and it's still here today. It's nowhere else and it will stay here because the oil is here. And listen, &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. &gt;&gt; God was sealed. in the bride in Pentecost &gt;&gt; and the door closed to the Jews. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now Matthew 25, the groom closed the door. &gt;&gt; The doors closed. &gt;&gt; When the oil is gone, &gt;&gt; the door starts moving. &gt;&gt; And then what happened when the door is closed? Let's read St. John. &gt;&gt; Could you read it? What happened? &gt;&gt; When the door gets shut, then comes Jesus. May he come here tonight and answer your prayer. May he come here tonight and make you a murderer. May he come here tonight. May he make you a jailer. Paul a prisoner of Christ. You are prisoner of al tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Let's see the sketch. 6,000 years is up. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; They walked into the ark. &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the door closed, God was inside &gt;&gt; and then it rained. &gt;&gt; And then it rain. &gt;&gt; Watch out. It's going to rain after tonight. You are not going to be able to sit still, stand still because it's going to rain. Only in the bride is going to rain. The wise virgin &gt;&gt; and didn't rain. &gt;&gt; The rain came down in Torance. &gt;&gt; And I heard they singing the world. &gt;&gt; I hear them singing the world. Can't you see the rain is gone? &gt;&gt; Mhm. It's dry. So dry in every church. Can't you see the rain is gone? The Holy Ghost is gone. And as it rained, you know what the rain done? The rain took the ark, the word, and lifted it up. &gt;&gt; The rain took the word and lifted it up. Oh, thank you. When when the enemy comes in like a flood, the oil, the spirit of the Lord raises you up. This is my bride. Yes, she is. You lifted up in the message. They know who you are. The oil lifted you up. And they say there's no church like your church. [Music] Hallelujah. The &gt;&gt; second 2,000 years, God seals the Gentiles. The Jews are rejected. They don't get the Holy Ghost to choose. &gt;&gt; They only get it after we finish with it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; After it finishes it work amongst the Gentiles. Then only Revelation 7:1 I saw an angel coming from the east putting a mark, the seal of God onto the 144,000, but only After El tabernacle has sucked in every book of the oil. Oh brother. Tell me. Tell me, tell me that angel of Revelation 7:1, the ceiling angel, &gt;&gt; is it the same angel that you feel here now? He's here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 7:1, &gt;&gt; that sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Elijah and Moses &gt;&gt; seals 144,000. &gt;&gt; But in Matthew 25, that same sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Edgar Ocon will seal off the ground. I take my stand. Oh, heat, heat. We gave you the quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the Holy Ghost is in the hands of the church &gt;&gt; and he gives out the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; eternal life. So I take my stand. The ceiling angel in at the rostel seals you. Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. Heat up Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Come on, let's go. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Just go to Genesis 18. Where is the greater works, &gt;&gt; church? Where is the greater works? They don't even preach it because they no know it. And if they know it, they need to produce it. But we know it &gt;&gt; and we producing it. Oh my. [Applause] [Music] 11. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. Yeah. You see, I'm taking my time tonight. [Music] I want to read this. Genesis 19 and verse 11. Just give us a chance. &gt;&gt; Don't forget this quote. All these years they said they think they got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost belong to Jesus. No, it belongs to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The wise version says, \"We can't give you our oil.\" &gt;&gt; It's not ours. &gt;&gt; I claimed it. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; Let's read. All two things happens here. &gt;&gt; They first &gt;&gt; smite them. &gt;&gt; They first shut the door. And when the door was shut closed, &gt;&gt; they blinded them, &gt;&gt; never to see the rapture, the oil again. &gt;&gt; Now tonight, the door is shut and they will never see and find the door, the Holy Ghost, the oil. Again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Again. [Music] &gt;&gt; You young men see that you get the oil. And now you know what happens? &gt;&gt; The children in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. is panic stricken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They hear me preach the oil is gone and you don't have it. &gt;&gt; And the children in all these churches &gt;&gt; is shivering &gt;&gt; because they know &gt;&gt; they don't have the oil. But the children in this house &gt;&gt; cannot be panicking because a champagne epic. Champagne epic. &gt;&gt; You only lift up champagne glasses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have victory, &gt;&gt; if you won the battle, &gt;&gt; the wise virgin won the battle. &gt;&gt; Is a champagne epic. Let me see your champagne glasses there. Hallelujah. Now, one thing about a door, &gt;&gt; a door &gt;&gt; is made to open. [Music] A doors made to open, &gt;&gt; but it's not meant to always be open. &gt;&gt; There's a time it's going to close. &gt;&gt; There was a time when the door Jesus Christ was open. &gt;&gt; Come all ye that labor and I have labor. But there is also a time when the door of longsuffering gets some close. And this is not the time for the door to open. This is the time to close the door and lock the bride inside. Are you locked in? And a door, a door has two hinges &gt;&gt; that opens and close it. &gt;&gt; If it's got what? If if it's got one hinge, &gt;&gt; then it can't &gt;&gt; open or close. &gt;&gt; If you only got the word, &gt;&gt; it can't open and close. But the Lord Jesus Christ got two hinges. Spirit and truth dynamics and &gt;&gt; former rain and rain. &gt;&gt; Former rain. &gt;&gt; Then let the door close then. Heat. Heat. Now, &gt;&gt; the door can close, but somebody can still open it, right? &gt;&gt; But a door has a lock on. &gt;&gt; And a lock needs a key. And a key is faith. &gt;&gt; And faith come by the seven thunders give you faith. Have you got the seven thunders? &gt;&gt; Then you got the key. &gt;&gt; Keep the key. [Applause] You can open the door. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you can Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] And then the bridegroom says to her, &gt;&gt; \"Come in. &gt;&gt; Come in.\" Amen. &gt;&gt; While the door was closed to the foolish version, &gt;&gt; Revelations 4:1 says there's a door open in heaven for the bride. &gt;&gt; And a voice says, \"Come up higher.\" Brian, &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle, &gt;&gt; come up higher. Come up higher. &gt;&gt; And yellow is a mystery. &gt;&gt; And he says, \"Come in.\" Now, how could you go in to the wedding supper with this flesh body? &gt;&gt; That means they had a body change. [Music] &gt;&gt; Before they could go in, &gt;&gt; their body changed. You had a body change &gt;&gt; for you killed that old man &gt;&gt; and now you have a body change. &gt;&gt; Your body changed. The things you used to do, you do them no more. You had a body change. You had a body change. You don't like nice times anymore &gt;&gt; because the night times now lay behind the door. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Come on out. Right here in verse 10. The voice and the trumpet took place &gt;&gt; and they changed &gt;&gt; and then they went in cuz they can't go in with their bodies. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So I show you a mystery here that the wise virgin went in. But you know, &gt;&gt; there was one of the foolish virgins that slipped in with him. &gt;&gt; She look alike &gt;&gt; in every way and she slipped in. How? Nobody knows. But she was in the wedding. Every now and then they slip in. Yeah. [Applause] And the bridegroom said to her, \"Friend, &gt;&gt; what are you doing here in E Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; You didn't come from Raymond Thompson. &gt;&gt; What do you want here? We see you don't have the your Gloria garment on. &gt;&gt; Get out friends. and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave the rest of the message &gt;&gt; and the door tonight is shut. Will the pianos come? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs the wedding garment? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs more? [Applause] Now, let's call on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Call on him. Cuz when the door is shut, he's standing right next to you now. [Applause] You speak to him. as the oil is leaving Al tabernacle and going over to Gaza where the Jews are finishing the thing off. Let us keep the oil. [Music] I'm finished. Everybody. Come on. Come on. Oh, hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Amen. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. America. [Applause] Oh my [Applause] search me Lord. Suit.

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Awesome. [Music] [Applause] Hello. Hello. Go set. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Yes. Bless you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Come on. [Music] Yeah. [Applause] Thanks. [Music] Thank you so much. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Lord, [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] as I finish [Music] off this meeting. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember, [Music] &gt;&gt; more than 20 years ago, [Music] &gt;&gt; I told you the Holy Ghost is gone. And now I come back to show you the sequence. If the Holy Ghost leaves, the door gets shut. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now the door is shut. [Applause] [Music] If that door shuts and you still a sinner, you're never going to be saved. Your day is gone. [Music] Cuz he shuts the door and you can't find the door no more. [Music] You can't even save your children's soul. [Music] The foolish virgin said a half an hour [Applause] to fill up and it didn't fill up. [Music] And then the Holy Ghost leaves them and heaven's door shuts. [Music] All these years it was just open as much as that &gt;&gt; and you could only go in like a crab like this. Now it's closed. It's gone. [Applause] But brother Oscar, what about them that's still coming? God's got his talked away that never heard the gospel. But you that hear the gospel. Goodbye. [Applause] I hope I'm wrong, but up till now I am not. [Music] And the door is shut. It's closed. We going to be able to pick up one here and one there and one there. As I said, the door Jesus is not going to be always open. [Music] He closes the door. That's why I came with that little story. [Music] A murderous confession. We can only kill ourselves and beg for mercy. You oldtimes that's been so long with us. Watch that the devil don't trick you against the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get too big for your boots [Music] because the door is closed. You'll never come in back again. Two years ago, we spoke on the 70th Jubilee and the church was packed with vacciners. You remember how many of them could make it? [Music] None. None. And how bad is it going to be now when the door is shut? And this is where the foolish virgin made her biggest mistake. We put it on. You're doing what you are told, foolish virgin, but not doing what's right. Your pastors told you a lot of things that's not scriptural. And you were doing what was what they told you, but you didn't do what God said. You do what your girlfriend told you, [Music] but you didn't do what is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young girl, you're running after flesh [Music] and you don't even know it's time to drop the flesh, [Music] to kill the flesh. [Music] It's time that you search yourself [Music] before we go into this new year. [Music] A thing that I hate that I see in our tabernacle is these young children that wants to tell their parents what to do. Found a sister from Cape Town. says the child want to go home. Send the deacons over there. The child was under drugs pressing her. She must go home. Since when do we hear listen to children? When Gersian didn't listen, I kicked him out. Al tabernacle don't listen to children. [Music] Children listens to us. [Music] They do what they told from their friends, but they don't do what is right. It's time we do what is right. Search me. [Music] Oh Lord, [Music] I told a sister the other day, take your heart off your child cuz you're going to lose your soul, too. [Music] stubborn. And now it's nearly impossible for you to come back. [Music] You struggled with your boy all the years cuz you patched him up. How does he look tonight? How is he looking tonight? [Music] It's no time to patch up. Son or no son, kick him out. [Applause] If Job, Noah, Daniel had to live in this day tonight, they could only save their own souls. Can't save your children's souls. They want to go to hell. I told Gersian, \"When you open your eyes, you saw me here. And when you close this eyes, you're going to find me here. [Music] You're too nice with your children because you think if you're so nice that's love. That's not love. That's compromise. Because it's your child. I don't know how many people, deacons even that was with me, that straightened out all the other people's children. When it came to theirs, they couldn't straighten them out. They left with their children and they backsliden with their children. Only thing that helps [Music] is God's word. [Music] [Applause] Search me. Stop looking at your child. Look at Jesus. If you don't act like Jesus is not worthy to be your boy. [Music] [Applause] Wouldn't [Music] you like to kill yourself tonight? [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Is there any wicked ways still to live in you? &gt;&gt; Let's kill that wicked way tonight. [Music] Let's commit suicide. [Music] [Applause] [Music] God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; And the doors [Applause] are shut. And the wise virgin says, \"I cannot give you any oil. [Music] I just got enough for myself.\" Brother Oscar, why don't you go to the other churches and help them? I already done it. Here's the flags hanging. They didn't want it. Look at all those flags. But on every flag there's a tape. And now I cannot do it no more because the door is shut. Brother Jonathan [Music] Let me see. Amen. [Music] Search me, oh God, and all my today. [Music] Oh, save. Oh my go [Music] see the be [Music] some Bring the light in me. [Music] Amen. Set me free. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Is there anybody? [Music] It says this was for me, not for somebody next to you. Your apostle spoke to me. Is there anybody like that? [Music] Not someone else is the target. I'm the target. It was directly to my [Music] kill myself. [Music] There's people at the altar. &gt;&gt; There's people killing themselves. That way it be [Music] and [Music] Oh son. Oh God, [Music] my heart [Music] for we're going to take communion tonight. the crossing over tonight. Is there anyone that examined themselves or was it just somebody else? You felt, \"No, that's not for me. Somebody else.\" But before we take the communion, are you examining what the man said? [Music] I beg you to ask him &gt;&gt; who was talking to us tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is there a young girl that is rude to her parents? Are you examining yourself? [Music] Oh, tonight I realize God's spirit not going to strive with any man anymore. [Music] God is not going to strive anymore. You heard he strived all the time. Is there anyone here? Why are you okay? You feel okay? It's fine. [Music] You'll feel [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll be your next year then you [Music] &gt;&gt; say anybody I don't want to be a preacher tonight that expects you to worship and I don't worship when God speaks. I don't want to be like that. I want to tell you, but I'm not doing help the preacher tonight. Lord, tabernacle, it's later than what you think it is. [Applause] [Music] I believe the spirit spoke plainly tonight. It was not it was plainly speaking to us. He that has an ear, let him hear what God told you to know. [Music] Thank you. Spirit to the earth. [Music] Lord, speak to me. [Music] We are staring. [Music] I sing to you strange. [Music] Yes. [Music] So lovely. [Music] Please. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Dad, stop. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I wonder precious brother Ignatius come to read us the scripture for the communion. [Music] [Music] Amen. As we turn to our scripture, scripture, turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 11, reading from verse 23 to 34. If you have it, it reads as follows. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"Take it. This is my body which is broken for you. This give me remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup. When he has supper, saying, \"This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, it will show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread and drink it this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body in the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are just, we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat tar for one another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. We just take moment of silence as we examine ourselves. Amen. I want to ask brotherly to come and pray for the Lord's table. Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you blessed savior. Father, it's with a humble heart. Father, it's with a contrite spirit, Lord, that we bow before thee this evening, Lord, we want to say thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that we are behind the shut door, Lord Jesus. Father, for where you have kept us, Lord. Father, Lord, we want to say thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus.

Thank you Lord that we can come and break bread with thee tonight Lord. Father Lord when the world does not know Lord Jesus. Father Lord what they have missed out Lord Jesus the greatest thing that they have missed which is the Holy Ghost Lord. Father Lord tonight it is the Holy Ghost Lord that has called us to the tree of life Lord Jesus. Father, Lord, where we can have eternally suck with thee, Lord, may you bless, Lord Jesus. Father, the breaking of the bread, Lord, may you come, Lord Jesus, Father, and just Lord Jesus, make a way, Father, as we partake, Lord Jesus, of your table tonight, Lord, Father, that it will strengthen us, Lord Jesus. Father, Lord, that it will keep us, Lord. And the apostles said, Lord, Father, that it will keep us, Lord, in this day, Lord Jesus. May you bless the table, Lord. Father, Lord Jesus, as we Lord, partake, Lord, and as we've examined ourselves, Lord, that we will not partake unworthily, Lord Jesus, but Lord, that we've examined ourselves, Lord, Father, Lord Jesus, may you come and have your way now, Lord, and bless this table, we ask it in Jesus precious and mighty name with much praise and thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. Amen. We're going to start with the communion. We're going to do it rowbyrow and we request that everybody be reverent. We're going to ask the Rosco and the Augustine family if they can just open the table for us. [Music] [Music] [Music] Commun sweet communion [Music] to Fellowship with you. It's what we long to do.

Oh great eternal heavenly father Lord, how can we close a champagne epic such as this tonight? Oh God, Lord, we're so thankful, heavenly father, Lord, that you brought us thus far. And we're so thankful, Lord, that you sent an angel our way, heavenly father. Lord, when we look back to 2025, we started the year with a mighty angel. And we're so thankful, Lord God, that that mighty angels could keep their doors open for El Tabernacle for us to cross over in to the higher calling this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you, Lord, for an upward pool, oh God, that could pull us in through the door. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we could be part of you and your beautiful kingdom this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you so much for the man that is the pinnacle of prophecies to the Gentile dispensation. Oh God, Lord, when we look back to 2025, we can see, Lord, that surely you've been Jehovah Gyra, the Lord our provider. Lord, you've been Jehovah Shama, the everpresent help in the time of trouble and trials. Oh God, we're so thankful, Lord, that we've seen you in different attributes and different ways throughout this year. Oh God, and we're so thankful, oh God, that in El Tabernacle, we know you as Jehovah Rosco, the manifestation of God in flesh. Lord, thank you, Lord, for coming down our way to open the way to open the door. Heavenly Father, and to call us into the beloved of the Lord. Thank you for opening the door for us, heavenly father. Lord, that we can be in the joy of the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful for everything you've done for us, Lord. And Lord, as we depart, Lord, may your spirit go and prepare the way for those that will be traveling, Lord, to our respective homes. Heavenly Father, Lord, may that same angel that started last year, that started this year, Lord God, may he go with us as he shut us into the Shakina glory, as he shut us into the Aoya of God, may that Aoya that we were shut into move heavenly father, Lord, and protect us as we leave to our respective homes, oh God. May you just bless us with safe traveling mercies. Lord, we pray Lord for our precious apostle that you'd strengthen him. Heavenly Father, like never before, Lord. We've never seen a man such as this. Heavenly Father, thank you for sending us an odd pole. Thank you for sending us a man that we can see right through the footprints of the Bible. Lord, we pray Lord that you'd restore all the virtue that has left his body. Remember our precious senior pastor Jonathan, Pastor Jude, our precious pastor Edgar Rosco Jr., Brother GL, the entire Rosco family, Lord. God, bless and undertake for them even the more, Lord. May the same fullness that dwells upon the father dwell upon each and every one of them, Lord. And just like Aaron, Lord, may it reach from the head down to the beard, heavenly father, Lord, and even down to the skirts. And may we just be filled with more of that rain that Apostle says should fall upon us, heavenly father. May it rain so much upon us until we lose trace of our flesh in the sea of forgetfulness. Lord, may you take our flesh so deep in the sea of forgetfulness until we cannot even go and take it back. Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this beautiful service. May you bless each and everyone that is here. And may we depart Lord in your shakina glory. We ask it not by might, not by power, but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the apostle in your infallible name of Jesus King God. Amen and amen. [Music] Amen.
