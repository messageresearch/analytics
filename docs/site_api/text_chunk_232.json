might sing it tonight as brother Donnie would come out Jesus is the sweetest name I know you know they tell you in sales if you meet someone remember their name people love hearing their name you tell them their name so I tell you there's there's one name that's the sweetest name I know tonight that's Jesus oh Jesus is the sweetest name I know and he's just the same as his lovely name and that's the reason why I love him so oh because Jesus is the sweetest name I know sing it to him tonight with all of your hearts yes Jesus is the sweetest name I know and and he's just the same as his lovely name and that's the reason why love him so yes Jesus is the sweetest name I know oh yes Jesus is the [Music] [Applause] sweetest and he's just the same as his lovely name that's the reason why I love him so thank you Lord for Jesus is the sweetest name I know praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus well it's not only his name but it's it's mine yes and yours if you're a part of the Bride it ought to make it even more precious to you should it not that's right let's turn tonight to 1 Corinthians if you would CH 12: 7 greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus trust you're all doing well am has been fighting the devil yes am's been winning okay good praise the Lord you're winning that's good if he's fighting you it means he ain't got you yet and you also need to let know every day he ain't going to get you either CU you're a son or daughter of God you're already an overcomer by the grace and the mercy of the Lord 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all now we're going to speak tonight the Lord willing on the gifts of the Spirit now listen why they are gift the manifestation of the spirit manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit and it's not p r o p h t but profit and that is to make something grow or as you understand in a business you don't start a business so you can do it for charity you don't start a business so you can lose money you start it so you can make money well when God gives spiritual ual gifts they're to be a profitable spiritual endowment so God wants it to profit very first verse but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom now this is not Rama but logos the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts plural of healing so there's not just one there's multiple Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles now not believing in Miracles but actually the working of Miracles is given to some people so God in them will have them to lay their hands on people or sometimes just to speak to them and tell them be healed receive your healing whatever it is and that is a working of Miracles now notice how that he identifies every one of these is given by the spirit of God they're not man-made we don't learn them we don't wish we had them and try to get them ourselves to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits notice now it's not the word commonly used discernment but Discerning of spirits keep it in its proper connotation and it brings a whole new meaning to it to another the Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues now diverse means variegated it's many different kinds so it would be languages both human and Angelic so it's diverse kinds of tongues so that's given to People by the spirit of God to another the interpretation of tongues I love verse 11 but all these workers that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so it's not according to the people who receive them by their will but according to the spirit of God and the church said amen praise the Lord I wonder how many's got a request on your heart tonight that you'd like to signify or i' hold that request on your heart also like to remember brother Michael Carter in prayer and uh heard from him today and he's having to take some treatments some radiation in his back it took some last week and some more this week so we want to remember our brother that our father would just move for him and his great time of need also have some prayer claes here tonight as well Lord Jesus we count it such an honor that we could be assembled here tonight father in your presence and not only just with you because we could have actually gathered in your presence in our bedroom or in our closet at home or in our living room but there's something about us being able to gather together with people of like Precious face and we're grateful that we have that opportunity Lord that we can do so we pray father that we would take advantage of it every time that we can to be able to come and may we cherish it may we love it and just the prophet said that his people at his church loved one another so much at a certain time frame there that they went through at the brandham Tabernacle and when it would come to closing out the service and them leaving they would just grab one another and weep after the Sunday service because it would be till Wednesday before they'd be able to see one another again they had such love for each other I pray father that you'd help us Lord that we could feel that way about one another father that we could so love each other and realize that we are not complete without our brothers and sisters not only in our local assembly but of those of like Precious Faith around the world even those that are in the sixth Dimension as well father you saw the hands that were uplifted the request what they had on their heart Lord I pray over them I pray over these prayer claws dear God you see what they're going for in the name of Jesus would you move and meet these needs help me tonight Lord as I look into your word help me to be able to move aside and speak through me the words of life I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you Saints you may be seated and believes in the gifts of the Spirit oh my mic must have cut out on me how many believes in the gifts of the Spirit I do oh okay all right that's that's I thought that's what yall should be doing raising your hands you know the gifts are a very difficult and touchy thing sometimes really in some ways it shouldn't be and then in other ways you think that it's pretty inevitable that it's going to be there's very few things given to us by God that have been so controversial down Through the Ages Grace has been argued about uh Mercy has been argued about who would get it and how far could you go or you couldn't get any more of it you know and all that uh but when it really comes down to a lot of the um Charisma type of things which is where the Greek word comes from the word gift Charisma which is charismatic it's been one of the most controversial things that God gave to the New Testament Church sad in one way yet you can see why that Satan would want to attack them now these gifts that we're that we've just read about tonight are different than the ministerial gifts which are offices which is not the same thing as the gifts of the Spirit the word here spirit is Numa Numa and it's a word that we get those of you that are familiar with pneumatic tools this is the Greek word that it comes from Numa so pneumatic it's a tool that is used for for something and the Greek word there is a gift as God gives to people to minister inside the body so we know of course that the five full ministry that's what they are but they too are a gift and it's no wonder why then really that Satan of all the messages that have been down through time that Satan in the last greatest message would try to attack the use the benefit whether it's even needed or not of the fivefold ministry and it would be the message of restoration that he wants to do it well to me that proves that it's very very much needful and yet Satan any of God's gifts Satan hates them you have to understand that in the very beginning when God started this New Testament Church that Satan was unclear of what God was going to do the Lord Jesus had given a little bit of word about it but it was still unclear as to what it was going to be now he saw the Lord as he called these Apostles that was a new word entirely new in the New Testament never used in the Old Testament so he called them Apostles and he called them disciples the word disciple was not so much a new one uh because some of the rabbis had also used a similar word in the Greek language in the Aramaic so so it was a similar word but Satan was totally caught off guard that the Lord Jesus had said I've chosen you and you are to be my Apostles and Satan thought wow Apostles I like it so what what's this all mean I don't know exactly what he's doing here this is something totally new and he could see then that when Jesus sent him out in Matthew 10 and he sent him out by twos and that Jesus had given them power and authority to be able to heal the sick cast out devils and Satan saw that there was something different about this power that were given to these men now you've heard it preached before and it's in the in the New Testament the word the Greek word exusia and then also dunamus now dunamus is something that you have by inherit nature but exusia is something that's given to you by someone who is above you and they delegate to you an element of of authority to do these certain things so you're not doing it because you have an inherit nature you're doing it because your boss said you could do it so that's exactly what Jesus did in Matthew 10 so Jesus gives them exusia Authority and said go heal the sick go cast out Devils they were not born again now they did not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's under the exusia order that false anointed ones are able to do the same thing in this day not that it is an inherit Nature by a new birth or a nature change so Jesus sent them out and they did it now Satan was learning so he thought my this this is incredible so they can go out and actually do the same things that he did but they don't have the same thing he has how can that work excuse you delegated authority so he could see that the the apostles were gifted above the other people now remember in that original 12 was Judas es scariot Simon's son and Jesus said have not I chose 12 of you and one of you is a devil but remember in the church book The Prophet lays it out for us that Judas Ministry was not weaker nor was it inferior to the other 11 so one's a devil and 11 more are elected but yet looking at them and judging them by miraculous maybe even by understanding because Judas shared a certain knowledge of the message of the day so no doubt Judas could preach and talk talk about reconciliation Redemption Grace you know whatever more that the rest of the Apostles preach Judas could preach it and he wouldn't have to take a backseat to none of them he could heal the sick cast out Devils whatever they would do and the Devils Jesus said I beheld Satan as Lightning cast down out of heaven and the disciples come back and rejoice in Matthew 10 because the Devils were subject to them Judas was rejoicing right along with him so there was a devil casting out Devils but he didn't do it under the anointing or under his nature he done it under exusia Authority oh you're quiet on me that but now think Judas rejoiced as well because he had spoke to them devils and them Devils had left people but he didn't do it because of his nature he did it because Jesus gave him the the authority to do so so he was gifted he was called he was anointed and he was a devil he shared knowledge of the Mysteries of the kingdom of God and he was still a devil but the Lord chose to start out the New Testament was something totally different than the old now remember he chose a priesthood in the beginning actually it was to be under the abrahamic Covenant that God would allow the firstborn son and he would be the priest inherit he would be the one that would go to God then it would be the father and then of course God substituted the tribe of Levi and let them be the ones that would be the priest so it was automatic if you daddy was a priest you're going to be one your son's going to be one it was handed down from one generation to another to another but God said I'm not doing that in the New Testament in the New Testament all of my men will receive a personal call from me cuz your daddy's a preacher don't mean you're supposed to be one right that's right because every God call man now some people think their preachers when they're not every preacher is not a godall man amen that's right but God calls every individual that's going to preach the gospel God himself calls them they don't go by a feeling they don't go by a dream they don't go by well I've had this told to me my goodness I don't know how many times over the decades brother Donnie I I I I was reading my Bible before church and you or or My Pastor got up and preached for the same thing I felt like I'm called to preach and I tell them all the same story that same situation happens to my wife and I know she ain't called although she was called out in Pentecost by preachers who had discernment and told her she was called to preach she was also called out by another preacher in Pentecost who supposedly had discernment and he told her she had cancer I'll tell you what that preacher was anointed with demons no doubt that man was sincere but he was anointed with a demon out of hell to try to get my wife to accept that but she refused it that's what you need to do when preachers call you out and tell you things that are contrary to the word amen praise the Lord would stop some of this stuff if we' do it well how in the world will I get off on that oh my now watch what God is going to do is going to be totally different than the levitical order totally different than what God had done for thousands of years dealing with Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph then on down then it would come to the patriarchal Avenue then it would come to the levitical order but God interrupted all of that now he called Peter and Peter was married we don't know if Peter had children or not but if they were there's none of them by name that's been given that after Peter passed away then his son got the keys that wasn't the way God done it so Paul was not even a married man so there was no Apostolic succession in the way that it was in the Old Testament so God now is going to do the ministration of the New Testament totally by Divine gifts now those Divine gifts will not come by mother wanting her son to be a preacher it will not come by a grandfather and he has this certain special favorite grandson and he just knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that that grandson's going to be a preacher and he starts telling him from the time he's five or six years old you're going to be a preacher you're going to be a preacher you're going to be a preacher you're going to be a preacher there's been many a person that has put their grandson or their son under a absolute torment for years of their life when God never called them but mama daddy grandpa grandma told them there's going to be a preacher come on now don't get quiet on me but you know what if God himself don't call you forget it for those of you that attended brother Lewis La Funeral Service you heard a little excerpt of a clip that was played in 1961 that was whenever his parents took him and his brother Johnny to the Tabernacle and brother brandham prayed over them and referred to them as little preachers or something like that you know brother Lewis that that taunted our brother tormented him for years and he come to me and said brother Donnie if I fail God if I miss god brother Brandon prayed over me or said those words over me that I miss somehow God I said brother Lewis if you would study dedications the way I have over the years you would find out nine times out of 10 when a boy was coming up to be dedicated brother Brandon would pray or hope or ask God to make him a preacher you know why ca to him that could be one of the greatest things that God could do for a man so that lets you know these anti- preachers belong that say they believe the message don't brother random wanted his own boys to be called to be preachers cuz to him that was the highest order that there was pressing play is Antichrist to say that replaces God's gifts well you might as well go ahead and get with me now I'm going to have church with or without you to say that pressing play does away with God's Ministry is Antichrist you show me where God's Prophet taught it and I'll preach the same thing but until you do I'm going to blast that demonic devil out of the pits of hell because that's where it comes from it's not Apostolic it's not according to the message it's from hell I'll tell you the devil would like nothing better for every God called preacher to sat down and stop preaching and press play and Press Play service I your service if I feel led to play a tape I will feel led by the spirit of God I don't have a headquarters that tells me what tape to play I don't have a headquarters or a bishop over our church come on somebody a nicolate and spirit that sends out a text and says we're playing this at a certain certain time I don't get those texts I get my inspiration from the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that hears you cry and pray and here's you and your wife discussing certain things and the same Holy Ghost will anoint me to get up and preach the very same thing you all talked about well come on somebody that's the God I'm serving tonight and I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever well praise the Lord now the Lord Jesus was the one who decided to set the order of of the church and he chose the apostolic order the apostolic order so he would choose the apostles first he did not choose pastors first he did not choose evangelists he did not even choose prophets first as far as major Church AIDS Messengers he could have chose Paul first if he had wanted to Paul was on the earth that was not the order the order is going to be Apostolic order which is what Satan is against in and around this message so what Satan wants to do is replace Jesus on choice and I remember the people around the message who fight preachers they're not they're not fighting me they're not fighting these preachers here in the church they're actually fighting the Lord Jesus himself well good luck with that is all I can say he was the one who chose to make it this way if you don't like him go to him and complain about him and get off of my back about it okay just go to the man himself and say Jesus I don't like it because you chose preachers I just don't like it well that's what he chose and others might say I don't like speaking in tongues and I don't like that well that's your problem the Lord Jesus is the one who said these things in the church and Word of Life said oh my brother Donnie I've had a lot our problems with the gift and I've seen a lot of this that and the other so have I but that don't change God's word come on somebody there ain't no need for us to hide behind scarecrows and say well this and your claim that they spoke in tongues and this and said this and that I'll tell you one thing I don't even want nothing to do why in the world would we not want anything to do with God's word praise the Lord now in this in the office calls a person the prophet tells us could actually have more than one call in his life well it's the same way with the spiritual dispensing now what it is it's like the seven rainbow colors the seven Church AG Messengers all dealing with the church comes through sevens and fives and it's like the spirit of God can give a man like Paul dealt with him when he said that if there's someone that speaks in tongues and the church if there is no interpreter then let them hold their peace so it would be as if though you know I get done preaching here tonight and someone would stand up and start speaking in tongues and oh my it might really genuin be the Holy Ghost and they are so fired up and so charged up you know but there's nobody to interpret so people just leave and you know it kind of gets really quiet and creates that odd something that it always does and then you think okay what what's supposed to happen here well according to what Paul said that individual unless there be an interpreter is to hold her peace amen is that right now unless Paul said that they should pray that they could interpret themselves so then a person could have speaking in tongues and they could also have the ability to interpret their tongues but if they only have speaking in tongues then their speaking in tongues must be coupled together in order to be used by God in the ministry of the Church they need another person to work together with them to make their gift complete you that you understand that so speaking in tongues it's awesome it's wonderful so you're alone with God you're praying you know you're going down the road or whatever it is you might even come up around the Altar and you're just praying and boy you're just having a blessed wonderful time but you know what those tongues are not for interpretation if there's no interpreter there or you yourself do not interpret now watch let's go back through this again in verse 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so the manifestation of the gifts are not to make some uh more known than others the manifestation of the gifts are not to make some more popular more famous it has nothing to do with making you and I anything but subject Ive servants to the will of God now this is one thing I look for in gifted people is what do they do with these gifts do they use them in such a way that always points these fingers right like this praise the Lord do they have a problem with pointing to other gifted people people as well as thems or are their gifts always superior their miracles are more miraculous which I'm not sure how that works exactly their Divine healings are more Divine now you see I have a problem with that attitude now I know some of the message people don't want to hear it but that's a straight up Pentecostal that's all it is it's just outright flesh that is contrary to the Bible we do believe the Bible around in here right but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the Spirit by the spirit the word of wisdom the word of wisdom now notice this is the most Superior gift of all nine huh I mean I kind of thought that it'd be a little bit quiet in here tonight but I didn't realize you could hear a mouse walking across cotton balls notice this the prophet said love God's love it'll take to place of speaking in tongues and that's all right he said it'll take to place of gifts wonders and signs and everything else and if you haven't got love to accompanies that what good do the signs do you God tries to do it across the nation but it wouldn't work the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge well it's apparent from a lot of what I've seen not only just in Pentecost but in the ranks of the message that the three on the the bottom of the list are the ones that so many people want which shows they don't have number one yet now you can do whatever you want to with my words okay just you know just do whatever you want to with my words but if I were you I would be careful when I'm reading scripture and reading from a Vindicated prophet's message now what so the greatest one then is wisdom the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge if you haven't got knowledge you haven't got wisdom how to control your knowledge what Good's your knowledge going to do you see what I mean seek the first things first wow so we're at the bottom seeking for the bottom first or the ones on the bottom the last of the list are the things that are deemed so super spiritual and wisdom the first how many sermons you ever heard preached on it oh it's getting warm in here ain't it man oh my we've gone after gifts we've gone after this we've gone after that because the supernatural was done but brother don't seek gifts don't seek favor with denomination you imagine putting that in the same sentence seek the love of God do it Brethren now brother Donnie are you saying then that we should not absolutely have no gifts no I'm not saying that at all I'm saying there's a proper order by which we seek them I believe if we would have perfect love perfect love would produce perfect gifts as a matter of fact I just quoted to you a quote I didn't give you the city in the day but perfect love would produce perfect gifts so what then will we have if we have imperfect love nine times out of 10 imperfect gifts which the prophet said can be questioned which will cause problems which is probably what a lot of us have seen through the years that's why somebody quiet on my that you've been burnt by them now if you'll notice the routine of the gifts again he says the first is a gift of wisdom thank you the first is the gift of wisdom that is the best gift of the group anybody here tonight know what the gift of wisdom is if we don't have wisdom we don't know how to use knowledge now watch he goes again in this same thinking is the second gift and we can't use the second gift without wisdom how we going to use the last gift interpretation or next to the last speaking in tongues our Zeal has eat up our wisdom so our Zeal for the gifts has eat up our wisdom wiom which is the best one of all praise the Lord now I've heard it through the years and I'm sure we'll continue to hear it that Brothers have said well you know brother brandham taught those things and that was for his church only and all of that and our church is Sovereign and at our church we're going to do it this way and that way I I want someone here or someone that'll hear this to show me where any church in this message has the right to claim sovereignty over God's word if you are saying you are sovereign over God's word you are a you are a prosper stitute you are committing fornication with the devil you show me where God's Prophet ever said any church including his own had sovereignty over the word of God friends that's what the Catholic Church does they say the Bible don't matter the denomination say it don't matter don't you understand where the message people are going many of them they're claiming sovereignty over scripture or sovereignty over the teaching of the message of the hour well we know the prophet we know the prophet Tau that we know he Tau it but this is the way we do it at our church but it ain't the way we're going to do it at ours not as long as I'm the pastor anyhow our sovereignty comes in under the headship of the word of God not against it well praise the Lord oh Jesus here we go y'all going to stand with me now right hey I'm taking my stem of the word will you taken yours now notice he says our Zeal has eat up our wisdom and our Zeal for our denominations and our enthusiasm has eat up the wisdom off the vine Brotherly Love now let's go back to where Paul says this in verse 8 for to one is given by the spirit the word the logos of wisdom let's look at the meaning of this word Sophia Sophia Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God it ain't no wonder that takes precedence over speaking in tongues so would the Supreme intelligence of God ever lead any of us to step over the top of the word of God or the word of the message of the hour it proves we're lacking wisdom when we think that we are superior and our understanding to the seventh Church age messenger we lack wisdom amen we need more Sophia praise the Lord Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God the wisdom of God as events in forming and executing counsels in the formation and government of the world and the scriptures so the first thing Paul said now before you all start focusing on tongues interpretation prophecy all that first get wisdom so you'll understand how in the formation of these gifts disciplinary action how you going to deal with them this is why we've got a lot of the stuff we've got people hit Miss hit Miss hit Miss and if you call them on the carpet they get mad and leave oh my don't tell me I dealt with that when I first came to Happy Valley years ago some of You original people that was there when I came there things that was going on things being said thus sayith the Lord this thus sayith the Lord that well whenever I was visiting as a visiting Minister I didn't say nothing about it but when you all voted me in and the deacons told you all brother Donnie will not be able to be run brother Donnie will not be able to be controlled so they give you a heads up for you newcomers is come in well you come in after the ship done already sailed so that was the oses that I took this church I could be led by the spirit of God preach the word of God is that right some of You original ones is that right is that what you were told and look do we want to change from that now because we're all these years later down the road do we want to say well look at what is goddess it's brought us a lot of trouble it has caused us trouble but it's brought us a lot of Supernatural too it's brought us a lot of Miracles and it's brought us a lot of healing it's brought us a lot of Joy it's done a lot of great things for us I'll choose that that way myself now notice the importance and the value of wisdom so this now it's not man-made wisdom and it's not the wisdom that comes with old age by being around a long time you know and you get you get wisdom and there's there's some folks in I took the church years and years ago and they come and they sat there for a while but I was way too Pentecostal for him and too fiery and this and that and the other so a couple of them come to me and say brother Donnie we love you and you're really anointed and we I I knew exactly I always wait for that one word But but so they lay all the butter on then they drag out the butcher knife you know and well you're this and you're that but you know but brother Donnie you know you're you're young and and we like a man with a with gray in his hair oh if they' waited around a little while that would have showed up too oh but you know we want this and man with wisdom and people think because somebody's old that they got wisdom some of the dumbest people I ever dealt with in my life is old people well Hallelujah you you young people can say amen for a few years can't you come on brother Malachi say amen for me buddy you know a lot of time people think glory to God I tell one thing I've been around forever in a day we can tell it too don't mean they got a lick of wisdom this wisdom is not brought on by age God gives this in his body I think we need more more men of God to seek God for this gift right here our churches would be run different some of our meetings would be run different oh come on I feel like having church tonight preachers need wisdom pastors need wisdom evangelists need wisdom the ministry needs wisdom to know how to run special meetings to know how to run youth camps to know how to counsel people to know how to lead the people of God oh you don't know how much I pray for it constantly because sometimes I get hit with situations and I get caught right in the middle of situations and I've seen it so many times that de the devil loves to slam my back against the wall and if I go this way he's caught me if I go this way and say well it's this way or that way and the devil loves to stand right thr he poin his finger at me say ahuh I've got you now you know I always tell him uhuh devil I'd like to remind you of this situation and that situation and that situation and you know what he has to do stick his tail between his legs and go back down to Hell like a little beat down pup why because wisdom is here among us if we will only ask almighty God for it I don't need just knowledge knowledge I thank God for knowledge and I still got a pretty good memory I thank God for the ability to study but I do not just need knowledge I need Divine wisdom I need the wisdom of God to know how to run this church I've been pastoring for decades but my experience alone will not get us out of here I need the wisdom of God to know what to preach how intensely to say it when to preach this and when to preach that I need the wisdom of God every day of my life to be able to live a life that is pleasing to the Lord I know you pray for me for strength and I appreciate it but add one more thing if you don't mind to that request wisdom wisdom oh my Lord Jesus can you imagine what God would be able to do among us if we would get in the divine order of what he really wants us to have wisdom again let's look at it Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God this B passes our flesh this bypasses Satan can you imagine a Son of God filled with the Holy Ghost has the ability to receive a thought from God a rainbow word from God bypasses his flesh bypasses his Spirit bypasses demons a direct thought from the mind of God on how to do this and how to do that I've seen him do it so many times I always Marvel at it sir oh what a blessed thing it is do we need it friends am notice so the first one wisdom the second notice how it's given for to one by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge look at knowledge now we use this a lot because it's a word that's used a whole lot in the New Testament Noti this the general knowledge of Christian religion the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion but remember this is not by studying it's not by studying this is a gift of the spirit watch this I found this amazing and how the prophet tapped into this about a word of knowledge or I think Pentecost failed well if Pentecost failed how do we figure we're going to better it if we go the same way they did you know what if if we're not careful in 10 or 15 years we're going to say where I think message people failed I don't want them saying that about us friends I don't want them saying that about our church I don't want them saying about that about me brother Dave as a minister as a pastor the of the word of God do you want that said about you I don't he could take the prophets with the gift of knowledge and for show them what was going to be and they can speak it because it's a word of knowledge that God gives to his prophet and he foretells it before it comes to pass because God knows all things I want you to notice how he catches this then that God would bring this gift into the prophets of the Old Testament of course and they were able to foree or for know events that was going to happen thousands of years down the road what was it a word of knowledge now that would have been limited only to the prophets who were so designed that their first conscience and their subconscious was side by side so they could have a dream as we would say with their eyes wide open so they could stand right there and travel dimensionally just like the prophet I see you I see you coming home from school you got on a yellow chicken dress there's a dog at you I see you come up on the porch you fill through the door he could go from where they were backwards he could come to present time and go to the Future and cover a span of 60 70 80 90 years just like that and it was a word of nosis a word of knowledge you see what was it that Peter manifested that day the spirit of God when ananas and Safara had lied and Peter when they come up and Peter said why is Satan putting your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost God dropped that word down inside of Peter now Peter wasn't even a prophet right but he had the Holy Ghost now watch the prophet goes on to say here in person nature of Christianity so God had took Ezekiel high and far up to see round about 2600 years remember Ezekiel Saw the Millennium things that he saw still has not yet happened think of it a prophet is also a gift of knowledge a knowledge like an attorney who studies the books and when you go to hire an attorney to plead your case he's only taking what he knows and you're playing paying for what he knows to present your case before the judge wow what a way to explain it a gift of knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which goes up and find out these things that are to come and brings them back down but they must compare with the Bible That's What We believe a't it notice jump on down there a bit and the prophet goes up and sees sees the time coming see it's only a gift of knowledge that he brings down and puts it on paper so God can allow in the body now remember there's only one for an age a prophet with the sign praise the Lord can God allow people in his body remember this is not just now to to the office Ministry but this is to the body as well my Ministry to lay hands on the sick it's been by Divine gift to bring the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in Presence by discernment of spirit which is called in the Bible a gift of knowledge in doing so makes him manifested before the people then they receive him as their healer and that settles it I've seen Lots called discernment I do not believe in but I know there's truly a Discerning spirit of God the gift of knowledge that calls and speaks and it's perfect five out of five five out of 10 NOP it's perfect every time if it's a gift from God so wisdom is first knowledge is second notice the third to another pistus Faith a conviction or belief respecting man's relationship to God and divine things generally with the included idea of trust and holy fervor the conviction that God exists and is the Creator and ruler of of all things the provider and bestower of Eternal salvation through Christ now God gives to every man that believes a Measure of Faith but some have this gift of faith which is above the average believer's Measure of Faith to believe that there is a God and that God can heal and God can save and there's a heaven and there's a hell to every believer is given this Measure of Faith to be able to believe God for certain things but to some is given the gift of faith and they by that gift can pray and they can bring the presence of God right down around people other preachers other people may be standing around and praying too but if they don't have that gift that one individual that's got that gift with that fervor and that something and then what does that do it creates more faith because people know God God God mov moves for that man God moves for that man we've all seen it have we not so faith of course this is substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen but here is a special endowment which is what the gifts are a special endowment which is separate from your salvation separate from your new births it is an endowment given by the spirit of God the Charisma given for what purpose to profit the body now where do these gifts belong they don't belong in the White House White House don't want this they don't belong in in the Senate house down in in Nashville where do they belong in the church but let me tell you something we cannot produce these gifts on our own it takes the Holy Ghost to produce them and I want every one of these gifts in our church but we're not going to get them because we are desire spiritual gifts we're going to get them whenever we say God pour out your presence Among Us let it be real Let It Be genuine Lord we don't want no fake we don't want this and that and the other we want the real thing I don't know about you I would like to see all nine manifested in a true right way before God before I leave this world praise the Lord is that asking too much I don't think so this is a portion of the word like Malachi 4 other portion of the word of God to another by The Same Spirit to face to another by The Same Spirit then the gifts of of healing now we know that God loves humanity and he wants people to be healed so much that the prophet said that God heals by love God heals by music God heals by medicine God heals by surgery this is why the prophet prayed for doctors every day that they would find a cure for cancer well praise the Lord if he did that as message followers shouldn't we be doing the same he prayed constantly that God would help him he did not reprimand and rebuke on a Sal for coming up with the polio vaccine he was grateful to God that he let that come upon the Earth is that right but yet here we're talking about an endowment and any of you that's ever been to a doctor or you've ever had a stay in a hospital you know that there are some nurses no doubt that are called to be nurses and they come in and they've just got something about them and they don't just push that needle in your arm they push it in your arm in a different way you know what I'm saying they're just something about it and it's the same about doctors you know as soon as you go in and sit down and you talk to some doctors you know why they are there it's because they've got that big house in the ridges and they know they've got a Porsche car and that their child's got a BMW and they've got this big bank account they've also got a vacation home on Blowing Rock and they've got another vacation home down in Tampa and that's the reason they're a doctor to make all that money and you can tell by their attitude so you're number three 85 get in sit down shut up next one 386 387 the more they get the more payment I get but then you've got others and they are so concerned about you and they're asking how are you and you tell me which is very rare doctors is like preachers they don't want you to tell them nothing but they ask well you tell me how are you doing both carolly and I went to a Cardiologist yesterday well how are you all doing what's going on with y'all how are you been well you tell me if you got any problem s anything going on no no we're doing good we're doing well that's awesome to Carol said you don't even need a cardiologist you don't even need to be here but he was a man that was very caring and you see what that is a person that's called to do it they do some of the same stuff got access to the same scripts and they can write the language you know and all that but there's an attitude that comes with it that you cannot learn at ETSU you've seen nurses and they didn't care a bit more about you they've shown more affection toward a donke than they would a human being and budy they go to drawing blood out of you and it's like they're drawing out of a turnip cuz they slam your arm down there dear God help and that they don't care a bit for you because it's become so common and so cold there're so Pat on you now calm down honey you okay how in the world can they tell we're nervous just because we've got the beads of sweat that big coming out all over our face how do they have that discernment but there is a call it's the same way when it comes to the spirit of God and the way he gives out these gifts so God is looking for people that he can give special endowment to that he knows are not going to take it and lift themsel higher above their Brethren because it's not to profit you it's not to profit me it's not to profit the individual that's got it it's to profit the Church of the Living God God give us people that he can be able to give such things and it'll not go to their head Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another working of Miracles Bo I tell you one thing there's something about the gifts of healing and the work of Miracles now let's just be honest in face facts some of these things are going to be more Visual and they will be more talked about and they will be more desired than the greatest ones which are wisdom and knowledge but yet whenever you look at it if we don't tap into that Avenue first from the top and work our way from the top down to what God wants us to have it's no wonder that we have the stuff that we have working of Miracles to another prophecy prophecy which means what repeating scripture yeah the Lord say I'm here yeah the Lord say I'm going to bless you so what if Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15 would have said yeah the Lord say I'm going to bless y'all I'm so glad Moses didn't believe the Pentecostal version and some of the message version of Prophecy right that's why Moses said behold the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me from among your brethren and he goes on to Define and Define that's prophecy Oh Glory to God y'all get nervous tonight don't be nervous it's good it's good till another Discerning of spirits Discerning of SP Spirits deis discern distinguishing judging I want you to notice what this precedes notice what this proceedes Discerning of spirits then tongues interpretation and prophecy oh my so that's why we need Discerning of spirits is it okay all right now watch the prophet of God is he takes this and he said now question answer say for instance I'm going to say we spoke in tongue somebody that is a gifted bunch of men Leo raised up spoken tongues and a brother here brother Willard give the interpretation all right now I want to say brother Neville and brother juny and brother Willard Collins was the discerners the discerners so does that mean then that brother juny Junior Jackson brother Willard Collins and brother Neville are standing in the church Discerning people you see friend this just absolutely blows me away that we have got message preachers that are putting their own interpretation on this word and will take their own opinion above a Vindicated prophet and if you think brother Bram taught this on in his church I say shame on you for not taking time to sit down and get your computer in your lab and typing it in and find out that he preached It All Over America cuz he was sent to correct the Pentecostals and they refused Elijah's meal offering and now some of the message preachers are refusing Elijah's meal offering too but I want Elijah's meal offering myself cuz God knows I mixed up enough poisonous porridge in my life anybody else say Amen to that I've got enough wild Gorge brother Steve and mixed in a little bit of this and a little bit of that I'm just going to be frank and honest with you tonight I'll be something a lot of preachers won't be I'll be honest I mixed up a lot of pottage and I pulled a lot of gourds and mix this that and the other but thank God for a prophet with enough meal to pour down inside my understanding of predestination and my inside of predestination got healed praise God my insight on women preachers brother Larry got healed yeah cuz I used to preach for women preachers when I was back there in Pentecost I preached eternal hell back there in Pentecost I preached tongues as the evidence back in Pentecost I preach a lot of them things and I did have a little bit of Truth not very much it's very little but once I found Elijah's meal stored up in the last day and begin to pour that on my election it brought my election to a Divine Healing it brought my predestination it brought my my ideology of the godhead oh I tell you friends if you haven't tried it you ought to try it you ought to tried every aspect of your life it'll heal your resentment attitude it'll heal your inability to forgive and love and just have joy in your life every day some of you let the devil Rob you your joy of per of serving God you need to take some of Elijah's meal and pour it in that Joy praise God get up in the morning with a smile on your face with a song in your heart saying out of my way devil I'm serving God today I don't care what's in my path greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Glory so brother Neville brother juny and brother Willard Collins are the discerners so what and who are they Discerning they are Discerning the tongues and the interpretation which came forth so someone spoke in tongues someone interpreted so you've got discerner setting there two or three and they are Discerning that Spirit yes amen then if they agree and said that was the Lord that was the Lord that was the Lord now of course this would make it quite sticky yeah because a prophet would have them to write down this prophecy and bring it to the pull pit and he would read it and then brother Neville's name would be on it brother Collin's name would be honored and whoever someone spoke thus sayith the Lord the tongues interpretation and the discerners all three said it was thus sayith the Lord then of course if it didn't happen public embarrassment a now we want to claim sovereignty don't we our church is above this really so I wonder where what else you'll start being above you see all it takes for a preacher on one little bitty tiny thing to start saying well we don't want that in our church that's not the way we're going to do it you just opened up the floodgates of hell cuz you'll start with one little thing that you think is insignificant then another then another then another and three years from now five years from now what where you going to be at then friends it is so dangerous amen amen oh my right God help us amen now watch the example that a prophet gave describing prophecy Leo spoke and Willard gave the interpretation here and said thus sayeth the Lord Wednesday night there's coming a woman in here she's going to be violent tell brother brandham not to rebuke her because she's insane but but tell him to take her over to the corner because it was in a corner where she did a wicked thing on one time and a certain thing taking place now that sounds very good doesn't it now but the first thing you know in the old scripture no matter what the prophet said or what anybody else said it was tested by the urum Thum first you see where brother random is going with this straight back to the Scriptures it went to the word and if them Li didn't flash then let it alone first thing you know now watch let's take it back to the word this man spoke in tongues sound it all right this one interpret it sounded all right but the word said let it be judged by two or three judges First Take It to the urum Thum now the first thing Willard colins says it was of the Lord juny says it was of the Lord two out of three all right it's put on a piece of paper spoke right out here in the church then when the people who sees it read it notice before it ever happens and then see it happen and they say brother that's God that's what I want in our church yes sir so the spirit of God could speak and say Sunday morning there'll be a man come in dressed like so and so and so and so tell brother Donnie to pray for him he'll have this certain thing his name will be so and so oh you can see why people don't want to do that cuz if they're wrong everybody's going to know they're wrong so what are a lot of our prophecies and our discernments they're so generic that's right even if you miss it you can't prove it wrong cuz I wouldn't want I said no I didn't say it that way no you misunderstood what I said well glory amen hallelujah somebody dial 911 get the ambulances lined up for after church now listen this is the way the prophet the same Prophet that we want to study his quotes and prove without a shadow of doubt that the gifts are supposed to be restored in the last days and yet we won't take his same message and prove how they ought to be restored and how what they ought to be restored to well thank you Jesus but what if it don't happen yes now we're going to get to another thing I could hit right here is all prophecy and interpretations and message prophecy now just a minute now what if it don't happen then Leo has spoken a false spirit Spirit he gave a false interpretation and you gave a false judgment then get that thing out of you that's wrong leave it alone that's it's not just a mistake sir I said it's not just a mistake amen the one who's the author of so many of these hit and misses around our message ranks it's not just mistakes it's demons amen yes sir praise the Lord thank you Lord everybody that gets mad at me now you can line up in line to buy me and Carol steak supper we'll take your name and address after church okay even you online too i' be getting a bunch of gift cards after that woo praise the Lord now watch see that's a regular Saints meeting I think that's what's in the Bible because Paul said if one prophesies and something someone bring prophesied something be revealed to one that's sitting there let him first hold his peace until this one speaks first you may all prophesy one by one that couldn't be in a regular meeting now I find it amazing that preachers will stand up and defy the prophet of God on this teaching I don't care how long you've been preaching what are you want a ribbon a star a button the spirit of Christ is subject to Christ teaching amen am don't smell that is it just me I me I took a shower before I come to church friends let me just tell you as we go on in time we are going to be shocked at people that will turn from this word but don't believe it'll be a total repudiation it will not be a total denial it will be a dissecting that's right come on I want I don't want I want I don't want I want I don't want may God help us amen do you realize when reding in the realm of spiritual gifts the realm realm of demonology lays right there listen to it Harvest Time December 1964 Satan can hand out those Supernatural gifts by the handfuls why because the realm of gifts lays so close to the realm of demonology this is why we needed this kind of te teaching that's right people think brother R was trying to take our Liberty are you kidding me he was sent by God to break them denominational bounds and then he would lead us back into another bondage he's not trying to take our freedom he's trying to keep us from evil spirits now I ask you what was on the preacher that told Carol she was called to preach yes sir what the Holy Ghost what was on the other preacher that told her she had cancer God Don't Lie oh my argue do whatever you want to do but listen Brothers those of you that disagree with me let me just let you know tonight you are not disagreeing with me you are disagreeing with God's Prophet any you in our church that disagree you're not disagreeing with your your pastor you're disagreeing with your Prophet messenger but this is the issue God being misunderstood brother REM says if you Brothers will trust my understanding of the scriptures I'd like to come down and meet with you and we could set these things in order that's the sad part brother Smith some of the preachers in this message have been preaching so long now and they've got so much you know know years behind them that they can question brother brenham's understanding of the scriptures well I hope I don't never live that long I hope if I you know it's amazing a lot of preachers don't mess up in their 30s brother Ron spencon I was telling about it last week lot of preachers don't mess up in their 40s and 50s some do but it's amazing how many preachers it's when they get up in their 60s and 70s when they get their Kingdom secure and they become you know where they can handle the word and they can Venture without Authority and purum I hope and pray to God that if God ever sees I would do such a thing he would take my life amen yes sir and put me in a free mature grave before I would bring reproach on the Lord Jesus amen and his word am and this message and you amen yes people let's stand together now that couldn't be in a regular meeting you know that the gifts now to be sure that it's of God CU if it's just foolishness it ain't of God you mean to tell me there could be tongues and interpretation and even so-called Discerning of spirits that would be nothing but foolishness poor brother Donnie that's scary stuff I know it's scary it's scary both ways it's scary to call something foolish that's God it's just as scary to call something God that's foolishness right brother Rob oh my goodness if it doesn't come to pass it's not of God it's got to come to pass and therefore in our churches oh no oh no oh no not just in my church but in our churches who's here question answer 61 message preachers message churches oh my goodness so brother brandom intended for this to be more than eth in pen Street oh no how terrible how traumatic it that's not the way I look at it I look at it as keeping demons out of our ranks brother Donnie what if it don't happen but four or five times a year by putting them back there I'd rather for it to be real and be four or five times a year than every time we come to church and'll be nothing but flesh yes sir cuz it's only a matter of time that an evil spirit will start saying things initially it'll start out you can't really pinpoint it initially nothing that you can really say is really missing it so generic demons know how to be generic remember each demon has its own personality all of them have it Blended in that personality an element of genericism where they can remain very neutral remember they're the kings of deceivers they know better than to give the very first one to be so far out and so false nobody else that even want to hear it anymore so what do they do it very generic and remember you are dealing with beings that know how to say things in such a way that you can't say it's right or you can't say it's wrong neutral just all neutral and then when he gets the people caught up in it then this will be wrong that'll be wrong oh my goodness friends there's people in our church that have come from churches and told me just a few years ago and people man man that even said under brother brandham himself and yet people getting up and speaking in tongues and prophesying and telling them you've got married the wrong person you need to leave your husband you need to leave your wife telling people to cut their hair you cannot believe all the nonsense and the trash a so-called Message Church of a preacher that brother brandham calls his name on tape that don't mean nothing come on but it starts out oh yes generic generic may God help us as I said I'd rather have it five times a year and it be right than every service hit Miss hit miss a lot of name Prophecy in the first place brother Donnie how can you say that I judge it by the word if it don't tell you what you prayed if it don't tell you what you was thinking about if it don't tell you things that's going to be forget it that's right I said forget it her and I knew a woman Carol knew her well as well an angel of God walked into her room one night handed her a Bible and told her she was called to preach she didn't even know where the Bible come from it was not her Bible it was not her husband's Bible they'd never even seen the Bible and I say angel of God in the sense that it was a created angel of God in the beginning which sold his Birthright and become a demon and this woman started preaching because an angel appeared into her room and called her to preach woo thank God for mercy don't you love him with all your heart how many wants the real me too Church well he said Brother D you think that's going to encourage us to seek after the real if it'll encourage you to seek after anything it'll encourage you to seek after the real there's too much heaven's just full of the real and genuine why do we want to fake we don't want it we want real hey and I was talking about it one time he said you know brother Donnie I've thought about it he said what if the gifted people met in our church and other message churches and that meet Sunday nothing happened then meet Wednesday nothing happened they meet Sunday nothing happened that meet Wednesday nothing happened how many of them would be faithful just to keep on meeting and waiting and praying or whether it say well the Lord don't want us to do it so I guess we'll just be out there in the church we'll just do it this way God will try Us by his word oh I want to be faithful to it don't youen let's bow our heads together praise the Lord oh Lord Jesus Lord I remember when my poor heart finally saw this message of what it was and once I begin to acknowledge and accept brother randam as the seventh angel and a Vindicated messenger of the last day and I listen to the anointed ones at the end time it answered so many questions for me I'd seen men and all the things that they had done and the way that they had lived I just could not understand and Lord I sought when I left Pentecost that I would be free from that but as I was communicating with a brother today from another state and he had a relative in his family that was dying and he told me today that several famous message preachers told him several things concerning this relative and every one of them was wrong even a member of brother Ram's family give him a cloth a blanket to take and lay on this individual and told him that if he'd lay that on him prove for him that'd be well but they died I felt so sorry for the brother and I apologized to him in the text cuz I could just hear it even though it was words I could hear his hurt and I could feel his pain because I know the disappointment that I had and even though we try our best to spare message people of the same disappointment some of them are going headlong right into it and I've done seen it some of them are going to be so stubborn and so hard-headed they will not stop until they make the office mess that ever was and there have to be public acknowledgement there'll have to be public shame and humiliation and they've been El of people that'll be hurt and scarred and then the preachers going to have to answer for all because we step over the teaching of this word forgive us human beings for our hard-headed ways our stubbornness forgive us Lord sometimes I don't know why you even fool with us not just when we're Sinners but after we become saved and even after we've preached for decades and we can get so set in our ways and so stubborn people would just listen to the Harvest Time real well and they'll listen to it very carefully how that Satan moves in that Realm of the supernatural Satan will get a man so caught up and people calling for him to come here and go there and he won't even stop and pray no more they want him so much and he's in such demand Lord God help help me help me Jesus help me to stay true I pray tonight before my church that if you were to see that I would ever head down that pass that I would become stubborn hard-headed cannot be corrected by the word please father take my life please Lord don't allow my my position to bring reproach upon you help me Jesus help me that I can always have a teachable spirit no matter how long I've been preaching how long I've been around the message help me Lord that I can maintain the ability to be able to stand up behind the pulpit and say I was wrong help me to be able to apologize and say I was wrong please forgive me I know it's a rarity among preachers but I want to be that Rare Breed I want to be of that breed that say I exalted myself above the message help us Lord Jesus for I truly believe if you can find men of that caliber we are yet to see the phenomenal and the supernatural help us Lord your Prophet tells us a man sent from God God call man 1958 that you had a Revival that you was going to shake but you'd have to have some men to bring it with men that have been shook to their very core he describes a men that it'll be that you'll use never mention nothing about Pride arrogance stuffed up hard-headed stuff shirt as a matter of fact that's not qualifications but disqualifiers help us Lord I know my people here love me I pray father I can always live a life and preach the gospel in a way where they can continue to do so I pray Lord they wouldn't forget to pray for me I pray that they would not be negligent on their part as the Sheep to pray that God will give me wisdom God will give me knowledge as we Face One Challenge and one trial after another from without out and from within help me Lord give me wisdom we're going through Waters that we've never been before Lord I need you Lord Jesus I'm not ashamed to stand here tonight and and say you as say to you as a man sometimes I get afraid I get afraid oh God my flesh becomes weary I need you Lord Jesus these are a great people I'm referring to tonight your people help me Lord God we worship you tonight Jesus we bless your name oh hallelujah how many of you tonight love him with all your heart you want God to help you maybe some of you feel like you're gifted in your life what I'll tell you what you want to do is check your motive your objective if you'll listen to a little simple tape very simple but very profound at the same time called discernment of spirit in 1960 it'll unveil a lot about motive and objective and of people that are gifted and what you can look for and what you can watch about people oh I pray that God will let his great Supernatural fall Among Us like never before and if we will pray and be sincere here what will happen before we leave this world remember the prophet told us that he believed there would be missing limbs that would be restored remember I told you that years ago when I was a Pentecostal preacher that God told me the dead would be raised in my Ministry I've seen it twice since I've been here I believe we will see such phenomenal things if we can just keep our hearts our attitudes and let's seek the gifts in their proper order let's start with wisdom with knowledge then when we get tongues we'll run its manifestation Lance through the gift on top wisdom which will always put God's word first we run interpretation through knowledge nosis the proper understanding of the word which includes also the word of the hour so tongues an interpretation of that wisdom it's easy to see why you get Bible saying almost anything it don't even have to be prophetic and people just accept it oh my I seen something not not long ago and a preacher had preached and my you know the people had said amen and Hallelujah and that sort of saying while the preacher was preaching then somebody got up spok in tongues and somebody supposedly interpreted people went wild they was screaming they was holling they was running they nearly knocked the chairs over in the church and what was said was not even prophetic there was nothing said that was even prophetic at all and yet a preacher had labored and labored and labored in the word and they sat there and said amen praise the Lord you can see the camera on some of them you know they're twiddling with their thumbs and they're doing this and that and as soon as tongues and interpretation come they went wild and then people wonder why I worry about stuff cuz I saw the same thing when I was a Pentecostal preacher now you show me that where that carried on in the Tabernacle and that was the brother brandham had the example and I'll stand up Sunday morning and apologize but until you do I'm going to keep on preaching it well praise the Lord I got my name embraced from some context tonight I guess off the phones and I lost some friends and buddies and Pals but that's all right I'm going to stand for this word if I have to stand by myself I won't have to because God's got people everywhere that believes the message of the hour right down to the gifts and right down to the election and all the rest of it and I'll tell you friends we're going to be glad after a while that we've took s with Jesus amen Hey sing something for him see if you can lift them out of this place I've brought them down to amen

mountain in his strength was almost gone but a shouted as he turned till it ever rides with the town then Palms [Music] I shall I saw him in the evening the sun was sinking glow he had overcome the and he reached the place he saw that Golden City his everlasted home and he shot his light or sat up Deliverance will come then come to Victory crowd the glory Palms I [Music] am [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] it's just a good thing I didn't know he was coming or he'd be standing up here tonight preaching met brother mental years and years ago and we've always had such a wonderful friendship I don't get seen that often but you know it is with some friends you have you don't get to see him very very often but every time you see him it's just like you just reconnect and there it is that's the way it's been my brother mental I want a pair of years ago and he took me around to preach in some of the different places and I just always have sort of admired our brother well Linda good to be here tonight praise the Lord thank you for being patient with us on the sound and the lights and all this new stuff we're getting used to so hopefully hopefully we'll get it all set here before long thank you for your patience Daniel chapter 2 verse 31. this whole world of ours is full of so much sorrow and difficulty and trouble and sadness and death and over 11 000 people lost their lives and as you know and the earthquake there in turkey and Syria and so much disease and heartache and just life itself so maybe for a little while again tonight we can be able to leave some of that aside and move into our future as Angel of the Lord till brother Branham years ago whenever he went to Africa and missed the will of God and picked up the amoeba thought he was going to die he was sitting in a tub of water praying asking God to help him and he saw these white pieces of paper and a hand tooken through them like that and like they made a a pathway up into heaven and the angel told him your way is clear and your future so if we can for a little bit tonight maybe we can lay aside our anxiety our trouble our worries of life and let's look at a little bit of our future because I'm telling you tonight your future is looking wonderful now I'm not a fortune teller but I am a future teller and if you're living for the Lord you're looking good if you ain't you're in big trouble so I can tell everybody's future depending on the way they're going to live let's read together Daniel chapter 2 verse 31. now this is the interpretation of the King Nebuchadnezzar's dream this is the beginning of the great Gentile kingdoms of the world and what God is showing this Heathen King the Heathen King has the dream but he doesn't have a clue what it means so God sends the prophet and the prophet doesn't re-dream it but he has a vision and then the prophet interprets the vision and this is where we pick up here in Daniel 2 31. thou O King saulst and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold now this was the king himself of course and the Babylonian Kingdom his breasts and his arms were of silver and his belly and his thighs of brass so he starts at the head and he starts defining it the way Daniel goes down as he does each one of these symbols which are symbolized by metal they're getting weaker and weaker and of less value but it's going to show the Babylonian the means of Persian come on down of course to the Roman at the bottom his legs of iron his feet were part iron and part of clay thou saw us till that a stone was cut out without hands which smoked the image upon his feet so notice where it hits him doesn't hit the image in the head it doesn't hit the image in the chest or the thighs but it hits the image in the feet and he said defeat that were of iron and Clay now iron and Clay is a mixture they're not there's no way that they can ever mix strong metallurgical mixed with dirt that's basically wet and moist so there's no way that it can go together so it shows a divided Kingdom there's where the weakness will be and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became now notice the stone came out of a mountain and it come in a condescended form and then it became a great Mountain you're talking about the condensation of God in the form of his son which was himself in humanity so he comes from himself as a stone a rock just a small rock and then once that rock destroys these kingdoms then that rock becomes grows unfolds into a great mountain and filled the whole Earth I made a lot to be remembered tonight as we pray it's just our heads together if you would Heavenly Father we're truly blessed tonight to be able to once again stand in your presence we thank you Lord for everything that you mean to us you've done so many wonderful things for all of us we stand here tonight Lord with breath with life we have a provision of clothes and food and so many things that you've given to us and we want you to know that we are happy to be your people the psalmist David said it so many years ago happy are the people whose God is the Lord we ask you tonight father that you would catch us up you see the hour that we're living and there's trouble and despair and Sadness and Sorrow and death and politically and religiously every way we look we can see the world is at its end it's at the terminating point of all these kingdoms and it's because soon and very soon the stone will come and destroy and annihilate everything that is of this present world we pray father that you would fall upon us while we're in this Gentile dispensation may we by the grace of God be able to not be destroyed by this Stone but our nature will be annihilated we will be born again in the image of God so we can be part of that great Kingdom speak to us to not father from your word we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated truly when God spoke to His prophets and these symbols it must have been very unusual to them and to the people that would hear them can you imagine being in the days of Daniel whenever this was written sometime after Daniel would have seen it and the people picking it up and trying to read and understand a stone silver gold brass iron clay what in the world does all that mean and what's amazing about it is that even though this was written over 2 700 years ago and yet to many people it's still just as much a mystery as it was when Daniel spoke at thin but yet God doesn't want it to remain a mystery we know that God desires for certain things in his word to be understood and truly this is one of them the stone does not represent Christianity it does not represent denominational systems it does not represent our church doesn't represent me or it doesn't represent you but it does represent our Lord Lord Jesus for he took on this form which was an Earthly image of course I find it so amazing that he humbled himself when he come to the Earth that he took on the form of the lamb and he was identified in the form of a servant according to the book of Isaiah he was identified as a sheep he was identified as a rock he was identified as a sacrifice he was identified at all these symbols that we could look around on the earth and think why in the world would he do that he did that for us you know it's a shame that man absolutely is totally lost without God and man has such a hard time trying to Humble himself and the great almighty God humbled himself so low that man can never get down that far it's just not any and you can see why that the kingdom of God is so misunderstood to the haughty to the high-minded to those who look look at themselves as being some great something to the world but we know that he reveals himself to those that will humble himself before his plan he's spoken of as the stone of course and the scripture to the Jews he was a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense now notice this is the exact same symbolism that Daniel sees him and they look at him the Jews identify him and they said oh my there's no way this man will not have him to rule over us are you kidding our Messiah is not going to be coming from the Nazareth and down in Jerusalem born down there in that little place called Bethlehem the house of God's bread his mother was a spouse of Joseph and and she conceived him out of holy wedlock and for him to be king over us no way we'll not take that man to be our ruler but we will will we not but yet to them he was a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense but to the New Testament Church he was the foundation stone that the building whole building of God is laid upon so it all depends on who you are and how you relate to the rock of God now he will fall on some people and crush them to powder but if we fall on him then we become broken and our nature becomes annihilated and we become part of the building so it all depends upon how we relate to this great Stone of almighty God the question is how do you and I relate tonight so here Daniel sees this image now before the cross and he sees it coming out of the mountain not youn out with hands must have been so perplexing to try to understand what does that even mean how could it be what is it and it comes out comes out of the mountain comes rolling down through hits the the image and the feet strikes it in the feet the feet combusting all two pieces the iron goes one way the clay goes another and when it does the entirety of the image falls down into shreds of gold and silver and iron and clay and there it lays smashed by what would seem to be an impossible Rock now it was not a mountain that hit it it was not a gigantic Boulder that was so big it would have took tractors and trailers and great big yuke trucks and a crane but simply a boulder that come rolling out of the heavens and hit it in the feet but John then rather Daniel sees the same thing John does and he watches as this Stone begins to grow what a what a strange thing it would have been for a prophet as he's looking there and he sees a rock and this rock starts growing growing and growing what in the world well why didn't God just come right out and tell him what he was because God runs his business the way he wants to now when he come the first time he did not destroy the Roman Empire as a matter of fact it looked like that the Roman Empire had the upper hand on him because he died under capital punishment and the death that he died was a Roman death it was not a Jewish death the Jews did not crucify their people the cappadocians did not crucify their people many of the Gentile heathens did not crucify even the worst of criminals but it was a Roman death so it looked like that Rome had the higher upper hand as we would say and even the Roman seal not the Jewish seal not the Syrian seal the Roman seal was what was on his tomb and it looked like Rome absolutely had the upper hand but we could go back to that tomb and see that he raised from the dead and broke the Roman seal and he showed right there one day he would annihilate the Roman Kingdom now since that time he and his servants had been hit in the Roman Kingdom up one side and down the other now they have had certainly a Dominion in the earth and they will get a mixture in the last days and they will mixed with the seed of man which is the representation of the clay in the feet so it's in the feet and it runs down to the ten toes which will be the the resurrection of the old Roman Empire in the ottoman Powers so they will rule as kings but they won't be Crown Kings which is a dictator so there was five toes on each foot which will be the ten kingdoms that that John saw in the Book of Revelation thank God a lot of this won't happen to the bride is already gone but we need to lay this out so you can see what's coming in your future so he comes first and he does certainly take a lick upon the Roman Empire and then the Roman Empire smites him and makes him to die and they think of course that they've got him so the first coming of Christ was not this falling of the stone that Daniel saw in this Vision but it was the coming of the Messianic prophecy of Psalm 22. now remember how we love Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want we all learned it when we went to Sunday school but I know that you're aware of it the psalm 22 precedes Psalm 23 and Psalm 22 which is the Messianic Psalm my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me so the Messianic Psalm 22 is what leads him to the Victorious place to become the answer to be your Shepherd of Psalm 23. you see the Lord Jesus would never have been able to been your Shepherd of Psalm 23 had he not fulfilled Psalm 22 understand your life and my life comes the same way sometimes we want to be a great Victorious church we want to be an overcoming church we want to be a great conquering church but before we can ever be that comes trials tests tribulation is that right hardship difficulty do we like it nope I don't like it a bit more now than I did when I first got saved I don't like tests I don't like trouble do you all like it any better I don't like it but if you do pray for me I don't like it one bit better but I know it's part of being a Christian I have to have trials but I'm always glad when they're over I have to have valleys but I'm always happy when I'm going out the other side anybody else feel the same way I know I know the prophet said you've got to have sickness on in order to appreciate Health but I've got to say I do appreciate Health better than I do sickness and I think I would be fine if I never had another dose of sickness the rest of my life if I never had another headache if I never had another heart day if I was never betrayed by another friend I think I'd be fine but yet we know it's part of the way this life works is that right so what are we longing for we're longing for that state of perfection when we will never have another trial we know it's coming and we know it's closer than it's ever been before but we know until we arrive at that hour we're going to have to fight hell but let us just say it this way we're going to fight hell and we're not going to let hell get by with it because hell we'll pay as long as we are here We believe We were born by the grace of God to torment tormenting Devils we're not just meant to go through life and hang our head and just barely survive pray for me I'll make it till Sunday oh no that's not the way I look at it I believe I was born to be such a Son of God that when I get up in the morning the devil says Dear God here he comes he didn't die during the night a heart attack didn't take him oh no another day was him on the Earth Yep devil here I come brother donius every day seemed Victorious no it doesn't there's days I feel like I've totally lost but you know what I'll still hold my head up because greater is he that is in me that he that is in the world I have disappointments I have days I don't feel Victorious I have days I feel like man I don't think I made no dent in hell at all but when it's all said and done I didn't bow to the devil I didn't bow to Leia to see it I'm still in love with Jesus so whether I feel anything or not that don't matter whether it feels like overcome hell or not that don't matter because at the end of the day I'm still saved I'm still Sanctified I've still got the Holy Ghost and hail trembles when I pray well I wish somebody would preach with me tonight I'm just talking about a Christian a preacher being that way but when the weakest Christian gets down on their knees to pray Devils begin to shake and tremble because you have got power with god oh yes I don't feel it you don't have to feel it it's because of what he's done in You by the new birth you've already got this rock inside of your soul Hallelujah [Applause] so the first coming was not the Stone Kingdom so it awaits in the future at the second Advent of Our Lord notice now in verse 44 of Daniel chapter 2. in the days of these Kings now Daniel was like some of the other prophets that God would show him a condensed form sometimes of a vision like chapter 2 here and then he would send him over to chapter 7 and he would expound a little bit more on it then he'd go to chapter 10. and he was going to bring it into he goes and he'd bring in the two horns and he would prophesy about Antiochus epiphanies and he would go to all these symbols of a goat and a he-ram and all that sort of thing and he bounced kind of back and forth and Prophets could only say of course as God gave it to him but notice this in in Chapter 2 in the days of these Kings so again we come back to a certain time frame so the Lord Jesus could not come as the mighty Messianic King that the Jews are looking for they were looking for the son of David so it was a dispensational time Idol and they had it in the wrong dispensation they did not understand that he must come first as son of man then come back on the day of Pentecost as the Son of God and then in the Millennium he would come as son of David is that right but what they're looking for and you know you can't really blame them because they would take the prophet's quotes of the Old Testament they would take Genesis 3 15 they would take haggai 2 7 Zechariah 14 7 they would take Zephaniah they would take you know so many of those things and they would put them together and you can see why they were looking for a mighty king So when he was born a poor baby born wrapped in Swan and clothed and laid in a Manger there's no way that fit with their idea there's no way that fit was what they had always been taught they're looking for a son of David to come riding on a big white horse and he's going to knock down all Rome and he's going to give Israel back their Homeland and the Romans are going to die and here he comes pushed from Pillar To Post a weak looking sword of a guy this is what caused John the Baptist to doubt John introduced him he said he's coming and he's going to have a my big flame in his hand a fan and he's going to Fan down through there and the chaff is going to come blowing away where's John where's John quoting from the scripture we just read in the Book of Daniel so John said boy when he comes I'm telling you what everybody better get out of his way and when he comes they push him over this way and they push him over that way and he stands up there my was humble and poor and didn't have no Kingdom didn't have no horses didn't have no soldiers and his army was fishermen ignorant and unlearned couldn't even sign their own name and John the Baptist sent some of his followers and said ask him if he's the one or have I messed up should we look for another you imagine the man who introduced him now Lord willing we'll get to that Lord will maybe on Sunday morning but John actually had a breakdown inside the prison and John is looking at what looks like reality to him and it does not look like the Lord Jesus is this Messianic prophecy he just can't believe that that's him so Jesus said hang around for a while and go back and tell John what you saw once you notice he didn't say we're polishing our swords we're getting our helmets ready we're getting all of our Shields ready but he said tell him what you saw the blind see and the lame are walking and the poor have the gospel preached to them so you imagine whenever he comes back then it hits John oh I see I had the dispensation Place wrong I was taking the scriptures of Daniel 2 and Daniel 7 and I was supplying the stone Kingdom when it was not the stone Kingdom it's the spirit indwelling kingdom That's Where It's At oh okay I see it now so John could go right on and let them chop his head off and knew that he had introduced the Messiah at the right time you see God's dispensations aren't always visible to the unlearning they're not always visible to the carnal mind of man and this is why it takes Revelation and the church said now watch in the days of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom in the days of those kings the particular Prophecy of the kings of Daniel chapter 2. now this of course was not in the Advent of Our Lord at his first coming which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people now what Daniel is unfolding into King Nebuchadnezzar coming on to the Book of Daniel here is that it came from the Babylonians and it's going to go to the means of Persians then it'll go to the Greeks and then it'll go to the Romans so what's it doing it's going from one people to another people to another people but Daniel sees him this Vision when this kingdom comes it will not be turned over from the people of Christ to somebody else and then somebody else and then somebody else but once Christ ever gets this Stone Kingdom it will never be turned over to anybody else it'll be his and his only from that time so that's who you're serving tonight notice in the Kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all those kingdoms and it shall stand forever so other kingdoms were raised by what human Ambitions human Ambitions so one king would get this ideology about himself he was the greatest king of kings and all my he was the great this and that and the other and it would go from one man to another man a man with an ambition a man with an ideology that he was supposed to do this and that and the other but the kingdom of God is Not established any such way now what's really sad is is when you see preachers that get inside and in and around this kingdom of God and they go to bring in the mannerisms of the old Gentile World Order kingdoms and they think God is looking for men who have ambition no God is looking for men who will lose their own ambition and tie in with the ambition of God what I've always wanted to be this and I've always wanted to be that well more than likely God will never use nothing you always wanted to be God will get rid of that and make you what he wants you to be well praise the Lord but you see what many people do they fall right in the way of the Gentile Kings before them and they fulfilled the repeat of what Daniel saw and they bring it into every move of God that's been down through the church ages I hate to say it but it's right around our message as well you take a man with an ego a man that wants to be a big this and that and the other and you watch trouble will find him he'll split he'll Splinter he'll divide he's got this ego he's got this thing although don't get quiet on me gone ain't looking for for song leaders and for musicians and singers that's got this great ego about themselves God wants people to say Lord I can't do it Lord I don't know what to say I ain't no speaker Lord I ain't no great singer Lord I'm not a great Mission musician if you can use me use me Lord but I can't do nothing on my own oh but be afraid to then hang glory to God let me edit here hey yeah we're not voting on something we're not auctioning something all we're looking for people who want to die to their own ideas their own agendas their own motives and become part of the greatest Kingdom that ever will be on the face of the Earth now notice so it will not be left to other people so we are the finale of all the kingdoms of the world notice in verse 45 for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hand so there was no hands that was in here so it wasn't like that the people cut it out and the denominations cut it out and the systems cut it out and with these overseers and this bishop and this and that and the other no it was not cut out by men let me tell you some friend if our church is made by man it'll only be a matter of time it will collapse any church that is started because a man has an ambition it may go five years it may go ten but it will run its course because God's true church is not started by any man the way I look at it years and years and years ago before you all ever knew me and before I ever knew you whenever this church had its original Roots over on Roan Hill some of you all were there I wasn't and that was not them people that wanted to start that church I believe it was God that led them to start that church then when it moved over to Happy Valley changed the name and took on a different look in a different building and the ministry changed down through the years I don't think it was them people that wanted to do that I believe it was the Lord that did it so you see when Satan attacks a church that God himself set up then the people ain't really attacking you they're not attacking me they're attacking God himself now there's a difference in God starting a church in men starting a church and there ain't no question about it a lot of men down Through the Ages and started churches but the Bible tells me except the Lord built the house those who build it labor in vain so myself I ain't looking for a man-made church I ain't looking for a man-made system I want a God made church I want a God made Mountain that I can run to and oh I wish somebody would preach with me tonight I want to be able to confide and something that is stronger than that the strongest preacher in this message the man with the greatest gifts the man who has the greatest ability to speak I still don't want to tie my soul to any human being all men will let you down all men will disappoint you there's only one place that you can put your ultimate confidence and that's in the rock of our Salvation the Lord Jesus not done here Reagan not some other man the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it breaking pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation sure now notice again Daniel 7 13. and I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man now watch this the son of man you can imagine what the Jews when they hear the Lord Jesus use this term when he comes to the Earth it ain't no wonder they got so mad now this is a common term to us son of man we've heard it for years but can you imagine being a Jew you only knew that reference was used in Daniel and in Ezekiel and a few of the prophets and here stands this man with an illegitimate birth supposedly a poor no schooling no education and he stands up and calls himself the son of man you imagine them looking at him with anger and Furious son of man who does he think he is that was referred to Daniel and Ezekiel the son of man the son of man was the one that stood by the most high God who does this man think he is it wasn't who he was thinking he was it's who he knew he was now watch Daniel sees the merging together of his Humanity and his divinity what's the terms that he uses one like the son of man now here's his Humanity the word son in the Hebrew is been so b-e-n so it would be so and so the bin of Donnie or so and so the bin of John which was son of so this name identified the Tabernacle of God as the son of man isn't it amazing the son of man so he takes upon himself this title the son of man oh God help us but notice word Daniel sees him the son of man came with clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days so he sees the visible appearance of what it looks like a human being surrounded in clouds and then this human being surrounded in clouds goes and walks into the presence of the mighty Elohim the Eternal himself and Daniel says how can that be a man ever to walk into the presence of the Mighty God so Daniel's looking and he sees the merging together of his humanity and his deity and he came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near so here comes the cherubims and the seraphims and who are they they are the ones who stopped the approach remember God telling Lucifer that thou art the anointed cherub and I have set thee soul the anointed cherub was the one who stopped the approach Lucifer in heaven was God's right-hand man any other angels of lower degree that approached the Throne of Elohim Lucifer would have walked up before them before he fell and he would have stopped them because he stopped the approach and if Elohim allowed the angels to come they came through the gate or the entrance of Lucifer he had a great position but in his pride he got lifted up because he felt like he could do a whole lot more than what God was letting him do oh boy and here Daniel sees this son of man doesn't know him by name now he never was allowed to mention the name of Jesus but he sees him as a son of man and he sees as he approaches and then someone Angelic beings come and get this what looks like a human just a mere human and Daniel Sanders said how can this be a mortal and he's surrounded by clowns Heavenly Witnesses and he comes up to the approach of the Ancient of Days and the cherubims and the seraphims and the zooms and they come and they meet him at the gate and they take him into the presence of the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him so his Humanity being the son of man his deity being declared by the way he traveled Hallelujah his Humanity was the title of son of man but his divinity was revealed by the way he traveled so will yours be after a while they see millions of people have died billions of them down through time and they've left the Earth by the channel of deaths but one thing that separates the seed of God from the rest of other human beings is the means that they travel you see they don't go to paradise they do not go to Shield they go into that sixth Dimension and there they wait they go into a theophany body so it identifies they also are from deity hope you understand it tonight there's a part of you that's just as human as it can be we all can say Amen to that can't we but if you're born again tonight of the Holy Ghost there is a part of deity that lives inside of you and I it ain't the deity that causes our problems it ain't the deity that causes our difficulties somebody say Amen it is our Humanity it is our old flesh it is our old human Spirit oh my but one of these days I will be identified who I truly am it'll be by the way I travel by the way I travel amen hallelujah for what did Paul say that by by the grace of God we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye for the dead and cross shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed and we are going to be caught up you'll be known by the way you travel you won't have to have a plane ticket you won't have to have a space shuttle ticket you'll be known by your true identity that you are part of deity you are going to travel the way he travels you are sons of men and Daughters of men but one day you're going to be identified in the clouds hallelujah hallelujah will be identified by our theophany body you see John seeing the same thing whenever he sees him in Revelation 1 8. but here Daniel sees him veiled not in Thunder heads not in wispy white clouds but in Shekinah or the Hebrew word shakanai he sees him surrounded by the Shekinah of God and he thinks How can any man ever be surrounded by the Shekinah Glory of God if we can look beyond our Veil tonight if a person that's in this building filled with the Holy Ghost you've already got a part of that Shekinah yourself is that right oh my God you see our lord Jesus used this term when he came to the Earth 82 times in the four Gospels 82 times apparently he wanted somebody to know who he was well I'm glad I'm one of them somebodies now he could have called himself so many things and yet he chose knows to prevent himself a son of man of course we realize that the the appearance of him and the last States Luke 17 30 is what causes such confusion again because people take the same title and they think it applies to the Lord Jesus in the reappearing of his own Corporal body but the revealing of the son of man of Luke 17 30 is not the second coming in his Corporal body it's his second coming and the revealing of the son of man not his Corporal body when that comes that will be the Rapture praise the Lord but truly as it was in the days of Sodom thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed is that right and then of course in verse 30 tells us all of that and then he reminds us down below there remember Lot's wife it was in the revealing of the son of man when he made himself known to Abraham and lot and his wife left the message they left the message and went to Sodom isn't it amazing Jesus never did save remember Abraham's wife remember Jacob's wife remember Isaac's wife remember Joseph's wife but why did he say remember Lot's wife it was a sign in the last days look around we are saying mister and miss a lot pulling away from the message of the hour and what's he saying to us remember lot's why why he don't want you to be identified with that he don't want me to be identified with that but what what are we doing we're staying right there Hallelujah what's the original message of the hour we are not leaving our Oak Tree in the plains of memory we are there waiting on God oh it may get hot it may get dry there may be tests and there may be trials but I'd rather have a hot day in the plains of sheikim than I would living down there in the well-watered plains of Jericho are living down there near the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah you can have Sodom you can have gamara Give Me Jesus you can have the world you can have Leia to see her give me Jesus if I've got to live up here under this oak tree I'll do it I'll do it let it get dry let it get hot let it get difficult but give me Jesus Give Me Jesus he's all I need watch the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24. 27. for as a lightning cometh out of the East and shine us even into the West come us out of the East and shine us even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be so it will come from the East to the West and of course people have quoted this for years and years since he said it two thousand years ago and they're looking for this to be applied at his second bodily coming that's no son of man that's Crown King Son of God so the son of man coming can't you see why Satan wants to take you away from your inheritance he's trying to get you out of your inheritance what is our inheritance our promised land is the message of the hour feeding on Heavenly Manna baptized in the Holy Ghost by the spirit of God and how will he be identified by the way we travel so you see in the days of Luther this horse and buggy as it moved on up it moved beyond that and come on up to the airplane age but we're beyond the airplane now well you know the other day whenever the FAA one of our brothers told me here last night that he took him about 30 hours to travel from out in Tucson because the FAA had a glitch in their software well that's kind of the way it is whether all these churches around native they've got a glitch on their software well headquarters say we can't preach this no more and not no more I'm so glad I ain't got no software to get glitches because if you got it you no doubt we'll get glitches come on say Amen but I'm so glad that we are hooked up straight into heaven and we don't have to go through no Heavenly all glory no earthly headquarters but we've got a Heavenly tie and we ain't got some scientist sitting back somewhere to say you know well you can't say man or women no more we can I know a lot of them don't know what a man is and what a woman is they call it a it or a Shem or a Herm or whatever they call them but my Bible still identifies male and female well come on preach brother Donny I'm going to my Bible still identifies there is a church and there is a pride there is a first resurrection and there is a second Resurrection and you are going to be identified by which one you live in and which one you get up in okay notice Daniel 7 13. I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him they brought him near before him and there was given you see the trinitarians were wrong and the Jesus only were wrong too but the truth always lays in the middle of the road now I was trinitarian years ago and I came from that side of the ditch and I became a Jesus only now the sad thing about it is we have a lot of message folks that are Jesus only but because there never was in Pentecost they don't know what Jesus only is so when they hear you preach the Divinity of the Lord Jesus they're with you but it stumbles them when you preaches Humanity they cannot take him when you say sit down with a headache why they're Jesus only so I used to preach I used to believe Jesus was his own father I believe that Jesus was at all don't you come and tell me now then I remember it years and years ago Harry remembers the meeting where we was at and there's one of the brothers that we fellowship with and he began to see a little bit of light in this truth may be known he may have stumbled on it in the message because I found out a lot of the people I was preaching for they secretly was reading the message of the hour I'd hear him preach kinsman redeemer I'm hearing my my brother King a man down in Yeager West Virginia and I hear that man he'd preached about Ruth and he'd preach about Boaz and he'd preach about I'll say where in the world is that man getting that well I found out where he was getting it I found out with some of them guys that I was fellowshipping with God but you know what once they found out that I found out they didn't want nobody else to found out what I found out so they sure didn't want me telling where they got their resource well I'm the kind of man I want to let you know where I found this out I didn't find it out in any organized religion I didn't find it out for my daddy God bless him I didn't find it out for my uncle for my grandpa I found it out from the prophet that spoke of the Malachi 4 and I want to point you to that same way and you need to be feeding right there on that same message hmm so they bring the son of man to the Ancient of Days and then there's given him who the son of man now the millennium is the continuing of what God Said in the seventh day in the Garden of Eden Adam called God out of his Shabbat in the Garden of Eden and God put his millennium on hold so no individual has ever lived to be a thousand years old but they will in the millennium so the millennium is the old Sabbath the seventh day of the Old Testament now watch this and there was given him Dominion so who given who the son of man who is who the Lord Jesus um remember when Jesus stands and says after his resurrection all power has been given unto me show me where he says that before he dies you'd be better off to spend more time into the holy book instead of Facebook praise the lord well I just throw that in for good measure no charge you see he could not stand and say that until he had completed the atonement then all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me now watch there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom given to him how could you give something to someone who already has it what is this it's the sonship of God not another God not another person the same God in human form I said brother Dory that confuses me why why should it you've got a soul you've got a spirit you've got a body have you ever seen yourself anybody here ever seen your soul what about anybody else's soul have you ever seen your spirit have you ever seen anybody else's spirit what do you know most of your body right why is that confusing and yet you take my spirit out of my body my gray matter all that matter will still be in my brain I will not be able to reason I will not be able to think I will not be able to have a conscience why because my spirit contains those five inlets and it runs in on my brain matter runs in the cerebral the stem down through the back and all that it tells me what's to do so when a person goes out of their mind what do they lose part of that spirit I just want somebody this crazy age that we're living in they've gone out of their mind their spirit's all messed up well praise the Lord and yet whenever the Lord Jesus come to the Earth what was he he come from the heart of God I came forth from God and I go back to God so what was he he was that invisible part who is the father God the invisible God's not an old man sitting in heaven you don't find that in your Bible when John looked in the Book of Revelation he said I saw one and one Throne that wasn't a big throne and a big old man on it another little guy said over here and another little guy called the Holy Ghost over there if there's another God in Heaven Beside the Lord Jesus he's sitting on the floor because John only saw one Throne there ain't no big throne and no little Throne there's only one throne and he's the one sitting on it don't you understand in the Millennium he's given this Dominion don't shut us down also in Corinthians where he said when it's all said and done he will turn it all back over into that great invisible life that God may be all in all and there to be the Lord Jesus setting on the throne in the seventh day and and in the eighth day as well surrounded by what father God which has never been seen and never will be will be that's a direct quote and there was given him Dominion and Glory and their Kingdom that all people Nations and languages Shall Serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed so in the Millennium will be Nations and peoples Ethiopians Sioux Indians Cheyenne blackfeet Europeans black white red Chinese Japanese all kinds of nationalities in the millennium praise the Lord notice verse 25 and he shall speak great words now here we come back into the move of the Antichrist against the most high and shall wear out boy I can sure identify with this and shall wear out the Saints of the most high how many ever just gets wore out with life just things you deal with from day to day and it ain't like you're quick I'm I'm fixing the backslide oh I'm going back to the world oh a real child of God filled with the holy ghost thing going back to no world there ain't no world in them but they do get wore out they get worn out with struggling and they get wore out with sickness and disease and battles and one disappointment out of another but I want you to notice that Daniel never said that he ever got a one of them saints he just said he wears them out what I think of it ought to be the other day that we ought to wear him out too I'll tell one thing as long as I'm here on the earth I don't want the devil sitting down there in hell with a big glass of sweet tin of strawberry moon pie land on the other side of his recliner said well Dawn is up here he ain't causing me no trouble I want how I want hell to know that I've lived I want hell to know that I've been on the Earth but brother Donnie you're an old man yeah but I'm still kicking and I want to be like oh Uncle Buddy Robinson I'll tell you what I'm going to stay here cause I'm so full of the power of God and I'll now on him if I lose my teeth on all on him with my gums and I'll be left you whatever I've got left I'm going to make him pay if I roll out here in a wheelchair and I can only say Hallelujah Jesus is alive Jesus is Alive and y'all sit there and look at me as a poor old Feller don't poor old Fowler me I want to keep on saying it because I know one day it'll change me back to a young man I will be revealed but the way I travel I'm fixing to travel like a fault forget the car forget the airplane forget the rocket I want to travel like assault in a moment and they're trying kind of an eye hmm and shall wear out the Saints of the most high and think to change the times and laws and they shall be given unto his hand until a Time and times and the dividing of time three and a half years time singular times double oh my and then we come down to three and a half years but the Judgment shall sit oh and they shall take away his Dominion I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them and they shall take away his Dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most and Satan wants to tell you you ain't never going to get nothing you ain't nobody there ain't no need for you to even try he can read this verse he's been reading a lot longer than I have he's doomed his days are numbered but yours aren't Oh Glory to God his days are numbered but your days are not numbered notice what's going to happen God will take away his kingdom and give it to the people of the Saints of the most high the ones he's lied to the ones he's telling why you're worthless you're no good you've messed up so bad God will never forget why God don't love you God don't care for you and God send children honey I love you you're my bride I love you I'm fixing to give you the whole thing I'm going to give you the very Kingdom you're married to me already an invisible Union but before long you're going to set with me on my Throne you and I was going to rule together oh Zechariah 6 12. speak unto them unto him rather saying thus Speak Us the Lord will hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the Lord that's amazing to me when you look at the time frame how that God would sometimes have these prophecies it's Prophet sacchariah is one of them haggai too but God would hide things that they would say and they would prophesy about things that was going on right then current events and God would slip in a verse or a hifa verse right in with the current events that was going to be 4 000 years down the road and the devil Read it just like a newspaper went right over the top of it like a bunch of theologians did and this is one of them settings now remember this is in the days when they are rebuilding the temple this is one of the days whenever they're out there the temple so they're going to say well the man whose name is a branch of and who in the world was that who's he talking about Joshua who's he talking about and God slid another Messianic prophecy right in the middle of it that's the way he likes to do you sometimes he likes to set you right down in the middle of NAPA Auto Parts and give you a job right there in the middle of it and you turn that whole part store upside down God likes to put you in the or God likes to put you in an office somewhere and every time you come in and sit down on that long skirt and that long hair and then Bob heard painted face Jezebel sitting around they can't stand it they don't realize there's a walk and a pistol walk right in among them and you're sitting there just as happy as of being a bunch of honey and you're typing away glory to God he set me free yes he set me free you know they kind of Snicker at you when you get up and walk out but you know you're bearing the reproach for the word and you know Lord Jesus is on your side Why Should I Worry why should I fear the lord Jesus as God is out on you children you are the apple of his eye and God just slides it right in there so your Zechariah says the man whose name is the branch the people probably thought oh boy who ever heard of calling a man after a true branch these prophets are so weird they are so strange we are so blessed to be able to understand such strange things which must mean that we are strange also but the way we look at it we're looking back out from where we are and we're looking at others and saying what in the world is wrong with everybody else they're out of their mind and they're looking at us and say them people are crazy they are totally Looney Tunes they don't have a clue what in the world is going on you might be surprised we not only know what's going on we know what's going on before the foundation of the world we actually know a lot of things that's went on down through time and now further more than that we know what's fixing to take place and it might be right here tonight it might be in the morning but one of these days we may be sitting together on the house of God and it hits us and all of a sudden a 66 year old Pastor standing here and about like a boat to lightning strikes out of heaven and I turn to be an 18 year old man right in front of your eyes and you turn to be 18 years old right in front of my eyes and we know it ain't gonna be long we're fixing to be called up by the power of God why let them say what they want call us what they want to but one day call us gone come all is gone because you're going to be leaving this place so the man whose name is the branch so I guess it shouldn't seem unusual to us that when the man whose name was the branch come on the earth and he started saying I am the Vine and ye are the branches you imagine the polished theologians of that every other thing the poor guy I mean you can tell he's from Happy Valley you can tell the poor guys a Kentuckian I mean you know they're just kind of backwashed and ignorant and stuff like that he's from down in Nazareth and I mean who would call himself a Vine and and call his followers branches the Branchwood we consider the great honor to be called branches don't we I mean because after all the man whose name is the branch is calling me an offshoot of him oh maybe you don't want to be called that I couldn't be calling nothing better I'll tell you one thing my name will not be in lights well I guess this is about as bright as I'll ever get right here my name won't be on the Hollywood's Walk of Fame my name may not be here and there and I really don't care and I really don't want it to be but the man whose name is the branch calls me a branch so that means I'm an offshoot of the man himself I am the vine and ye are the branches and now he said I don't no longer bring forth the fruit but you all will so you'll go in my name and you'll cast out devils and you'll heal the sick and you'll lay your hands on them and demons will come out of them because it'll be me in you continuing my same work foreign notice this title of condescension the man whose name is the branch he shall grow wow as I said I keep repeating it but you can say by God has such a hard time dealing with human beings because they feel like they can't go no farther they've reached the Utopia they're the ultimate if they're Society creatures I mean they are the society Elite you know if they're this oh I can go no farther I can but even he himself grew Luke 2 52 Jesus grew in wisdom and understanding before God Amen how many wants to be like Jesus now notice the attribute that Zechariah attributes to it now remember the parallel of the time what's going on here temple building time Temple dedication time and your Zechariah just speaks the word of the Lord and said now there's come in a man whose name is going to be the branch and he shall build the temple of the Lord so the thing was that Joshua and remember there was a Joshua doing this time for him not to Joshua and the days of Moses but this Joshua and that was also the high priest he was the one that had on the dirty garments and the angel of the Lord come and told him to to make him claim so God slid this prophecy right inside of there you can see why this sometimes people try to study the message of them and they totally Miss prophetic words and they say oh he left out a man here and he said this over there they don't even understand fall now you ever read the prophecy there in Isaiah whenever he talks about the mountain of the Lord and then you turn over to Micah chapter 4 verse 1 and read verses one two and three a lot of these people in the day we're living it would have considered them to be pleasuring one another's words because they were almost identical except when you come down to verse three so I guess they'd say that either Micah plagiarize Isaiah or Isaiah plagiarize Micah because they said the same thing that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost you see cerebral is now the builder of the temple and the temple building is going on and God just slides this prophetic word right in the middle of and they said the man's name he said branch is that zeruble is he the one he's talking about he's not going to build a house Made of Stone sheetrock but he's going to build a body he will build a temple of the Lord praise God aren't you glad we're part of it as we started building this structure several years ago two years ago I guess it was planned on it for two years before that and especially when we got into the sanctuary part and we needed people that could do this and do that and lay carpet and stain and build and you know build this beautiful piece of furniture brother John did that and brother Dave laid Stone you know and my brother Scotty and brother Dave Hunt run miles hundreds and hundreds of feet of wire all above your heads and everywhere seemed like every person every job you needed there was somebody there to be able to do it and that's the way it is in the body of God when we find our place and we'll all be synchronized together now cervable could not build a temple like this Solomon could not build a temple like this hold tight brother Branham could not build a temple like this Paul could not build it only the man whose name was the branch could build this house of God oh don't you love him you see the Divine architect who made such a beautiful world also had in his mind another Temple which would be the house of God and he planned this Divine structure himself so everything is specified and pre-ordained and remember as it was in the days of Solomon that they took and they used The Cedars of Lebanon and they would get Craftsman from Tyree and they would get Craftsmen from different parts of the world and they hewed these stones out of the queries they're in different parts of the world and they brought them there to the Mount Moriah where Abraham was going to offer his son and there wasn't even the sound of a hammer in that building some of you come over here whenever this place was in the construction stage some days we couldn't even talk to one another yeah I want to use I would have to holler so much noise going on nail guns you know the Hammers I'm air compressors this going on that going on but can you imagine the house that Solomon built every stone was pre-cut some of this trim and some of this stuff here these brothers would go to the saw and cut it cut it long of course a good Trend man does and then he'd come back take a sixteenth off take another 16th off take an eight thought why because you want it too short you got a big long piece you'll ruin that thing if you take too much off at one time don't you know that's what God's doing to us we're saying well why don't he get that great big Sledgehammer just knock everything off if he did that to us it'd scare us to death some of us spiritually is about the size of that piano and when God gets done whether it's going to be about like this right here you can imagine if God took a sledgehammer and knocked you down that big of the Lord have mercy oh God don't don't fill all that of me away you're showing away my best Forest he said that ain't nothing but junk son That Ain't Nothing But Trash ain't never gonna weigh you down I'm Gonna Get You Down Under the right side you say you mean mother don't need the Lord may make me that small that's a great blessing if if you're made that small that means you're the only one that can fit that certain pot nobody else can take your place I I don't want to be jealous of preachers I've never been gentle so preacher I'm not a great preacher I know that I'll never will be too old for that but now but you know what there ain't a man in this message that can take my place they're in a singer in this message that can take your place and don't you come here and say well nobody knows me I'm not media if God placed you in our assembly you are needed and nobody can take your place you need to assume that responsibility say Lord I'm gonna be there every time I can [Applause] oh you see what he does he collects the material he'll take a Rahab or tomorrow he'll take a Bathsheba he'll take a ruse he'll take an eve a Mary a Sarah a Rebecca Hallelujah he'll put him together you make one an evangelist fiery evangelist not brother Daryl he'll make another evangelist like brother John and brother Johnson coming up here and brother Joel Brown different ministers around the world that he's made called them in different ways give them diversities of give set them inside the body they just find that spot and be what God wants them to be don't be jealous of one another well I don't get to appreciable once every now and then well maybe he'll once every now and then pressure that ain't everybody in our brother that can preach three times a week let me tell you that right now and then everybody just called to be a convention speaker and some that Don't Preach convincing so jealous of those who are you ought to walk in that man's shoes and feel the burden that he feels and not change your desire to want to preach a convention but we can only be what God has made us [Music] you see these Stones right here these Stones right here a great Craftsman laid to him a man right there every Mason has his own style I started laying this one over here I said well Dave I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to finish it he said brother it'll be right there waiting on you I ain't finishing it you know why every Craftsman ever Mason has his own style and if you had an eye for masonry you would see where brother Dave stopped and where I started unless he mimics my style or I mimic his so brother Dave started this he finished it brother Dave started that he finished it I started that I finished it the Lord Jesus started you he's going to finish him the Lord Jesus started his church he's going to finish it it ain't going to him started me finishing this man no sir and the devil is not going to destroy it my machine set right there for days on end full of stone full of maul of my two but I couldn't come back because I had to do pastoral Duty really I am passed on because I'm laying Stones too and that they would not touch I said Cornell no I ain't doing that that's yours well that's the way it is with our working god brother Daryl can't take my place I can't take his you can't take somebody else's and nobody else can take yours that there's people better than me oh yeah I understand I'll say the same thing even if they are better the Lord God ordained me to fit that certain spot there ain't another Stone out there in the world that can take my place or yours foreign so the Lord God collects his material he won't buy some Honky Tonks you walk by some cold denominational churches you walk by some pig pens he won't buy all kinds of things collecting material praise God what by one damn found a little boy packing water to a moonshine still and the Lord said it's time to wake him up of a deposit I've got to work for him so he appears on the top of that tree and that little boy drops that bucket of water and heads out they're scared to death what's God doing getting ready to collect the material you see God may take a Mighty Man a great prophet of God and use him to reach the entire world and him influence millions of people's lives and God may take one of you and you'll lead one to the Lord it may be your son or your daughter and you think I've never done anything for God what that one's soul is worth millions of Worlds don't you never say you've never done nothing for God you household saying well I ain't no preacher I ain't never prophesied I ain't never done nothing like that but you've been a good wife haven't you you've been a good mother you've well brother Donnie I made mistakes sure like all the rest of us half that you serve God with all of your heart you'd be a good housewife you'll be a good mother you'll be a good preacher's wife whatever it is and I'll tell you one thing when that preacher stands before the Lord God that day you'll stand right there with him and all the world the saints of God will bear witness that you've stood with that servant of God oh oh children notice this and God's provided place of worship for prophet speaking about this living stones a new creation not to a denomination but to the word your creation of the word because the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God and upon this comes Stone upon Stone any change I've stood there at the Pyramids of Giza I've stood at the step pyramid I've stood at those pyramids of Egypt and they stand there and you look at those massive stones and think how did they do it how did they do it and of course what we see now is a far cry from what it was because they said it was actually covered in a white limestone so the whole outside was slick and Polished white limestone and that that sun shining down on that it must have been absolutely incredible it still is to this day when you walk up and see such a thing but I'll tell you one thing I'm looking tonight it's something that's even more incredible oh it's amazing to stand there as I told you a few years ago whenever Carol and I stood there in Jerusalem and see some of those stones and I just saw a video the other day of another one where they'd found and that dug that thing down one stone 40 feet long brother Jerry one stone hewn out around Jerusalem there somewhere and they took some type of chisels or something and cut like a Roman OG sign in that stone all the way around four inch perimeter on the top and the sides and the bottom and you've got that thing about seven feet tall and about seven feet wide and 40 feet long one stone not poured concrete one stone then you've got others it's about like this then you've got people like me that's Splinter Stone I guess but as long as I'm a stone I'm going to come out punching look out devil here I come I ain't worried about my size I just want to make sure I come from the man whose name is the branch I'm one part of the rock Kingdom so guess what I'm going to do I'm on a beat I'm on a thrash I'm gonna whip up on the devil as long as I've got a chance and an opportunity anybody with me tonight I don't have to be as big as brother Ron Spencer I don't have to do what brother Tim does that's not who I am my name is Donnie in case you all forgot it my last name is Reagan in case you forgot it and I'm going to chew on that devil I'm going to kick him I'm going to stomp him I'm going to do whatever I can do to make hell pay well praise the Lord you young people quit comparing yourself to this man or that man or that young man he's my idol don't make any person your idol make the Lord Jesus the one you look to understand Hallelujah Hallelujah oh don't you love him tonight thank God for his grace to us praise the Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight mighty God hallelujah hallelujah you understand friends we're in that transition between the coming of the son of man and that advent when he will take away his bride what's been going on now for two thousand years it was under the dispensation of the Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost why Son of God God is a spirit what does son of man mean son or been of a man what is holy ghost son of God God himself condescending in a form of sonship for two thousand years seven Church ages under that reign of Son of God building an invisible Kingdom in the hearts of his people and then right down on the end time before the opening of the seals he slips down as a revealing of the son of man praise God now remember that prophetic Ministry ended the man but the son of man Christ Jesus is still here I hope you don't get mad at me if you do I don't really care because it's the truth anyhow that Pillar of Fire is still here that Lord Jesus is still here he's out here with us tonight he's with his people all over the whole world he is here when he leaves we leave with him praise God so what's he doing polishing the stones getting everything ready for this great body you see John saw it coming down but he's looking at the end of the of the Feast of Tabernacles the Millennium and odd John saw the holy city in the New Jerusalem descending from God out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her husband but Paul says this one is going up what is it it's the Pyramid of God faith virtue knowledge Temperance all that down through the church ages God building a building and what's he going to do in the resurrection he's going to resurrect this entire pyramid and take it up in the first resurrection and then whenever he comes back and we set upon the Earth in the Millennium Reign and the temple will be rebuilt in Jerusalem and the law will go forth the Torah will go forth from Jerusalem Micah 4 1-3 and War will it set upon the Mount of God Mount Zion oh praise the Lord then the spiritual pyramid of the body the bride will come right back down and set down where on Jerusalem thank you Lord Jesus don't you understand there's no way for you to lose your winners praise be to God that's about our head shall we anyone not to be remembered tonight as we pray anything that just hindering in your life you walk you just don't have the victory that you want to have or something besetting you or something bothering you maybe a sickness in your body or whatever it is you just need strength you just think brother Donnie that rung true to me tonight that's scripture about the devil wearing out the Saints I got to be honest friends I feel wore out sometimes just dealing with life you just feel so worn out what's that mean you're going to quit goodness no you ever work real hard in the day especially when it's hot and the heat just takes it out of him you've sweated and you've sweated and you've drank and tried to intake your fluid level and all of that and you just feel so worn out at the end of the day and what are you looking for you're looking to go home that don't mean you ain't never coming back again you're just longing for the end of the day this is what we feel is the bride it ain't that we're quitting that ain't we're going back to the world my goodness why in the world but I want to go back to that hog slop that old mess of the world I'm just getting tired at the end of the day I'm weary I'm hot I'm sweaty as it was Brother Louie just tiring your hands are feeble as the Bible says lift up the hands that are feeble that hang down your spirit gets Weir your mind gets weary sometimes you can develop a weary attitude but that don't mean we're ready to quit just means we're ready to go home but maybe we might need a little bit of recharge it tonight home might be tomorrow for some of you it might be tomorrow for me but if it ain't till next week or next month I don't know when it'll be but I want to be ready and I want to stay energized you think that little Energizer battery is something my goodness you and I ought to be way more in that little energized bunny you've seen it you know what I'm talking about they put them little batteries in that little guy and he goes down there beating that drum we ought to be even way more than that is because we've got the original Energizer the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's just pray can we not only those in the visible audience but those that are streaming Wherever You Are Tonight Heavenly Father we're just praying tonight for your strength and your grace Lord is Zechariah prophesied in those days and we know from the story of Ezra and the stories thereof during that time frame that they were dealing with such opposition and such difficulty to build the wall and to build the foundations of the house and and to bring it all up it was one battle after another after another and Lord we should not be confounded when we look around and say why is it such a struggle why is there such a battle Satan is always hated the construction of the house of God we know what a time we've had just building this natural building trying to meet this requirement and that requirement and this stipulation and that stipulation just to be able to get in here just the natural side how much more that spiritual dwelling of the house of God then Satan will try to discourage he'll try to wear us out as it were oh but Jesus we pray tonight you'd come this way Lord visit us in a special way with your presence father may you bring encouragement tonight Lord maybe to every preacher Lord every deacon Lord some of these brothers and sisters have contributed so much of their strength and their time father many of these brothers have come and worked in the Midnight Hour donated their time took time away from their wives and their children themselves to be able to make this all work together some come early but the crack of dawn oh I pray you'd bless every one of them Father bless every one of them some Lord maybe they don't have any ability like that but they've donated and donated Lord people that streamed the services even though many of them know they'll never be able to set a foot in this service but they have sent thousands and thousands of dollars because they believe this is the work of God and they want to be identified and supporting where they get their food I pray you bless every one of them Lord God oh Jesus would you come father and just strengthen your people I don't devil would like to wear us out he'd like to wear me out Lord he'd like to wear brother Daryl out he'd like to wear out Brother Louie he'd like to wear us out as far as it's getting weary no wonder the Bible tells us be not weary and will do it father I don't care what you want me to be I don't want to be big I don't want to be important I'm not gifted like a lot of men are but whatever you can use me for Jesus maybe I've got a tiny little spot in the Kingdom some of them Stones I put in that column over there I can still remember the size of them an inch and a quarter by two and a half and some of the brothers cutting them for me so I wouldn't have to get down and they would cut them and throw them up to me and I'd stick them in and I'd call out the measurement make me a three and a half by an eight and a half or make me this and that brother Dave did the same thing because we had something in her mind and them little stones are important they fill a spot Lord God May ever Stone in this building tonight realize we don't need to compare ourselves to somebody else what we need to do is compare ourselves to your vision of our life if you want me to be a little stoned I'm perfectly fine with that but Lord God help my life to match your vision of me I don't want to be one inch bigger or one inch smaller I want to be exacted to declared Dimensions that you thought of me before the foundation of the world because there's one thing I want to hear when Carol and I walk before you that day and I grab her by the arm and we walk down and we stand before you Lord Jesus we're not going to stand there at the white Throne judgment but rather we will stand there at the rewards when we stand there that day arm and arm Lord God I want to hear these words well done my good and faithful servant I'm not looking for accolades of Praise I'm not looking for greatness and that and the other just let me hear those words then father it will be worse at all everything we've ever won went through to hear those great precious words anyone else feel that way tonight would you just raise your hand Lord God say that about me Hallelujah oh Jesus don't let us miss it Lord let us be faithful to the very end whatever you've contributed to us we might be the little boy that has the lunch with a few Fish and Loaves in his hands it was good for a lunch a little boy that skipped school but in the hands of Jesus it could feed five thousand maybe my little ambition my little gift my this set the other if I keep it and do what I want to with it not never amount to Nothing in life but if I can surrender to you Lord God it can affect people around the world brother Daryl that people probably thought raised up with him while he'll never amount to nothing oh Ward boy you know them Awards come from over North Carolina and probably just you know hang around and become this and that and the other and yet Lord God you've given him a Ministry that has touched people around the world Lord God there's people alive tonight that's been healed from cancer people alive that growths have fell off their body that he's prayed for people alive heavenly father of great things that you've given to him Lord we thank you tonight that we have been blessed to be associated with such a man oh Lord I pray you'd help each of us to be able to do what you've called us to do Lord God granted I pray father in the name of Jesus oh we worship you tonight father Hallelujah how many wants to do something for Jesus Jesus used me oh Lord don't refuse me let's just be our song As we sing it together before we go oh Hallelujah Use Me Lord brother Donnie you're getting out in your last years I I realize that you think I don't know that I'll look at this ugly face in the mirror every day I realize I ain't the young man I used to be I ain't the young man I was when I first come here those years ago but I'm going to keep on pressing and doing everything I can I may not have the strength I pray I have more wisdom I pray I've got a little something more of something to be able to give out I want to give it till I ain't got no more to give don't you how

that's been said for over 2,000 years now that early church when they saw you ascend up on the Mount of Ascension no doubt they went around telling everybody it may not be but a week or maybe a month or maybe a year he'll be back that generation passed the Next Generation started believing the same thing and the next and the next and the next here we are 2,000 years later and we're believing the same thing but Lord God We Believe by prophecy and the things that we can see in your word that there has never been a generation that's as close as we are therefore father the sincere Cry of our heart is we want to be ready above everything in our life so this is one of the reasons that we come together tonight your Prophet has told us that when we come to church we come to be told about our wrongs our shortcomings where we mess up I realize that's unusual because a lot of folks don't go to church for that reason anymore more but we do we want to know where we're wrong so we can fix it we want to know what we can do to be a people that's better pleasing to you we ask tonight that you would take your word and speak to us father help me to get out of the way anoint me anoint the people that we can be able to make this service what you want it to be help us to realize that you are not going to commend this service tonight and take over the preacher and take over the leoty take over the musicians take over the singers and you're just going to do it all you will use us but you want our effort amen father I want to present everything I am to you tonight May the people give their amens may they give their praise the Lords may they give their pullings on the gift tonight father so that this service can be something of Eternal value in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen praise the Lord ain't God good amen oh he is so good praise the Lord Revelation chap 10 verse one question and answers tomorrow night at 7:00 we got some really good questions to look at by the help of the Lord also be streaming that for those of you old people that can come to the young people's service so I tell you that've been a blessing not only to the youths but I've heard from people all over the world that just really enjoying him and benefiting that's that's wonderful that's why we do it Revelation 10 verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and notice all these verses are filled with symbolisms so it's not real plain it's hid behind types and an types and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven now this is a sworn affidavit and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the people of God said amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated Read With Me Now from The Book of Ruth chapter 4 verse 9 and Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was elik all that was chilion and maon of the hand of Naomi moreover Ruth the moabitas the wife of mean have I purchased to be my wife now remember this is kinsman redeemer that we're talking about to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren I want you to notice these next words and from the Gate of his place I want you to see that his emphasis is to raise up the inheritance of Maan Maan had died without seed so the leverate marriage was that the next of Ken and the family would take this Widow and marry the Widow and the firstborn would bear the name of Malon he would also get a double portion of the inheritance now Boaz is willing to do this this is going to cost him a great deal Boaz is a wealthy man so he will have to take of his own inheritance in order to bring this to pass if he follows through with this now watch what he says that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren and from the Gate of of his place from the Gate of his place this is taking place at Bethlehem why Bethlehem Bethlehem was the headquarters or the seat of the government of the place where their possession was so he could not go to another city in a nearby City and be able to make this legal transaction at the gate at another town so it must be the gate by which maon chilion and their father on The Inheritance so where was Naomi's inheritance under the jurisdiction of Bethlehem which is what house of God's bread now I want you to realize how that he emphasizes the inheritance and he also emphasizes the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day so he goes before the Elders of the little town of bethelem because this is the Gate of the jurisdiction of The Inheritance that he's going to purchase now I want you to I want you to think with me tonight that the Bible tells us about the Lord Jesus that when he come to the Earth and when he died and gave his life that he suffered without the gate now there's two places in Israel that they attribute could be Calvary one is called Gordon's Calvary and then the other we went there five or six years ago whenever we were there and it's near the bus station and it actually looks like a place of a skull because of the formation of the Rocks it's not the traditional one that most of them accept as Calvary which probably pretty well tells you that's the right one uh you know every other place that the church recognized which if you're not familiar with it it was actually Constantine's mother the Roman emperor Constantine it was his mother that went to Israel and begin to search for all the so-called holy places and after she found them by tradition then she set up want to build a church here you know Monastery whatever more here there and there so there is places that are accepted by the religious world that are that and then there's other places which was passed down by the tradition of some of the apostolic fathers which is the one I tend to follow so Calvary is the same way actually two places of the garden tomb to places of Calvary but whenever you look at it and you realize that one of them is outside of the city gate now one thing that a lot of Christians do not understand is that the Lord Jesus at Calvary he purchased and paid the price so that the book of redemption could be taken but he did not take it at Calvary the book was was not there I know emphasize to you again Wednesday night I want to emphasize it again tonight that the book was not there he could not take the book at Calvary he had to wait until he became righteous again I know that's staggering and I know it's mindboggling but think about it he could not have taken the book of redemption at the cross he had to wait till he was righteous again you understand because at the cross he died the death not of a righteous man but of a sinner not because of what he did but of what he become so he could not become a curse in the eyes of God and walk up before the Throne of God and take the book out of God's hand so the book was not at the cross I'm afraid even some of our message Brothers do not comprehend this is why they don't preach the opening of the seals this is why they see no significance brother Joe of talking about the Thunders in the book and it being our inheritance this is why even in our own ranks they still are emphasizing only at the cross itself and remember we can never have the book without the cross but we can never get our inheritance without both so the cross paved the way by which the lamb could take the book which he could not do at Calvary because he became our sin he who knew no sin became our sin that we might become the very righteousness of God so he could not be a sinner son at the same time no more than you and I could so he forfeited his rights to sunship listen to it forsaking all Phoenix 1962 In The Garden of Gethsemane the anointing left him and he had to die on the cross a curse in the eyes of God so the book could not be taken he had to wait till he returned to that state of righteousness again so it must be the consignment and the full operation of redemption had to be back at the Gate of his city which was not Jerusalem so where must Jesus take the book it must be Hallelujah it must be back at his City Boaz had to make this legal contract of marriage where at the Gate of the city of Beth elim Beth elim which was whose City milon's City so it must be reconciliation and Redemption to make it legal it must been acted upon by Boaz in the front of witnesses at milon's City Gate the Lord Jesus could not take the book outside of Jerusalem's gate he could pay the price and as Paul tells us that he suffered without the gate but remember the book and the marriage of redemption and the reconciliation of all of those attributes that was in God's mind had to be witnessed at the Gate of his City not natural Jerusalem so what was the gate of the city of the Lamb of God the New Jerusalem so the reconciliation the price certainly was paid at Calvary and there the blood the subaryanto and she comes before him no doubt as was her custom and she would fall down before him to take him by the legs and simply Embrace him around the legs and he said touch me not don't you touch me I have not yet ascended to my God and your God I have not ascended up but after he goes up and then comes back when he meets with his brothers he tells them touch me handle me see I'm I'm like you I'm like you only in a glorified form now what had happened in between the time that he told Mary not to touch him and when Thomas said I will not believe until I thrust my hand in his side and until I put my fingers in the prince in his hand and when Jesus comes he said oh hail touch me Thomas so the blood the high priest had now taken the blood before the mercy seat which is before the Eternal and offered the blood as an Aton for every person's name who was in the Lamb's Personal Diary he is offered before the father because the sacrifice of the high priest's body could not be tainted by Humanity but once the sacrifice has been made then he comes back he eats with his brothers they handle him they sit down and eat and they no doubt they touch him and they rub him and oh Jesus we love you so much but now it could be done because he was righteous again oh glory to God don't you understand he had to become in an unrighteous State he forfeited all of that and kicked off his shoe of dignity he kicked off his resplendant glory he kicked off all of that to take upon him our sin our Darkness our wretchedness and become oh oh my everything that we needed he became that and then when he did he must finalize this contract before the Gate of his City you see had Boaz went to a city in Ephraim had he went to a another city this contract with Ruth would not have been binding but it was binding only if the kinsman redeemer went to the city where the inheritance laid praise be to God can't you understand why didn't go down to Hell and get the book cuz the devil didn't have the book and your inheritance was not in Hell well praise be to God you had nothing in Hell brother Donnie ain't you scared of going to hell I didn't come from hell I ain't going to hell come on somebody I am from the mind of God and that's where I'm going back to no sir there's nothing about hell that sounds like home to me I don't cry when I your preachers preach about hell but I sure do cry when I hear them preach about heaven I I do cry when I hear singers sing about heaven because that sounds like home to me I ain't worried about going to hell I didn't come from there there's nothing about me that lines up with hell I was only the under the influence of that for a short time in my life but those days are gone and my king rose up and he went before the Gate of our city where our inheritance lay and before Witnesses he said let it be known this day I have redeemed my predestinated bride every thought that was in my mind let it be known that I have redeemed her she is my wife and in every one of them in their season they will come to me I don't care how darkness in I don't care how lost and sin they are I'll get them if I've got to knock them in the head I'll get them if I've got to break the leg I'll do whatever I got to do I declare It In The City Gate she is mine Satan take your hand off of my wife notice he says moreover Ruth and mo is the wife of meon if I purchased to be my wife to raise up the name name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren from the gate from the Gate of his place from the Gate of his place so when we look in Revelation five then we see the book in the hands of the great Creator which come back from the hands of Adam there it had been for all these thousands of years waiting for what a kinsman redeemer a goel one that would be able to pay the price then come back through the city gate and be able to walk up before the Throne of God and be able to reach force and take that book and be able to say I did it and it must be one without fault it must be one without blame don't you understand why I could not do that at the cross the book was not at the cross what was at the cross was the altar it was the altar by which the precious blood must be spilled on the altar but Revelation five was calling for what let one can come to take the book and what did John see he saw one proceed forth out of the Throne of God it was a lamb having been slain notice been rest restored back to the place of righteousness John did not see a sinner John did not see a serpent I wish somebody would preach with me tonight John did not see an unrighteous person standing there or a man who took the sin of the world but John said a lamb come amen a lamb come and took that book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he did the witness is fell down oh glory to God what was it he walked back through the gate of the city where your inheritance like let me tell you tonight Church your inheritance ain't in Johnson City it's not in the United States it's not in an America it's not in Canada your inheritance was in heaven and the Lord Jesus walked right through the gate and said I have completed the task I have paid the price now I want my bride book I want my bride's [Applause] inheritance oh praise the Lord and I I think that we as a people of God and we could ever come to this simple realization we do not belong to ourselves praise the Lord but we belong to him because he purchases read with me in 1 Corinthians 6:20 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are yours y'all don't believe that they're yours but why do we claim them why do we act like they're ours why do we act like that we are the B B of our body if I want to look this way do this say that act this way I'm going to do it and ain't nobody going to tell me what to do now you're acting like you're the boss now you're acting like you own you but you don't own you not if you're bride now now if you're L to seea and foolish virgins and you know whatever more then yeah go ahead but if we're bride we are not our own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God 7: 23 ye are bought with a price be not ye the Servants of men are you realize how much easier that we could all make our lives as Christians and brothers and sisters in serving the lord if we would come to that realization and keep it before us every day of Our Lives because a lot of our battles in serving the lord has to do with procession rights of who really owns us and if the Lord then orchestrates something in our life that we don't understand and we have a hard time then what do a lot of people do they want to assert well I don't understand why you did this why would you do this to me this is not fair this is not right this is you know on and on and on we go and why do we do that is because we've not fully committed yet to this aspect right here that we do not belong to ourself we are owned by almighty God he bought us he paid for us he done everything that was needed and we are his property so if he wants to raise us up he can do it if he wants to push us down he can if he wants to heal us he can if he wants to let us go by the way of the Grave he can do that and we shouldn't say anything but that's the part we struggle with notice this the prophet goes on to say man is not a property of the church neither is man a property of the state but man is property of God Sons and Daughters of God we belong to him because we are bought with a price and what a precious price the Son of God now we are bought but think of it now unlike things that you would buy with your money uh we are bought with something that is not separate from what we actually are now let me let me make sure you understand it that in order to have a currency which would be spendable for a soul God must have a currency which would be able to be used in a way in the Bank of Heaven I've told you in traveling around the world and all and many places I go I don't necessarily need to change money but in some places they won't take the US dollar and some places they won't take a credit card so you will change it say in Israel you change it to shekels and and uh in China you change it to a different in Zimbabwe you change it to Zim which is Zimbabwe dollars and you change it to different places and then they will always of course exact a usually amount out of that for you so you walk in there you may have $5,000 in your pocket but they say oh no we don't take US Dollars well if you've got a need then you've got to change something in order to be able to get what you need God had a need for his attributes to be expressed and the bank of Heaven would not take sinful dollars it would not take Zimbabwe sinful dollars American sinful dollars we'd say so God had to create a currency that would be able to be acknowledged by the individuals on the earth and they would have to accept it and then it would also be honored in the Bank Of Heaven by which the recipients of that currency could be released from their debt y all follow me tonight now he knew we could not do it on our own so we don't work for it we don't go out and work a week's wages and God said well if you do this and this and this and I'll give you this much and then you can trade that in for your salvation no I don't work for one ounce of my salvation it's a free gift from almighty God but I work after I'm saved because I love him so God gave me then and you this currency which the bank of Heaven is the only currency that it will recognize it will not recognize denominational currency it won't recognize your Works your good efforts all of that nope it will not work at all so God himself must change himself into a currency which will be accepted back by his own bank so what did he do he con and sined into this low State and he changed himself in currency so he paid himself in Son of God form he paid himself Spirit form with this currency of sunship that's the way the reconciliation price was made God paid it in the form of sunship everybody follow me the form of sunship was the condescended act of God by which he would use so the spirit as John saw it he saw a lamb come out of the Throne of God not another God but it was the same God in a form which was accepted so then when you and I receive that in the fullness of its atonement then we need salvation okay but there's the currency you need healing well there's the currency to pay for well whenever we go on then those who receive the fullness of the word they're going to need a body change well you know what you've already got the currency living inside of you right now it's already there every time you get a Divine Healing that is a little bit of a miniature body change in you right then every miracle that we've seen happen in our church it's a little it's a little small but very very significant a very small form or down payment of the body change every Divine Healing that God does every day we live by this currency that he's given us aren't you grateful and think of it we were poor lost wretched Sinners but he loved us so much and he settled it at the gate now the price was paid to Calvary but he must come back into his own gate of his own City and be able to take now the book and let there be Witnesses now according to Jewish law there had to be at least 10 but he wanted to double that times four and then he would have 24 Witnesses 12 from the Old Testament 12 from the new and there they were in theophanic appearance and they stood there when he walks up before the Throne of God and takes the book and then everybody starts falling down and worshiping God and praising God blessed art thou because thou has redeemed us to God by thy blood and out of every Kindred and tongue and nation and people and thou Hast made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth what are they doing they're having this great time of rejoicing in the gate of the city just like they did with Boaz so when Boaz comes up and takes the price and he exchanges the currency over to Toad and to admits it and to has to go ahead and take his shoe off and hand it over to Boaz and as a said sometimes it would just be the seller doing it sometimes it would be the seller and the buyer and whenever he took his shoe off that signified I will no more set my foot on your property that's exactly what we need to tell the devil tonight too the devil bothering you with high blood pressure the devil bothering you with back pain or kidney stones or whatever it is you're going through you need to remind the Devil he's one barefooted devil and he better not be walking on your property because you'll have spiked Nails stuck up on the perimeter so devil if you want to come on come on come on if you want to walk out our property but remember you're barefooted and we're going to remind you you're walking on our property and our signs are posted everywhere no trespassing and we have fouly in the court of God's Judiciary and if we get sick and if I ain't got enough Faith to make this thing leave me I'm going to go before the Elders of the church and they're going to pray for me and they're going to set me free by the power of God oh you say brother Donny that's a big mouthful it is and let me add another mouthful with it the prophet said the army of the devil put sickness on you and the army of God takes it off we're not here to play with the devil we're not here to play church I don't know about you tonight I've come to have real church I've come to lay hands on the sick I've come to lay hands on those that are bound and watch them walk up here bound but watch them walk away free by the power of God why because it was settled in the gate of the city our Boaz went Before the Throne of God and took the book of our inheritance and the elders in heaven fell down before him and said Thou Art Worthy thou are worthy I'll say the same thing tonight he is worthy he is worthy oh Hallelujah that I've got everything I need right now in my soul for the rest of my journey for however long I live woo hallelujah hallelujah now watch this I love the way the goes into this about the life and the blood Rebecca and Isaac were blood relation cousins oh my and the Bride of Jesus Christ is blood relation to him a blood bought bride now you see this is another thing theologically where we differ with most of Christendom in the day that we live in that we know there was not enough chemistry in the body of the Lord Jesus always shed one drop for me and how is that impossible how is that possible rather there was not enough chemistry in his body to shed one drop that's the carnal mind that looks at still the natural side of the chemistry and the blood was so important but the cken is not the blood oh I know there's message preachers that preach contrary to that but the message preachers are wrong they're not preaching the message that's the problem they're not preaching the message the prophet tells us it was thought to be the chemistry of the blood but when the blood cell broke open it released what more chemistry the life the to token life the token life of God so all it would have been necessary my friends was for him to shed one drop of blood he didn't even have to shed out all the pints of blood that was in his body how many ever was there all he needed to do was one blood cell to be broke open that's where life started don't you understand it didn't start with five pints in Mary's womb it started with one cell when God created himself Lord have mercy when God created himself in a virgin womb you imagine he spoke and he followed the trajectory of his own word and he himself got inside her womb by the spoken word and it started from one blood cell which did not come from Mary and did not come from Joseph but it come from himself he deposited in a human bank that which would be necessary to pay the price for our sins Hallelujah if he would have shed one drop of blood only one drop that would have been enough power in that one drop to save all the billions of people that live on the face of the Earth if that accept it amen and when the blood cell started there then it was broke at Calvary what did it release Zoe so out of that tiny tiny droplet of his blood was released the godhead you don't see it yet no no you don't one day you will it'll turn you inside out when you do the word Theos Theos which is a Greek word for deity the godhead yeah I'll wait on that but once you see there's a part of God in you that was there before there was any molecules or time that's the redeemable part notice he says the life is in the blood and the life is in the church the Christian that's born again by the spirit of God that's the spirit of Life blood relation to Christ and the spirit of Christ is the blood of Christ leading a child of Christ The Seed of Abraham that's why they move peculiarly well Glory that's why the world think so strange of them so don't just think it's you uh-uh it's the blood of Jesus your blood relation to God Lord willing Sunday I want to speak to you on another right that God's give you like a little Prelude on it it's the right to be married to God thank you Lord it's as far as I'm going with it so don't try to pull it out of me but before he can make this transaction remember he want wants a legal marriage her husband is dead but there's still a claim on her she still has no inheritance and she's still going by that tile moabitas moabitas she needs to be changed from Roost the moabitas to roost the wife with boas amen if he can buy her and release her at the Gate of his City he will change her name forever notice this the prophet said he's absolutely legal defeated in every place now remember to's ride had to be forfeited and the Devil's right's got to be forfeited with a claim on you and I the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere I want you to listen now of this guy that goes around blows around blows around you know and he Huffs and he Puffs and he said I'm going to blow your house down and he blows and he Huffs and he Puffs and he's going to blow your house down but what you need to do is drag out your double gauge and say you puff one more time and I'm going to blow you away I've got double barrel was the Old Testament and the New Testament put together and I know how to use this thing so I'm giving you a warning oh you say Brother Don that sounds pretty far out it ain't far out at all the Bible tells us that if we'll submit oursel to God the devil will flee from us I think you know what it's time that we to go to reverse some of this fle instead of us running from the devil and the devil Boo and we jump back Boo and we jump back scared to death what in the world is the matter with us it ought to be us booing the devil it ought to be a boo devil boo high blood pressure boo you o toy and back thing boo get out of my way you ain't stopping me this is not who I am this is only a temporary setback I wasn't born to be a creature of time I was not born to remain sick I I Hallelujah to God I was not born to be down I was not born to be S I was born to be a Son of God I was born to have joy unspeakable fall and full of Glory in this life not the [Applause] Millennium the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere he's just a devil he's just a devil and the password I find that so unusual a password that's all he hasn't got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped oh Hallelujah yes sir he's whipped in sickness he's whipped in disappointments he's whipped in everything he's whipped in death come on somebody he's whipped in death he can't scare me he can't scare you and that's all he is is a big old Shadow a big old Shadow now let me show you tonight there's only one way way that Satan has got any legal right against you only one way as long as he's got an unconfessed sin something that you ought to have done or ought not have done you could anoint him with oil you can do anything you wish to he will not leave that's right he has a legal right to hold there this is the only way friends that Satan will not move if there's something in our life we should have done something in our life we shouldn't have done I can pray for you brother the D can pray for you every man of God can pray for you anoint you we can do all that we can jump and Shout around you we can March around Jericho Till There is no Jericho but he knows his rights on and he knows if there's any unconfessed sin and we're coming up for prayer he'll s right there and he'll laugh in my face while I'm praying for you he'll life in your face but if we can make everything right it'll be us doing the life now remember this is from a servant of God who cast out Devils by the thousands the fourth dimension was a realm that we knew very little about God sent prophets in different areas and they were like a window to the supernatural so it was like the wall into the fourth dimension would be like this we could see nothing we don't know if it's wide outside dark outside cars passing by we don't know we can't see anything but then every now then God would send a prophet and he would cut a hole out and God would place a prophetic gift in that wall of time and then we could look through the wall and say oh my oh look that look look at that look oh my oh wow oh oh my and then God would take that Prophet from the earth and the wall would go solid again then didn't send another and another and another but in the last days for whatever reason I mean God cut a picture window and kicked it out and exposed the devil and hear them Devils was they were being seen for the first time since to fall in the Garden of Eden the way they were showed now when Jesus so here he give us a little bit of you but for whatever reason God chose the last days he's going to expose that devil can you imagine a man standing in the platform and he hears these demons as they're talking he hears them as they are screaming can't you hear them he says they're saying keep them from believing keep them from believing so he are these demons in the fourth dimension faith is building in the service and he's sharing this conflict going on I said the angels of God are here and the demons are here and there's a great Warfare going on he said how will it end it will depend on what you believe so for the first time this big piece of glass opened up and we've got a a human being standing there said can you see that can you see that streak it went from this woman here on the platform that man back there the same thing it's a cancer he's screaming help me help me I've often wondering when them demons got back in hell that one that told on the other they must had the office fight ever was can you imagine they got down I said what in the work you do that for I was HD I thought I was head pretty good you I remember Hell is offest mess ever was remember what hell is built on division contention can you imagine what it's like in hell well look around here and you get a pretty good idea except it's a lot worse down there but imagine how can there ever be a kingdom so whether it's a kingdom a family or church or whatever it is and it's built upon splitting like like heaven was or it's built upon the personality of of another monarchy that wants to have a great trone and you imagine down there the darkness and the fussing the prophet said what causes war in the world is because those Spirits so the spirit of Russia hates the spirit of America and it's evident that the spirit of a lot of those in the UN hates the spirit on Israel come on somebody and they cannot stand that Spirit on Israel and they get jealous of one another and they hate one another and and for the first time since man had stepped out of the Garden of Eden were able to peer into that realm and hear what they're saying and the prophet said he'd go back to the motel room at night and your chains rattling all night long and them demons would come into his hotel room and their flesh would rub his flesh I don't mind telling you I'm glad I ain't made to deal with that sort of thing I wouldn't have to worry about too much of it cuz I'd pass out cold in the wedge I'd wake up sometime in the morning and say what happened what happened aren't you glad you don't Oh Brother Don I'm terrified I'm terrified don't tell me that don't worry God will never let you deal with what you cannot deal with but what did God do he put this big gigantic picture window but he didn't just let us go to see hell but as he was sitting in his bed and he kind of raised up and put his hands behind his bed thinking of that song I am Lonesome oh so lonesome like to look past the curtain of time would you like to see oh yes I believe it but help me so much and all of a sudden I felt myself leing my body and I looked over at my wife and I looked up above myself and there I was about 20 feet from my body and I looked and here come all of these people running it looked like millions of them and the sisters was the ones that got to him first all of them was that long beautiful hair hanging down their back long robes on screaming our precious brother our precious brother then Here Come Those young men long shaggy hair wow and they were screaming our precious brother our precious brother and they reached down and pick me up and set me up kind of high said why'd you do that you as a leader in life oh I I want to see Jesus me and Carol was telling about this week she said I wonder what what Erica and all them saints are up there doing I said I don't know honey I don't I don't know it's not like they have a schedule it's not like they have events that they have to attend and go to I said but can you imagine Carol what a place that sixth Dimension must be that it is a place of such happiness and Bliss that he said if I've died I want to see Jesus and the voice answered and said you can't see him now he's a little bit higher and that took care of it wow I mean you'd think you'd be so sad and so lonely I want to see Jesus I want to see Jesus but it's not that sixth Dimension has its own Comforts and he still a seen Jesus yet but he went to finding trying to find adjectives to describe the place and he said perfect million miles beyond that Sublime be beyond that I don't know if a word in the English language he said that would describe it other than you've arrived wonder why of all the I Paul was carried up I knew a man about 14 years ago when they're in the body they're out of the body I cannot tell but such a one was carried up into the third heavens and heard things that was not lawful for a man to utter so what it was that Paul experienced he couldn't even come back and tell his people why his time was not the Rapture age but God let our messenger one go over and be able to come back with some grapes amen praise the Lord come back and say I'll never be the same brother brandom again again I'll never be the same one and Not only was he able to peer into that realm and see all of that but also break into the Angelic realm not just the angels of God like Gabriel and W woodworm and all of those but your angel cuz you remember when he come back down and a few years after that translation in 1960 he said I was able to look over there that morning and I saw all of you all there that's why I feel so sorry for those who have took a stand against this message I feel so sorry for them may God help them to come back and realize no doubt some's cross the line you and I don't know who that is you got family members there pray for them that God God will help them to come to their senses think what God did to open up that sphere and be able to watch these demons and see them as he tells us in the church age book whenever he would go to Discerning and the spirit of God would move upon him and he would watch the countenance of their face change because he said Satan is afraid you see we never knew that he said Satan is afraid to be exposed and he said that will reflect on the countenance of the people so they'll go to acting really funny and behaving funny because that Spirit that's dominating their life or their faith or their body it'll become so apprehensive and so tore up and here what was it a window end the supernatural oh but how would he tell oh you're a Christian I know you're a Christian say okay now your higher sister is 28 Ines down from the crown up here down and I see that your high heels is under 2 Ines so you're good there and I see your dresses Y come on down past the the out about 3 in yeah you're good okay that wouldn't way tell him that's Christians but he said I see you're a Christian because it's light around you so he was reading demons he was reading Angels he was reading Christians by what pulsations of light or Darkness you see every one of us have an appearance every one of us have a story that story of your life is not just your mortality it is whether you are light or Darkness I want you to listen to this but I in your command tonight I come to represent your vicarious suffering as talking to the Lord Lord in prayer I in your command tonight I come to represent your vicarious suffering and death at Calvary who stripped and robbed Satan of every legal right he had he is only a bluff amen amen and he's exposed tonight amen can't you understand friends why he hates this message why is it that this message is hated so much it's unbelievable the small amount of percentage of the people on the Earth that even believe it and accept it why don't the infidels and the unbelievers and many of those that have turned and walked away why don't they fight the Bible the way they fight the message why don't they fight Catholicism which is killed millions of people right have y'all ever heard me teach you how to kill anybody have we ever martyred anyone here at our church do we do what the denominations has done why is this message hated so much because Satan knows if he can stop the men of God from preaching the message of the hour oh I know some of our compromising so-called message preachers they're reverting back to preaching the same Bible stories that's been preached for decades uhhuh and I'd like to remind you them same Bible stories preached under the light of the day gone by never did produce a Rapture and it won't produce one now unless we preach some same Bible stories under the anointing of Malachi 4 then we preach Daniel and the Lion's then it's under a different anointing we preach some of the same Bible stories Harry but we're preaching it under the anointing of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 and it will Usher in a change of the body because the anointing has changed it's no wonder Satan don't want the message preached pardon me just an update you'll never stop it never and Boaz the king of the Harvest the lord of the Harvest goes outside the gates calls the Elders of the city and makes a public testimony outside the gate all of you people took off a shoe and kicked it off before them at a testimony and said I this day have redeemed all of Naomi's lost Heritage and all of her possessions is mine this day let me just say it our government may turn against Israel and they will France may turn against Israel Britain may turn against Israel turkey has already cut off relations with them the UAE Saudi Arabia Egypt different ones of them are making threats And if every nation under Heaven turns against her who are they compared to he who rides on a white horse wo Oh Glory I'm talking about the Prince of Peace the bright and The Morning Star you see my King has power to split mountains my king Iran you know they think they got really really smart because they divided their nuclear capabilities and they've got part of them buried under this mountain in Iran and part of them buried under that mountain in Iran and this mountain in Iran and America is the only one that has a bomb that they think can even halfway penetrate that mountain and that is one that whenever they drop it it does not explode whenever it hits the ground but it actually goes and buries itself down in the mountain and then after it's down in there for how many ever hundreds of feet then it will explode and they hope that it will take care of Iran's nuclear stud but let me tell you one thing I ain't a hoping tonight I ain't a hoping that my Jesus has got enough power I've done red in the back of the Bible in the Book of Revelation I've done read at the end of the prophecy of the Old Testament I found where Zachariah said that he will stand there upon that mountain and when he does it will split and hide and you will run to me as you did in the days of AEL it will make a valley down through there and the king of kings and Lord Lords will come to get whever of them's alive of that 144,000 and he will stand there and all the bombs of the world won't stop it all the f35s and the F-22 and the machine guns and the Hand Grenade cuz you can't kill my Jesus no more the price has done been paid but once he paid the price he got back into the righteous form Hallelujah he entered back into the deity before and you better look out devil cuz he told John I am he that was dead but I am alive forever more I was dead but I won't die again I am the resurrection I am the life I am the Healer I'm the alpha Oh Glory to God I am the Omega I'm talking about your husband or says about 30 oh I just feel something moving he says notice Christ before the Elders of Israel LED outside the gates watch him now the purchase price was paid outside the gates made a testimony wounded for our transgressions whether stripes are healed a public testimony he redeemed the church from what a lost estate and the Garden of Eden we didn't have any sickness the Garden of Eden we had no sin the Garden of Eden we had no death God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and made a testimony outside the gate but let me just give you a little heads up for Sunday he was the only begotten son but he's not the only one now Hallelujah glory to God glory to God he redeemed man to everything he lost in the fall Christ restored it to him in the Kinsman redeemers ship when he died at Calvary your health your eternal life life everything you lost in the fall Christ redeems you to it he's your kinsman redeemer you with me yeah your health amen your strengths and everything you lost belongs back to you tonight through the Lord Jesus he became kin folk to take away sin and sickness he redeemed her back everything she had plucked off his shoe and made a public inside that all that come in and out might know that he had redeemed everything na only lost and he was in full possession what did Jesus do to do it he made a public testimony when Satan could not die for sins because he was The Sinner he's the father of sin but Jesus the innocent one God Of Heaven who didn't have to die come down and made a public testimony by dying lifted up between the heavens and the earth a public testimony stripped his clothes off of him and hung between the heavens and the Earth in shame and died a sinful shameful deaths can't you see why he couldn't take the book of Redemption on the cross he died the death of a sinner he had to wait till he was righteous again what did he do kicked off his own righteousness kicked off his own glory Lord have mercy and he asked you to give up cigarettes he asked you to give up something worldly and ungodly and we belly at and cry like it's something terrible can you imagine becoming from God it would have been what a transition to be come from God to man yes sir but to come from God to be a sinner I have power I could speak to my father and straight way had send me 20 Legions of angels but he kicked that off he laid God aside he laid aside all of his dignity everything aside and become a sinner and died for you and I you see how Satan here in the scripture tried to make him break God's plan to receive it give it to him when he took him up on the mountain and tried to give it to him without the purchase of the blood you want the Earth fine I own it you don't have to die a kingdom without a cal remember I preached that to you 32 years ago you don't have to die you want it I'll give it to you I'll gladly give it to you no Calvary no dying no cross no Thorns none of that none of that totally Escape every bit of it just bow to me and worship me that's all you got to do I'll give it to you oh but remember he was the word without the purchase of the blood notice Matthew for it again the devil taketh him into an exceeding high mountain can you imagine the devil having such power that by time travel he would be able to pick up the Lord Jesus from where he was and move it when the prophet reads this in the seal book he says what a creature and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and sayth unto him all these things will I give this that will fall down and worship me you imagine showed him all the kingdoms of world not the ghettos not the back alleys the Palaces the fine homes you want it no problem I'll give it to you I'll make a trade why cuz Satan wants to be worshiped so bad and there's nobody who wants to worship it any more than Theos deity don't you understand one child of God would mean more to him if they would bow on their knee and worship him than all of his own children because they are like him but if one son of God or one daughter of God will say Satan you're King you're God you're the great Creator he would have broke into to what he could never get to the godhead but don't hold your breath devil too long CU ain't none of them Theos kids ever going to do that then Jesus saith unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve let me close you a momentarily bit I want you to think of this before we close the Lord Jesus and raising Lazarus and those others in the New Testament that actually had died and he raised them from the dead but every one of them had to die again because even though they experienced a bodily resurrection that did not redeem them permanently from The Sting of death don't you understand tonight you're more blessed than Lazarus was if your soul has raised from the dead it can never die again the resurrection a resurrection from the dead that's phenomenal it's wonderful yes it is but a resurrection from the dead is not a full Redemption what happened to all them people that died in the New Testament raising from them dead every one of them died again what A peculiar feeling it must have been for Lazarus he died twice What A peculiar feeling it must have been for the Widow of name with her son and you know all these people that that that he raised in the dead so they done face death one thing he's raised up by them but because he did not redeem them from the curse of the law they had to face death twice but if you're sting here tonight with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you can never die oh but you say brother Donnie sister Erica died oh no she did not brother Donnie brother Jerry Phillips oh no he did not the coat that he lived in passed away the coat that Erica lived in passed away but Erica is alive and well she's more alive than she's everwhere brother Jim bad brother Jerry Phillips sister Naomi on and on and on we can name them here tonight they are not dead they are alive Hallelujah and can never never die again think of it as powerful as a resurrection is do you understand that people could get miracles in their body that don't mean that they'll have eternal life people could get healed in their body and still wind up being lost but if you're standing here tonight and your soul has been redeemed praise God that is the greatest of all miracles amen oh my don't you appreciate the Lord Jesus tonight amen let me read you this in the future home and then we'll close did you notice how Abraham when they tried to give him the land and he bought it with so many shekels of silver before the people as an inside as a witness let it be known this day I bought this bearing Place see purchase it Satan tried to give him the Lord Jesus the kingdom which belongs to him now he tried to give it to him as a gift you see the devil would love to give you as a gift to God as long as God don't fill you with the Holy Ghost God you want Jonathan you want Kirk you want Donnie you want all these women but sure you can have them sure I don't mind letting you have them they want to go to church fine let them get a religious par that's fine have no problem with that but God don't you get in them don't you get in them if you break that blood cell over their soul and you go in them God my chains are forever broken where would we be tonight were it not for his grace amen a hopeless case yeah I'm looking at hundreds of them here tonight let me finish this quote he tried to give it to him as a gift but he wouldn't receive it because see then Satan could still have a claim on it but it had to be bought that's why he wants to clear your deed Ruth to where you're released from the nature now remember when mean married her under the first nature in the type he married her as a moabitas which would have kept her out of the economy of God but she must be remarried to another man to be brought in to the tribes of Israel and that's why you must be be remarried again to another nature thank you Lord when you were born you was given a human name to that first nature and everything you done under that first nature was listed under that first name like ru some more about this go to church do all them good things but you don't get a new name just because you join church you've got to have another marriage so there's got to be a death to your first husband you see Boaz could not marry as long as Mayon was alive so her first husband had to be dead and if she could marry a prince in the land Maybe could not stand in the gates of the city he alienated himself across the border in the land of Moab Adam couldn't redeem us Moses couldn't take us back but there had to be a goel that was still in the land of inheritance and from the land itself he would project his love I find it to be amazing because historically they say that she was probably in her 30s and Boaz was in his 80s so that young woman married the Ancient of Days amen one of our brothers standing here tonight had a dream a while back about that Dimension he saw several people there saw brother Jim Babs he come running up to him he saw brother Cecil but it took him a little bit to recognize brother Cecil because him and brother Jimmy were the same age [Laughter] then in a little bit he saw Erica coming she come running and hollering to him praise the Lord after the visitation there and brother Jim bab took him and also Eric on the other side and telling them now you got to go back you got to go back friends they are alive tonight [Music] amen they are alive but they white nose don't you want to go hallelujah oh Jesus thank you you suffered without the gate to pay the price of redemption but thank you so much for going up before father God and offering your blood as the atonement by which we are redeemed Lord Jesus thank you Father we stand here tonight with gratitude in our hearts where would I be Lord where would we all be tonight no telling where I'd be if it wasn't for your grace be I turned Pentecost still running around preaching this that the other but your grace not only come to save me but you gave me more grace as you kept revealing your word thank you for this message of the end time I love it now more than I ever have I'm so grateful for it Lord dear Jesus we worship you tonight come Lord come for your Ru oh how nervous you must have been at the house waiting not sure what the outcome would be cuz she wasn't actually there before the elders when the transaction took place so to and made his claim and it seemed as if to had the upper hand but the Lord Jesus was not done yet oh what a day it must have been an awesome hour when her and Naomi got the message from the gate Boaz made the deal baz paid the price Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus we're waiting for that beckoning call for us to also be summoned up to the gate when we too hallelujah hallelujah your Prophet tells us something at shreport that he knows that we'll be looking around in that Resurrection so he lets us get get together first we'll be looking around to see if this one made it that one made it Carol asked me the other day how would that be how how could we if we didn't find our loved ones How Could That Be Heaven I said well I certainly don't have all the answers but I I don't see how we could enter into a marriage supper of the Lamb thinking a uncle didn't make it a sister didn't make it a niece didn't make it somehow he will erase that from our memory how could we enjoy eternity with that hanging over us but we'll all gather together I'm reminder of the dream that brother Ron Peterson had years ago and he was balling and crying like a baby when he told me about it he and I sitting there together and he said it's like the Resurrection The Rapture took place and the Lord Jesus was in the middle of all this throng of people and we all started worshiping and praising his name and the more we worshiped he started rising up out of that crowd and the more we praised the higher you Rose and the more we praise the higher you Rose and you Rose to where you were suspended in the heavens above us millions of us were praising and adoring Ing and worshiping you Lord Jesus I don't want to wait to that hour I want to do that every day of my life I want to lift you no telling how many people have used your name in vain today don't even

God for that this life is hard enough the way it is can you imagine having to walk alone without the Lord in your life without him being the guidepost and helping you through all the things of life I know I know people do it every day but I ain't one of them aren't you glad you ain't one of them I know people think it's small it's inferior when I was in China several years ago and preaching in those meetings there there were professors School teachers people of every occupation that you you can imagine and the type that the communist government thought would not search for God if you can educate them and give them this and that then that'll do away with the need of God yeah but I sat there and looked at them people and I thought there was still something in them even though they were professors teachers mathematicians and all of that but you can't satisfy the soul with mass amen you can't satis y it with algebra you can't satisfy it with money it's made to search for God when it's all said and done friends and when our heart is slowing down the blood pressure is dropping and we get ready to cross over all you own won't amount to nothing what you think you are won't amount to nothing what's going to really matter is you know him I'm glad I do don't you let's turn tonight to Matthew chapter 16 how are y'all we're well doing good doing good thanks for asking how he's happy to be in the house of the Lord ain't it wonderful to be a Christian just awesome to be a be a child of God Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 let's look tonight and see what we are a part of by the grace of the Lord the Lord Jesus saying these words and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church I will build my church now what is an organization an organization is a man-made system there are also many independent churches that are manmade churches yeah if Jesus don't build them they're not hisen now people can put his name on the sign that still don't mean he built that church because Jesus uses a particular type of material and this is the way you'll always know that Jesus founded whatever Church you're going to whatever one you're looking at or fellowshipping or whatever the traits of the Builder will be in there and you'll be able to identify it by its characteristics its traits its foundation and the building material that is used this is it Upon This Rock I will build my church so what was the rock of course The Rock was Revelation revelation of who he is not who he was so the churches of this day that are built by Jesus himself will be focusing on who and what he is in 2023 and shortly 2024 right so if they're built upon a memory of what he was 2,000 years ago that's not a church that Jesus Built right amen cuz Upon This Rock he said I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it acts 15 verse1 now some traits and characteristics of this church now a few years after Jesus starts building and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved now notice certain men don't call them Brethren just calls them men certain men came down from Judea and taught the Brethren yeah so here was some men that were not Brethren but they were teaching the Brethren how in the world did that happen so you got man that's not even born again and somehow the Brethren let them among them and start teaching them wow that ought to be a double wow we ought to take warning an't that amazing certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you speak in tongues you ain't got to hold holy ghost or except you run and Shout you're not the bride I see then it was circumcision but it's changed in every age and it's happening in our ranks as well that we're making new evidences of what the bride is we've had so many bride revivals I can't even keep up with them but let me tell you what the bride Revival won't be the bride's Revival will not be hacking and splicing and cutting the word or the message and putting it together to fit your idea it won't be that now of course they were saying this because this was such an important thing in that day and this day we don't even think nothing about it so the evidence will change but that Spirit never changed except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no SM small no small dissension and disputation with them wow so Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question now you see because the scarecrow has been so effective for thousands of years if we would try to do this today in our message people would start screaming denomination denomination denomination you know why the scarecrow has started scaring Eagles now this is the way the original Church operated and the devil put up a scarecrow of the name of denomination and they started pulling some of these things out of there and Satan knew it would scare the elect from the 3 Century right on down and it still scared them notice in verse three and being brought on their way by the church they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto all the Brethren and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and Elders wow Paul the prophet a church AG messenger had to be received by the church and by the apostles and the elders oh why didn't he get this attitude I don't care if y'all don't think I'm of God or not glory to God go on to Hell well that's the attitude a lot of the men message folks have I did say message folks not real Believers you see real message Believers know that brother bram's message is not something new on now it's a restoration to the original amen now you see a lot of message people do not believe that they can never believe a lot of the doctrines they do they could never stay home play tapes don't need preachers no more all that the reason they believe that is because they believe this message is something totally new and if you believe that tonight I pray to God you get the Holy Ghost before you leave this service cuz you ain't got it now cuz the Holy Ghost will never lead you to believe a lie because the prophet messenger come to return the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers and the church said and they declared all sa that God had done for them I me like to be remembered tonight as we pray sister Wendy Asher has an aunt that has a real need and they want this prayer cloth so just hold that request in your heart as well as you pray over what you have need of heavenly father we so love you tonight oh I'm so glad to be back in church I'm so thankful when you saved me you saved me to go to church you saved me to sing you saved me to worship you saved me to pray you saved me to live right you saved me to Rejoice you saved me from heaven and you saved me from hell I don't worry about being lost cuz I didn't come from there and I ain't going going there how grateful We Are Tonight Lord Jesus for your mercy father as we approach your word tonight we're asking for your help we're asking dear God that you'd help me to get out of the way help the people to be able to enter in the service Lord they've worked today many of them and no doubt they're tired and would your presence just come and catch us up Lord father I know there's several that's sick and couldn't be with us in service tonight we ask that You' be mindful of them Lord I have this prayer cost in my hand for sister Wendy's Aunt you know all about this need and request and we believe you father that you're going to move for dear God we desire to be with all of our hearts one of those churches that has been turned back to the apostolic faith help us I pray Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you you may be seated now I'm sure that you all believe already tonight that just because people say they are Apostolic does not mean that they are the original Apostolic anybody here ever belong to the UPC Church of God in Christ few of you Church of God in Christ one is Church of God the black side of that UPC thing probably nobody many of them claim to be Apostolic but basically what they preach is one God and they don't even have it correct and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus I was at a funeral some time ago of an Apostolic man a family member close to someone of mine and the preacher which was Apostolic of course got up and every way that he could he tried to bring in Acts 238 and uh speaking in tongues evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and preaching this guy's funeral but also trying to get forth his Apostolic Doctrine now many of those Apostolic preachers they they are specifically known for acts 238 and a lot of them turn into preachers that carry an Acts and 238s so that's all they know how to do with that scripture is fight with it and they will fight you and they will get angry and they will get upset and they have no mercy whatsoever for someone that maybe God has never opened their understanding to that so they take their Axe and cut their heads off and if there's anything left they pull out both 38s and finish them off with that and as I sat there listening to that man's funeral and I thought you know I knew the man well and knew the man was a good man loved God with all of his heart but yet this preacher saw it as an opportunity to be able to convey once again their so-called Apostolic Doctrine but I had talked to some of those people years before about the message ah mentioned predestination serpent SE some of the different doctrines that we know the apostles actually preached and what I found was that those Apostolic people wasn't Apostolic at all they were Apostolic denomination so because they baptized in jesus' name and because they preach the tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost and you shout and this and that then you're true Apostolic no you're just Apostolic by name but there is a true Apostolic people on the face of the Earth today so true Apostolic people are built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets so the true Apostolic people are those that can tie their original Roots back to the church in the book of Acts which was what Jesus started himself now Jesus said himself on this rock I will build my church now it may be kind of offensive a little bit but as I said earlier every church that's built on every Church Corner between here and Memphis and back is not built by the Lord Jesus because Jesus could go in there and start just preaching a little bit about his word we'll say he would start in the Book of John and he might say something like this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and many might come on down to verse 14 and say and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth some of them might make it to the end of that and say amen and then we might bring Jesus over to St John 10 when Jesus would say I and my father are one amen we might bring him over to where Phillip said so Lord show us the father and he said Phillip have I been with you so long and you don't know who I am if you see me you see the father well right there a bunch of the trinitarians would fall out of their Pew would they and yet they claim to be following Jesus well Jesus was actually the one who said that and then we come over to the first church AG messenger that was the foundation stone that God began to build a lot of these Revelations on what he gave him and he would say something like this for without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh just in the justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles who did God God then we might come to the book of Titus where he said Hing to and the coming of the day of God in that day when the Lord Jesus will come himself you mean calling Jesus God not one of them but him Jesus wasn't one of the Gods in heaven he was the only one and we might move over to the Book of Revelation when John was carried up and he said I saw one and I saw a throne not three but I saw one throne and he that sat upon the throne was to look upon as a Jasper and a Sardis Stone which was the birth stones of the tribes of Israel so I wonder how many churches in the tri cities that the Lord Jesus would Acclaim that he himself started that church and it would be identification that all would know because the building material that church is built upon so it's built upon the Revelation then of who Jesus is in this age and yet many of them will take people down to the water and they'll say in obedience to the Commandment of the Lord Jesus I baptize you in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost so in other words you spiritually baptize them into the Catholic Church well glory to God I thought y'all was Apostolic here tonight so I wonder then how many of them that Jesus would stand up and say I did not build my church upon the teaching that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost well there'd be some more that'd get mad at Jesus and then others that would say well you know I I believe once in Grace always in Grace and once you get saved as a matter of fact this I was going hunting this last week and on and one of the brothers just telling me that he had Hunted been around a guy up there where we were some time before this and the guy was cussing I mean cussing everything off the hinges and the brother asked him he said uh what do you do he said I'm a licensed ordained minister oh my goodness so I doubt Jesus would want to put his arm around that dude and call him buddy wouldn't you so you can imagine then one church after another after another the Lord Jesus J would say you are not mine I never built this church as a matter of fact this one was built by this organization or this man or this or that or the other this is not even my church my name is not here my Revelation is not what built you it was built out of Envy or Strife or whatever more this is not my church it's going to be surprising when we get to the end of the way and a lot of people stand before the Lord and they will stand there sinking you know that I've done this and that and the other and the Lord Jesus will look at them and I know some of the brothers right now don't like it whenever preachers will still preach on Matthew 24:24 but I've got to because I'm a Full Gospel preacher and I believe in healings and signs and wonders and miracles but by no means do I believe that the bride's only identification is the miraculous because there's going to be all kinds of people that's going to stand before the Lord and say we cast out Devils we raise the Dead We heal the sick in your name come on church and they will absolutely be anointed I heard the prophet say it today it is the true anointing of the Holy Ghost but they are anointed falsely to the word so you mean the spirit of God would come upon people and anoint them fall ly to the word so you don't judge them by their signs or their miracles or how much they jump or dance or shout but what you judge them by is the word that includes me that includes every other preacher that includes every one of us and the church said am so the church then that Jesus is going to come for in the last days is going to be an Apostolic Bible believing church now keep in mind that God did not send brother brandom in order to replace our Bible but to make our Bible more real to us is that right is that the way you believe it and understand it so he did not come to sim brother brandom so that people would formulate their doctrines outside of the context of scripture and they would come up with all kinds of strange ideas which of course is going to be in every age but he would come right back cuz when he would be on the curtain of time and he saw his people only didn't see Paul's did not see Luther's did not see Wesley's but he saw his only and whenever he reconciled and he told the angel said if Paul's group goes in mine will and then those thousands I heard him say it today that there was hundreds of thousands of those people looked like there could have been millions that was there and they screamed out we are resting on that and they said one day Jesus will come to you and you will be judged and if you are accepted and you will be then we will go in on your teaching so that would be totally impossible for us to go in on brother brandom's teaching unless he was a word Prophet praise the Lord so Paul didn't say one thing and brother Ram say something else now he might have said it in a Kentucky way where Paul said it in his way but it's still the word of God now whatever the Lord started forming this church he knew of course that there would be Seven Ages it would be spread over seven dispensations and there would be seven manifestations of the spirit of God in the Book of Revelation it would be called the seven spirits of God but it would be seven manifestations of the same spirit of God each one of them would be represented by a horn on the Beast and then there would be an eye in the horn now these were actually the horns were the power on the earth which protected the Lamb's rights so in the first church age there was a horn which was under the lion anointing and there was an eye in the horn oh you're trying to get deep brother Donnie no I'm not I just want you to know where you're identified and where every age has been so a horn come up on there and that was the church that was the true Acts 2 church then in that horn was an eye so the eye represented the sear or the dispensation of light that was given to them so he saw seven horns and then he saw seven eyes an eye in each horn so it was the messenger of that age so the eye of the age catches the mind of God looks into the script of God catches the word of the day pulls it down into the horn and then the horn gets under the manifestation of that word you following me of what their word is for their day cuz we didn't know what our word was the Ephesian people didn't know what their word was the Samarian people pergamos saus Sardis Philadelphia and leoda we didn't know what our word was and every Church age message if you notice in the Book of Revelation unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write notice who the letter is addressed to it's not addressed to the denominational headquarters it's not sent to a bunch of Bishops that's going to tell everybody what they can do and cannot do come on church say Amen but who is the letter sent to it is sent to the church M messenger the angel of God of that day he is the eye on the horn so the eye gets the message direct from God then the eye comes right down and projects it down to the horn and then the horn protects the Lamb's rights in that day now we're talking about the bride's rights but also the Lamb of God has rights this is one thing we're called to do we're not called to be passive we're not called to let the world do whatever they want to do and people just say whatever they want to say and let's just s around and hold our peace and and be real quiet Paul didn't believe that Paul and Barnabas did not have no small dissension and disputation with those that was teaching contrary to the word of God they confronted them and said you're not saying the truth well come on now children this is what we are called to do we are called to protect the Lamb's rights in this leot to sin age now everybody in this age one of the most important things to them is what their rights so the gay rights and the you know this rights and that's right well that's fine if that's what they want to do but the Lamb of God also has rights he has a right to have a church he has a right to have a church filled with the Holy Ghost a church built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets is that right and he's not going to send Gabriel down to protect those rights but he's going to have men of God under the same anointing that the eye brought it I don't want to just repeat what brother random said I don't want to just repeat it like a tap recorder but I want to have the same spirit of God he had I want to operate under the same thing that's what I love when he writes it down pick up your pen and write in the spoken words original see that the bride not only has the word but she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word it's evident friends a lot of churches and a lot of preachers around this message are missing the mind of Christ notice the seven seal he said whenever the mind of Christ comes in that is the supernatural element so people can come to the message but it does not mean they get the immediate oh my the immediate deposit of the mind of Christ just when you hand them a book if they do not have the mind of Christ they'll never know what God wants done by that word but if you receive the mind of Christ with the message itself then you know what he wants done it's evident some folks still don't know what he wants done they think he wants us to argue and debate and make this little kingdom and that little kingdom that's not what he wants done with the word he wants us as preachers to preach the word and produce word first and Obey them scriptures lay hands on the sick I know some of the preachers in the message they're fighting laying hands on the sick and they say we're Beyond it we don't need it no more I'll guarantee you one thing we've still got a lot of sick folks around here and I'm going to still keep on go brother Donnie brother brandom got to a place he never had no more Visions I want you to show me that in the message I'll tell you when brother brandom stop having visions when he move into the other dimension you want to tell me the prophet stopped praying for people people and the prophet start having prayer line I want you to show me that where he said that himself what did he do he was still ministering to the body right before he left the Earth and that's what every godall man is called to do cast out Devils lay hands on the sick praise the Lord now notice if here in the chapter 15 again verse 5 but there arose up a certain set wow of the Pharisees which believed wow so you mean they still kept their old name on Pharisees that believed I guess my question would be believed what how could you be a believer and still want to be called a Pharisee or a sad you see I think some of y'all are sad you that it was needful to circumcise them how could they believe how could they be word born Christians and still believe you had to be circumcised In the Flesh they had no Revelation that the Holy Ghost was the tool of circumcision in the New Testament they had no idea it was still to do with this right here amen that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the apostles and the elders came together for to consider of this matter now notice they did not consider it denominational at all when questions raised up for the preachers to get together and try to resolve some of these issues come on wonder why that's so foreign to us come on now wonder why that's so strange and we're Apostolic are we really I wonder I wonder how many Apostolic churches we actually have in the message we have a lot of message churches but I wonder if they're Apostolic message churches you hear what some of them is preaching you can understand they're a long way from the doctrine of the Apostles verse 22 then pleased it the apostles and Elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas wow so what if we hear there's some kind of Doctrine that's broke out wherever and then some of the brothers get together and say you know what we we all need to go to timbuck two we'll say we need to make a trip to timbuck too and we need to straighten out some of stuff cuz this is going to affect us all boy can you imagine what some of the message people say Lord have mercy brother Donnie and brother Daryl and Brother David S or this brother they're going to 10 Buck too and they told me that they're going over there to straighten out a bunch of stuff who in the world they think they are Lord we're going into denomination that's the way they done they did in the Bible you know what I just realized I'm I'm I might I might be in the wrong church tonight I mean I'm preaching to people that look just like you two weeks ago the last time I preached But now y'all are looking at me like you don't know me come on brother oh my goodness so they send these people now with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas her name barabus and Silas Chief men among the Brethren and they wrote Letters by them after this matter the apostles and elders and Brethren send greetings unto the Brethren which are in the Gentiles and Antioch and Syria and cissa for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us on now they went out from them but they went out without Authority you see this is the way God wanted to control Division and contention I wonder how many them guys when they heard Paul was in town shook like a leaf and the fall winds blowing they said Lord have mercy he's here oh good gracious I didn't realize h why because Paul said you think I've got this attitude they say oh his words are powerful but he's puny as we saying his body he said let him know that these same words I write when I get there I will have the same attitude sir you see that would have kind of helped Squatch down a lot of false Doctrine and a lot of false teachers why is it that all these things are breaking out around the world you know because the greatest most powerful Nation so-called in the world has a weak leader and Satan waits for weakness as Nations wait for weakness now watch for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words so they actually came out from under the apostles and the elders and then they started troubling the people sewing Discord and false Doctrine and whatever more uh with the word subverting your souls subverting subverting your souls and saying that's what it said today oh well you know we really think it's not necessary to no longer quote the prophet well of course we believe the message in secret but you know I I'm kind of thinking that maybe maybe we should start a TV program or something like that not against anybody wants to do all that sort of thing but you know if if we're going to have a TV broadcast and maybe a radio broadcast and we're going to do this and other or maybe we're going to do a lot of Outreach meetings well that's good nothing wrong with that either unless of course you have to compromise What You Preach well since we're going to do that it wouldn't be fitting to you know to mention anything about so I won't say it but you all will understand so from this point on I won't say seventh angel or any preachers that come into our church I'll mention to them and ask them not to read quotes of subverting their souls so you understand what some preachers now begin to do they began to cut off the light they're supposed to filter down into the soul of the horn the body the body is supposed to absorb the light as it comes through the eye and the revelation of the hour it sets their soul on fire by that word but of course if you become ashamed you think it was just a mistake to Paul wrote to Timothy and said don't be ashamed of me as his messenger there must have been something already moving among them what do we have to actually get up and say Paul I mean really he's got a pretty bad record you know this guy was a murderer can you imagine in that day now of course we pick up our Bible today and we read it as a holy word of God but in that day it was simply books or letters written by this man that was so strange and bizarre that he said he was carried up to the third heaven whoever heard of such a thing and he said women couldn't even preach my Lord what in the world's a matter with him and he even wrote In the book of Romans that men were sleeping with men and women sleeping with women and he said those that do it are worthy of damnation and I say the same [Applause] thing I heard some of the guys up in the lodge where we were staying out in the hunting trip talking about a gay Pastor I thought oh my Lord make me sick at my stomach gay Pastor can you imagine can you imagine a man being that blind can you imagine people being so foolish they would set under such when God's word will condemn them oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I must have got a little raise of that light it come down on me and hit me and made me kind of Li you like or something kind of rough let me let me let me cut off that light and say oh how is everybody this is the greatest day of your life oh boy come on now some of you that would feed on that slop that's all it is slop fit for Hogs I want you to notice how that Luke whenever he writes this in chapter 15: 24 it said for as much as we have heard that certain went out from us now you see they were not sent they just went amen it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord well that's a miracle within itself ain't it to send chosen men unto you as our beloved Barnabas and Paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore Judas not his scar it now Judas and isus who shall also tell you the same things by mouth so now they notice the difference between these men and the others the others went but weren't sent these went but were set the others didn't have a message that coincided with what the apostles was preaching but these were the voices echoing the truth of what the apostles said now they didn't just send Paul and Barnabas but they sent these other brothers who had been around even longer you see friend a lot of the thing that Satan has wanted to do is to try to corrupt us away from this original Apostolic order and it gives him more Liberty to do whatever he wants to do all people have to say is they feel led I challenge any person here any person listen to me tonight around the world I challenge any preacher to show me where the words feel led all right in the book of Acts where any preacher felt led to go do this or do that or the other contrary to God's scripture I'll be waiting but I ain't going to stop preaching till I get it I'm just going to go and preach now notice we have sent ah so you mean the church sent wow hope it's hard for me to say this brother Joel Brown's had a burden on his heart to do something for the community where he was raised up and he come and talk to me about it and want me to pray with him of course he follow the leading of the Lord and God would be with him and wed my advice lesson so it so happens that there's a church not too far from this community where brother Joel was feeling and I told him brother Joel the first thing you need to do of course after praying about it is contact the brother in that area right Joel I said don't you go in there and try to start something different than what he's got said why would you tell him that because I think Bible I think Apostolic that's the way they did you never find them coming in come on children now preach with me you don't find it in the Bible with them going along with men who done something contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles and the prophets so I said go in and let the brother know you're not there trying to undercut him but you've got a burden for your your black Community where you were raised because many of them of course still live in their own community and may not go to some of the white churches yet or whatever more and he just wanted to go see is there somebody there Lord is there somebody there said but brother Joel the thing of it is you don't want to be like brother random brother random went to India and had hard no churches to support him all those people come to God and he said whenever he come back he said probably nearly every one of them went back to the siks the James the Buddhist because there was no church to s send them to so I said go there and talk to that Pastor which brother Joel did so and the brother actually said well you can have our church if you wish to if you want to use it for outreach whatever and I thought praise God that that's that's an awesome way to do it and brother Joel said well maybe not maybe we just you know get a building and I tell them I said where you going to have it I said I hadn't thought about that said well you going to use for PA well I hadn't thought about that well you see whenever you've got men that are experienced and you're going to start a work work it's foolish so foolish not to ask the men of God who's been laboring for decades it shows scriptural ignorance in the minds of so many people as I said I wonder how many Apostolic message churches we have thank you Jesus y'all want me to go on another hunting trip this week is any place say we can go brother Danel notice now in verse in verse 40 and Paul chose Silas and departed because he felt led and he felt led and and uh Silas felt led Paul CH Silas and departed so do you understand what would happen in that day if a man would feel lad to go out and start a church or do whatever and they would go to the local church and say hey he come talk to you are you all working with this is this a work together with you and if they would have said no real Apostolic Believers would had nothing to do with it right come on message people will read your Bible now remember from this night forward every one of you is going to be held accountable and you will stand before the Lord God himself and these scriptures right here that you've seen on this screen will be on Heaven's screen yeah not only you visible but those of you that are streaming and if I'm taken from the earth and people go back and archive it them too cuz this is God's word not mine and he went through Syria and Sicilia confirming the churches chapter 16:4 and as they went through the cities they delivered them the oh no decrees I mean y'all still believe your Bible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of who ordained of the Apostles and Elders which were at Jerusalem wow verse five and so oh so here's the way New Testament churches expanded and started and so were the church is established notice and how many faiths Presbyterian Faith Church of Christ Faith Church of God faith one God faith two God faith three God faith there was one Faith well there's truly still is just one true faith can I go a bit farther thank you chapter 20 verse 17 and from myus he sent to Ephesus now this is Paul as he's journeying through he sent to Ephesus and he called the Elders of the church wow so you mean the prophet of the age is going through an area and he would not even pass through that area Harry until he called the Elders of the church and wanted to meet with them chapter 21: 18 and the day following Paul went in with us into James and all the elders were present and when he saluted them he declared particularly what things God had WR among the Gentiles by his ministry 1 Corinthians 4:17 for this cause have I sent unto you osthus you mean Paul sent another preacher okay now some of y'all buckle up okay put your shoulder harness on your seat belt your crash helmet and everything before brother Ron Spencer ever started pastoring I sent him on a mission get your handkerchief out and wave it by that person by You Phantom phanom you don't believe me ask him as a matter of fact we was talking about long ago he said you remember when you sent me to certain certain place I said yes sir I remember that brother Jim bab went with him they had some Great Fellowship until they started talking about the different football teams that they liked and then they nearly had a fallen out it didn't last long now can you imagine brother Ron Spencer being able to be sent somewhere come on now well glory to God it's either getting awful hot in here or I'm feeling the pressure notice and when he saluted them he declared particularly what things God had wrote among him among the Gentiles now he jumps over here First Corinthians speaking about now what he do have i s unto you timotheus who is my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord and shall bring into you remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I have taught everywhere in every Church wow you mean to tell me that Timothy then whenever he would go in and preach the message and he would actually preach about the messenger and talk about the messenger to the people and say now I want to remind you now brother Paul you remember how he lived now brother Paul you remember you imagine people say now what in the world is he doing referring to some man what in the world is he doing talking about some man oh my good people say I cannot believe you all stand up and quote a man well what's the difference between us quoting the Vindicated prophet and you quoting the smiley preacher from t what's the differ that El standing up here preaching and you quoting the 700 Club or The 500 Club or the 200 Club you're going to quote somebody I'm just GL I'm quoting the right body amen I'm not ashamed of this message know of this [Applause] messeng 2 Corinthians 8:16 but thanks be to God which put the same Earnest care Into the Heart of Titus for you for for indeed he accepted the exhortation being more forward of his own court and he went unto you we have sent with him the brother my goodness so you mean men of God actually felt they could influence others and they would go because these men of God hey why don't some of you Brothers go down to a jail over there why don't you do this what you want to do something for the Lord some young preachers want to preach and where a lot of them want to start out preaching before 500 yeah they want to stand up so why don't you go to the nursing home oh no no no I'm too nervous to go over a nursing home if God's called you you'll start in a hog lot if that's where you have to start if you've got to start down out with one woman Jesus wasn't too big to go to one woman anytime a preacher is too big to go to one woman he's too big for his britches amen if you're a called of God you'll preach in a pig lot you'll preach wherever God sent you because it's burning inside of your soul you ain't preaching for an offering you ain't preaching for a crowd you're preaching because God himself called you to do it now can you imagine if brother Joel Brown moved on his heart whenever they start having Services maybe he's already started having some and the brother from that area would call me and say Hey brother Donnie brother Joel Brown from your church is coming up here and he's doing this this or this you know anything about it and brother Joel didn't think it necessary of course to come to me and I would have to say no sir I don't I don't know one thing about it so I don't know exactly what verse said he might use but more than likely Sunday brother Joel is going to be his text why cuz he don't know brother Joel he want alpam under the headship of his pastor [Music] but now if the brother's concerned and he ain't call me cuz he trusts him you imagine when say oh yeah done talk to Brother D okay that's good that's exactly right oh you say that's a denominational that's the Bible that's God's protocol but again friends people don't believe what the prophet told they do not believe what he said that God called ministers are God's commanding officers they simply don't believe it and do you realize your unbelief will keep you out of the Rapture you think it matters to God which scripture you disbelieve whether it's Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4 I want to believe all of them don't you brother amen boy it seems like I've been preaching for three days is it that long man a lot God help me tomorrow notice we have sent him the brother whose praises and the gospel throughout all the churches not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this Grace what a recommendation so the churches was in such Unison they said brother Paul We believe this young brother he'd be a blessing to you and a help to you and a strength to you so it wasn't just I feel L I feel L I feel L I feel L but the church has recommended this brother and Paul so honored the way the churches felt about it he said I believe I'll take him with us all these scriptures of will be available for you if you'd like to read them yourself this is not a king Donnie version It's the King James that's right I'm sorry y'all didn't know this is in your Bible maybe you'd spend more time reading your Bible instead of on Facebook and Tik Tok and twick twack and everything else in the world and social media spend a little time in Social mediating with God you might know your Bible a little better Philippians 2:25 yet I suppose it necessary to send to you aphroditus and companion and labor and fellow Soldier but your messenger he that ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness don't you understand what this did this eliminated so much false [Music] prophets they would not let them in their pulpit without [Music] recommendation for he longed after you all and was full of Heaven is because that he had heard that ye had heard he had been sick for indeed he was sick and N to death but God had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also amen won't you look at this prophet of the age he needed men around him that had inferior Ministries and he did not feel threatened he needed men that could come he knew he wasn't going to live forever he knew in order for the message to live there had to be other men of God that would pack that same message oh I heard brother man said today things that ought to be and he's preaching that last message I if you knew it or not but that Assembly of God and he said I know I'm I know I'll go on I oil pass something like that and he said go on and these young men I used to fulfill that scripture not anymore since I'm an old man but these young men will take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord Jesus tape players don't have legs Church come on MP3 players don't have legs Shaman don't have legs a tape player can't baptize you a tape player cannot sit there and cons so you God call men is what God ordained to pack this word he's never changed it and that's what we believe because we are original Apostolic [Applause] Believers praise God can you imagine what this recommendation meant now for a pafitis to the church I send him therefore the more carefully that when you see him again you may Rejoice that I may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore so what about hus fius and some of those others that he wrote their name in the Bible now they too were preachers but they were preachers without a recommendation oh my they were preachers that Paul warned the flock about now no doubt there some dumb sheep that went and hurt him just out of curiosity but if they really believed this man was a servant of God you imagine ever darking in a door where amus was preaching or felius was preaching and Paul said their Doctrine does eat like a canker which is cancer and a corruption that starts in on the body and the skin begins to die word used for a couple different medical terms there and Paul would liken their Doctrine and their preaching to the rottening of the Flesh and the limbs would fall off ain't a saying of God full of the Holy Ghost going to sit and hear amanus preaching nothing why wasn't recommended by the church receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold such and reputation fimon 1 ver10 I beseech you beseech thee for my son onesimus whom I have begotten in my bonds which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom I have sent again thou therefore receive him wow so if some other man raises up glory to God I'll tell you one thing I believe the word too hallelujah amen thank you Jesus and Paul didn't recommend him so it show up at Corinth or show up wherever wonder what them people would think and where where's your recommendation oh Lord to God I don't need no recommend Hallelujah I feel that oh [Music] my friend should not believe some of the trash and the nonsense that's going on around our message people with some of their so-called gifts prophesying for this man to leave his wife and marry this man's wife and someone sometime ago a woman standing up and speaking in tongues and interpreting or prophesying or whatever you want to call it I've got a different name for it yeah the Lord I'm calling for a trim I'm calling for a trim so the sisters of the church went home and got their scissors and they started trimming well that's what the Lord said he wanted not my God beels above the devil well come on now well Hallelujah how do we judge prophecy oh I felt it we don't judge it by feeling we judge it by the word and if it don't come to pass it ain't the Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh my notice in Jude chapter one only one chapter of course verse 17 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ notice how now Jude is the Foster brother brother of the Lord Jesus notice how Jude is exhorting the people to Remember The Words which were spoken by the Apostle as if though it was the holy word of God wow how many believes the apostles Doctrine is important yes sir brother how many be honest and say well to be honest with you I'm not sure how much of the message churches even go with that anymore I'll raise my hands whether you got enough courage to or not I can guarantee you it's so sad when you look at it oh my brother Donnie we're in the age of the Prophet The Apostles don't even matter no more really well Jesus certainly disagrees with you that's right because he built his City in heaven in a reflection of the earth Revelation 21:14 and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of the 12 Apostles of the Lamb yes so you mean when you get there and you're going to live in that City for eternity you're going to see them 12 names of them Apostles now you see the Lord Jesus want he said brother brandom did not go in there and tire at TH Foundation say now wait a minute I made a mistake here I shouldn't have never built the city on the foundation of the Apostles I should have just buil on brother Bram alone and have brother Ram's name there he makes no mistakes so what did Brother Brandon be built upon the doctrine and the teaching of the Apostles and Jesus Christ was so confident that he could build the church on it that he himself allowed himself to be the first stone laid on that foundation and then you and I are given the privilege to be laid by him on that same Foundation that's right let's stand praise the Lord and the church said how many wants our church to be a Bible believing Apostolic Church not UPC not Church of God in Christ not any of these other denominational things but a Bible believing Church oh my hallelujah thank you Father thank you Father you see in reality friends a man a preacher which cannot be led and cannot recognize headship himself is not a leader he is a dictator you look at the difference between Saul and David Saul could not be corrected Saul could not admit he was wrong he couldn't follow directions so therefore he could not be LED under the teachings of the prophet Samuel and look he becomes so stubborn so hard-headed he didn't want to be told what to do oh yeah God said this I've done what God Said but look at David boy he had his mistakes didn't he but he knew how to repent amen and he could do it not because of act but because he genuinely meant it that's right he could be led to repentance he could be led to saying he was wrong he could be led and God even hundreds of years later God was still referring back to David and he said for my servant David's sake for my servant David's sake hundreds of years after he was gone but his legacy meant so much to God oh may God help us we can be that kind of Christians let's bow our heads if you would praise the Lord now maybe you're here tonight and you say actually brother Donnie I didn't realize the Bible said all that well you probably didn't because you're not called to study the word like a preacher would and God knows that so maybe you didn't understand maybe you didn't see it maybe you didn't know it was there but after tonight you say my I want to be that kind of believer I want my heart my life my home our church to be established upon the doctrine the teaching of the Apostles that original word because I truly believe God sent his Prophet to restore our hearts back to the apostolic fathers that's right the apostolic fathers praise God how many wants our church to be that kind of a church would you just raise your hand before God and the angels are watching you the Lord Jesus is watching you and demons are watching so remember we're making our stand we want to be a Bible believing Church oh yeah a message sure oh absolutely with all of our hearts yes we want to believe it teach it walk it obey it praise the Lord heavenly father as we lift our hands to you tonight dear God in your presence I thank you Lord for the Bible I realize Lord Jesus some of our brothers and sisters still in parts of Africa India different parts of the world still don't have a personal Bible I've seen some pictures of some just a few days ago getting their own Bible for the first time we have them laying in our cars laying in our homes we have access to them all of us that have a smartphone have access to them and how much do we read them how I thank you for the Bible and Lord how we thank you tonight for the message of the hour amen that points us right back to the Bible the devil tried to lay a trap for your Prophet one day a man come to the prophet and said now now brother brandham you've had so much experience with God so many visions and so on you would be qualified to write your own Bible now he said the man i' have been trying to catch me a little and I said well brother that might be so but that couldn't be what God would want because he said there would be NE added to this word I remember brother Charlie Cox telling me one time that when brother brandham was there at their house and brother Char had been reading a message book and he had his Bible laying there on a table and he had just laid that message book over on top of the Bible brother brandham saw it went over and picked it up and laid the Bible on top of the message book said brother Charlie don't ever put anything before the word of God Lord God I pray our people will always believe that I pray your people around the world will always have that attitude to love the word to love their scriptures to read them oh Jesus we love you father we don't want to just baptize in your name say we're Apostolic we're one God but we want to be able to take the founding of a new church or the advancing of the kingdom of God brothers that would go out of our assembly I don't believe you call preachers just to set them all under a preacher the rest of their life but they may be sitting there for years to get training so they can be able to go out maybe start other works or missionary or whatever more more but Lord if they follow the apostolic pattern they will not have to sneak around behind the pastor's back like a snake in the grass thank you Lord cuz if they would have done that in the days of Paul they would have got no recommendation help us father What a Sad thing it is many churches will crumble because they aren't built on the revelation of your word I didn't start this church Lord it was started years ago on rone Hill I thank you for those who started it Lord Lord the Yan's family and the Phillips family and many of them dear God their parents and grandparents and we thank you for them they were the Pioneers that started it then move moved it over to Happy Valley and Lord they changed the name of it when it moved from Ron Hill to Happy Valley because they didn't figure that Ron Hill would quite fit the name anymore with them being at Happy Valley sort of the way I looked at it whenever we left Happy Valley I didn't figure it'd be fitting since we're sitting in Buffalo Valley to call it happy valley so I figured it's time for a change Lord God just because we change the name of the church don't mean we change what we stand for as a matter of fact I'm more determined now to disrupt the kingdom of Hell than I've ever been in my life hallelujah hallelujah we're more determined dear God to stand for your gospel stand for your truths cast out Devils heal the sick I'm more determined dear God to pray for the sick people people I'm more determined to pray for folks with cancer than I've ever been in my entire life I am by no means discouraged I am by no means down or weary Satan thought he would get my face but he better thinkink again he thought he would discourage us but he better think again we are not discouraged we are encouraged we are encouraged in the word we're encouraged in Your Great Name in your great power father we're looking for great things to happen among us we've seen great things but we are looking for greater and by greater I don't necessarily mean more emotion I mean a greater manifestation of your person and when I say greater I don't mean dead a lot of folks consider greater with dead I don't think it's going to be dead I don't think we're going to stop worshiping we ain't going to stop praising we ain't going to stop singing we're not going to stop clapping our hands I think we ought to have a shout we ought to have the shout of the king among us now more than ever before because your word is manifesting itself amen Lord God prove yourself Among Us Jesus we've already seen you heal cancer we saw sister Ruth Garden Lord I believe with all of my heart here several months ago she lay there dear God lifeless but after prayer the spirit of God brought our sister back we've seen you do so many things among us already Lord God that only fertilizes our faith to believe you've got wonderful things if we can only stay small and stay humble Lord God help us I pray amen thank you Father how many wants that with all your heart amen friends let me show you the difference difference between some of the arrogance that goes around some of the message preachers I a god taken me to hunt this week and I almost missed the deer that the Lord give me because the guide hadn't called me and I thought well it's too late for me to go brother Daniel called anyway Fally worked it out where I could this guy I get in his truck and he's getting there maybe had even went a mile we've talked about the Lord he's a saved man been a Sunday school teacher youth leader things like that about 64 years old and he said D already told me said my my son's a pastor 32 years old and he said I can tell from talking to you you're a man of God your experience and handling the word what advice would you give to my son I thought as as I sat there m Jo my heart's I I I I was so sad because I thought of the message preachers that could ask their Elders similar things but won't even do it won't even come to Men of God that have labored in the word and already forgotten more than some of them will ever even know and won't even humble thems to come the Servants of God and say help me man of God I've got a burden on my heart to do this to do that do you see anything wrong with it do you see anything wrong in my Ministry look at me servant of God pray with me help me advise me yeah and I thought how sad I'm not sure if he was a Baptist or Methodist whatever but all I know is we talked about the Lord and hugged one another's neck and shed tears I thought how pitiful that a man like this that knows nothing about the message of Malachi 4 and yet but have more humility about him don't even know what I believe and some of the message people that have watched you for years and years yeah what'd you tell him brother Donnie I said my advice to him would be this stay humble stay little don't never become big in his own eyes and become arrogant and proud and I said if he will stay that way God will be able to use him he said 'w he's always been humbled and got a real good spirit I said that's great but I said tell him that I said to keep it because Solomon the man of God that built the Great temple of God when he got older he also built this Temple and that Temple and another Temple and another Temple for idol worship the very same man that built the house of God because he got arrogant and proud God God's blessed us and give us a nice place to worship don't we thank him for it than Lord but let's not get arrogant let's not get proud and say boy our church is Big our church is our church let's stay small and little and see what he'll do let's not ask people come and see our church let's tell them come and see our Jesus yeah amen amen come and see our Jesus don't come and see our pastor come and see our youth choir Bo I tell you why sister Emma is doing such a great job with our young people and our boy you ought to see our youth group my goodness brother Rob and brother Joe and this brother oh just just come and see our youth group let's tell them to come and see our Jesus are youth leaders can't change your heart I can't change their hearts only Jesus can change our hearts amen hallelujah sing something for us s praise the Lord you imagine what brother Brandon would be able to say tonight if he'd walk in this church and say my those of you that have been to brandham Tabernacle you know how small that it is how humble how little brother brandham wanted to build a bigger church but the people didn't want to and one of the brothers that was on the board said that after the people voted not to do it brother brandham told them that's what they think of my Ministry but because the church voted to do so he stayed right there but I've often wondered what it would have been if they would have been of the right mind you see a Visionary is always one of the most misunderstood preachers that there is in the ministry because most everybody just wants to keep his scrunch down don't grow don't do this don't do that oh no oh no it's our for and no more but the Visionary that says what about tomorrow if there is another 10 years or 5 years what will we do what are we going to do with our young people what are we going to give to them oh my we don't want to just give them a nice building we don't want to give you a place to play basketball we want to give you a place where you can be born again but I also want to give you a place where you can come together with your own and we can invite the youth from North Carolina South Carolina Georgia it's absolutely amazing the youth services that we've had I'm hearing from pastors I'm hearing from youth churches or youth leaders rather some of these other churches when I was here when brother Matt was here how many of the youth from South Carolina North Carolina Georgia sit outside and say thank you brother Donnie for letting us come praise God so you see this ain't just for us this ain't just for us hallelujah and it won't be if we'll stay little and stay small how many wants to be that way oh Jesus we love you Lord Jesus Use Me Jesus use me let's sing it together before we go I'm sorry I have you a little bit long tonight we say Brother Don but I'm not a preacher and I I've never even spoken tongues I don't get up on the floor and dance and I understand my little daughter that just stepped be on the curtain of time I never recall ever hearing her speaking tongues I seen her one time on a video where she was jumping can't recall that I ever saw her shout her higher down I can't recall that I ever saw her cast out a devil or do things that people think is great but I have never seen a lay member whose life touched so many people from around the world I just keep hearing about and I say Lord have mercy Lord have mercy you see the Lord told me months and months ago that we was going to see his glory and he told me that it would be marvelous in our eyes but I totally misunderstood what he meant I just knew beyond a shadow of a doubt and our dedication Services when all the saints of God was praying and Saints from around the world were praying I just knew I just knew beyond a sh of doubt she's going to jump out of that wheelchair and run over this whole place and we was going to tear this church down and have to build another one we all shouted it down but that wasn't what he me at all so you see sisters even you can be great just live your life for what the Lord wants you to be your brothers that'll never preach you never know who you're affected but brother Donnie everybody may not know me the way they do sister cuz she was your daughter I know that but what if you influence one soul and they come to the Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet said that name that individual will be identified with you for eternity forever each of of you have a work for God do it do it let's sing it together come we just worship a little while we go dear I be your witness if you will help my weakness help me Jesus I know that I'm worthy Lord for the oh sing it to him now with all your heart by eyes face I [Applause] see upon upon the cross of calary of Calvary de Lord I cry let oh Hallelujah oh just's sing it now close your eyes if you would raise your hands everybody Jesus use me oh Jesus use me and don't refuse me Sur there every young

me surely there's a word that I can do and even though it's I'm sure that most of you probably know that sister sheay has been having some some real problems like seizure type things and they found they found a a growth and she can't even get in to get a a second MRI with contrast up until January so she's having these things multiple times during the day and it's sort of like that she passes out sometimes her eyes roll back in her head and then amazing that our health system is so backed up that someone like this is dealing with these things and can't even get get seen to and taken care of by the doctors but we have another Health Care System tonight thank you Lord Jesus ain't backed up to the 1 or the middle of January let's believe together tonight sister dear God we believe your

for us to be together here today if you turn with me in the Book of Proverbs chapter 31. or return there are a lot to make this announcement brother Rob and Sister Sarah Weber about to announce their engagement of their daughter Emma to John Michael Laster I told him the other day he finally must have proved himself enough to get Daddy's permission I think he had a hard time doing it too let's just give him a nice time [Applause] being a daddy with two girls when you get ready to give him away I'll tell you it takes pretty good man to be able to get him from your heart because you love them that's right Proverbs chapter 31. verse 10. who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband death safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil what a woman she will do him good and not evil all the days I've always loved these scriptures since I've started reading them just as a boy but once I began to realize who these were written about I've really loved them more especially when you consider it was written about Bathsheba so how could this woman been a temptress a seductress a woman who did something ungodly to get the attention of the king David and this ever be said about her couldn't have been of course it's not to me the Marvel that she was that but how she could deal with all the trauma complexes fears anxieties that she brought to the Palace and still able to become this type of woman I mean I'd like to be remembered today as we pray God bless you Mrs holder needs our requests in our hearts Heavenly fathers we Bower hits in your presence we sense that you're here we believe that you've come once again that you could speak to us Lord God I pray that you would take charge of the service help me Lord God that I can speak that which is pleasing to you shout my mouth to anything that would displease you May every heart be opened May every life be challenged changed by the word of God you see the needs Lord of our people many are sick many are dealing with various things in their bodies we bring them before you today Lord asking you that should be mindful but I pray you'd go even deeper than our body today are you going to our spirits may you go into our conscience our memory and you go into our souls woo us with your being father pull us up close to you that we can hear you whisper secrets secrets that's only given to the bride of Your Love your purpose your plan for each of Our Lives help us today Father in the name of Jesus we pray amen God bless you you may be seated I'm sure as we sit here today gathered in this place we've come with different needs different desires different requests on our hearts before the Lord I believe that the Lord is so mindful of every one of us no matter what you need no matter what you've been through what you're currently going through the Lord Jesus in his love to come and redeem us so much so that he would become one of us I know I've preached about it a lot you've heard it preached many of you since you first gave your heart to the Lord of what he became and his great Act of condescension I wonder sometimes how much I still know about it the more I read about it as I was last night the more I realized there was an Avenue about him that I still need help with not that I don't believe him I do but to be able to see how far he's stepped down and what he was willing to become in order to redeem us because his love is so great and we know that in his love we sometimes measure it by human love Carol and I took Erica down to Nashville the other day to get a treatment and seeing her and and quite a bit of pain and discomfort and stuff coming back looking at her and um just watching her and having to go down and pray for her after we brought her home and as her parents looking at her and feeling this in you how it breaks your heart and many of you have felt the same way about loved ones and friends and you look at them and you hurt so deeply you wish there was something you could do to change it to fix it to make it better and yet we know God looks at people's hurts and their pains and the things they deal with and he looks at it in a different way than we do we look with a human empathy a human sympathy and compassion and we feel so sorry for them but yet the Lord looks at people in a way that is so different than we do because he's looking at the bigger picture of what he wants to accomplish out of something that he allows them to go through now let me say before we get started in this direction this morning I don't believe that God is the orchestrator of many things that has happened to many of us in our lives I don't believe that God is a murderer of the innocent I do not believe that God is the cause of many things that happened in your life in my life lives of other people people want to blame God for many things that the devil does that always bothers me whenever I hear people blaming God for things the devil does whether they're Christians or Sinners it bothers me more so when I hear Christians say well God told me to do this and I look in his word and I'm saying there ain't no way my daddy told you to do something contrary to his scripture he just don't do any such thing but yet we know that God looks with a different a different view than we do and how can God look at people in their suffering and how can God look at people when they're going through so much stuff in life and he wouldn't even have to speak all he'd have to do is just look their Direction and that problem would totally be eliminated and they would be set free delivered healed or whatever it was they was going through and yet why does he allow it to go on why does God allow people sometimes good people people that really are not reaping because of something they've done and yet they suffer so much and go through so many things and then Satan of course loves to take those things and twist them around in our minds and try to make us question our God but myself is an individual I call that a no-fly zone I don't fly there because I'll never understand stand all the mind of God nor the will of God and you won't either but I've learned to trust him even when I don't understand what he's doing because I believe Divine sovereignty is that Progressive attitude of God that will override human circumstance in order to make his will come to pass in our lives I believe in that myself but I look and I realize that God then is not always the cause of terrible things happening to good people but God in turn will turn around and use some of those terrible things that that have happened to people and make them work out to where that he can use them for his own honor and Glory how many seen that in your own life or the life of others now it's not that God himself was the cause or the instigator of the thing that happened but he will turn it around and make it work to his own glory and this is what I see about the story of David and Bathsheba that we've been looking at that the Lord would allow Bathsheba one which was brought into the first view of the scripture we know nothing about our past we know nothing about her childhood nothing about her hardly at all other than her first appearance is whenever she's brought into the Palace of King David and we or looked at it for a few weeks now seeing it was beyond her own choice she had no choice to do this David never loved her he never cared for her initially he lusted after her would just be honest and Frank David was a great man but he was a man and David made a terrible terrible mistake and he paid for it the rest of his life is that right but yet God did not Mark David off and neither did God break his Everlasting Covenant with David So Bathsheba had to bring a lot of things with her no doubt into the Palace of the king and as I've been looking at this I've realized that God merged her into the natural genealogy of the Lord Jesus in order to bring a picture and to be able to display the picture of the making of the Gentile bride that God brought in Rahab for an element God brought in Tamar and God brought in these others and then God brings the last woman which is Mary which is the epitome of a virgin bride which speaks of your soul and yet God allowed these which were scarred and these which were wounded by others and some of them by themselves things that they did and brought on their self and the Lord never looked at them and said you know what you've got not a bad background you've got a bad pass I really don't think it would be worse me risking you to identify you and my genealogy now the truth of it is there's probably every one of us here today that have people in our families and people in our family tree I've never been too concerned about looking up my family tree and finding monkeys because I know I didn't come from a monkey but what I'd be more ashamed of of some of my family not not afraid of baboon will be up my family tree it's some of them gangsters and robbers and you know Train Robbers and this and that and the other and don't some of y'all smile because they stole your horse and they did because you stole their Pig so all of us are from the same bucket of gum and mess when it comes to humanity ain't that the truth so all of us I'm sure wouldn't have to look very far to find people in our family tree that have done some pretty terrible things and some of you might not have to look past yourself but needless to say the Lord does not hold that against us and that he will not allow us to be something greater than what we even are right now I saw a sign the other day and I thought it was a remarkable sign and it said these words don't let what you currently are hinder you from becoming what your full potential really is and I thought that's a wonderful thing that even what we are today I personally don't think that I've reached my Heights in Christ Jesus I think there's more for me I mean he believes the same thing I believe there's a deeper want a greater understanding oh but you're an old man I realize that but I'm still younger than Abraham was when God started dealing with them so haha devil look out here I come so God started dealing with Abraham when he was 75 years old I'm just 66 so I'm still a young man by that standard but we can look at our past and look at our failures and if we're not careful we will let that determine what we think God will do for us and God's looking at it in a total different way let me start this with this this morning in a sermon called the Great Mighty conquer before any Victory can be won there must be great prices to be paid oh what prices and sometimes they are very deep and they make very great scars tearing down but in order to have the mountain we've got to have the valley before you can have the sunshine we've got to have rain before we can have the light we have to have the night or the light rather before we can have the right we have to have wrong and you would have never known what wrong was now here brother random I love the way that he projects the full gospel because he preaches healing he preaches Miracles he preaches the supernatural the phenomenal power of God but he also preaches where we live every day of our life how many beliefs and miracles he healing signs wonders Supernatural but how many also knows you got trials you got tests of life you got difficulties well you know this is the way I see that as a preacher I want to preach the message as well that I want to preach a God that is so mighty and so great and so wonderful there's absolutely nothing we can ever go through that he can't bring us through that I also want to preach life in a realism form and that is that you're going to have tests trials people aren't going to love you you're not going to everybody that comes to the Lord Jesus is not going to be a millionaire sorry if you thought you were I hate to bust your balloon but some of you are not going to be billionaires and millionaires some of you won't even be thousand heirs that's right some of you is going to struggle it's just the way it is you're never going to get up every day of your life and never have a sickness that's not reality but I want to preach to you that if you do have sickness you have a Healer and if you have a need to have a mighty God that is bigger than ever need you will ever have in this life I love the way that our Prophet stands in this aspect and brings these things to us notice again from his personal perspective now and the reproach of the cause of the word my heart has got so many scars on it Lord from hard battles I'm an old veteran help me Lord I need your help now what I hear from this is not the mighty Elijah standing there before the false prophets of Baal I don't hear Elijah when he calls for the two she bears come destroy the children I don't hear the mighty conquering Elijah as he rebuilds The Altar and calls for the spirit of God to come down but I hear from a man Anointed with that spirit that is giving us an inside view of a hurt wounded individual any of them type of people here today now he gives us a little tiny glimpse inside of his heart his heart now we tend to rejoice in the Miracles the signs the Wonders the phenomenon I'll read you about some of them in a few minutes but myself I know I'm weird I know but myself I absolutely love quotes just like this one because it helps me to relate as a minister as the Son of God and I trust it'll help you relate today my heart's got so many scars on it Lord from hard battles I'm an old veteran help me Lord I need help maybe all this training has been for a purpose I trust it has been Lord help me oh God help me oh God so we have to believe either one of two things from this statement this is only an act this is only a put on that this man was not sincere or this is the sincere cry of a great veteran Warrior I know what I believe what do you believe you believe it's a veteran Warrior I thought so so then this Warrior is asking God for hell for what to cast out another devil to be able to lay hands on a cross-eyed child that God would heal it no help help from wounds and scars battles he must have been feeling kind of weary anybody in your ever get there well the rest of you Godly angels that are here today would you remember us four Mortals now let me share this with you I have never seen any cross-eyed child ever come to the platform but what was healed better than 300 cases of cross-eyed children have been healed and less than six months time now those of you who want to believe that brother Brandon was a false prophet and those who have attacked him and you feel like you've been sent by God to straighten us out I'm going to ask you to do 300 I'll ask you to perform three and then I'll sit down and talk with you let me know when you do it but until we'll follow this better than 300 cases of cross-eyed children that were healed in less than six months we have a record of it 40 000 testimonies to the sick to date of healing Witnesses signed by doctors forty thousand healings to date this is 19 and 50. signed by doctors again we won't require 40 000 of you what about four and until you can keep your mouth off of God's prophet [Applause] now wonder why there was never across a child that ever come across the platform that was never healed not what Wonder why an embedded scar on a servant's heart speaking about his little eight-month-old daughter I'll never forget she was eight months old and I remember I used to come home and she'd sat down in the yard and I'd blow my horn and come around the corner and she'd go goo goo and she'd reach I love those little fellas now he reverts from that back to when she was dying she was suffering so hard to one of them little fat legs was moving up and down in a spasm and looked like her little hand was waving and I looked at her and I said Sherry honey you know Daddy I was trying to make myself strong and I said you know Daddy honey her little lips got to quiff it she looked at me she was suffering so hard till her eyes crossed her eyes crossed I imagine Satan stood there and laughed but he will pay little did he know one cross-eyed child would cost him one after another after another after another hundreds of thousands of them did God do this it wasn't God but God took what had happened and did something out of the life of this man the point I want you to see today is friends what will we do what's the negative things in life that we've been through whether people have intentionally hurt us or not intentionally hurt us or have been let down or disappointed or whatever more will we spend our life in inside for ourself and just you know poor little me poor little me or will we allow God to take the things we've been through like Bathsheba a woman who was defiled the prophet said David defiled his neighbor's wife David was the one who instigated this evil and this wrong but we don't find Bathsheba turning into the type of woman that set around the palace all day and did absolutely nothing feeling so sorry for herself but she is the very epitome of what an honorable virtuous woman should be even for the New Testament Daughters of God so it depends on what we do with what life gives us brother random calls it the human grab bag the human grab bag so out of the human grab bag we can get all types of sickness and afflictions and complexes and fears and Trauma and so much stuff that we inherit from our parents or our grandparents or uncles and then all the other stuff that's placed upon us through our short span of life and then we go to looking at serving God and we bring all this stuff to him Lord here I am what do you what can you do with me what what can you do with me Lord well I've got this fear and I've got I don't trust preachers and I don't trust men and I don't trust women I don't I don't like this and I don't like that and I've got racial problems and I've got this problem and now if there's anything you can do with me God yeah I am go ahead well the first thing he needs to change is our attitude now listen how that he unveils this part this is 1950 by now he's found out I didn't know it then but I understand it now there has never been a cross-eyed child that come in the line there's never been one that placed over the platform that was healed I didn't know the crushing that it had to bring forth but I never see it I never see it till I think of it so you can imagine every child black white red yellow make no difference what size they were how old they were but every one of them that would walk up there before him who would he see not just that child but his own daughter Sharon Rose anybody here that has lost a loved one to cancer and whenever you do there's something about that oh you hear you know people and friends and relatives and that had it and they passed away oh that's terrible that's terrible but when it happens to you there's something about it it affects you in a more personal way as a pastor I hate cancer I hate covet I hate different diseases that have come and attacked people in our church I hate it because as a pastor God gives me a charge to watch over my sheep and I do everything in my power I hate it when disease strikes God's people don't you I hate it when it comes and it gives me something inside now I hope you understand that God will layer the supernatural many times over the top of the natural makeup that he allowed to be molded in US can't you see what God did in the prophet that God layered the Supernatural and brother random is not standing there out of human anger because we don't cast out Devils out of human anger we don't cast out Devils by a loud screaming voice but we cast them out by Authority but God layered the supernatural over the top of the natural and then when this Prophet spoke him on a person to walk up and he would see them there in that condition and what happened something from within was an empathy that could never be bred into he could have read all kinds of books of people who had lost a child and the baby had died with the eyes being crossed it would have never had the same impact upon him but it happened to him do you understand those of you sit here today and you've got hurts and issues and scars and things like that instead of allowing those things to control you why don't you let God layer over those hurts and let God be able to use you as a witness and you will be able to tell other people in a way that maybe I could not tell them look brother sister you can allow God to take those things and turn them into something that will expand your testimony to others and you can tell others God can help you through hurts and God can help you through disappointments and God can help you through sad times or you can sit around and feel sorry for yourself and struggle and not do anything for the kingdom of God I refuse to be a victim of pain I refuse to be a victim of being wounded and hurt by this and that and the other instead I choose to be an instrument of healing through my pain an instrument of healing through my loss anybody know what I'm saying so we take what we've went through in life and allow God to turn around and mold it and make it into something to his honor you know I realize we're living in an age whenever everybody wants so many therapists and I'm not against therapists as long as they don't tell you something contrary to God's word but I know that there is an element of this about therapy and phobias and traumas my goodness I've never heard so many phobias in my life you know the when you go to read about it you can't even keep up they got so many phobias people now are being able to draw unemployment because they got a fear of covet so I think a lot of lazy folks are just you and using that so they can stay home and draw a chair well go ahead somebody praise the Lord that's all right but it's exactly what people want and then we have so many self-help books and really there's only one book that can help you out of all the things that Satan got you into and that is the word of God I don't care who writes you will say well I recommend this book from Dr Dobson and I recommend that book from Dr so and so and I recommend that book from Dr so and so well I recommend the Bible from Dr God because Dr God is the true physician and he won't tell you to leave your wife and his sir won't tell you women to cut your hair and he won't tell you men well you're going to that old legalistic church and you need to live a little bit there's only one way to really be able to live and that's in Christ Jesus do I believe phobias are real I do I deal with people who have them all the time listen to this how strange they can be I do not know you I've never seen you we are strangers but I notice around you you have a phobia of something you have a phobia of something about wintertime now how strange when winter time comes you resent it now can you imagine this might be your only opportunity that you get to stand before Elijah in your lifetime he doesn't tell you what a great Christian you are how many chapters you read before church how many times you pray a day how many times you fasted the great sacrifices you've given to the kingdom of God but before God and the devil and everybody else he tells you you've got a phobia of wintertime but you know what that's what this person needed to hear I imagine if God's Prophet was shared today and still Discerning I'd say that if he started with me and went down to every person here probably what he would tell us wouldn't be some great Supernatural something and people would be so overwhelmed by your spiritual wealth and your spiritual depth in God I'd say we'd more fine would find out more about one another's Humanity than we knew of knowing each other in decades because he probably wouldn't tell us great complementary things it would be such carnal stuff it would be fears and phobias and that well I was somebody who would preach with me this morning why because a lot of these things are what hinder our spirituality with God anyway it's things like this that hold us back from going on I want you to listen what A peculiar thing that he says when winter time comes you resent it you get scared when winter time comes and it makes you all upset and it makes you constipated wow so this poor person probably tried fiber they probably tried more apples more pears more prunes prune juice they got online and they Dr Googled it of course Dr Google wasn't in there then but today that's what we would do and they've done everything depending on whether they lean toward the natural means or they lean toward the medical process and they would go all natural if they were natural and there's all medical they'd go on medical and hear God's profit goes right down to the problem who what doctor What doctor would ever Associated a fear of wintertime to being the cause of constipation wow so I wonder how many things we're dealing with here today and we are treating the side effects with this and that and the other and we've got one tablet for this and another appeal for that and a shot for this and you know we read some new something another coming from way over there in some foreign country I don't know why it is but this is the Curiosity of human beings they found some nut that falls off of a tree and it you know it's grain in purple yellow striped and has white polka dots that run down the middle of it and it's this rare saying and they found out that when monkeys eat it that it caused them to do this and that and then somebody in a pyramid scheme wants you to be a partaker of it and then you have so many people under you and then people pop that peel whoa I feel so cooked wow they laced that with dope you better stay away from that bottle pop and then after a week or so oh I'm right back where I was shame on us shame on us for following all this stuff when really the reality is I the answer is the Lord Jesus now I want you to notice how the prophet deals with this phobia wintertime the side effect of constipation does it recommend apples prunes prune juice but he said ah curse that devil in the name of Jesus Christ go home it won't bother you no more left you oh Hallelujah I'll tell a friend brother brennaman here today Paul ain't here today James saying here today but the same Lord Jesus that made that devil leave that individual it's right here in this building today Hallelujah [Applause] this is from Dawson Creek British Columbia what's the matter Soldier Boy you're not going to commit suicide the devil's lying to you boy you remember the story about the Soulja Boy in British Columbia Dawson Creek you've only got a phobia he's lying to you he will drive you insane if you believe him you remember what this was homosexuality he will drive you insane if you believe him tender him renounce that devil Hallelujah I command you in the name of Jesus Christ renounce the devil wow I want you to notice now the commanding is not going to the devil in this situation but the prophet is commanding this Soldier Boy to renounce the devil so here he's commanding him Oh Glory I wonder sometimes if some of you all ain't waiting on brother Daryl to do it for you or waiting on me to do it for it or somebody else to do it for him and you need to rise in faith and say Satan in the name of Jesus I command you leave my body leave me you tumor leave me you gross leave me you nervousness my house is a house of God I have no room for you and my body leave my body in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to renounce the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer healer healer get him with a homosexual saying and you need healing but where was there something in his body that was causing it his spirit a woman and man are not just different in their body and their Anatomy they're different in their spirit don't you understand people that walk that wall they're crossed up in their spirit that's why you and I try to rehab them and try to talk them out of it we'll never do it they need Deliverance inside themselves it's a devil anointing and Crossing up their Spirit what in the world would make a big fat ugly man one who drove great his hair grow out like a woman and hair on his leg like a gorilla and want to be a girl he's messed up in his spirit remember God didn't just take God could take a male rib and make female anatomy God took a male rib from Adam and made a woman's body out of it but God did not take Adam's spirit and put Adam's Spirit but he divided the spirits that he placed in Adam in Adam all glory in Adam was that masculine thing but in Adam was also Eve's identity and God separated that part from her he did not give her Adam's male spirit and Eve said well glory to God I'm in charge of the Garden of Eden now Hallelujah I'm going to take care of everything you know imagine when he opened up his eyes When papa laid him down there on that ground and put him to sleep maybe just passed his hand over his eyes and the Divine anesthesia he just started and papa reaches in all right and pose a real bow from Henry's heart and he lays the rib over on the table and then Papa goes in to Adam's spirit and divides this tenet shy female traits that God had made in him and God put this inside the spirit the spirit inside this body and then she comes up and met God and I've told her go stand by him when he comes to him she's standing there by him and takes his hand starts taking her little tiny fingers her little dainty fingers are rubbing over his hands sweetheart sweetheart wake up I'm on them type of guys whenever I have to have a procedure done they can't hardly get me awake at all I've had to have procedures in and I'm just unclear Hallelujah but you know who they've sent to my room before whenever I've had to have a colonoscopies or whatever it is to get me awake a little lady right there Donnie Donnie wake up hey girl what is it you imagine as Adam's eyes began to come open and here was this how you doing buddy I'm essential lady around to the American League I'm in charge of that God gave me to be your head I'm supposed to be on it I guess we can dismiss now I'm sorry but you can imagine the first time when he looked at her blonde hair and her blue eyes and her standing there in the form that God made to the prophet said the most beautiful woman that ever lived ever lived and yet so dainty and so touched him and was able to minister time and it was something he said where did she come from from you from you but this Soldier Boy just got messed up somehow so instead of being attracted to women well the prophet never looked at him and said you ain't got no hope boy you're damned to hell you get out of my prayer line you ain't got no right setting in there come on children I pray God will help us to reach to that kind and every other kind that the spirit of God leads us to watch this he said renounce the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer you'll go back and be a gentleman a real real man a gentleman a real real man raise up your hands to God and say praise God that's right now go back home and be well so you mean the person was sick yes not in the body spirit we just message people so specialize in ministering to the soul others of our ranks specialize so much their entire Ministries ministering to the body but ain't we got some preachers that can minister to the human spirit to help pull our Spirits into harmony with God's word gonna go on what's this what what's your trouble this is in Dallas in 64. you've had an accident and then that accident you were gassed was carbon monoxide gas now is that true it poisons you it poisons you in your liver and you've had trouble with that and you've had trouble with your stomach and the brother says that's right okay so some of these Hypocrites are tail bound that's standing up refuting all this here is a man that had the opportunity to say you're a liar and that's a false prophet he said that's right so you're going to go back in time and refute this man you say why do you do that because I'm called to stand the defense of this word hey look friend God didn't call me there'd be no Pennywise preacher dot God didn't call me and give me a yellow streak up my back I've stood for this word for decades of my life I'll stand for it until the day I die I will stand for it and say it as a message sent from God it is a message that's called us out and we will not give it up oh my you've had trouble with your heart that's right this is the brother answering him it's made you so nervous till you've built yourself in a complex you're poor and you must go back to work but you're afraid to go to work now look what Satan will do Satan will cause something to happen to you and then you will build a complex out of it and then Satan will try to cut you off from the very resource that you need to live I hear this man was having a job dealing with this type of stuff we don't know exactly what it was but he had got poisoned by carbon monoxide poisoning and it had built this thing anyway it caused liver damage and caused other things and this caused the complex to other man don't want to go back to work because he's afraid to go back now because it may happen again you know what Satan don't just do that to work he loves to do that to church so people get their feelings hurt going to church and they get their feelings hurt going here though well I don't believe in Preachers no more I don't believe in going to church no more I got hurt I ain't going back there's too many Hypocrites at church I guess I just have maybe a slight problem with that so those of you that are going to Longhorn after service today for church for lunch others of you are going here and there and there now of course you will do this the same way that you do church right that you will go in and say I will not eat in this place if there's any hypocrite yet all gays all homosexuals all liars all out while I hate oh I see it's written on your face you don't have to say one word so you have one standard for church and another standard for your favorite restaurant now if you go to Walmart after after you eat your lunch then and I suppose you go up to the service desk and you take the microphone a Ted shot a 10 shot all liars all whoremongers all thieves all women with verses on all this and that other leave until me and my family are done shopping and then you can come back or I will not shop at Walmart you'll be waving on your way out because they will throw you out so what does Satan want to do have any y'all ever noticed you can be feeling wonderful on Monday morning to go to work another work day oh man alive it's Monday it's Monday it's Monday here I go I'm telling you what and then Wednesday comes close to the midweek service Tuesday evening oh my tummy hurts and then Wednesday morning you get up go work how are you oh I'm feeling so good Wednesday evening gonna be able to go to church I don't think so and people that don't believe in miracles they ought to watch people on Thursday morning because I'm thirsty morning they get up and go to work how are you today I'm a chipper is a squirrel and a hickory nut pal I'm telling you what I feel so great I don't know what nowhere will happen it's a miracle it's a miracle uh-huh do you honestly think you're going to be rewarded at that day for how faithful you were to your job to how many days I've worked so many days straight and haven't missed a day do you want a star you want a trophy what are you looking for isn't it amazing some of our priorities when it comes to church we have all church will always be here and I'm going to tell you I won't always be here no it won't well you can go to church anytime no you can't one day the bride will be gone our building may be left but the bride will be gone and people get into such a complex why because Satan knows if there's any place they can go to get helped it's Church where the word is preached and the spirit of God is there and deliverance is there if I was the devil I do my best to keep you out of church too foreign you're afraid to go back to work but it's all going to be all right now just remember if Jesus Christ will tell me who you are wow and that those things are true will you believe and accept it will you do it your name is Mr Wagner that's right that's right go on back to work Hallelujah well your name is misoffended and Mr hurt go on back to church going back to church Hallelujah you're gonna be healed go on back to church go on back to your family go on back to God go on back and let God do something for you Isaiah 53 3 says it this way he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not he become this so he could relate to you listen to the meanings of these words as I said life's not studying I was just overwhelmed by them the word despise means to be held in contempt disdained to be deemed despicable so that's the way people looked at the Lord Jesus he was Despicable and he did that for who for the Despicable to be despicable to be vile and to be worthless worthless worthless he was worth everything was he not but the way they looked at him he was worthless he's despised and rejected of men so he was not admitted into the communication or Fellowship with the lowest of humanity many of the scam as we would call them of the Earth was respected more than he was dear Lord Jesus why he was deemed unworthy born illegitimate born out of wedlock so they thought claimed God was his father a man like that has ever been slided before by people oh really why I thought there'd been more than that how many's ever feel like people just kind of ignored you you know they'd see so and so and so and so and boy they just make over them and they'd look at you and look right at you and you think yeah I am as big as an elephant they don't even see me and it it hurts you don't it it hurts you now if you're not careful that hurt will turn into resentment and that resentment will turn into anger and then you'll find yourself having something against that individual and sometimes it's true that people just don't see us they really don't see us and they don't mean it but yet it goes to building a complex in our minds and the prophet said you imagine that someone has something against you and said really they don't but you imagine they do and in your imagination you imagine that it's there and it goes to build up and he said the next thing you know you won't even speak to that person and it's only in your imagination but it was not in Jesus imagination he could hear them whispering they told me he said he was he was a hero he was this one of the Lord have mercy don't even have fellowship with him despised oh God a Man of Sorrows and the word sorrow is pain and it means both physical pain and mental pain so Jesus suffered the physical pain in his body but he also suffered mentally of being rejected not having very many friends when we come right down to it even his disciples went away from him is that right so no matter how low friends you and I have ever been none of us have ever been where he lived and why was it necessary for him to go this way because he knew you and I the making of a gentile bride that we would not only need healing in our bodies but we would need healing from rejection we would need healing from people that want nothing to do with us and some of you have been rejected by mothers fathers by loved ones and Jesus told us it would be that way so we would not be discouraged but all brother Donna you you can't relate to it you know maybe I cannot relate to your hurt but he can he can relate to no matter what you've been through he can relate to it and he can turn it and make you a woman Bride As it were to be one who is after God's Own Heart a woman that he could say many other women have done excellently but thou excellous above them all that was what was said about Bathsheba thou excellous above them all what a woman what a woman what a bride let me close we hear it as it were our faces from him he was despised we esteemed him not you know Isaiah when he prophesied this he said he was a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief in other words he was known by grief I find this amazing that how many of us miss this is one of the attributes of the Lord Jesus that many of us would identify him only by healing brother Daryl would identify him only by Miracles but Jesus partially was known by being hurt can you imagine he was persecuted from the day he was born until the day he died the Lord Jesus grief was such an acquaintance it was around him every day of his life everywhere he went there was grief and sorrow and pain and hurt he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted grief was one of his daily acquaintances oh I'm sure he had Joy I'm sure that there was such happiness inside of him but ended amazing the Bible doesn't say it that way the Bible does not identify him as being acquainted with shouting and the Lord Jesus was just this happy Christian that went around dancing all the time there's no scripture that even says he ever danced at all but his acquaintance was grief oh Lord God why for us his constant companion his constant conversant that was there talking to him grief he was oppressed I found this word amazing to press to drive down to exert demanding pressure oh man a task Massacre or a ruler a tyrant to be hard-pressed he was oppressed and he was afflicted to be bowed down to put down to be depressed can you imagine the Lord Jesus being depressed how many has ever been depressed just feel so sad and you go through things and you know how we are whenever the Lord will allow tests and trials to keep going and going and the pressure bills and bills and oh my we get to a place and then what do we do we go to saying things oh I can't take it no more I I can't handle it I just can't go out I can't do it God if you don't help me I'm going to quit a cat I can't take it no more I can't take it now let's be honest and truthful the most of the time for a seed of God that is not their heart speaking that's the weariness of their human Spirit that's their anxiety how many has ever said it oh lord I can't I just can't go no farther Lord I just can't do it and it ain't tomorrow you're wide open again you don't feel one bit better but you say devil out of my way I shouldn't have mumbled that stuff get out of my way dab on the devil here's what you say he said he don't mean that a bit more nothing I know him but you know what he'll turn right around and condemn you for what you said in your moment of weakness and the Lord Jesus allowed himself to feel depression passion some of you young people think you've got a right to be depressed because you're rejected by other young people in our church or other young people in the message you ain't felt nothing compared to what her Lord lets her but he went lower than you would ever be able to go so he could Encompass every human being on the earth that would trust him not only for salvation but Redemption from depression Oh Glory to God

you see what the doctor say and we're grateful for everything they can do to help us but we know many times they come to the spot they don't know what to do I'm reminded of a woman in the Bible and the Bible says she had suffered many things of Physicians it does not say they helped her at all and she went from one to the other and they took nearly ever Farthing she had and she'd done everything no doubt they told her to do but they could not help her oh but one day she heard about a man coming through town it was a man that was despised and rejected he didn't have a great reputation he didn't have a lot of Honor as far as the people was concerned but somehow she believed if I can touch but the hymn of His Garment I will be made whole she did not have a quote she did not have a scripture but she had a revelation from God hallelujah father in the name of Jesus May brother Michael may receive his touch today Lord while your anointing is here while the angels of God are walking

times I cannot stop drinking I've tried everything blessed sis have you tried Jesus you just lay your alcohol right here and take his forgiveness take his freedom enjoy his freedom I'll never forget it I begin to pray for that young girl she began to scream I'm free I'm free and by the grace of God I was there just you're so ago she came up to me she said brother that's been two years and I'm still sober I said you see because whom the son is made free is free indeed Barabbas that day of that jail cell the door was open said you're free he said in your trick you want to you want me to go

come and said trouble the master no more your little girl's gone it's over but Jesus gave him the antidote to every negative report he just touched him on the shoulder and said only believe I know

is science I sent and said it brother Brown prayed for his church and prayed for himself and asked God to forgive them and he wanted God to forgive them not for drinking not from lying running around committing adultery but he asks that God would forgive them for their sinful fears I saw what a statement that God would forgive them for their fears I'd say there's probably more than just Branham Tabernacle that needs that today he's done so much for us why would we fear and yet we do and if we're not careful he'll overwhelm us I mean those it's the truth but having no unique God's help today to help you get away from those sinful fears God bless you such a privilege for us to be together today remember the Harry sing and it will will be dismissed as you feel that you want to go service here again Wednesday night we had to put a few more protection things up in front of the heat pumps at the church so we've got 14 more of those to put up tomorrow and they'll come hopefully and

good to to have this invitation uh to be able to stand before you once again now um I I can only be who I am Saints and so that's what you're going to hear today that's what you're going to see today

any problems with it the pastor extended the invitation so blame it on him talk to brother Donnie when he gets back home do you love him yes turn with with me to Isaiah 14 Isaiah 14 beginning at verse 13 amen somebody say 11:40 put that watch down okay good 11:40 amen and I will say this I I usually do this when I'm out ministering but I I'll go ahead and take care of it now I'll just go ahead and let you know in closing I'm closing now okay I'm wrapping things up right now right in the beginning Isaiah 14 verse 13 Isaiah 14 and 13 for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation ation in the sides of the north verse 14 I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high Isaiah 14:5 says yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit I'm going to give you a little time to say what you got to say but let me know let me let you know one thing devil you're going to be brought down sometimes it's best to let people just get it out whatever they got to say don't interrupt them don't stop them but let them know once they finish who you are in Christ huh let the devil Rumble let the devil Roar let the devil say what he's going to say let the devil do what he's going to do just give him that space because we know who we are and we know in the from this message that that this bride this body knows what he wants that's a powerful thing that she knows what he wants done with the word so let's get to getting little bride m yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit that they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroy the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners let us bow our hearts and our heads father as I bow my head I can just hear the old song that father I bow my head to thee I stretch my arms to thee no other help I know so Lord I'm depending upon you the people are in under expectation to hear from you and father we count it as we were just sharing with them truly an honor and a privilege to be able to stand and and bring this word and if there's anything good that would come forth out of these lips today it would be some something that's of Eternal quality something's of of Eternal value cuz Lord I I have nothing in this life to to to render or to give to bring I'm not a wealthy person don't come from from stock that that uh the Silver Spoon wasn't wasn't in my mouth when I came forth Lord just an old poor boy from the hills of Virginia just growing up but Lord out God I'm just a a simple person as you know so Lord if you would come then we would be benefited by our gathering may we not miss it may we receive from you may we hear your voice may we respond to your inspiration and fall under the inunction of the message of this hour this father is more than words that You' brought to this age this is a word that is to prepare us to take a body change and as we tra through time as we go through our thing called life Lord may we be illuminators to those around us before we don't know who is and who isn't and Lord I don't even know what people are going through today that's assembled here this morning but I do know this that we all need you we need your help so Lord that's what we're here today just reporting to duty service for you the speaker and the hearers together may we be blessed and it's in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may have your seats God is so good amen I'll get it in a minute as I often say I pay good money for this thing I want it to be seen I won't take it off just now it's okay y'all know who I am I'm not prideful like that just to say it as a joke I guess but I I want to just as as we can while we're here rather if if you would just go with me my little thought dethroning a king and this little booger here that we just read about he thinks that he's something even the thing that's so striking to me is that even after all this time that he's had to do what he's doing he still thinks he's something H and he still thinks he can can can throw his bluff and and and there are sometimes he does a pretty good job you know he gets us down gets us discouraged we go through grief we go through these seasons and of life and all these shadows and all of these things but as we were saying this bride knows what he wants done with this word even when she's low even when she's down even when she's discouraged she still has the very heartbeat of God within her your kids acting up stand in your position yeah your husband ain't doing right stand in your position sis throning a king a throne in verse 13 as we see that he says I will exalt my throne above the stars of God so watch him watch watch watch the watch the devil watch this old Slicker in this instance when and and he does this so uh eloquently and so uh he he's he's a master at it he watch him as he begins to throw out words and as he's beginning to speak it's all in order to deceive and to realign an individual's identity huh using words to realign someone's purpose their identity because when we hear the word throne what do we think of we think of a king we think of a king we think of these things so he's using words that that through the the mind when you hear that word you think well this guy he he must he must have a a pretty high position he he must be the king since he sits on a the throne right yeah Proverbs 23 and6 says uh eat not eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty meals because as you think so are you yeah amen Proverbs 23:7 says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he so the devil is tactfully uh precise in the words that he uses because he has been there and he knows the Power of Words he knows what words have the ability to do we're talking about dethroning a king here Saints for in his heart for as he thinketh in his heart so is he so the devil's wanting you to get to to take on his identity of who he saying that you are yes sir and we we we know that in the age in which we live now that we're in the midst of an identity crisis people really don't know who they are when when when you have the ability to look at them and see that old Adams apple right there for one but what you doing with that skirt on what you doing with that high pitched voice all of these people don't know who they are it's an identity crisis it's time to wake up sitting in the house of God maybe you're here today and don't know who you really are in Christ I'm here to let you know there's a king that's trying to settle in on your life and it's time to Dethrone the king that's sitting and ruling over your life yes Lord H Throne a seat of Honor a stool a royal dignity Authority but dethroning a king dethroning means to remove from the throne to remove from a prominent or powerful position to deprive of any High position or title to depose to take away the power and authority of you know what God wants done with this word this is this is the the prophet meant it or he did not mean it we either take it into our lives and we express it or we don't right because this ride we're being put on display in this age this is more than just words Saints amen this is more than we come to a beautiful Sanctuary a beautiful place have a powerful ministry that's here it's more than that it's time we stand up in our position it's time we stand up in the authority in which we've been called Sir dethroning a king so how did kingship begin so what what actually made a person begin to think that they were so important or so great that they positioned themselves above everyone else and that it gave them this elevated position where in the world did that come from oh huh I found this little expression I thought it was was fitting it says if you own the farm you own the food which is something everyone needs to survive so that makes you the king kingship some of the origins of it essentially there are various models in schools of thought regard excuse me just a moment while I go through this just to set this a little background but there there are various models and and and schools of thought regarding the emergence of a leadership class for instance in it it's in hydraulic civilizations meaning a civilization that is dependent on irrigated agriculture it is assumed that the leadership class were the people who planned the irrigation systems that were vital to everyone's survival you own the farm you own the food you own the people so in these societies that's how it was set up as time went on and these cities prospered the leaders begin watch what they do the leaders begin to assume mystical or mythical qualities which transform them into priests and eventually God Kings of their societies these little kingdoms begin to build up we see it in church people think that they something because they got money or their their dad is the pastor or my uncle's this that and they begin to put themselves in an elevated position and what so sad about it is there are some people that follow along behind that thing on I'm not a Reagan I'm a brown okay I don't need to be a Reagan to think that I'm anything hello I don't descend from the brandom stock all y'all cute folk are getting quiet on me get tight ain't no breaks on me I say so comically all the time with the expression Jesus Take the Wheel I be Jesus take the whole car M I don't want to drive anymore you I just want you to be in control amen people thinking that there's something simply because of from where they came our identity is in Jesus Christ our our our power our Authority is because of the shed blood of Calvary amen that's the only thing that'll do so let's go on note that this is why there is a prevalence of Thrones having mythical answers history which seems to be the Common Thread among all these different civilization models Pharaoh's for for instance claim to trace their ancestry to Horus an actual God in the Egyptian uh Pantheon right even modern Thrones tend to have this myth myth mythical origin with the Throne of England being myth mythically entwined with King Arthur so mythology comes into play that's that's demonology to me today of course we scoff at such claims but the fact is that kingly Thrones were often entwined with mythology to confer a sense of divine legitimacy to the monarchs yeah yeah and they were just mortal beings like everybody else that's right they got up in the morning their hair was all over their head their breath was stinky yeah they had drool running off the side of their face huh they were no different than anybody else but because of this position they begin to think that they were something and the devil moved in on that elevated thought thinking that they were having that I'm somebody you're a nobody come [Applause] on Amen we scoff at such claims today rather Kings emerg let me back up today of course we scoff at such claims but the fact is that kingly Thrones were often entwined with mythology to confer a sense of divine legitimacy to the monarchs and rather Kings emerged from the fusion of leadership classes or leadership roles and a common mythology which effectively created a paradigm that the entire Society can agree on as their reality so they begin to construct this uh this uh uh a style this position and eventually society would follow along behind it so there are spirits that will creep into churches and get behind uh Ministries and things that they're trying to build up a kingdom around themselves on and I was telling you I'm not here to give you anything but Jesus Christ I don't have anything else to give you I said I'm just an old country boy grew up out in the what the what we refer to is the holler oh yeah grew up running around in the summertime no shoes and running through the manure squishing through the toes and playing in the creek and and sanding minnows and catching croads and all of these things and plucking chicken feathers and all of these things yeah going out to the well and carrying the water and toting and fetching water and bringing it into the house with taking a bath in an old number 10 bathtub and heat the water up on the old stove and during the winter time the the old bucket that was there the Dipper that we would use for our water and some of you old folk know I'm only 54 years old but this is a reality to me these are things that that I grew up with so I'm telling you all of this I'm a nobody I'm nothing nothing but Christ makes us everything amen identity is in him you're in the winter time that old Dipper the bucket of water would be frozen solid where the stove had gone out during the night and the house was cold and have all these blankets on top of us be afraid to move in the mornings when you wake up it's you're going to lose your warm spot so you got to lay still I'm a nobody I don't have anything to give you but Jesus Christ Christ if you need my coat I'll let you have that but in that coat when you put it on know that you're putting on Jesus Christ you need some shoes I'll get you some shoes but when you put them on know that you're walking in Holiness cuz why brother Joel why you say that because there there will be a gift to you from the heart and compassion of God himself the Pharaoh doesn't just lead because he plans all the infrastructure projects and has an army to kill any Rebels he's the leader because people actually believe he is descended from the gods and to disobey him is to subvert the will of the Gods just laying a foundation it is that combination that allowed them to rule and with great success and stability for a period longer than the entire Christian era so when I began to look at the history of kingship and we all of this was found and how it came into view I found it fascinating how that that when uh when even with like the Egyptians in particular specifically that when when they um began to to create this power structure and time and time again that that structure that they created would would collapse but there was something on the inside of of these people that concept that demonic construct was so powerful within them that even after that that there it would topple time and time and time again there was something on the inside of them that that was so uh tied within their DNA that they just had to build that thing back huh here you what what is it you're going to think that some man is King and Lord and he has some mythological uh uh entity or position or power what was that it was the it was the power of Hell dethroning a king keep in mind but they were intentional about this thing until he finally that old order was reestablished Rose back up again yeah and it isn't the will of God for man to rule over man no the rejected King the prophet talks about this very principle he says in fact God sent the Holy Ghost to rule in man's hearts and rule in their lives that's who's to be the ruler over our lives not some man not some King not not some Bishop not some Queen God sent the Holy Ghost to rule over our lives and if you can't be led of the Lord then you can't be led of anybody else that's right right he goes on to say in the message rejected King that there are even some who want others to rule over there there are people that that want people to rule over them he says but man Wants to Rule and Rule over man and man wants man to rule over him he doesn't want to have God to rule if God is Not ruling in your life then there's another king that's dictating what you do there's another king taking rule in your life and we're here today to help you destroy that King to help you Dethrone that King yes sir sir it's laying Foundation it's a demonic construct Luke 10:18 says and he said unto them I beheld Satan as Lightning fallen from heaven and we know this instance in the scriptures that he he'd sent 60 away two by two to go do his work to go uh uh to compel people and to go uh Minister and do all of these things and they come back all excited the devils are subject unto us and then he picks it up here and he begins to speak to them and he says and he said unto them I beheld Satan as Lightning falling from heaven verse 19 in Luke uh 10 behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and I declare to you today if it was good enough for them it's good enough for me that's right it's good enough for us it's good enough for Word of Life the power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing nothing by any means shall hurt you you oh it may hurt this but it ain't going to hurt this Soul you may get me down sometime devil but I guarantee you I'm going to get back up there's something about of True Believer even when they are down there's something on the inside of them that causes them to get back up you keep rallying around that son of yours you keep rallying around that daughter of yours there's something on the inside of you that's able to stand even for them when they can't don't give up on them say as I say kids you can't eat them for breakfast and you can't kill them get in trouble notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven he says behold I I saw him falling from Heaven the Shining Light begin to fall from heaven heaven the seat of Order of Things Eternal and consant perfect so he says I saw him fall as a Shining Light from heaven so this thing that was from the Eternal and as that definition says consumat perfect where God dwells in other Heavenly beings so he was uh an eternal he was uh uh he was a Heavenly being that fell as a Shining Light and what's amazing to me is that God watched him as he fell yeah think about it God watching this eternal creature this Heavenly being this this uh consant perfect being far watching him fall that word beheld is a Greek word it means to be a spectator God was a spectator to look at to behold to perceive with the eyes to discern to ascertain find out by seeing this word listen this this word is not used of an indifferent spectator but of one who looks at a thing with interest and of a purpose with a purpose it would be used of a general officially reviewing or inspecting his army of a lay spectator looking at a parade so God says I beheld Satan I watch this this this being this heavenly being fall and as I begin to look at this and and as I begin to see that definition I began to think why didn't God stop him why didn't God catch him in his fall why didn't God stop him from falling Jesus of Nazareth in 1958 the prophet says the woman touched His Garment virtue went out and she got her healing but there was a Roman soldier who put a band of Rags around his head and hit him on the head with a stick and said prophesier tell us who hit you and we'll believe you he never open his mouth and said a word to him God doesn't clown he doesn't have to he's God you're the one that needs to plead for Mercy come on God why aren't you catching Me I'm Falling why isn't God catching you in your condition where you are now you are the one that needs to plead for mercy so bound up in the condition that you're in your thinking is that you're going to always be this way I'm going to always to fight this thing dethroning a king today h this one that's falling you're the one that needs to plead for mercy your inment to God and not God to you it's your inment and not his he's done everything he can to redeem you what more do you want God to do on what more can he do he died he gave his life he even picked that life and and Rose it up again so all the world could see I'm back I'm here there is nothing more that God can do for you my brother my sister get get a hold get a grip on this thing my goodness dethroning a king it's your edent he's done everything he can to redeem you sending signs wonders Miracles send his son and he died he sent Pro and so forth and still they were they weighed right on in sin as if he had never been anything to happen just stepping over the grace and mercy of God as though nothing had ever happened young people listen to me God has a place and position for you I remember just a few months back I was speaking to the young people and began to talk about the Church of Tomorrow the young people we let's talk about that in order to be the Church of tomorrow you have to be the Church of today right now you better get in while the getting is good old Pastor years ago he used to say he would say get all you can and can all you get you old folk know what I'm talking about Canon laying your bed at night there's the old country boy laying in bed at night and I hear those little pop pop there goes the corn there go go the green beans there goes the the Fatback all that stuff the beets I hate the beets but I'd hear them pop them in the night because why we got all that we could to harvest and we canned everything that we could we couldn't always make it out to the store yes I said sto that's St o r e store for you cute folk I brought my interpreter with me but you're the one that needs to plead for Mercy dethroning a king stepping over right on in sin as if it had never been anything to happen then if you spurn Mercy only one thing's left that's judgment Jo came to church today to hear something happy you were singing those happy songs yeah you can hide in a song you can hide in the worship service but when that word comes to where you are yeah comes right down to your Pew takes a seat right beside you what are you going to do then you spurn Mercy only things left that's judgment if you run a red light listen to what he says and get hit don't blame the city and that's what folks do today they they'll go out and do something wrong then they want to then they want to send a uh bring a lawsuit yeah you're the the one that ran the red light don't blame the city he says you should have stopped amen yes sir you should have clicked off that device let me come down here just a minute you should have been the one to stop it you should have been the one that clicked that device off instead of you were the one that come up to the red light you had that light right in View and you zip right on through you press the gas you're in control Jesus don't take the whe Jesus take the whole car if that's what you got to do turn it off we're talking about dethroning a king my goodness your cute folk are quiet let me hear the church say amen amen let me hear it again amen okay I know it's in you I know it's there not you're the one that needs to plead for Mercy you spurn that Mercy you run a red light and you get hit don't blame the city you should have stopped if you wind up in a Hell someday don't blame God he's waved everything across the front of you that he can wave even the blood of his own holy son and you've constantly waved right on by H the songs of of the church the preaching of the Gospel the reading of the word signs and wonders before you and still blindly just determined to go whether God stops you or not I beheld him falling yes H God ain't going to stop you when the the cry for Mercy is already in you you're just not giving voice to that cry you think I've been in this condition so long there's no way yes there is a way of Escape amen the word that's being presented to you today right now is your opportunity to escape that condition that you're in amen come away my sister come away my brother you're here today you might forget tomorrow what I've said next week but today you can hear the very opportunity of how you can be made free than you Lord in the blood of Jesus Christ and the power that he has given the power that's in that word the prophet says gives us the ability gives us the ability the power in the word of God gives us the ability to to to live an overcoming life yes [Music] sir not just when Mama's around not just when you're in church but every day of your life you have the ability to live an overcoming life every day and this whole thing is going to aggravate you to you leave this thing you know me to say don't get stuck on stupid stupid has sent a lot of people to hell that's a good place to say amen amen trap people in a condition come away from that thing just and still blindly just determine to go whether God stops you or not God sends nobody to hell you send yourself to Hell by rejecting his his son yes sir you step over the boundaries of that word that's your decision and God is not obligated to catch you under the influence of this King this demonic King and his construct that he he seems to project in our minds every day I've got a lot to cover I better hurry up so from the very beginning it was Satan's ambition and desire to be like God in closing it was his desire to be like God and quite FR frankly to be even more than God right he was at one time the original Archangel of God we know these things the simple things he once held the greatest position in heaven outside of God himself but he wasn't confident he wasn't okay with that he wanted to be in a greater position he wanted God's position and that is what he's doing in your life the throne thone of your heart is the seat of God and he's after that Throne he's after that that's why he badges you that's why he bugs you that's why he buffets at you all day because he knows that there's a an eternal quality inside of you and he wants that he wants it he was God's right-hand man to Fellowship in our text as we reading Isaiah 14-13 the Bible say says that in his heart in his heart he got puffed up in his heart he wanted the worship he wanted the recognition he wanted the power he wanted the authority he simply did not have the character to match the Fulfillment of that ambition there was nothing wrong with him having an ambition there's nothing wrong with you having a desire having an ambition to be great be all these things but you have to realize there's character that has to unite with that ambition you got to have character to go with that that's why power apart from character is satanic let me say it this way the prophet said power apart from character is satanic amen maybe that'll help you get a little louder amen out there there if you condition it before and after the prophet said people amen I said the same thing 10 minutes ago and you just sat there like that bump on that pickle hey I'm not here to bring I'm not here to tell you anything that hasn't already been said that's right amen yeah is that all right he got puffed up he didn't have that character to match the Fulfillment of his ambition that's why power apart from character is satanic and we must remember you search this out in the church age book submer Church age that we must remember that character is a what victory character is a victory it's not just given to you you're going to have to work at this thing you say I want to be like brother Donnie bless God Brother Don be talking about these young ministers coming up they think having a position to do all these things where are you been what have you done have you sat long enough in the presence of God to really find out what is it that I'm going to be doing yeah and while I'm here let me just share this just personally just let you in a little bit I know this years ago 1994 when God called me to to preach and as I went as I went on in in in in and in life and things and I began I began to get a little uh a little uncertain Lord what what is it you want me to do where you want me to go and people be asking me are you getting out and preaching you I what wasn't going out very much but I found out that that my calling at that as as U my family began to grow that that I was needed more at home now I had invitations to go all over the world to be honest with you but I just didn't yeah sometimes people don't understand the Simplicity of God that's right and they think because this one is doing that then everybody else needs to follow that and do that but you need to find out your purpose your calling your gift as your pastor he's been telling us it's essential it's important to the functioning of the body because when there's a need that arises in the body there has to be some part of that body that can go and minister to that need at that time at that moment and when the purpose of that function is over then somebody else will pick it up later that's that's what it's all about it's not all it's not about just one person I'm going to shut up I need to leave that alone my goodness you tell me cross the way here which way am I cross the way here in the F PA how could have all of that transpired and been uh undertaken all of that with just one person or just 10 or 20 it took the body to function to do and when when some parts of the body got tired and they couldn't make it CU they had to work or whatever they had to do there was somebody else there to f a spot why because the body was learning to function as a whole after all a person without character cannot Reign Romans 8:17 and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together I got I hurry up I got so much but dethroning a king for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen if so that we suffer with him that's the Bible suffer with him let me ask you a question what has Satan suffered he's wanting this position in your life what has he suffer to get that position and you're just going to just just easily hand it over to him hand over your life here here's my private life here's my bedroom life here's here's here's my life when I'm at school here's my life when I'm on the job here you can have it just you know just going along with the devil he has not suffered to have the quality of the queen under his control you are more than that little bride you are more than that you said brother Joel I don't know if I'm bride or not I can't help you I'm not here to tell you that you are I'm just here to tell you what this message has said what the word of God has said if you're a crow stay a crow but if you're an eagle get get those wings set cuz it's time to take flight [Applause] am I can't tell you who you are precisely I can tell you who you should be or who you should be beginning to think that you are and begin to believe that so what exactly has Satan suffered the simple fact is character is never made without suffering and he's wanting this character he's wanting this power he's wanting this position in your life what has that devil suffered and then you going to just blindly give over yourself to him oh my and take on his identity and feed his you use his slot as your sustenance my amen the simple fact is character is never made without suffering it's a victory not a gift questions and answers in 1959 so Luci luer is on Earth today 1959 2024 I can say it bring it up to date Lucifer is on Earth today what is he doing brother Brandon trying to work in the church to accomplish the same purpose that he started before the foundation of the world why has he not given up because he knows the value of what he's wanting and if he has enough sense to know what value is in the bride why should I not understand the value and worth that's inside of me and not just give over my life my time my energy my mind everything just hand it over to the devil when I was weak brother jelan I got caught in a I don't care about weakness this is a time to stand up in the strength of who you are in Christ we're not on a picnic we're in the war we're in a battle yes you're going to get tired yes you're going to get weary but you still have to fight you fight on oh you fight on keep your hand oh my we've got to fight Saints don't give up don't get weary in your well dooing I know your kids are Knuckleheads but you don't get weary in that wello you fight on you still believe for your children you said brother Jo are strung out on drugs they're in jail they're doped up they're prostituting themselves you fight on you still believe dethroning a king So Luther is on the Earth today trying to work in the church to accomplish the same purpose that he started before the foundation of the world Lucifer was kicked out of heaven and somehow somehow the devil positioned himself between the angels and God and he ascended himself above those Stars the prophet words it that way the Stars meaning the sons of God now and preached to them and deceive 2third of them so he positioned himself between the themselves and God between the angels and God that view of calvary should be very crisp should be very clear should be in full Focus every day of our lives and if it is not whatever standing between you and your view of Calvary has at that time become your God you can believe it if you want to your pastor he's told us the same thing dethroning a king CU When he did this he saw it was effective so he did the same thing with Eve he's doing the same thing today you're sitting here looking at me you're listening to me but you ain't hearing me this is your day to Dethrone that King in your life I admonish you do not walk out those doors unless until you have given yourself full till you fully surrendered to Jesus Christ the word the life the Eternal qualities that we need to survive in this age amen you say well that's just you brother Joel you're right it is just me it is I'm of no value to you but God is getting your attention today right Prophet tells us I'm just paraphrasing you can only live an overcoming life if you receive the word that's coming from the men that are sent to you to bring the word dethroning a king he did the same thing with Eve he obstructed Eve's view Matthew 8:16 when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were SI that word possessed is a Greek word and I don't want to get lost in the words so much but as I was talking about Satan come and he used the word throne he took a word and when he threw that word out it begin begin to set up in the minds of the Angels hm yeah that must be him so it's important when when you're hearing the meanings of some words it's important to to hear these meanings because it will help you understand the real meaning and not your understanding of what you think that word is okay that's what I'm doing today but but that word possessed means to be under the power of a demon the power of a demon yeah the devil's real yes the devil has power he's strong he's Mighty in the New Testament these are persons Afflicted with especially severe diseases either e bodily or mentally such as paralysis blindness deafness loss of speech epilepsy Melancholy Insanity Etc whose bodies in the opinion of the Jews demons had entered so the Jews believ when someone was possessed a demon had entered that body and so held possession of them as not only to afflict them with ills but also to Dethrone the reason and take its place themselves stealing their identity oh blinding them to the realities of who they are paralysis all of these different ills and malities within the body in their sicken condition and state they begin to lose uh an understanding of who they were well if I was laying here if I you know laying here on my back with cancer I'm dying should the Lord don't love me anymore yes he still loves you but Jo I'm battling this thing you don't he still loves you amen so that's what these people that were possessed but also to Dethrone the reason and take its place themselves accordingly the possessed were want to express the mind and consciousness of the Demons dwelling in them they begin to talk the devil's talk they begin to walk the way the devil walked they begin to think the way the demons told them to think so they took on the animation of a demon here in the body coming to church praise God got my Bible under my arm and possessed with a devil this is real yes it is this is real dethroning a king and their cure was thought to require the expulsion of the demon brother Joel Brown says amen that's the only thing that's going to help you is to be delivered of that demon amen but I go to Word of Life I don't care where you call your home church if it's something that's preventing you from seeing who you are it's a demon your demon possessed come on now the last time I checked 2 + 2 was four this is simple math this is a simple understanding of your walk with the Lord you wrapped up you think you all so holy righteous ah no I don't I know better than that mm- this old boy fight Stu too woo yes huh praise God and I blame it on my wife I blame it on my kids I blame it on my friends I blame it on no I blame it on me see it's easy to blame it on some shut up Joel get on with this you got my goodness got to hurry but in all those the L of speeech definites this epilepsy what I want to focus on this word Melancholy for just a moment possessed with Melancholy what exactly is that Melancholy has multiple meanings including a sad mood a state of depression or a serious thoughtfulness sad Moon meaning sad mood meaning a sad or gloomy State of Mind especially when it's prolonged or habitual coming to church in a sad mood for example you might describe a piece of music or Autumn days as Melancholy depression a condition characterized by a depressed mood bondly complaints and sometimes hallucinations and delusions so the devil will start something in your mind and begin to to to orchestrate it such that it it'll move into your body and you'll begin uh uh exemplifying some some conditions in your body and it starts in your mind it starts up here what does the prophet says he talks about the a little girl he says I see you your dog was running after you run up the steps and all these things that that was a scar in her mind but it set up other conditions in our body you're not sick so much something going on in your mind Melancholy a depressed sad mood sh it's okay you say Amen know where I am all right depression serious thoughtfulness a state of sober thoughtfulness or pensiveness symptoms of melancholy include melancholic sad somber despondency and dejection Melancholy is beyond sad it is a word for the gloomiest of spirits so that they were bringing people to Jesus in this condition and other conditions but I wanted to focus on just that one just for a moment so they were wrapped up in sorrow ful thoughts why because of the bumps of life and things that had happened things just happen life sometimes gets in the way of us doing what God wants us to do and when that happens that don't take away your Eternal quality amen you're still in Christ symptoms are similar to but are more severe than depression and when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed Matthew 8:16 I'll read it again with devils and he cast out the spirits watch this he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick how did their healing come through a word word remember the what the devil was doing with words he would take a word and he would say well this is this is this is this word whatever he'd say and the people yes but their understanding of that word was skewed because it was coming from a demonic anointing sure you're sick but the devil put that on you yes I know you're sick but who are you in Christ amen my goodness it was the utterance of a living voice Matthew 4:24 and his Fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse disease and torments they were taken with these things and the bringing them to Jesus you've come into this room today with whatever your situation is you've come to Jesus you've come to the word not to me not to the brothers who if you come up for pray not the brothers who will lay hands on but you're coming to the word you're coming to Jesus Christ himself in order to Dethrone that King in order to be delivered in order to be healed of these these conditions and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the py and he healed them so all of these things are mixed up and they're bringing them to Jesus heal them that word taken they were taken with divers disease that word taken means to hold together with constraint to compress and sometimes the devil will get us in such a mental condition sometimes he will press him he will get us in that condition so tight we say that we think there's no way I can get out of this to press together with the hand to hold one ears to shut the heavens that it may not rain you haven't heard God where are you I haven't heard you speak the devil is captivated your perception and it's time to Dethrone that King to press on every side of a besieged city like a straight forces a ship into a narrow channel that ship is too big your Experiencing God is too big to go down that path you're too important to God to be found in that condition amen giving your time your eyes your attention your heart your passions to that thing you're too great of a creature and being in Christ to go where you've been to stay and remain where you are like a cattle squeeze pushing in on each side forcing the Beast into a position where it cannot move so the farmer can administer medication you've come here to church today and the great farmer God is here to Minister some medication but the devil has you in such a tight place come on it's time to receive the word of God to hold completely the devil's purpose his ambition his goal his directive is to hold you completely in that condition it's time to Dethrone the king that word torments means a touchstone it it means the Rack or instrument of torture by which one is fored to divulge the truth the devil will get you in that condition who's are you who's are you oh I'm Yours devil I'm Yours devil well come over here and look at this I'm yours I'll go I'll do that www.h.com and you go it right on up in there I remember one time years ago I was at my mama's house back in Virginia and i' heard brother Donnie our pastor lovely wonderful Pastor talk about www. don't do this www.hl.com this is years ago I don't know what to do now so I said hm let me see what that'll do so I did it yeah again don't you do it I'm telling you what I did it's is not an excuse for you to but as soon as I hit that enter the screen just so slowly Fades black I'm in hell. it's okay and then just as it as it went dark it slowly faded back up just a little faint light and you know what that site was asking me to put my name in to go on a waiting list there was so many people wanting to get into hell that had to go on a waiting I didn't go on a waiting list but I thought who who in their right mind would sign their name and want to go to hell but you're sitting here today that's good trapped in a condition that you think that you cannot be delivered from get off the list brother get off the list sis I make a good song won't it get off the list sis yes sir dethroning a king I've done run out my time 45 minutes is about the time they say that that you hold people's attention say amen amen okay y'all still awake good see they only sang One song so you know I got a little bit more time but an obstructed View and the serpent Lucifer son of the morning he's got all kinds of names he saw what God was doing and said within his heart within his heart remember the script scripture a reading he said within his heart I want that that's what I want H I want a heaven I want an Eden I want a wife I want an eve he was pouting I want that God won't let me have it so as I asked the question earlier what has the devil suffered he thinks his pouting is suffering nah pouting can't equate to suffering you know how kids are they a little pout and think they just going through the worst thing ever they just want what they're want they're wanting you to give into it that's what the devil is wanting you to do he's just like an old pouting snotty nose full diapered kid diaper full of mess huh he ain't about nothing he's wanting to take away your experience he's wanting ultimately your very life yes pounding can never be equated as suffering Ahab he began to pout because naboth would not break the traditions of God and the laws of God and give up his place he was after naboth's position he was after naboth's possession right and Nebo said nope not today devil because naboth had a revelation NE knew that God said that this is your land Nebo amen I'm here to declare to you today that this is your land my sister and my brother this is your possession and naboth knew that it was his Heritage and he knew that he must keep it in order that he could hand it down to the successive Generations some of you young people sitting here today just new parents and just little babies swaddling babies You' have a Heritage to pass down to that child and there baby strains in your family that you're going to have to fight to defend and protect that child amen 2+ 2 is four but he KN he had this heritage why because Satan was after the to establish dominance and position himself as king over nebo's nebo's Heritage nebo's possession and Satan attacked the mind or the intellect of Eve so he brought educational Enlightenment if he could get to the mind he had Direct access to her heart get the mind you have access to the heart and if he had her heart she could easily be swayed by every wind of Doctrine huh he starts in the mind the words that he uses to get to the heart because once he was able to do that to swear there was no longer to put up a fight I feel comfortable here feeling comfortable in chat rooms sometimes I wish there wasn't anything right here I'd preach and hide back here where y'all can't see me feeling comfortable on websites the devil is causing you to feel comfortable dethroning a king that's all I'm saying today that's all I'm trying to get your attention to be brought to it's time to Dethrone that King yeah because the exponential nature of a destructive situation is much broader than you think you say to yourself well it's just me it's it's only just me no it's more than that hear me Saints it's more than it's time to Dethrone the king it's time to throw up our hands in a sign of surrender the greatest battle ever fought well that's the way it is Friends Satan tries to be hypocritical about it he tries to show you something better an easier way a more sensible plan but there is no more sensible plan than that God laid down at the beginning right so why are we listening to what the devil says the plan has already been laid out thank you Lord and you've already said amen to the word I heard you there's nothing more to rest upon the battle raged when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reason her reasonings where did she get those reasoning from the devil had planted these words in her mind he's trying to change her identity he's trying to give her an understanding of who she is by what he is he's trying to give her his identity that's the flu it come in that's the channel it run down her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned her eyes with sight watch this she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome far better than her own husband what's she doing looking at what what are you doing looking at somebody else something else other than the word of God he said but Joel you just don't know I don't need to know it's a devil you're under the possession of a demonic Spirit I've been there too ask your pastor this when he gets back I don't mean to keep throwing off saying he's not my pastor too but just to make it ring true ask your pastor if he's ever been under demonic spirit before come on I can answer the question right now for you he'll say yes ma'am yes sir sir absolutely why because he's a mortal being trapped in a body of time amen you cute folk welcome to Word of Life Church thank you for coming today we believe in the power of the word of God here at Word of Life Church we believe in Deliverance from demonic spirits we'll see you at the altar shortly amen keep your seat you can have it is that important to you H oh my that's the fluid come in her eyes with sight she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome far better than her husband he was the most subtle all the Beast of the field and he was probably a fairer man than her husband he looked like a great masculine Beast standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was and the first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reasonings caught it human reasonings not God's reasonings but human reasonings CTIC and she says why wouldn't that be a thrill he injected into her a a word he presented a word to her and it came into her mind and that's the thing he does to a woman today some woman with a lovely little husband finds some great big masculine man that's that man this man will try to opening up her reasonings remember that's Satan that's the devil or vice versa man to woman woman to man either way what does he do work in that reasoning power that conscience where something begins to move through but God gives but but but give God's word the first place the first place when the Devil comes in say not today devil God's got first place in my life [Applause] amen a man can't even he can't sin here it is this coming fresh the prophet says a man cannot sin until first he cast aside God's word yeah I'll leave that alone 2 Corinthians 10:4 we're going to the Musicians would well oh my goodness wow now this hold off just just give me about oh my goodness I'm sorry um let's see 2 Corinthians 10:4 for the weapons of our war are not carnal But Mighty made possible through God to the pulling down to the destruction to the demolition of strongholds the word of God is powerful that's what you need in your life is the word of God and it the word will be what you need to bring destruction and demolition to the kingdom that has encamped and enshrouded your life amen the word of God the power that's rest that's in this word casting down imaginations casting down these reasonings all of these reckonings these computations in our mind casting them down and having in a Readiness Watch this once you cast this thing down you will have within you a Readiness to Revenge all disobedience the Lord it don't get any more simpler than this this is the word of God having in a having in a Readiness to Revenge that word means that word Readiness means to to to be prepared so when you cast all these things aside the reasonings of our Humanity we have a preparation within us to revenge or to vindicate our right to protect to avenge a thing to punish a person for a thing we have the power the ability and the knowhow to punish the devil for what he's doing in our lives amen this is the word of God h Lunch will be all right just give me just a few more minutes I'm sorry when your obedience is fulfilled compliance and submission follow submitted and compliant to what Christ submitted and compliant to what brother the anointed one submitted and compliant to what the word word of God his anointed purpose for your life yes Lord that's how you can get in a position to know what God wants you to do in your life is submit to the word of God his word in his people doing the very things he did when he was here did you not hear what I just said his word in you will allow you to do what he was doing back then amen why because it's an eternal word it's a word that will last from here and will blend on into eternity my goodness F AI t h in the word of God it becomes an atomic bomb the prophet says let's not use a 22 rifle greatest battle ever fought let's get an atomic bomb let's do the job right musicians come let's get God's atomic bomb what is it brother Bram F AI t h in his word is that atomic bomb that's God's atomic bomb and it blows sickness and devil right and left and it annihilates them discriminates oh it's justs destroys it disintegrates everything it disintegrates everything your past everything that you did everything that you're doing everything that you're involved in now it that atomic bomb of the word of God will disintegrate all of that getting hung up thinking I'm going to all no you won't always be this way today is the day of salvation today is the day of Deliverance dethroning a king that's ungodly when with the disintegrates everything that's ungodly when that bomb of Faith drops in there with the word of God behind it it blows every devil every sickness every disease full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the Token just little nuggets and nothing else blessed is he that does all of his Comm Commandments he might have right to the Tree of Life Isaiah 19 59:16 and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak verse 59 and 18 according to their deeds accordingly he will repay Fury to his adversaries Rec to his enemies to the to the islands he will repay recompense simply it gets to the point saints that the individual you have to get to a point where you're simply

the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him crown means a mark of royal Royal heir or in general exalted rank the wreath or Garland which was given as a prize to Victors in public games you you are not just a conqueror you are more than a conqueror that's the Bible Saint stand with me you are more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus my goodness dethroning a King James 4:7

bedroom he'll flee from he'll he'll get you away he you will get yourself away from the music that you're listening to the people people that you're hanging out with the things that you're doing

submit yourself under to God and just find you a little comfortable place in him and submit yourself under that Authority that power yes sir when you do that the Bible is clear and it says and the

contemplate why he's doing what he's done and when he does what he does we've learned to trust him that way and know that he makes absolutely no mistakes and did a wonderful privilege for us to be able to be gathered together here today in the house of the Lord and to be able to come and worship and receive and not only get from him but give back to him many people have it one-sided when they come to church well I need this and I need that and I need something else well you figure he needs today I think he needs to hear from us that we love him so much and we're trusting him and we're longing for the day when we're going to be changed and I want him to be a part of this service not only just giving but being able to receive yeah God bless you if I get this crazy I appeared to work boy it's going to be one of them kind of services I can see already look out devil God bless you and we are here it was working perfectly fine before I came out yeah it's okay Matthew chapter 7. verse 7 and 8. hmm get me that other one I reckon I'm going to start carrying three of them yeah whatever that's right we do whatever we need to do don't we Matthew chapter 7. verse 7. all right this is the words of the Lord Jesus now thank you ask and it shall be given unto you so I asked for another app iPad and I got one ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asks us not everyone that asks one time and that was it but ask us you're just continuing to ask for everyone that asks us receiveth he that seeketh not salt one time in past tense but he that seeketh findeth and to him that Marcus which is continually Lord I need this amen sometimes you ought to keep right on knocking sometimes you might have to knock a few Devils on the head while you're knocking but you just keep on knocking right because we're persistent he that notice to him that asketh everyone that asketh receiveth he that seeketh findeth to him that knock us it shall be opened I love the way that Jesus said this and remember this was an Aramaic whenever he said it and the words was that to him that is constant at the throne of grace who continues knocking at the door of Mercy will have no denial will have no denial but it shall be opened to him and you'll have entrance into the holiest of holies know this again in Matthew chapter 17 verse 20. and remember these aren't my words now these aren't the words of some man but exit the words of the Lord Jesus himself to his people Jesus said unto them we read this Wednesday night because of your unbelief will really I say unto you remember they couldn't cast out the devil and that asked the Lord Jesus why so he answers them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as of a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hints to Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you I guess the question is this do we actually believe this is true you actually believe it's the truth or would we say well I've tried that and it didn't work well I know another person who tried it and didn't work that has nothing to do with his word his word is always right John chapter 16 verse 24. hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full how many knows what that's like to experience it whenever God answers a prayer and it just it just does something to you I mean a lot to be remembered today as we pray and approach the word Heavenly Father we love you so much we're so grateful Lord for the opportunity that we can be gathered together today Lord Jesus we thank you your God we bring before you our needs our desires our petitions but that's only part of the reason that we're here today we're here to minister to you because you are our husband Our Redeemer Our Savior you have done so much for us if you never answered one more prayer we have enough to thank you for for eternity but we believe you're going to keep right on answering and get right on moving because as we go on our needs seem like they become greater and greater and the things we Face become greater but we believe your power is greater than anything we'll ever face speak to us today help me Lord to be able to get out of the way I need you so much help me Lord Jesus I pray it's in the name of the word we ask it amen God bless you you may be seated again I'd like to speak to you today on the brides Bill of Rights as I look around this darkened world that we're in every day you see pain stress anxiety sin sickness evil rottenness of the world corruption you see people that are so Bound by things of the world and they live their life from day to day and just simply try to exist until they get to a spot to where they think it just ain't worth living anymore and they take their life or they go out and take the lives of others and then have their lives taken by police officers which is such a sad thing to end your life in such a way and go out of this world into the presence of God lost and yet on the other hand I look at people that are Christians people that love God people that serve him go to church live right do things that are right pay their tithes have a faithful attendance to a church somewhere they love the Lord Jesus they clap they clap their hands and singing's going on they actually sing and then they just participate in worship and yet some of those are just as bound in their own way with either sins or shortcomings and when I look into the word is what the Lord has provided for us as his people I don't mind telling you it breaks my heart because if all he would have done would have purchased salvation for us and said now from this point on I won't heal you I won't deliver you I won't give you anything else but I just give you a one-way ticket and then don't ask me for anything else that would in itself would be enough to be thankful for would it not but when we look at the full coverage of benefits that he said in his word of what he wants us to have and then we see so many people that fall so short of what God wants them to have I wonder how it makes him feel as I look at it as just a mere mortal man like the rest of you humans are and if it breaks my heart seeing people fall short of what God intended for them to have I wonder how much more it makes him as if though he only made a way for us to be saved and basically live the rest of our life with some Sadness and Sorrow and such heavy burdens as if though he paid no price for that we act sometimes as if though Our God has no promise of Joy he has no promise of overcoming and of Deliverance and yet it is one of our our rights as the people of God to be able to to overcome I may believe that so the Lord doesn't just want us to survive I don't want to be a Survivor no I I just I just don't want to be a Survivor I want to be an overcomer I want to be a conqueror praise the Lord not only do I want to be I am now I hope there's more of you and I believe there are setting here with me today and you could raise your hand and say I am too by God's grace but yet there may be people here this morning and maybe some of you that are overcoming in certain capacities of your life and yet you're defeated in other capacities of your life to me to be a Christian and to live a defeated life it's so sad I deal with some all the time and my Journeys around this world praying for people even counseling with pastors and with preachers and ministers and hearing the things that preachers themselves will deal with and hearing that preachers sometimes themselves live less than a Victorious Life it's a sad scenario especially when we think that our God purchased the full benefit look friend we don't just have liability we've got full coverage he didn't just say okay you're saved and then that's the end of it we've got full coverage as a matter of fact David said he Lotus me daily with his benefits I think that uncovered everything that we will ever need from the day we get saved to the day we leave this world but yet how is it then that so many are able to be a Christian and have a walk with the Lord today brother Donnie yes they have a walk with the Lord and they love the Lord and he loves them and yet they're living here when he wants them to be up here and I forget living where maybe some great man of God some Prophet like our prophet of the age none of us will never live they will never have the Walkers God he had were not ordained to I don't want that myself I want what God ordained for me to have that's my personal possession maybe some of you will have something with God I could only dream about well I'm not going to be jealous because you do I just want to have what's got my name on it that's what I want for me and if it is mine I don't understand why that I shouldn't have it what about you and I believe according to the word that overcoming is one of those rights that God has given to us and yet it is something we will have to fight for every day of our life now when I mention overcome maybe in your mind you'll go here there and there you'll think of certain people well I know brother so-and-so you know he's dating with maybe smoking or so-and-so's dealing with uh they have a problem with drinking or they're having a problem with this or that or the other it's not just always that some of the greatest things that I've found that people can deal with and they need to overcome it's things that are hidden so deep within themselves hardly nobody else even knows they fight it but yet they find it nonetheless it can be interferes that are so interwoven in their spirit in things that happen to them whenever they were children it can be trauma that was induced to them by someone else and they didn't even do anything themselves to cause it and can be so heavy inside out of them and they're afraid to let anyone even know anything about it and yet they deal with it day by day or week by week you know I don't believe the Lord Jesus wants us to deal with such nonsense I believe he's sure today to set us free from such if we will allow it now overcoming is a great thing it can be a temper it can be anger it can be resentment either toward someone you love someone you go to church with or what's even worse resentment toward God you see many people and God will take a loved one or God won't hear a prayer the way they prayed him and the way they thought God should answer they will start with a little bit of an attitude and it will build and build over time until it becomes such a resentment toward God that quit praying they quit talking to him they quit going to his house and the next thing you know they've got a real issue and if they let it go far enough they'll eventually backslide and turn so against God they will hate him with such a degree the same degree that they loved him before because they never overcome that resentment and it's not just that it can be toward God but it can be toward people I dare say there's not a person here today that has not been hurt let down used abused betrayed whatever words we want to use to describe that we have all been affected by other people how many have we we've been let down we've been disappointed sometimes it can be family members it can be close friends it can be a preacher it can be whoever a deacon a trustee whoever that we have respect for and Satan will try his best to turn that inward on you you see Paul use the word when he defined it well about bitterness and Paul described this bitterness not as a tree not as a plant but he described it as a root so the Bible then identifies this as a root of bitterness and where does the root grow a root grows deep within the Earth it can be there for years and years nobody ever even know it's there but the person who has it and then all of a sudden it'll begin to shoot up out of the ground though it's been in their heart for a long long time bitterness against a husband bitterness against a wife and truly when we are hurt deep it takes the spirit of God to help us but let me just give you a warning if you do not let the spirit of God help you deal with bitterness and be able to get an attitude out of your heart it will zap your Victory before God but brother Donnie you don't know how deep I probably don't and you don't know how deep I've been hurt either if I could lay my heart before you here today it's not like you'd see great volumes of love and great volumes of the miraculous probably what you'd see more than anything would be the scars the pain all that I've been through as a Christian and I don't stand you're alone if I could see your heart I probably wouldn't say great renowning miraculous things I will no doubt see disappointments and hurts maybe in a wife maybe in a husband one that you trusted so much and yet you were so let down but it's up to you and I with what we do with that resentment we can let it control us or we can be honest with God and say God this thing is bigger than me and if you don't help me I can see already it's going to destroy me but I do not want to destroyed destroyed by this devil I want it under my feet is anybody listening to me this morning now you may sit there today and you might smell a brother and you get around him and you know he's got a problem with smoking that don't take much discernment does it it don't take much discernment if you see a little color between his fingers or a little Amber or still running out of his mouth or his Aqua Velva did not quite hide the cigarette smoke you know that person it's easy to see they have a problem maybe someone who gets real wrong and they lose their temper and they I say things they shouldn't say it's really easy for us to see that individual but sometimes it's the one that Harbors that root of bitterness that is so deep and resentment that is so deep no one knows it at the church nobody even knows it but their family does the wife does the husband does their closest intimate friends and yet when they are by themselves or with someone they think they can trust they get so angry and they will pound and they will Express such resentment yet if I would walk up they would squelch that resentment and bury it again deep Beneath The Human Side but you can only hide that for so long and to me many times those people are in worse shape than the man who's smoking cause he knows pretty much everybody knows but he keeps coming to church and if you're here today and you have a problem of smoking hey keep on coming back right here's where you can get Deliverance of that Oh you mean you want me to come absolutely I want you to come I figure your chances of getting delivered are way better of here than you are sitting at the house I figure whatever you're dealing with today your chances of getting touched by the presence of God and delivered a much greater being setting here that you are well I ain't going to go till I get everything took care of and let me know how that works for you I don't mind telling you I want this place to be like an ER I want this church to be like a hospital we want the lame the blind the halt the the smoking the marijuana the addicts whatever they are we want them to be able to come here and get set free this is not a place for only The Godly and only the holy well when you get good enough you can come to our church no when yours low down this rotten scumbag of the earth that's the kind we want to specialized in writing you to the Lord Jesus and being able to cast that spirit away from you and watch him take drugs out of your life and alcohol out of your life and bitterness out of your life and resentment out of your life and fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say our master place it in the bride's Bill of Rights the right to overcome he said these words in Saint John 16 33. these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation and everybody said amen but be of good cheer I have overcome the world now what I find amazing about this is he hasn't even died he has not went to the cross he has not been whipped he's not went to Hades and took the keys away from the Devil but he says I have already overcome now do you understand who's saying this it's not just the sonship of God but it's God himself the sonship the humanity is dreading the cross it is dreading the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews it was heard in that he feared now I want you to catch this as he says it be of good cheer I have overcome now I'm not going to but I have overcome the world so not only did he go before us but he did it for us not only before us but for us so when we're looking at something that seems like it's absolutely unsurmountable it is so great how can I ever survive this one I've been through a lot of things you might say but how in the world will I ever survive this one my word to you today is be of good cheer he has overcome the world now notice this he tells us this and John remember the same man who wrote this in chapter 16 verse 33 also wrote to us again in first John chapter 5 verse 4 and 5 and told us that we also would be Overcomers notice he says I have overcome the world so the Serene confidence and assurance that our lord Jesus has in what he's fixing to face calmly calmly with Serenity and Assurance as God as God I'll tell you we fight too many of our battles as a human when most of the time we need to fight them as deity we will get defeated by fighting our battles as human beings because Satan will scare us to death by using our reasoning he will use this person's word in that person's word and a doctor's report and whatever more and the News you listen to every day there ain't hardly nothing anymore on the news it's even encouraging are they you can't hardly go to anywhere any news station or whatever app you have on your phone it's all bad it's all discouraging it's all disheartening but let me tell you there is the greatest news that's ever been in the earth and that is the Gospel of Jesus Christ because the word gospel means the good news amen notice so he's looking at deaths in the face he's looking at suffering like no human being has ever suffered he's looking at the spirit of God the Father to leave him in the Garden of Gethsemane he's looking to be turned into a goat not a sheep a goat he's looking to be cursed in the eyes of God he's looking to be rejected by God and yet he says be of good cheer I've overcome the world only God could behave such Behavior no other way immortal could face such things and still say be of good cheer I hope somebody's going to hear me this morning this is the way I think we should fight our battles that we don't just fight them as mere mortals but we look at them as who we are Sons and Daughters of God and say it's bigger than me it's bigger than my family it's bigger than her church it's bigger than all of all of us put together but it ain't bigger than our God for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world be all good cheer I have overcome the world [Applause] notice in Romans chapter 12 verse 21 that Paul says be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good you see the Lord is not telling us to turn the other Chief and pray for them that despitefully use and all those blessed scriptures just in order to make us look like something that we're not but here is the key to overcoming evil you actually overcome it with good so if someone says something bad about you you don't overcome it by saying three times as much bad about them as a matter of fact the evil just took your Victory how do we overcome evil we actually overcome evil with good first John 2 13 I rather unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I I love the way John categorically brings it breaks this up in speaking to them I know a lot of people say well we shouldn't have youth services and we shouldn't just specify certain things to the youth you need to re-read your Bible because as a matter of fact they did just that notice I write unto you young men now why not just say it to everybody in general why would John specifically say I write unto you fathers which no doubt would have been older men because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because you have ye have overcome the wicked one now here John wanted this to be noted in the New Testament so that it would be an encouragement not only to the young men of that day but to the young men in the days of the church ages and I trust here today that some of our young Brothers can say if God helped them people and they were having their heads cut off they were having their bodies burned at Stakes they were being reviled and persecuted fed to the Lions brought before the Roman citizens and the Colosseum and I stood there many years ago went to the catacombs in Rome and see where the saints of God gathered together for church and think John was writing this around 93 94 A.D so during this time was when the persecution was going on and John wasn't just writing to old people because that Apostolic he feeds in church didn't have people 75 and above it had young men filled with the Holy Ghost it had young sisters filled with the Holy Ghost and John wants to acknowledge them notice he said I write unto you little children because ye have known the father I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because ye are strong that's the kind of young man we want in our church is it not I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one may I say to our young Brothers here today whether you are single or maybe you're a young man that is married you can take hope looking at your brothers which have lived before you but Brother Don who they didn't face what I did that's exactly right and you don't face what they did either we were able to come here today drive up in our vehicle and come to have church if you want to come back later and fellowship in the fellowship hall you can do so if we want to come tomorrow and the next day and the next day so far we still have our rights to be able to do it but can you imagine them every time they gather together under the emperor oh my that they would put out and edict anybody gathering in the name of Jesus they can be arrested and there was young men who risked their lives to go to the catacombs and say the devil will not keep me out of church I wonder if the state of Tennessee would pass such a law it is against the law to go to church to Word of Life Church I wonder how many of you sitting here today would be here well I'll raise my hand as the first one I will I will I will anybody else be with me why because we are of the same caliber of people amen they could not shut them up in the first stage they cannot shut them up in our age because we are the same caliber we are Overcomers oh my notice John goes on to say in verse chapter 4 verse 4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world when I also face facts there will be things that we will face and it will be even greater than what our human ability you may be a scholar of the message you might be a theologian of the message and when a preacher goes to start quoting a quote you can finish it for him and you might quote it more accurate than he does for God but yet at the same time you will not overcome just by your knowledge of quoting scripture John never said your Overcomers because you memorize what I wrote and you memorize what Matthew wrote but he said you are an overcomer because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world we want our church to study the word read the word write listen to tapes hear the preaching of the word but the main aspect I want you to have today is to get the Overcomer inside of you and when the Overcomer lives inside of you he will feed on the word he will Empower you he will overcome using your own body because the Lord Jesus is an overcomer whether he's in his body or your body or your body or my body he is an overcomer I love this in first John 5 4 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world I want you to notice he doesn't say maybe I'm praying they will perhaps they will but they do who whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world look at this word nikhail which means conquer Prevail get the victory to carry off the victory oh I love them days don't you I love it when you grab a hold of that victim you just carry it off notice this and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our shouting even our emotion our dancing our feeling what victory is it that overcomes the world what faith so when you feel him or whether you don't Faith still says I'm a winner either way now notice who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is not was is the Son of God notice again in Revelation chapter 2 verse 7 coming down to the church ages and God offered each age a reward now we're very fortunate in one aspect you may not consider yourself fortunate to be living in this last day but you are because in every age God gave them a reward now the last stage gets the accumulation of all seven the first age will get a great reward the second and third and fourths on them and now we're living in the last stage and it will be the accumulation of all the rewards of the church ages handed to the Believers in this day now you say oh that's wonderful well what that means is you're fighting seven times more than what they fought in other ages but we're more than able to do it notice he that has an ear Revelation 2 7 let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcome Thomas well I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God now this was the reward promised to the Ephesian age this is also my reward this is your reward now what you notice as it changes them from there and we come to the second Church age to have a different reward so the Ephesian age was not promised the reward of the second Church age notice how divided that it was verse 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says and the church is he that overcome us shall not be hurt of the second death notice how important overcoming is to God you see there will be no one that will go in the Rapture unless they are living an overcoming life friends this is not an option like power lend us on your car this is not an option well do you want an MP3 player or do you not want to do you want this and don't want that no this is absolutely a requirement the Overcomers are the ones that will be crowned and set with the Lord Jesus in order to be bride we have to be Overcomers well what have I got to overcome the greatest thing you will ever overcome is yourself because no brother Donnie it is smoking noise it's this another no it's not smoking no smoking is not a sin smoking marijuana is not a sin drinking is not a sin there's only one sin and that's unbelief and the reason people do the above is because they don't believe what the word says about it so where does it all come look they could you could live around cigarette factors you could live next door to those taverns every way you would turn but if you've got the Overcomer inside of you you can walk right by him and say you curse it think it behind me in the name of Jesus you can walk by him or brought the Lambert whether east west north and south but if you've got the overcoming on the inside there ain't nothing that's going to stop you but if you ain't got an overcomer you might live right down Paradise Avenue where Paradise Avenue intersects hope Pope Avenue and you're living right next door to Peace Valley but if you ain't got the comforter on the inside of you you won't be able able to overcome I know I shouldn't do this I should not do this friends it's going to take more than US sighting up her mental attitude I don't need to do this I don't need to do this it's going to take a power inside the bride in this last day to be able to not only look sickness in the face but look death itself in the face and say death give way give way death you cannot stop us as the people of God we are more than conquerors yeah I know you know this and believe it but I believe with all of my heart there's people sitting right here today that will not die you see we're not just going to look hepatitis in the face cancer in the face or some other sickness but one day you will look death itself right in the face and say I thought you had me didn't you Now You See Me Now you don't let gas itself right in the face hey you can't have me I'm gone I'm out of here what is a headache compared to that what is cancer compared to that what is high blood pressure low blood pressure oh my goodness Lazarus had no blood pressure so if God can take care of the no blood pressure attitude I figure he can take care of a low blood pressure attitude he can take care of high blood low blood no blood because he is the great creator look again in verse 17 he that half a deer let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh well I give to either the hidden Manner and give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man know us notice us now Noah saving he that receive it the accumulation of each Church age now as we come down notice he's not saying to him that shouts to him that runs to him who screams the loudest to him who hollers not even to him that works miracles not even to him that lays hands on the set notice one word one word that God uses the same in every Church age and basis the reward of every Church age on one word one only overcome overcome how many wants to be an overcomer listen how important not to him that raises the dead not to him that works miracles and Jesus said they'll stand before me that day and say I cast out devils in your name he'll say oh I'll say to them depart from me I never even knew you that ain't it friends we believe in that we believe God shouts we believe God anoints people to worship and run and praise God but you and I know my goodness I pray for enough of them and prayer lines all over the world so no they come through and you pray for them and they shout and run jump and fall out and three or four weeks are right back in somebody else's prayer line praying for the same thing that I prayed for them for before why we need more than prayer lines we need more than just getting our emotions all worked up and then coming right back what we want is people that can live Victorious overcoming lives and look the devil in the face and say I'm sick and tired of you stealing my victory I'm sick and tired of you stealing my joy you're stealing my peace with God give it back give it back in the name of Jesus verse 26 he that overcometh and keep us my works wow well what about his words sure you're going to keep his words wonder why I said works who keep us my works we don't want to be all mouths oh I believe this I believe I believe I believe I'll say I'll say I say works must accompany what we believe and everybody said he that keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations again chapter 3 verse 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white Raymond and I will not blott out his name out of the book of life you mean a person could have their name in The Book of Life and get it blotted out this is part of my reward he will not blot out my name oh praise God I don't want to just lay hands on the sick I've done that for decades I've seen Miracles my goodness believe me I've never shared with you one inkling of what I've seen God do but you know one reason I don't talk about it more because I know what stuff does like that to people they want to start following this they think they got to get to this man and that man and something I just read Carol a quote last time where brother Branham says it's not the certain man praying for you it's you within yourself having faith and believing God oh my notice this God's reward to the elect I will confess his name before my father and before his angels to who the shelter the jumper the preacher overcome do you understand there will be countless of preachers that'll have their name removed an angel will stand there and blot out their name now they're they're writing this as if they were doing that day they did not have paper and stuff of course the way we did so they would take part of the ink and blot out they would take a heavy dose of the ink and go over the riding there and blot out that oh what a terrible saying to stand there and your name it was sad when you walked up and now you're standing there and it's gone why it was blotted out oh Lord God but for those that overcome he said I will not blot out your name as a matter of fact I will confess your name can you imagine the Lord Jesus speaking your true word name before this eternal one on the throne and he will turn to the myriads maybe Millions times millions of angels and he will say to them look at my daughter so and so she was an overcomer here is my son whatever your true word name is I want you all to see my son glory to God glory to God Lord children if that's the only reward I got that'd be enough to fight every devil out of hell up with it can you imagine by the nation sat in there and the Lord Jesus confesses our name before the father and tense of those myriads of angels and said what to introduce to you my word son my word daughter how are they here master how did they get here they overcome they lived in that Wicked sinful Dark Age of laodiceem there was a rottenness and Corruption everywhere and that overcome and they stood for me now I'm standing for them and I want all of heaven to know silence photos silence what I speak their name in the Lord Jesus would speak your name my son so and so glory to God give me that brother notice in Revelation 3 12 him that overcometh so I may in the temple of my God a pillar yeah sort of like the two in Solomon's when Solomon erected his Great temple and God gave him the pattern to follow according to what David had saw and there's two big massive pillars as you come into the entrance the whole building held up on these pillars Jesus says to him that overcomes I will make you a pillar in the house of my God and he shall know more go no more out and I will ride upon him the name of my God in the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will ride upon him my new name to what category of people one Overcomers I think by the Paul we take it too lightly to overcome France it well boy that's something it's not just something it's everything you see if we don't overcome all of our running all of our knowledge all of our shouting all of our preaching all of our signs what will that be worse if we don't overcome Revelation 3 21 now here's the promise the seventh promise but remember you get all consecutive of them put together one through seven to him that overcometh all I grant to set with me and my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father and his son Revelation 21 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son what could be greater than that I love this in the church age book and I know you're familiar with it in the layout of sin Church age page 360. now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how you see so much of the time we focus on what uh I've got a pornography problem I've got temper I've got resentment I've got your focusing on what not how if we can ever learn how it won't be no difference what the problem is you'll know how to handle it and some of you can overcome this and that in the other but you keep focusing on the what instead of letting the same principle of the house that lets you overcome all these other 57 things in your life you're letting and you're naming that can't you see the power of naming can't you see the power of naming something the Lord Jesus has your original word name written in heaven but he cannot give that to you now it would not match your existence and time it would not match your body but there you will get your new name due to you not new to him look at the power of naming so he said well my habit my this my that quit naming that devil don't look at what look at how it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome this is the logical for notice it does not matter so much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome in Matthew 4 where in Jesus it's tempted of the devil listen Carefree these words beautiful absolutely beautiful he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only not by the anointing the Bible doesn't mention nothing about Jesus feeling anything he overcome by the word notice now they were so they were so made for him no one else could Satan even use this against them so the prophet I'm so glad that he allowed this to be said this way he overcame the personal Temptation don't you understand why Satan knows us so well it probably scare us to death if we knew how well he knew us and he has your Temptations and tests so personalized he knows you to the T but we know him too we're not ignorant concerning his devices notice this he overcame the person of Temptations of Satan by Satan I'm saying rather by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Edom lust of the flesh lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word he fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell and direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word notice next paragraph and his own personal life these words are astounding to me contending with himself was contending with himself now I want you to think Jesus recognizing that his flesh was now a Target and Satan was trying to pull on his Humanity and Jesus must defeat himself so his Temptations were not well this drinking problem and this woman problem and this he never focused on what but he focused on who and how you mean the Lord Jesus the blameless sinless Son of God yes but remember the prophet makes them astounding statements about that human body and he says even the Flesh of Jesus could not glory in the presence of God oh I know it took some of you Jesus owners but it's time you get choked down you'll never see yourself right if you don't see him right look at him but small their children he had to contend with himself Jesus had to speak to Jesus and say Jesus you've got to obey the word but Jesus said to Jesus I don't want to I don't want to die I don't want to suffer Jesus the deity had to speak to Jesus the humanity and said you're going to obey me I'm here for this reason I'm here for this purpose you're going to the coast I don't want to even prays a prayer that he knew the father would not and could not answer if it be thy will let this cup pass from me I'm so glad father God didn't answer that prayer in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame obedience to the word and Hebrews 5 7 it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered a prayers and supplication was strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death so Jesus mother Joel is crying he's crying and calling calling Spirit God I'm begging please don't let me go through this I you don't make me face this please thank you Oh Glory to God supplications a strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him so the savior his crime for the father to save him from being a sinner no from dying and becoming sin don't make me do it don't make me do it please don't make me do it I beg you but that he was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared can you imagine the Lord Jesus being so afraid brother Jackie Jesus fearing maybe he'd already seen it read the book of Isaiah 53 and many of the other places and he could imagine himself hanging on the cross all my bones they stare at me they laugh at me they put out their lips at me he saw them or he saved himself he can he saved the other let him save himself the Bulls of Bayesian Compass me about Psalms 22 it's proceed your great Shepherd psalm read it you see it was the victory of Psalm 22 that led him to the Sheepfold of Psalm 23. maybe reading in the scripture and imagining in his mind how can a mortal face this I can do it I just can't again I can't face it can you imagine when Satan heard him say it I'm afraid I hope you don't misunderstand me but I'm so glad he allowed himself to feel that how many ever gets afraid in life just get afraid let's get afraid afraid of the unknown sometimes afraid of the known afraid of things that around you not certain house that's going to turn out and how is this going to be you just get afraid but don't forget when you do you could go to High priests and say Jesus I'm so afraid I'm so afraid of today I'm just afraid of today I'm afraid I'm going to fall again I'm afraid of this I'm afraid of that I need a high priest who can understand me you can answer back and say son I know that feeling I understand the feeling of fear let me take you on a journey when I was on The Garden of Gethsemane I was shaking I was trembling I was in such profusion of prayer that the capillaries broke in my in my forehead in my bloodstream entered entered into the sweat glands and I sweated great drops of blood you see it was not just out of thinking of hell it was not of that but I was so afraid of the pain I was afraid of the agony I was afraid of being left alone I was afraid I feared so I understand anybody here have fears besides me but don't you guys got a high priest that we can go to and you say Lord I'm afraid you're afraid why no longer if I get down at that Altar and get saved you ain't got the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost but even though he was deity in that body it did not did not take away the humanity and the fear oh Lord God though he was a son yet learned he obedience of the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of God now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he's been living that word not just talking about it but living it your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of setting in that throne it will be granted only to the word bride that's the stronger the king is shared with the queen because she's United to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that throne I mean it wants to be part of that one can I have a few more minutes Paul says in Romans 8 37 day and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I love this word it means to be more than a conqueror to gain a surpassing Victory literally in the translation it means this we are super conquerors amen super conquered why we're part of a super race we belong to a super sign to a supersede and we're going to a super City divide designed by a super almighty God so we are not just barely conquerors but we are super we are conquerors on spiritual steroids we are super conquerors I want to just say this to you our face is not destroyed our hope is not gone our love is not diminished our sight is not blinded our intuition from the presence of God we are more determined now than ever before because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world we will bear the glory because we bear the shame we will set with us in him and the throne because he can try us now and not treat us like a bunch of babies and you see friends here's the key we conquer when we learn to conquer ourselves Romans 5 2. Paul says by whom oh shall we have access by faith unto this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory not only so but we glory in Tribulation Lord have mercy we Glory and tribulation knowing that tribulation workers patience I didn't put the rest of this down but I quote it for you tribulation workers patience patience experience experience hope hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us we don't just endure tribulation we don't just endure trying but we glory in them why because we know we have found favor in the eyes of God oh my we are so far from being conquered by them they do us much good well brother Donnie always knew you're crazy now I know you've flipped over well I hope that I have I hope I get so far out of my mind that I have the mind of Christ that I'll get to a spot I'll believe what he said if you don't if you don't if you don't it won't make no difference I'm going to take him out his word Hallelujah second Corinthians 2 14. now thanks be unto God which always calls us to Triumph in Christ and make us manifest the savior of his knowledge by us in every place or if you only could catch that listen what this man is saying he calls us always calls us to Triumph in Christ and make us manifest the Savior or the incense the incense of his knowledge by us in every place you see the imagery Paul chose to use you know Paul was a very a very typologist of a guy and he used so many images I love his images because he looked at himself here at the church as a trophy of God's victory and he said what I'm doing and what you brothers and sisters are doing we are the sweet aroma of his victory because he conquered us then he will take us and Conquer others through us praise be to gospel Paul considered himself as a conquered trophy of Christ's Victorious power now remember by this time when he writes second Corinthians he's back in jail again and he goes from one jail to another from one city to another but Paul sees himself as part of the triumphant entry of Christ himself into this city so here Paul would come and say me and Jesus have come to take over praise God now he's quoting the triumphal entry of the Romans Oh Glory to God you see they would lead them about so the Romans would conquer the Greeks the Athenians whoever they would conquer they would get many of the mighty celebrities of the city and then they would take incense and they would run before the Chariots and the incense was the introduction Oh Glory to the Victorious March so here was thousands times thousands of Roman citizens and they're lined up across the streets and they knew today was a triumphal entry because they had took God they had took Britain they had took this and that and the other and they would stand there and they'd smell the aroma and the incense and Paul said can't you all say what I'm doing God's having me thrown in one jail after another and we know when he got down there in Philippi and he got to the mother places God let him be able to lead people to the Lord Jesus you imagine was Paul down there and that one Roman guard according to history Paul LED one Roman god to the Lord Jesus and the man had a new birth about the baptism of the Holy Ghost what did God do God allowed this man to carry the incense of a resurrected life for the Lord Jesus inside there and there was a Roman Heathen about like a Tennessee Heathen or a Kentucky Heathen or an Eleanor Heathen or a Virginia either and the Lord God allowed this man's life such a sweet smelling savior of the Lord Jesus and that Roman said they tell me you're a preacher I've got all kinds of Gods smelling all the time but you smelled it I mean you you act different than my priest still the bride does all glory to God glory to God let me give you a little history one Pompeii triumphed over Africa his Chariot was drawn by elephants when Mark Anthony conquered his Chariot was drawn by lions when Helio gaboulos conquered his chariot was led by tigers when Aurelius had conquered his Chariot was led by deer isn't it amazing all animal nature which seemed unable to conquer but you see by Conquering the elephant can you imagine hooking up elephants to a chariot they could take a big trunk of theirs pick you in the Chariot and the whole thing and throw you however far they wanted to but yet you are showing your conquering Power by having these massive elephants pull you a little 160 or 70 pound man don't you understand why the Lord Jesus is going to allow his people to be a conquering tried people we are his victory Hallelujah it will not be great cherubs that'll lead his Chariot it will not be Mighty archangels that will be the crescendo of his victory it'll be little Housewives it'll be young men that were so Bound by drugs and alcohol Bound by pornography and this and that and the other and they even looked at himself and said I'm totally hopeless I've been in this situation for so long but the Conqueror got a hold to their life and then he'll it hits you and I up by the glory of God and say Lead Me Now oh Hallelujah take my name take my power he don't want you to just do it in heaven he wants it to do in the workplace where you are let the Lord Jesus chain us to his chariot say take me to the masses take me to the Lost not a tiger not a lion not an elephant a man born in sin a woman born in sin Changed by the power of God and Horn into harnessed up to the buggy of the word of God for the end time I told you years ago when I was in South Africa and I'll close to this in Durban but the name you now do which is an Indian brother Durbin has a large large concentration of East Indian people and there were thousands times thousands and thousands of those people there for one of those great Hindu festivals and they would have little small groups maybe eight or ten over here eight or ten over there and eight or ten over there had a little tiny uh timbering type things symbols little tiny things they go to plan them things and going back and forth neighbors dancing and carrying on off us ever was and there's one particular person that's all gathering around telling me what they're doing this man is going to be the man that they're going to hook a buggy to they have 33 million gods and goddesses so they would stand there and they'd dance and dance and dance all of a sudden this guy that they're going to hook him up to he'd let our blood curdling scream brother nammy said he's now ready they would start out with a big long pen like this start weaving it through his tongue poking a hole in his tongue that's sticking out of his mouth that take fish hooks brother Ram talked about it they'd take fish hooks and hang apples and grapefruit and hang them all over his body then they'd take two big long grab Hooks and put right in the back this man's back like this take his skin and put it up and feed this hook through his back and then run ropes to the back of this man and him pulling this Carriage representing this deity I saw some of them the weight of that carriage and it would tear a hole Plum out in their skin leave a big old place blood running down their bodies for what false gods idolatry but who was the best representation of them so-called deities their constituents who's the best representation of a conquer of an overcomer the day we're living here it may not always be a man it may be a woman it may be a little daughter of God that's attacked by this or that or the other and yet the Lord God uses hers we look the other night at Tabitha and what a life little Tabitha dork has had God hooked her up to his buddy to display himself oh friends forget about well if I can be this person give me that big buggy give me what difference does it make what size it is my goodness if I ain't got enough trust in the Lord and if I ain't got enough reputation that he has to tie me up to a little red flower wagon y'all know what them are don't you man they're antique now a little video guys about that big if that's all he can tie me up to all buried I'll pull it I'll pull it with all my strength I'm in the same parade as the big guys I'm in the same parade of the Mighty Warriors who's pulling tons and tons and tons and they say look at poor little brother Donnie he just got that little Radio Flyer wagon that's all right Jesus matched me up to that wagon I'll pull it with all my might about it Hallelujah Lord Jesus to him that overcome us what about it man women boys girls your temper bitterness sexual sins whatever it is it's not what that's how how do I overcome by the word he said but brother Donnie the Lord Jesus wasn't tempted by marijuana I know that he wasn't tempted by pornography I know that but there's only three ways a human being can be tempted that's the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life so he faced the channel of Temptation that every Mortal would ever face and he overcome the channel not the what he didn't have to face pornography he didn't have to face marijuana he overcome the channel and said do as I do let me hook you up to the buggy take me on the job with you let them smell the aroma of Christ in you the hope of glory let them sense that your life has been changed praise the Lord praise the Lord and he would say to the Lord Jesus today Lord that's the greatest desire of my heart to be an overcomer would you just stand to your feet those of you that that's your desire we don't want to just raise our hand today if we want to stand so it doesn't really matter what it is but how how do I do it I do it by the word [Music] oh I want to do so much for God I I want to do something for god brother darling well let me tell you how to do it the way to do something for God is that God help you overcome yourself [Music] that's the ones he uses to conquer is the conquered in the Kingdom of Christ the conquered are the conquerors and the kingdom of the devil those who are not conquered are the conquered ones they will never overcome their self and Satan in the end gets them all and the last one to be destroyed and that burning fire will be Satan himself maybe for millions and millions of years he will burn and turn and toss and be haunted but eventually he himself will be destroyed and when there is no more devil you will still be shouting the Praises of almighty God you the one that looked like you could never overcome you the one that it seemed you would never be able to face it and the liar who told you that no longer exists and you are praising the Lord God for eternity Hallelujah we've been made more than conquerors oh the cars in this life oh yes we are we've been made victory [Music] the blood of Jesus Christ everybody [Applause] friends oh the Commerce in this love [Music] we've been made Victory us through the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] let me set your desire today Lord I want to overcome you don't have to tell me you don't have to tell your neighbors standing by you just tell Jesus Jesus you know what I need I'm ashamed for saying anybody else knows you

glad we have an idea of what he will be but I'm so glad we know what he is now and what he's doing we're a witness aren't we you may like to be remember tonight as we go before the Lord in prayer and need a request on your heart all right Heavenly Father we so thank you tonight dear God that we have been able to experience and know that you are an awesome mighty God we thank you Lord Jesus it it's not just something that we read out of the old Testament or read out of the new or even read in the time when your Prophet was here on the earth Lord God we can look around and see and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have moved Among Us I wonder sometimes if these young people Lord here at the church realize how blessed they are they have seen things with their eyes that people many people down Through the Ages have never seen right here in our church we've seen the dead raised we've seen cancer healed we've seen one thing after another after another lives changed by the power of God we are so blessed father and we don't want to just receive it from you and not let you know how much we appreciate it we are so grateful and so thankful as we've come tonight Lord that we could be enlightened a little bit more of the day that we're living we pray that You' just help us tonight help me father to be led by your spirit shut my mouth to anything that would displease you thank you Lord for the opportunity that we've gathered here tonight in the name of Jesus Amen praise the Lord so glad to see each one of you tonight thank you for coming out on this Thursday night U eventually I'm going to get done with this one question but until I feel like I've covered it all I we just keep going on is that okay okay can you explain why brother brandham is a Vindicated prophet and why the message is correct I have a difficult time speaking to why I believe what I believe you can you can be seated I want to say I was out in Arkansas this past week and and a brother come up to me after the service there he's one of the deacons of the church and he wanted to S and Sharon brother Rob he wanted to express how much he had been enjoying the question and answers so maybe some of you would have a question on your heart and you wouldn't understand something and you might think man I I hate to ask that I don't want people to think west of me or something if I do it but it's amazing by your questions and things that you have asked how many people have been blessed by it and I'm grateful for that I'm grateful that we're we we have enough in our hearts to be able to understand that God is Supernatural but there's also an element of our humanity and I want you to know I'm not going to shame you because you need to understand more or you want to know more that's one of the things that we learn about as I've been studying on these questions I've just been amazed at how much more that I have found myself now the last time that we dealt with this I closed in Deuteronomy 131 and this is where I'd like to open up again tonight and it's quite astounding really whenever you look at it because people of this modern day don't have this concept about God and the way that God works and because mindset is that God basically has to Baby his people and God cannot treat them like mature Sons and Daughters of God so God has to keep all the bad away from them all the wrong away from them God's never going to allow them to be tested God is certainly not going to test them himself but we happen to know that that's totally different Deuteronomy 13:1 if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the Wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods now what's amazing is that a man could actually give a sign or wonder or even have a spiritual dream or see a vision and it could be genuine and true so you wouldn't just know a prophet because the dream was true or because the vision was true but what you would do is see after that man gives the dream or the vision then what is he trying to get you and I to follow because those things are given as signs so brother Bram likened it to bait on a hook and when you're going fishing that you don't show the fish the hook but you show it the bait notice Moses goes on to say in verse 13 Thou shalt not hearken to the words of that Prophet now notice here here actually calls these people prophets or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proveth you you mean God would actually do that God would let people raise up down Through the Ages and he would let them do that yes it's apparent that he's done it over and over again to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with with all your soul so we're not only going to be tempted by worldly things out here on the world and we tend to categorize worldliness as drinking smoking and all the wrong kind of dress your sisters cutting your hair uh your brothers doing things or saying things that you shouldn't do and people think that is worldliness but actually worldliness contains much more than that worldliness is actually unbelief there's only two aspects that's faith and unbelief so Satan will actually come against us in many ways other than just hair and dress and drinking and makeup and alcohol and drugs and so on and so on so this is actually what he used in the Garden of Eden to try to pull Eve away from the promise of God so he said you should walk after the Lord your God and fear Him and keep his Commandments and obey his voice and you shall serve him and clear unto him and that Prophet or that dreamer of Dreams shall be put to death now God was very very serious about this because Heath spoken now notice the prophets why they would do this because he has spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage it's a Thrust thee out of the way so this is way we'll be able to judge and know a false prophet from a true one it's not always by signs it's not always by Miracles you've heard me share difference of things that I saw in Pentecost and the Miracles were genuine many of them were but yet you always wait and see but what he got to say what's the message that follows The Voice now watch in Genesis 15:1 this is why that we believe that a prophet is in a different category than even a pastor an evangelist a teacher an apostle which is one that goes forth and starts works for god notice how that the Bible says this about Abram and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision so a prophet then wasn't somebody that just said uh you've got a sickness and you've got a trial and and you've got a burden and you're going through this and that and the other they they would say those things but God's main channel for his word was prophets so to us that's not unusual and strange then to believe that God would use a prophet in our day anybody have an idea tonight of how the what the number is current number as of 2024 of denominations in Christianity around the world anybody have an idea over 45,000 as of today 45,000 denominations and when brother random is here 900 so in this day of confusion now those denominations they don't agree right they don't agree if they all agreed there'd be no different and in just having a different name why be Baptist Methodist Church of God Church of Christ First Baptist Second Baptist 48th Baptist 153rd Baptist you know you follow me so if they all believe the same thing there would be no need for a differentiation just by name so why do we have all them different ones because they all disagree so they would split away from that one a lot of it of course we know in our day has been because of the gay move and the homosexual and all that sort of thing the Methodist are dividing the Baptists are dividing many of them are dividing and separating and even the churches are going more woke and that's what they want so that's that's exactly the reason that they're dividing and separating so you can imagine now in the early church age there was no denominations there weren't any in the first years when the apostolic church was founded in the book of Acts there were no denominations then as it began to go on in 325 ad at the council and sometime I'd like to take that for you and be able to break that down to help you see it but for 300 years there there was a truth that had come about still baptizing right and then in 3:25 ad whenever they meet together because the division started and it came from a man named aryion and it was about the godhead so there was a great doctrinal dispute about who Jesus really was was he God in essence or was he of the lower creation of God which is what many of them believed and then they had this great dissension so they wanted to meet so they came from Constantinople they came from the Mediterranean they came from the known world for now for about 300 years Christianity had spread and they meet together and it was actually a great leader of Rome that had them together and said you all need to discuss this you need to resolve this so here come prophets and sages out of the Wilderness and said don't do this don't do this it's wrong it's wrong 325 D at the Nan Council was whenever they decided to do away with the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and water baptism and replace it with the titles of father son Holy Ghost but now God had already foran that and gave a prophet in the first church age which was Paul now think if God wanted to do that before there was ever any denominations at all wonder what God would send then in the last day knowing that there would be 45,000 by next week or maybe a few more so why would God send a prophet so that the word of the Lord could come to him well brother Donnie can't the word come to you no I'm not made that way can I have Impressions yes can I be inspired yes I can I can be inspired and God will give me things but I have to take my inspiration back to an absolute and check my inspiration to make sure that it's right why because Satan is a deceiver and he can easily trick people but now a prophet is made to where he can so get himself out of the way I can't do that or can any other preacher other than just a prophet now Abram it's not that he was a a special man but he was a man that God chose so notice after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision now this was not Abraham feeling impressed and saying I feel led I feel led to do this I I feel led that um I I'm going to be God's chosen one no it's not impression it's not even feeling Leed and it's the same for us today today we will feel led to do a lot of things that are absolutely contrary to the word of God and that's why God gives us his word to where we can trace that back and say okay is there anything in the word that says I shouldn't do that and then if you look and you search and you can't find anything then God gives you a Shepherd a pastor then you go look you know brother Donnie you know please help me pray about this I'm thinking about doing this or that do you know anything in the scripture or do you know anything in the message why I should not do that now why does God do that for your double protection so that it'll keep you from making a mistake but even in that if you come to me it doesn't mean that I will always have the answer many times people come to me and they say you know you know this NOP I'm sorry I sure don't but I'll be praying with you I'll be praying with you but now if I was a prophet then a prophet would be able to get a word from the Lord it is so perfect and so so absolute that God will judge Nations by what them people them prophets got from God that's how perfect you understand so it's a different than an impression anybody here tonight be honest enough to say in your walk with God that you felt led to do certain things or feel you know just a a pull or something and it wound up being not the Lord yeah yeah yeah well all the rest of you just hang on you will now but a profit is made to where the word of the Lord can come to him in a vision now you know it's amazing because Joel 2 one of the Prophecies of the end time was that God would appear to people and he would actually cause young men to see visions and old men to dream dreams now I've never had too many spiritual dreams myself I've had Visions before I had one about a month and a half ago two months ago I saw two message preachers sitting at a table and they were actually talking about me and they were discussing me because they felt like I was wrong and some things I was preaching and I heard one of them preachers in this Vision I saw it and I heard him and I saw him say some certain things to this other man about me but was that the word of the Lord no can we base a Doctrine on that no so the word of the Lord that come to the prophets in this form of vision was somewhat different than that I know of different people in our church that has actually had visions and they might happen and they might not now you know brother random told us about seeing a vision that whenever a prophet would see a Vision that he might see a lamb in the vision and it might mean sheep or it might mean wool so in a vision a prophet unless God gives it to him clearly and the word of the Lord format that Prophet would have to wait for God to turn it around and reveal to him what it meant by symbols so now notice in this one it was not symbols that God was dealing with Abram but it was clearly the word of the Lord in a vision the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying so notice it wasn't a star and a bridge and a sheep and a book and and pews and this and that it was the word of the Lord infallibility now remember he tells us in the church age book that the power of infallibility would return in the last days but in what format pastors no evangelists no teachers no in the form of a god-sent prophet to whom the word of the Lord does that make sense to everybody that the word of the Lord would come now notice so the word of the Lord comes to Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward so this was not just not the spirit of God speaking to his Spirit or it was not him hearing a voice you know just like you and I would hear it was something even greater God is going to base his Covenant God is going to base millions of people's Destiny on this word God is going to base this is the foundation of the Jews the real Jews today still go back to this very word because to them it's the word of the Lord you understand now people can feel impressed and this is where brother brandom warned the Pentecostals and I saw it many many times myself when I I was in Pentecost and people would feel impressed brother I I I feel that that you're going through a hard time I could say that to probably everybody here tonight right you know and you say uh brother you're you're you you've got a I feel a back pain I feel a back pain yeah if You' anything today you probably got a few pains here or there but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about something that is absolutely perfectly infallible it does not miss so it's not guessing it's not mind over matter now watch in numbers 12: 6 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak to him in a dream so now here again God is giving in the book of numbers of course Moses again writing that it would be by this identification that we'd be able to know if a man was a prophet 2 Chronicles 3232 now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the vision of Isaiah the prophet so the book of Isaiah I love the way the the author of Chronicles writes this and he actually calls it the vision of Isaiah yet in Isaiah is also chronology of the tribes and all different types of things but the author here of this chose to write this in this way in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel now watch why this has such value to the people of the Old Testament and to us as well if we believe it Proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision the people perish now I find this amazing because you hear this scripture quot Ed so much in modernday Christendom but what they do is they take the scripture and Miss Supply it like that a church has to have a vision well we've got to have a vision of Word of Life Church and and I I want everybody to invite somebody to church on Sunday because we want our church to grow and then we're going to hand out tracks and we're going to have a a church ball team and then we're going to do this and that and the other and we're going to try to make our church grow cuz we have to have a vision without a vision the people perish that scripture is so misapplied it's pitiful because actually most of them don't even believe in the way this scripture is written but I'm going to read it to and I'm going to read you the meaning of the word where there is no vision the people perish look at the word Vision Vision in a static State Oracle prophecy Divine communication young people I want to ask you a question tonight where would we be had God not sent us a prophet if we had not received Divine communication from God in a vision the very say we're laughed about that people ridicule us and make fun of us until of course they come and hear us some so here a few weeks ago when we had sister tr's funeral there was a prominent businessman that came to the funeral service and he had heard things about us he knew our former church and where we were and all that had said some really bad bad things about us but he had had some dealing with us through the flood thing and he had told one of the brothers of our church that the Lord had rebuked him and told him that he should not think those things or say those things that he had said about our church so the man and his family came to Sister tr's funeral on his way out that door there he spoke to someone that he knew in our church and he said I've been in church all my life I have never in my entire life heard anything like that funeral so now what makes us different then every preacher is known for something you know one of the things I'm known for the way I preach funerals and you think dear God have mercy really wow that's really an identification is it not brother Daryl tells me all the time he said brother Donnie I wish I was up there in that box when you get done I wish I was dead going on to Heaven Ain't that really something to be known for but why what is it then that makes us different what makes our funerals what makes what what because we say it and the way we approach it and our preaching now that man may have never come to a service but he come to a funeral and he was somehow impacted CU he had never heard a funeral quite preach like that well is it because I'm such a great speaker you know better than that you know I'm not a great speaker I never finished high school much let preacher training preacher education huh I wouldn't even know where to start on such a thing but what is it oh he said brother Donnie so gifted it's not just about my gift it's where I feed from it's where I feed from what where do I feed from I'm feeding from an open vision that came through a prophet that gave to us Divine communication from the presence of God and I preach funerals in different states and different parts of the United States I preach them in military funerals I preached one several years ago of someone that was associated with our church that was a police officer I've never seen so many police cars state troopers constables sheriff's police it was absolutely unbelievable the amount of people that they came to the funeral the amount of police officers that was there they came to the gravide I've never seen such a gathering before I had the chief of police of Elizabeth also the sheriff of Washington County different ones come up and Sh hands me I've heard about you I'm going to come and hear you preach again I've never heard anything like that in my life now why cuz I'm a great preacher I'm not but it's where we feed from it's the Divine communication and as I stood there praying God please give me something and this police officer that had died every state trooper had a radio every Sheriff had a radio every cop had a radio and his last communication when he checked in he said so and so so and so and they told me when they was going to do it and they told me to pause every police officer it went off on his radio every Sheriff it went off on his radio and it was that man's voice voice which was now silenced in death and when that happened the Lord dropped something down inside my heart to speak to those men now where I wouldn't know that me Carol was talk about not Longo she said Donnie where would we be right now if it wasn't for the message I said probably still in Pentecost probably running here and running there and you know thinking was doing some great something from the Lord but why why do I preach different why why does brother Daryl preach different why does our message preachers different an open vision from God aren't you grateful aren't you grateful notice so where there is no vision the people perish this is why we were where we were this is why there's over 45,000 denominations they're searching searching searching searching looking looking looking why they have no open Vision so they have somebody that differs with that church and then they split and they make another church and then they get three or four more churches and they say let's make an organization so they make an organization and then they go for a while and then somebody splits out that no we're breaking away from them they have no open Vision thank God for the truth but he that keepeth the law happy is he now look in Ezekiel 8:4 for behold the glory of the Lord Lord of Israel was there according to the vision that I saw in the plane now remember these prophets are going to say things that none of the rest of them had said before because God works in dispensation so you remember we still have a few out there but whenever Co and all that was going on and and I bought a bunch of the hand sanitizers and put them here and there and there so they were out alcohol dispensers and soap dispensers why so you could put your hands and I could under them and it would automatically dispense so much alcohol they come preset with so many milliters or whatever it is and you would put your hands there it's all you had to do you put your hands there battery's charged everything's working good it would dispense something in your hands you would be able to do this and you'd go in from that point on you bumped elbows or bumped fist you didn't touch nobody's hands because you had been washed by the dispenser right so what good would it do if all the dispensers were empty what good would it do if they was there but there was no soap or no alcohol in them to dispense so God dispensed his word the same way so in the days of Moses he gave a large dispensation first five books of the Bible the law the Torah then God would go for many years before another Prophet might come and say a few things and then on and on and on but they would prophesy and they would say similar things but yet sometimes one would say something that not another one would say for the rest of the entire scripture how can God trust that are there any perfect human beings that are so in contact with God that God could do that there aren't any so God makes these men so special that that power of infallibility can be projected through their lips now can you imagine a man saying one day a virgin shall conceive that was a very peculiar setting in the way that Isaiah prophesied about this so he's looking at the Su dial of ahaz and he said the Lord will give you a sign and all of a sudden he jumps ahead 714 years and he says the Lord himself shall give you a sign a virgin shall conceive now you imagine what doctors would have said nurses Nurse Practitioners if they had them in that day you imagine what common just people with common sense would have said that man is out of his mind who heard of a virgin conceiving and this is the thing of it Ezekiel Never Said Amen to that that's right praise the Lord the Lord showed me the same thing Jeremiah never verified it Micah never verified it zachari Malachi Hagi naam Joel not another prophet of the Old Testament said a virgin shall conceive one man but Israel the real saints of God that believed that one man they held on to his word now you understand that same prophet Isaiah prophesied not only from chapter one on down to that chapter he didn't stop there he went on in chapter 65 and he prophesied of the Millennium now how can we have conf idence now in this day his prophecy was given almost 2800 years ago about the Millennium so now are we going to wait until the Millennium happens before we say all right Isaiah now I'll believe you when the Millennium happens we have confidence because we see other things that he said come to pass then we can say chapter 65 it'll come to pass too and chapter 66 which talks about the eighth day after the Millennium I'll just go ahead and tell you I'm resting on it aren't you I have confidence now you see for people who want to pick and sort and pick and sort well they said well it didn't come to Passion I ain't believing it you see God wrote it that way actually Ezekiel 44 through chapter 48 speaks again about the Millennium the Millennium Temple how the prince will enter into the Eastern side all those things none of those verses have yet come to pass the former sea the hinder sea Zechariah 14 the the mountain will be cleaved in half and the water will come out of that and it'll go to the Dead Sea it'll stream right down to the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea will come alive well are we going to wait and judge him he said no wait a minute wait a minute people want to pick on brother brandham and so this ain't come to pass and that ain't come to pass sure that's the way prophets do but it gives us confidence praise the Lord I saw a Pentecostal guy on YouTube some time back and he was sharing a lot of testimonies I think I sent it to you brother Rob and the man was sharing uh a lot of different testimonies he was not a message believer of things that he saw in brother ROM's Ministry and one of the ones I just thought was so outstanding was that his family his mother and father knew this certain woman and they had went to a meeting where brother brandham was and brother brandham called the woman out told her she was going through this that and the other and told her her address and his mother and father were there in the meeting and they knew where this sister lived and they knew that was not her address or so they thought so they went to her after church and said how you doing you know how you doing you know talk a little bit and said we we we just have to question you on this brother bam told you was that right about the sickness yes it was right praise the Lord it was right well we know that's not your address oh she said I hadn't told you all I just recently moved so what does that do for us Young people it gives us confidence you know and it's easy for lot of these people that want to criticize him now after he's done gone thank God for all those that have given us testimonies believe me I've been around many many people that were there as eyewitnesses people that were told all types of things these things are not made up and you remember when you're listening to brother brandom and he's calling them people out listen to their response yes yes amen praise the Lord praise the Lord you'll also hear sometimes I heard one the other day well that there was a preacher on the platform behind him brother random was calling somebody out telling them their sickness their disease and the man behind him on the platform said I brought her to church with me tonight that's the truth so there are witnesses by the hundreds of thousands that gives us confidence then that the things that he had to say there will be sharks swimming in California she will go under I don't care what they say it gives us confidence you understand now watch in Ezekiel again 11: 24 afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of God into Chala What A peculiar thing now remember prophet PHS they move in the realm of the fourth dimension so when God created the dimensions there was seven of them light matter time science where the unbeliever goes where the believer goes and where God is so all diseases began in the fourth dimension you can find this in the demonology part two if you like to look for it so in the beginning there were no diseases once Angels fell then they were still maintain their capability of being able to appear in time and appear in molecules and atoms even appear as angels of light God never created cancer God never created pneumonia God never created any of that where does cancer come from bruised cell brother called it a cell that backslides so A demon Spirit then will come and hijack the life in that cell and that cell then one of the difference that they found several several years ago is the trigger in most cells in our body they will duplicate replicate duplicate replicate and then they shut off but a cancer cell they've not so far been able to find that trigger inside that cell and they just keep growing growing growing growing until they explode and then overpower the rest of the cells in our body so a prophet in the fourth dimension it must have been a peculiar world you know to to live in in that world so here Ezekiel says he brought me in a vision by the spirit of God into Chala to them of the Captivity so by Vision a prophet could move back Wards he could move forwards and then he could also be in the present tense at the same time so something like this a a woman stands before brother brandham I see you with a yellow check of dress on I see you running coming home from school a dog gets behind you chases you up on the front porch and you you go through the screen door and it put a spirit of fear on you and it's haunted you all your life now what what happened so he went back in time and brought it right up to present tense in the fourth dimension because in the fourth dimension it's unlike what you and I can do we can't travel like that can you imagine being able to go to New Zealand in the fourth dimension I just think about it and be there praise the Lord one of these days that's the way we'll travel that's the way prophets was so Ezekiel by the spirit of God it was like he was transported into Chala and then another place he said that he was transported to the river of chibar they say wow how how did they do that so there wasn't hitchhiking in the fourth dimension and trying to find a fast horse in that Dimension they could travel that's why brother R would be able to be carried beyond the curtain of time Paul said I knew a man about 14 years ago whether in the body out of the body I cannot tell but he said I knew such a man and he was carried Beyond you know of course what we know beyond the curtain of time into the third heavens and saw things and heard things that was unlawful for a man to utter my so prophets were able to move into that realm and see these things now watch Daniel Daniel chapter 2: 19 then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the god of Heaven now remember the king had had a dream and he couldn't remember all of it yet it was weighing on him it was troubling him to death as we would say so he call for the susers you know and all those men that did all of that and they said look y'all I I've had this dream they said oh great King live forever tell us the dream he said well that's the problem you Knuckleheads I can't remember the dream but it's troubling me it's bothering me I want you all to tell me they said are you kidding us there's never been a king that's ever asked such a thing there's never been a king so all the Su said now what's what God's doing God's doing this to pull his Prophet away from being a susay identification now them susers they had to admit it well we can't do this we can't do it but Daniel Shadrach me check and a minuto they knew a living God and they said oh King live forever there is a God who can reveal it now watch So Daniel in a vision you know what Daniel sees he sees the King's dream so but the difference was he wasn't like this he was in a trance in a state of euphoria a static place oh what what a thing it must have been for these men when they were there in a wrapped condition r a p t which is a short word for what you're fixing to experience rap sure now watch So Daniel then sees there he is he said oh my Lord oh it's this it's this colossal image and and he sees the head of gold and he sees all of the image of the of the king there the man in in the in the vision was described by metallurgical elements so gold silver bronze brass and then the feet iron and clim mixed together so they go the next day and he said all right tell me of course the old s said well can we we don't know I mean we're we're we we belong to the Baptist Church but we don't know what to tell you we belong to the Methodist Church but we don't know what to tell you we belong to the Luc and the Church of God we don't know what to tell you but Daniel walked up and said oh great king there is a God hallelujah there is a God who can reveal the secrets of the hearts can you imagine what them susers and all the rest of them people must have thought when Daniel stand there and he says great king you saw this great colossal image the head was of gold and then he goes on down and as he's seeing it Nebuchadnezzar's face is lighting up like a Christmas tree he said that was it that's what I saw how did you know that he said the god of Heaven re the god of Heaven revealed to me the secret do you understand we are still living in that dream we're living right down at the feet and the toes to where the iron and the clay protestantism and all the rest of Catholicism and all that they tried to mold it together but it will not hold together it will break apart we're still living in that great thing notice again Daniel 8:16 let me go ahead and read verse 15 and it came to pass when I even I Daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man now I don't mind telling you most of us are not made to deal in this Supernatural realm we're just not and it don't mean that we're not good Christians that don't mean that we don't love the Lord but we're just not called to deal with this there's special people that God has placed on the earth these prophets to walk in that realm to be honest with you I don't I I don't want to I don't want to be there anyway I'm not made up to deal with what what Supernatural things that I've seen has scared me to death and I don't believe God would press us beyond what that we're called to do but now listen what he what he experienced there stood before me as the appearance of a man and I heard a man's voice between the banks of Uli which called and said Gabriel make this man to understand the Vision so here was the angel Gabriel huh you wouldn't have to worry about me telling a visitation about Gabriel cuz I'd probably pass out I'm not made to deal with that neither are you all come on just accept it most of the preachers that we know in this message are not called they're not this caliber of men though many would love to be when God chooses men to deal with in this way they are set apart from everyone else and we cannot make ourself this only God can do this notice chapter 10:14 now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days you understand that the children of Israel are now walking in part of the vision of the Book of Daniel and part of it is yet to come part of it they lived out under Antiochus epiphanes Daniel saw a goat raise up and he had one horn then he saw a ram rais up with so many horns each one of them was a power and a King Antiochus epes was the one with the one horn nearly wiped them out but God would not let it happen what was it it wasn't a priest it wasn't a singer it wasn't a good person it had to be a man that was made in a certain way God couldn't risk it to a person who had a gift that had a margin of error now you see there are people that are gifted but their gift has a margin of error that's how it can hit and miss hit and miss hit and miss that ain't the way God is going to reveal his word it's got to be infallable praise God now notice Obadiah very very small book of the Old Testament the vision of Obadiah thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom now when these prophets would say this this is not actually a man just feeling impressed thus sayeth the Lord thus sayith the Lord it actually was the Lord I hope this don't stagger you but when Jesus was here they they they you know they constantly was picking him and he quoted them the word how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God when your own law says ye are Gods that's in your new testament for he said did not he call them Gods to whom the word of God came to now that was not all of Israel that was those chosen ones so is it in the message we've got great preachers in the message we've got some great event great pastors great teachers but we only needed one prophet of God of the caliber of Malachi 4 that's all you need is that right you only need one of that caliber cuz God can say everything with that prophetic gift then what are the pastor supposed to do study what that Prophet brought and stay with it evangelist teachers and so on now watch thus sayith the Lord God concerning Edom we have heard a rumor I've always thought this is so unusual we have heard a rumor from the Lord and an ambassador is sent among the Heathen arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle naom again one of the Minor Prophets as is called in the Old Testament the burden of of Nineveh the book of the vision of naom the aishite but now remember these prophets would sometimes only preach to the time frame in which they were in but then every now and then they would break Force the way naam did and God allowed naam to look into the city of Chicago and see the Outer Drive anybody ever been in the outo drive of Chicago and he looked and he saw it and he didn't know what to make of it and he said the Chariots was jostling against one another whe they didn't have Chryslers and Chevrolets and Fords and Dodges so I mean he he saw this in the vision and brother renam said that whenever the prophet looked there and saw it he saw the Outer Drive of Chicago and he didn't know what to call them so he called them chariots can you imagine that man looking at the Outer Drive of Chicago I mean it's it's quite it's quite an expressway and loops and ramps going just every different direction and him carried up this man was used to dirt roads this man was used to paths and people walking and all of a sudden he's mov mov D up into who knows what time it was 20th century centuries and centuries way on in the future and he looked there by vision and saw people blowing their horns and there was tractors and trailers and there was dump trucks and there was cars and there was volkswagons and Fords and Chevrolet and pickups and all this that and other and thinking Lord God what in the world what is all that what what was that so he just come back down out of the vision all he knew to do was just write it down you imagine people for hundreds of years picked up and read that chariots josing against one another they thought Jing against one another well they ain't but three people in our community that's even got it got a chariot and they they certainly ain't josing against one another that was a false prophet I'm going to go on YouTube and I'm going to make me a video and I'm going to say that that man said something that wasn't even right well they called him Cher charot said we call him a false prophet because he didn't call it Chevrolet as a joke it's okay you can smile a little bit thank you Maria now think how unusual that it was for these men habac 2:2 and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it praise God for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not Terry and the use of the Word of Life Church said amen now let's move from there to the New Testament did New Testament people also have visions Luke 1:22 now this is the father Zacharias of John the Baptist the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and told him him and his wife was going to have a child but she was past child birth she was uh several years old and according to the time of life it had already ceased with them so he doubted and questioned and the angel said because you have done this you will not be able to talk so for nine months you're going to lose your ability to speak because you have doubted what I had to say when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless so the New Testament Prophet John the Baptist was foretold by an angel of God coming in a format now remember this was not a Prophet who saw the vision it was a priest so the word of the Lord could not come to him in the same way that it did to a prophet so you can imagine that many wasn't a priest so he he sees this and there's the angel of God you don't know what to make of it Luke 2423 and when they found not his body they had that had also seen a vision of angels which said he was alive now here the Lord Jesus has raised from the dead and a vision of angels has appeared you mean people in the New Testament were seeing visions no wait a minute I thought after the cross we would do Visions no more well you know we've got the Bible and we don't need them well you see that's actually tradition it's not the scripture acts 9: 10 and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananas and to him said the Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of tarus for he pray us and hath seen in a vision now I want you to notice now God dealing on both ends so ananas is seeing a vision and in the vision the Lord tells him I want you to go to this certain city I want you to go to this certain Street and then when you get there I want you to ask for a certain man you see how different this is than from a lot of the charismatics and stuff today well somebody here's got a burden and somebody's got a vision God can tell you the street the city the name the time the address praise the Lord a lot of discernments and things that are said today they're said in a very I hate to say it but they're said in a very deceitful way they're said that in a way that if it don't happen you won't be able to point your finger at the one who said it and if it does happen of course they're going to take credit and glory for it but a real one and they was already dealing with this when brother Brandon was here there was already people that was mimicking what he was doing and he rebuked it of course he said in face of the trumpets he said that sign of discernment he said not a dozen men but one man one man but you see after God sent that one impat well the devil sure didn't like me to did him with this part did he uhhuh now watch whenever brother Brandon was here all these impersonators started raising up I feel this and they would have oil and blood my my younger brother Jamie I love him with all of my heart but Jamie my younger brother I've seen oil drip from his hands he did not cause that to happen whenever we were praying for my mother dying with cancer and I seen it from both of Jim's hands and the oil it was as wet as if he would have dipped his hands down in uh some type of container and hold his hands and the oil would drip for him from his hands now remember that was one of the things going on when brother Brandon was here CU he said they got signs they got wonders they got all dripping I'm not saying that in a dragory way against Jamie because Jamie could not help it it just happened to him and I saw it with my own eyes praise the Lord now seeing that God was going to bring this to the New Testament Church and even though that have Bibles that have the church in order God was still using Visions so God then told ananas now this is what I want you to do and when you get there you're going to meet this man and I've already give him a vision too well wait a minute I thought Visions wouldn't even supposed to be in the new test oh but you see they are and have seen in a vision a man named ananas coming in that's my God and putting his hand on him that he might re receive his sight I imagine ananas needed this reality of God because this man was killing Christians now you imagine he needed this Vindication I would too wouldn't you chapter 11 of the book of Acts verse 5 and then we'll close I was in the city of japa praying and in a trance I saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheep now remember this is Simon Peter let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me acts 16:9 and a vision appeared to Paul in the night and there stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him saying come over into Macedonia and help us so do we believe in Visions are they new testament teaching I want your response back are Visions in the New Testament was it God that said there won't be no more Visions in the New Testament we see God doing the exact opposite let me read one more and actually had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly Gathering that the Lord has called us for to preach the gospel unto them let's Stand Together praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus how many here tonight believes that God still deals with his people in this way do you see young people why we needed a prophet of God that would come in this day and would not be able to just rally the people around him and have great healing campaigns well we'll get to it maybe maybe next time but one of the the signs for sure that Jesus gave us and the scripture by which we would be able to know the difference between a true prophet and a false one is a false prophet will always try to broaden the narrow paths a false prophet will come by deceptive means means that will try to draw all the people after him he will soften the gospel make the gospel easier Jesus warned us that there would be false prophets that would come and they would be dressed in sheep's clothing but he said that inside they would be ravening wolves ravening tearing ripping dividing pulling aunder but a true prophet of God will tell the truth if his friends forsake Him He will not preach for money fame or Fortune truly that's the kind of prophet that God has sent us in this last day can you imagine them bringing brother brandom a check over a million dollars escorting it and bringing it to him and he turned it down how many preachers in this message would do that today a man that the denomination said brother brandom if you will back off of serpent seed water baptism there's not another gift on the field that can touch yours if you will back off from some of these things our brothers will get behind you it'll go around the world you imagine as a man brother Rob that he looked at it and thought Lord is this what I need to do should I do this but aren't you glad he didn't he would have had to compromise on serpent seed then that had another list now you got to compromise on women preachers and you got to compromise on this and you got to compromise on that and do you honestly believe that sign that presence of God would have ever worked the same it would not have worked the same oh he still had it sure God gives gessi and an indan giver but I'm so grateful that we had a man that was willing to take the way of the Lord's despised few I'm grateful God still got men tonight that's doing exactly the same thing let's bow our heads together if you would Heavenly Father we consider ourselves such a blessed people to be able to set under the opes of the reveal word of this hour oh my father how we would have set in the days of Paul and if we'd been privileged to be at Corinth or Ephesus or any of the other places that he made his missionary Journeys and heard him taught we would have been the first century Christians and we would have heard Peter give his his experiences with the Lord Jesus or John oh Father how blessed we would have been in that day but Lord we consider ourselves to be so blessed in our day and in one sense of the word we are more blessed because when Thomas was able to touch the nail prints and the scars in your side and he said my Lord and my God yet you said to him Thomas you have believed because you have seen but how much more blessed are they that have never seen and yet they believe there's young people standing here tonight that was never in one of brother Ram Services they never talked maybe some of them to eyewitnesses to verify what they're hearing on tape but they believe it with all of their hearts if there would be another generation before long all those eyewitnesses brother Harvey sister Shirley Lunsford said here in our church brother Byron Palmer also an eyewitness brother Brenham came to their home they was there at the tabernac was through many services eyewitnesses even still alive in our church brother Tim puit an eyewitness there at the meetings in sort in 1965 if time goes on these eyewitnesses will all be gone but the word will still stand true Lord Jes Jesus thank you for opening our eyes and letting us be part of the open vision of the end time bless these young people father I pray keep them by your grace in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you I love you all so much what I would have given if Carol and I and our teens or our 20s could have been able to heard these things I thank my goodness how much more I could have done for God you see you won't have to go through the years of unlearning a bunch of stuff stuff that you heard that you picked up and and still you'll hear things in the message and and those things will try to raise yourself up you don't know what that's not many of you never you've never had to do with it many of you were raised in in this church not in this church building but you know what I'm saying you were raised in the message don't take it for granted think how blessed you are that you don't have to struggle and wrestle with trying you in baptism and you don't have to wrestle with this and that and the other that a lot of the older people that come to our church you're bless young people may God bless [Applause] you thank you Lord Jesus [Music] pus oh falling in love with

worthy of all praise my heart will seeing how great is our God [Music] 30 is coming into the message and one thing that brother Donnie mentioned uh brother Donnie mentioned at the end is that they wanted him to compromise on serpent seed and they wanted him to compromise on on water baptism well those are the things that got my attention that's what got my attention do not be afraid that it's what we believe is different okay it's very different than than when Christendom was and very different what I was hearing from the ministry as well as the message and basically I'd read the scripture first and I would go back and I'd read a sermon and I'd go back to find out where is that in scripture I was not wanting to sign up for anything and when I recognized the message dovetailing with the Scripture it was shocking to me how it did not it went against what I had been taught but it was exactly according to the word so I challenge you and God challenges Us Try Me look into the word and see if that's what Dove tales with the word and not with the world and that's what got my attention because it was different what they wanted him to compromise about is exactly what God hold of me and then I founded the word and then it gave me confidence it doesn't matter what man has to say about these things God has honored to his word will honor his word and honor his word in me that that was a progression and we ask you to do that even if you're young you don't want to just be in this church you want to go ahead and find God for yourself and let the Revelation grow in you according to the scripture Let's uh let's pray dear Lord thank you for your grace to us I thank you so much for the opportunity I thank you for the atmosphere in this building tonight Lord as you've come and and fellowship with us I thank you for Learning and and being a teacher to us teaching us more of your way and your your nature we thank you so much as we fall deeper and deeper in love we look forward to Heaven at continual unfolding of who you are and feel so blessed to be a part we are we're thankful for the differences that you are are in the world and that what the world has to offer did not satisfy the soul and didn't satisfy me but you have and I so thank you for it Lord than you are worth everything Lord we could ever hope and dream for and I pray and we'd Commit This service into your heart and into our hands in Jesus name amen God bless you all love you all thank you Brothers [Applause] [Music] oh every praise is to our God oh every word of worship with one [Music] Accord Every

word of the Lord we'll sing a song I don't regret a [Music] mile come on go ahead brother Bobby this makes me God's grace does for us um as many of you know I was diagnosed with therosis of the liver and a 10 cm Mass on the right side of the liver this was in about May of 2022 we had took a family trip to the Ark in Kentucky and I became very sick and while I was there I broke out in a rash that covered about 80% of my body my temperature was high I made it back home and went to the emergency room and they thought they titled it maybe a boil skin disease uh I I just looked like I'd been boiled in oil that's how my whole body looked and uh they didn't know what to do for me uh they sent me home then it escalated till I was hospitalized and they found out out it was a rare form of sasis and it only happens in random cases uh Mayo Clinic has treated two cases of it and the rest the doctor said it most doctors had never seen it on a human it was only in textbooks that they had saw it so God brought me through that but in the meantime I was uh began to swell in my abdomen and they had uh the doctors had done MRI and they determined I had therosis but I had to go in for a parenthesis and they had taken actually nine and a half 2 lers of fluid from me so I went on for a little while the fluid began to gather again and usually when this happens you're not too far from the end is what they say sometimes so but I was trusting God so I go back again they take 8 and 1/2 2 L again then my right lung filled and they took a one L of fluid out of my right lung I sat and watched them draw it out into something like a coke bottle I was uh 6 years old and we had a chance to go to brother braham's meetings in Chicago Ohio in 1960 and we we were there for five nights and two things that I remembered we were in a Pentecostal Church growing up there was a lady that they requested prayer for her name was Polly Reed and she she was in Middletown Ohio and you'll hear it on the tape it is I Be not Afraid we our family was setting two rows of seats from her when brother bam called her out he said that light was circling over there it landed first on a lady beside of her then it moved over to her and he told her he said you have a hole in your heart and you're going to die well we had just heard that testimony about 3 weeks before that in our hometown Church in Virginia never did we believe that we would see that lady so she was healed immediately I'm giving you this background to to try to encourage you with faith uh on the night he preached the reject the king there was a lady laying across from me on a stretcher and she looked like the great niece of Florence Nightingale she was Skin and Bones she's able to barely raise her hand up off the cot brother R's getting ready to leave the platform and he turned back and looked in our Direction he said what was that past me he said that wasn't an uler he said that was a cancer devil well he immediately prayed for her and I saw her with my own eyes get up off that cot and Shout to the glory of God I whispered to my mother I said how is she standing on those legs or nothing but broomsticks but she did that was a platform for for the faith that I I got when this when I got this diagnosis so I go to the doctor and they say well you got the therosis you got a 10 cm Mass it's possibly cancer first wanted to do surgery maybe a transplant then they come back and said you don't qualify for either so I said you you giv me no hope medically they said no I said well I've got a high power that has the final answer so I would not take any drugs any chemo uh they they actually got mad at me because I wouldn't go the route they wanted me to go but seeing this from my childhood I knew God was the same yesterday today and forever and I have testified that to many of these brothers they can tell you that I've said that after saying this as a young boy that God was the same and he still is I don't care what you're going through what you've been diagnosed with you don't have fear and you get up every day and you testify you thank God for healing you that's what I did and I'm still standing here today they did a MRI and a again about a year ago the doctor three months ago said well you know you've got cancer don't you I said well that's what they say I never have said I have this or I don't have it I said they say I have it but I'm not testifying to that so they don't you know they couldn't couldn't hardly grasp that so but anyway uh I was uh recovering doing better and I was on a platform on Wednesday night playing the guitar but I still very weak in my body I was hardly able to walk brother Daryl had prayed for his last person here and uh I I wanted to get up and go down but I was too weak I didn't think I could get back up if I did so I said God I saw this as a child I said I don't have to go to him you can send him to me that was the very words I said in my heart he prayed for the last person I was sitting here in the old church he put his coat across his arm he walked toward me and he turned around looked at me like he had never seen me before he walked straight to me and started praying for me from that time on my health started turning and by the grace of God I'm standing here today and can give you this testimony no matter what the devil tells you don't accept it it's it's not the final answer he's a blood and go go about your life brother BR said go about your life and don't fear I had no fear I can honestly say with my hand over my heart when they told me the diagnosis I walked through the valley of the shadow of death but I had no fear because I knew if he he took care of me all the rest of my life he could do it this time that's right so brothers and sisters no matter what he tells you don't fear it brother Ram said do not fear it and you go about your life and you sing and you give God praise and you thank him every day for what he's done and you will see the results God bless you I think brother Bobby could say that he doesn't regret one mile that he's traveled for the Lord and that right there is why because if he didn't believe in him he could have left him there to die but instead he healed him and there he is amen let's sing this old song I don't regret one mile I've traveled for the Lord and I don't re ret one time I trusted in his words I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret one m that I traveled for the Lord let's sing it one more time oh I don't regret one m i Trav for the Lord and I don't regret one time I've trusted in his word I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret one m I traveled for the Lord no oh I don't regret [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] D for the you can say Amen to that can't you brother Jackie seemed like I was uh well I was just a a young boy and the Lord spoke to me down on the river that day and told me to preach then he spoke to me told me when I turned 30 I'd start traveling and so when I turned 30 I got an invitation down into South Carolina and that kind of got me traveling and then I traveled for years and worked 40 hours a week and I come home sometimes 3 4:00 in the morning and sat in the chair for a little bit and throw water in my face and go to work then in June of 2000 I was coming back from lunch going back to surgery come around the corner of a hallway there at the VA hospital and just walked right into the presence of the Lord he was just hanging there and I just begin to weep a voice spoke to me and said go preach my word so in 2000 I went fulltime and 24 years later I don't regret a mile that I've traveled for the Lord amen he's he's been so good for all of us and that's what we want to look at tonight is to know that none of us are here by accident but there's a purpose for all of us if you have your Bibles turn with us tonight to the book of Ephesians want to read from Ephesians chapter 3 verse 11 and brother Justin talking about 911 as we remember that that day and he was right he was at our house was having a little birthday party for Carissa and Allison uh the day that that happened and I guess everybody remembers where they was at when they got news of that that terrible day but amen Ephesians 3 we just want to read one verse there of verse 11 trust something to be said tonight to help you to encourage you that's truly the reason that we came and I don't uh know all that everybody here is facing or what you're going through with individually and how many needs would be here tonight but there's one thing that I do know is that there's not a need in the building that's greater than our God there's not one diagnosis that you've got that God wasn't aware of didn't take God by surprise it might have shocked you but not God he knew all about it can you believe that tonight he's got it all in control I said he's got it all in control Ephesians 3:11 the the Bible says this according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord now Eternal means without beginning and end that which always has been and always will be without beginning Without End never to cease Eternal may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads I want to speak to you tonight on God God's undefeatable Eternal purpose God's undefeatable Eternal purpose or if I could take a context out of that I'd like to say the man who wrote the book says I'm one of them Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord and we thank you for the opportunity to stand before your people we surrender this congregation and oursel into your hands For Your Glory may you come tonight Lord and speak Words of Life to our hearts and Lord may we not just be hearers of the word as James said but may we be doers of that which we've heard may we accept it believe it and confess it for we know that is the ABCs of our healing that is the ABCs of our walk dear God is to believe what you said in your word about us we commit these things into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you may be S seated thank you buddy now I want to draw this first into your mind that there's not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing that could destroy us not one thing until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing the prophet said so then we come to understand this evening that we are made for a purpose you see this church here T night that we're in and we thank God for it it's such a such a beautiful building but this Foundation that was dug this building the roof and the interior and that was put in it was not just done all this wasn't just done to see if it could be done it was put here for a purpose your home that you was in before you come to church tonight was not just accidentally put there for somebody just wasting time where well we'll just see if we can build this no your home was made for a purpose your home was made to serve a purpose the automobile you drove here tonight was not made just to see if it could be made the material was not wasted by man it was made for a purpose to serve a purpose the clothing that you wear tonight was not just to see if somebody could design or fashion a piece of clothing no it was put for a purpose the food that you eat was not grown on the earth just to see if it could be grown but the food that we eat was grown to serve a purpose amen and God just not uh just didn't just happen to be making a tree just to be making a tree but he made a tree for a purpose and I want to say tonight that God made you not just to see if he could do it but God Made You for a purpose amen therefore there is a purpose for all of us being here we're not here here just to be another human being but we are here because God made you for some purpose we W just put here to eat the food that God grow we're not just put here to live in a house that some man made or or to drive an automobile that somebody created or wear clothes that somebody fashion but we are here for a specific purpose the trees God didn't have to make trees the way he made them but he made the trees for a purpose though they're different from one another yet he made each tree for a purpose purpose he could have make trees any way he wanted to make them he could have made flowers any way he wanted to make flowers but he made all of them the trees and the flowers everything he made for a purpose and what was that purpose to give a witness to give a testimony oh think about that he just didn't make a tree to be making it but he made a tree for a purpose that it would be a witness that it could give a testimony some people well that's just a tree but to God it's a witness it's a testimony he made them to Bear witness for they are God's Witnesses they are a true witness that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ is right the very trees that God placed upon the Earth will condemn some of these false religions for the trees the that God himself created serve a purpose to give a witness that Jesus Christ is right the death burial and Resurrection gives a witness that we are not dead eternally but we shall live again amen it shows a supreme intelligence look at the sun the prophet said when it comes out in the morning what's what happens to the sun it's a little baby born in the East about 10:00 it's a teenager at noon time it's in its strength in the evening time it's middle aged and at the evening time it's gone it's set it's finished but is that all there is of the sun no God's got a purpose for the Sun so the Sun comes back and rises again what does it what does it speak of it speaks of a birth a life a death and a resurrection Hallelujah it goes to show that it was made by a supreme intelligence to serve a purpose it's here for a purpose and I say tonight if that's true for for a flower if that's true for a tree if that's true for the sun then what about you what about you do you think we just accidentally fell into this thing you think God just accidentally created us I tell you no as the tree has a purpose and the flower has a purpose and the sun has a purpose to give a witness to be a testimony God has created you Hallelujah to be a witness no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you're here to serve a purpose it don't matter how old you are how young you are every person here was here for a purpose to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose and the nail on my finger is here for a purpose my eye and every part of my body is here for a purpose sure this little finger maybe not look as much as the as the bless of my eye but it's still a part of my body and it serves a purpose and I need that nail on the little finger come on somebody well I'm not the eye I'm not the tongue I'm not the ear but I don't care if I'm just a little toe on the foot the last toe where that little crease touches the foot if that's who I am in the body I still am here to serve a purpose hallelujah amen my eye every part of my body is here to serve for purpose it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it was God's divine plan to do so and if we were put here for a purpose then there's nothing nothing that can destroy us till God's purpose is fulfilled I make a Baptist shout I said there is nothing that can harm us until the purpose that God has put us here has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartache we have how sorrow that we go through all these things are for a reason God is not the author of confusion and everything that happens in our life God has a purpose for allowing it to happen amen and no matter what we Face the sorrow the pain the disappointment the sickness the fear all the things that we face as human beings has not been put here to destroy us because our purpose Hallelujah cannot be defeated by the things we suffer Hallelujah Hallelujah no matter how much heartache no matter how much sorrow all these things are a reason there's a reason for it but nothing you face in life will defeat the purpose that God has brought for your life it's the undefeatable Eternal purpose of the almighty God oh Hallelujah God placed you here you didn't stagger into this thing he could have put us in Luther's day Wesley's day he could put us in the days of Paul he could put us in the days of Jesus we could have been one of the discipl I Les but he chose this age this time this season this place to place you here it was not by accident but God knew in the last day in this age of confusion and lies and all the distress and all the darkness he knew he could put you here because he knew you would believe him when he spoke amen hallelujah Nations a lie to you governments a lie to you family a lie to you come on somebody but the word of God will never lie to us hallelujah and he knew he could have you here he could place you here and against all and against all darkness and against all confusion and against all denominations and against all internets somebody would believe his word and he said that's you I placed you here because I know you're the Seed of Abraham and Abraham's seed believes God when he speaks Hallelujah I'm not based well I got a sensation I'm not basing on a sensation I'm not basing it on the Goosebump I'm basing on thus sayth the word of God Sensations a lie to us emotions a lie come on somebody those things a lie to us but the word of God will never lie to us hallelujah well brother I want you to know I got it when you shouted no you got it when you believed that's right well Glory Hallelujah the undefeatable Eternal purpose of God God placed you here as a true witness of God that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ well brother Dar what's the answer to believe the sign what is the answer to believe the sign on Facebook and on the Internet it's you Hallelujah he put you here to be a true witness that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ is right think about it go with me for a few minutes in your mind before there was ever an angel a star a planet there was no air there was no life there was no stars there was no World there was nothing else it was God and God Alone Ella Ella Elohim which means the self-existing one there was nothing else existed but him and the self-existing one that we call God but before there was ever anything to worship him he was just a self-existing one and the self-existing one had a desire he had a purpose something that he wanted to achieve and he purposed within himself that he would do this thing and he spoke let there be light and there was like why he purposed it and the Darkness could not stop the light from coming forth because God's purpose can never be defeated amen hallelujah no matter how mysterious it may seem to be God always keeps his word God keeps his word if God makes a promise of anything God will keep that promise you and I make promises we intend to keep but things happen that we have to to break a promise but not God oh no he knows all the future from the beginning he don't make a promise unless he knows what's going to happen and he always keeps his promise God Don't Make A Promise unless he knows it's going to unless he knows he's going to keep it unless he knows what's going to happen Hallelujah he will not make a promise unless he knows he's going to keep it other words God just don't say something to be sa if God says something he means it and if God says he'll do something he'll bankrupt all Heaven before he'll let that promise fail you God purposed within himself to prove his word he said I will prove my word to be the truth listen to me I don't believe God heals people just to show his power to heal that's not why God heals he heals to fulfill his word for the word says He Is A Healer amen he shows he fulfills his word he keeps his promise when he came here on the earth the first time he said that he did this that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets listen to me all God's word must be fulfilled all of it all of it all of it God's purpose can never be defeated there's nothing that can defeat it so how happy we all to be today are you happy y let your face know it come on somebody he's got it all in control oh brother darl you don't know what I'm going through with you don't know what I'm going through with but that don't matter that don't change God's program that don't change God's purpose that don't change God's plan he's still God he's still mov come on somebody he's got it all in control he's not lost his power he's not a do old Grand Pa sleeping somewhere God is on the throne amen how happy we ought to be today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there's neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing that can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate God's Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said Hallelujah God said let a virgin conceive and bring forth a child and it was as God said God said behold i s you Elijah before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and it was as God said that's right God said there'll be a bride she'll be bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh Spirit of my spirit and she is she is him and it is as God has said there will be a bride brother I reckon when she'll come she's here brother Bon said in 64 he said the bride is born in infancy the word is come forth through the end time friends we're at the end time in' 64 it was a bride in infancy but what's happened between 60 64 and 2024 the bride has come to maturity she's reached the age of love She's reached the season she can reproduce him again on the earth Hallelujah think of it the heavenly father do you think for one minute that the heavenly father will be defeated in his purpose even though Satan has done what he's done it's an impossibility he will not be defeated and he's given us perfect assurance that we will not have to be scared of anything amen what the father has purposed in your life can never be defeated the undefeatable eternal purpose of God for your life think about that you see what do you mean well think of David David was anointed by the great prophet Samuel to be king and between the ages of 10 and 15 year old who was 9' N9 in tall and saw the king that David no doubt looked up to he tells David you're just a youth you're too young you can't do it and Goliath has been a Warrior from his Youth and you're still a youth but the giant that stood before David did not see the God who was with David Hallelujah if he did he would have turned from the battle amen but God done said to David you will reign as king it came through a prophet's message God sent a prophet to tell David what his future was he might have preached future home to him come on somebody God sent a prophet to tell David not only what was happening right now but things that are to be and God told David through a prophet you will reign his King now how can he die by a giant as a boy and reign as king so David took God at his word and as far as the word was was concerned Goliath was defeated before the battle ever started because God's purpose for David's life could not be defeated by a giant and the giant that tries to R over your life cannot defeat God's purpose for your life amen you said brother darl I've got a giant raining in my life right now I've got this mountain as a boy told me Sunday down when he come up for gra me want me to pray for him he said I've got this mountain that needs to be moved but let me tell you no mountain can stand in the way of God's purpose for your life amen no jant no trial no habit no sickness no disease come on somebody there is nothing n o t h n nothing that can defeat God's purpose for our life it'll be as God has said it will be Shad M shako Flo into a furnace heated up seven times hotter than it ever been heated before and we said they said whether God would deliver us this we do not know but there's one thing we do know he is more than able to deliver us he's able to deliver us but nonetheless we will not bow to this image and the prophet said God had someone who would serve him and his purpose would not be defeated fire cannot defeat the purpose of God's plan and the prophet said how we left the say this morning all the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church well brother Daryl you reckon Putin I don't care what Putin's going to do he ain't going to do nothing but what God allow him to do amen and if they push one button we'll be gone before it ever strikes the United States yeah all the bombs they have all the threats they have the imminent oh my yo everybody's looking for a donkey they're looking for Harris or they're looking for Trump to save this nation they believe in a donkey tell you this nation don't need a donkey nor an elephant it needs a lamb they rejected the thing that they [Applause] needed all the bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church all the explaining the way all the mathematics so forth the intelligence of the world has disguised the purpose to do something about to destroy the faith of God's children don't you understand they'll never crucify him again but the prophet said what is the third crucifixion brother Jackie the crucifying the effects of the word that can never nail him to a tree again that's been done one time but what they they do now through the websites through the books come on somebody they try to take the word of God and make it no effect in your life amen come on somebody but the Bible said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the the word of God so what did they do they tried to explain it away by their intelligence they try to explain it away by their mathematics something trying to destroy the faith of God's children all this believe the sign trash all these books that they buy on Amazon it's a bunch of nonsense I said it's a bunch of nonsense you think I'm going to believe somebody that wrote a book that can't do one miracle that don't know God from a hot and to come on somebody I serve the Living God tonight and he promised to send Elijah the prophet and he kept his word and he sent that prophet to me and he opened the seals and he revealed to me my purpose for being on the earth amen there is no book from Amazon going to take that away from me Hallelujah the prophet said they'll never do it that faith that faith will live on forever Moses when he talking and all the wisdom of the Egyptians when he knew that God had a purpose for his life what did that Revelation come from his mother said she was the Fifth Gospel it was Joseph his mother who took Moses and shoved him right out into the jaws of death what did she take him to what were they doing with these Hebrew children they was throwing them into the river they was feeding them to the crocodiles and and what did yed do she knew that God delivered Noah by an ark so she built an ark for her baby and what did she do she pushed it right out there in the now where all the crocodiles was she pushed it right out into the jaws of death why would she do that because she knew God's purpose could not be defeated amen there wasn't enough water in an aisle to drown him there wasn't enough crocodiles in all the world that could swallow him he was God's chosen and he was God's chosen for that purpose and nobody could take his place we are God's chosen today we believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus there's no bombs there's no hell there's no nothing else that can destroy God's purpose we have got to go into the resurrection it's promise it's a promise that we have of our God Amen he said there will be a Rapture as far as God's concerned we already have Moses on the back side of the desert out there the the screams and the HTS and the Wilderness stagging around almost perishing but he knew that nothing could defeat God's purpose huh for God had placed him there God had put Moses there to do what God told him to do cuz his purpose cannot be defeated think of Joseph and and mared a child the child was to be born in Bethlehem not on the road to Bethlehem not on the hill to Bethlehem not at the city welcome sign of Bethlehem it had to be Bethlehem because the word of God called for it listen to me Mary Don't Be Afraid Of The Journey Don't worry about the mule Dy don't worry about the thieves on the road we're on the journey to the Eternal purpose of God the child will be born in in Bethlehem the word will become flesh in Bethlehem why God purposed for it to be oh little bride don't be afraid of the journey we were born for a purpose and that's to reproduce Jesus Christ in flesh again Hallelujah God watched over them AGI why because they had the appropriate gifts to identify his presence on the earth there was nothing that would stop them from getting to Jesus Jesus they were born to identify him on the earth then what have we been put here to do little bride I tell you we have been put here to identify him on the Earth today amen making him the same yesterday today and forever we're more than a church member we're more than a message believer come on somebody the devil believes and trembles we're more than that we was born for a purpose God wrote your name with Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world he knew the color of your skin he knew the color of your hair he knew the color of your eyes he knew your name and wrote your name with Jesus why Brother David why would he write my name with Jesus why brother Jackie because we are join AES hallelujah hallelujah when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable well brother I don't feel that way he never said did you feel it he said did you believe it if you believed it you might start feeling it there is nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable you got to turn to your neighbor and say you're undefeatable well that was weak well you'll say it sooner or later you are absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's in you not Christ not Christ the body but the word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born from her then let's go from here tonight with this understanding we will not be defeated there is nothing that is is coming there is nothing that Satan is bringing there is nothing that can stop this bride we may have trials we may have troubles but there is nothing that will stop this bride from fulfilling the purpose of God for the bride will not be defeated and God's purpose will not be defeated he has given us perfect Assurance amen that we are the bride and we will not be defeated therefore we have nothing to fear amen did not he tell his disciples that night when they were scared did not he say Be not Afraid when he stepped in the boat him man I turned to him and said don't you understand what's happening don't you understand what you're experiencing don't you understand where you're at the word is being made flesh do you understand where you're at forence not a Creed not a Dogma the word is being made flesh amen listen you were made for an eternal purpose because you are the manifestation of an attribute you are the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you he made an earth to take you out of to make you a human being every man that come to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember if you can just keep quiet remember if he's called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening listen a young Minister don't have to try to produce his ministry brother Joe if God's called him God will open the doors that's right come on somebody you see it so much nowadays where they adverti theirself on the internet make theirself available but if God's called you for this God Will Make A Way for it to happen amen hallelujah God has ordained for you just keep Ste remember if he's called you for this there's nothing that can keep it from happening there's not enough devils in torment but what God's word will be made manifest you were born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place God's word will Triumph it cannot fail that's where every Christian ought to stand knowing trials will come up and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it will all work out right amen I don't understand it he never asked us to understand it but he did ask us if we believed him yes sir amen I remember that night sure I was crying and I got a basket for her to throw up in cuz she's so upset she said I've lost my daddy I've lost my sister she said why would God do this for us my little baby why would he do this she said you're gone all the time you're never home you're traveling why would he do this to us I said listen honey I don't know I don't know why this is happening but there's one thing I do know sometimes God don't ask us to understand he just ask us can we trust him can we trust what he's doing he'll make a way for us somehow some way he didn't bring us this far to leave us he didn't build a home in us to move away come on somebody he never taught us this s to let us drown and he never lifted us up in this hour to let us down he's got it all in control oh my let me hurry what was Jesus manifested for why was Jesus manifested on the earth to show God did not they say show us the father he said have I not been with you so long what was he here to do to show us God then what has the bride manifested for what is she manifested for why is she here in this hour why is he raised her up in these last days what is she therefore to show God what's more of this world will hear from God it'll be through his bride for the final voice to the final age amen do you love him he sent the life that he lived by he sent that life back to the church the Holy Spirit God's purpose we find here of sending the Holy Spirit back to the church was for one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that was God in Christ continuing the plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his Works through the church continuing his work through the church the God that was in Christ continued his plan through Christ and out of Christ into the church to continue his work through the church he was God he had to be no man could die no Prophet could die he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the Kings he was the history he was he that was to come he was he that was he that is and he that's to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose he achieved the church that he might have the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the preeminence the preeminence in the church the position his place in the church Jesus said he that believeth in me works I do shall he do also and even more than this shall he do for I go to the father's sea that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody who can so see it that they can let the word manifest through them someone who can so see the purpose of God the plan of God that they can let the word manifest through them Jesus so seated was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed then this Ransom Church of the last day

people there's no persecution of the world can can blow out that flame that God has lit for God has purposed that his torch light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no powers no

can we rest can we rest in his plan how many of you remember brother Alfred Hall anybody remember brother Hall you know brother Hall was a pretty dark skinned man wasn't he well here a few year ago they had a mungon reunion now some of you may not know what a mungon is but a mungon they call them the mysterious people out of the hills of Tennessee and Virginia over here and some people claim they were Cherokees some claimed they were pugie and genre and I don't know what all they claimed these people to be but there was actually a tri-racial people they were white black and Native American reason I know so much about it a lot of my mama's people the Goodman and the Moors and the Gibsons and the Sweeny they was all identified as that so here a few year ago they had a mungon reunion up in Virginia and me and my brother went to it and we was walking out through there now they had brother they had a man by the name of Brent Kennedy Dr Brent Kennedy and he wrote a book on the mungon it's called the mungon a mysterious people actually have the book there in my study and so we was walking around up there at this melon reunion and I told my brother Dwayne I said I tell you right now if anybody is at this reunion it'll be brother Alfred Hall and we turn the corner guess who we run into I said brother Hall I knew you would be here and he started laughing and he had that book Brett Kennedy the mysterious melons of mysterious people I said I knew you'd be here he said yeah he said the man that wrote the book said I'm one of them and I've come to tell youall come

charge elect to God's elect it is God that justifi who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of God of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter they and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded can I get an amen I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angel nor principality nor power nor things present nor things to come nor hyp nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord then what should we be we are children of the promise being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and our HS with him with the promise no matter how much sickness comes what kind of death we die how much poverty we go through God's purpose cannot be defeated he will raise us up again for he said because I live ye shall live also the author of this book said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the her of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of me saith the Lord that's what the author said well so and so and well they got this book I don't care what they say that's what the author said I think I shared this with you but I it just came on my heart here a few years ago this bookstore took the book of this man and he invited his Professor down from a major university he had a degrees about this long and he invited this man down to give an interpretation of this book so the man comes you know he's kind of famous so all these people come into the bookstore and gathered around going to get him to sign this book you know and they're going to listen as he gave his interpretation of the book and he started out he said now in chapter one what the author was trying to say was this and when it got done oh that was just so good chapter two they chapter three when he got to chapter 4 he said now in chapter 4 what the author was trying to say was thus and thus and thus and just as the people got ready to clap there was the man in the crowd said nope that ain't right sort of like saying Amen in the church everybody turn around and see who it was that said it you know and so he goes on to chapter five and every chapter five six 7even the guy says Nope ain't right so by chapter eight this professor he was Furious and they just lost all self control and just as he said now in chapter eight before he could even get it out the man said nope and he just lost

we good Brothers yeah I guess we are praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus what would we do without him amen aren't you glad it's not Christ bless your works and my works and your mama and your daddy and the church Christ alone that's the way we're righteous let's turn to Matthew 24 tonight Matthew Matthew 24 verse 26 through verse 28 wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert so that could be Tucson or Judea or the Sahara but I want you to notice that Jesus is giving a warning about his coming and that there would be people that would try to point you to one location on the earth to where you have to be to be a part of his coming wherefor they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret Chambers believe it not now the Lord Jesus was not mincing words friends and he believes his words had value amen so he's warning of us of a time before his coming that people would go pointing to a particular spot or a particular place and say now if you want to see the coming of the Lord you've got to be at Word of Life Church or you've got to be over here you've got to be over there notice this is the Lord himself for as a lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together notice Jesus didn't say chickens or vultures but Eagles aren't you glad you're part of an eagle message for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together now as it would be um Whenever two people would hear he the same sermon and one would leave the service and say well I heard this and this and this and another one say I didn't hear that I heard this and this and this and then another one would say that wasn't what I heard I heard this and this and this well now this is what Matthew wrote about this scenario Luke 17:34 listen the way that Luke wrote it I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed but now when you read the original the word men is not actually in the original text but it actually says there shall be two in one bed now you may wonder why would I say that well oh because homosexual Christians what a disgrace to even say such things like to take this scripture and prove that two men can be in the bed together but if you go to your original text you'll find out it does not say men at all I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other left if there's two men sleeping together they won't neither one of them be took the pastor's back home oh my one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left now listen how the Rapture is going to be so people would just be going about their daily activities so two at the grocery store to at Walmart to at Lowe's to at Home Depot whatever to in a family maybe sitting on the couch you know going to church together whatever they're doing one will be taken and the other one will be left now no doubt these are Associates or friends or family members or they might even go to the same church two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left now what I love about this is that Jesus does not make the elect to where that they're not working and they're not grinding and they're not fixing breakfast and they're not just going about their job you see what I'm saying they they didn't feel like that they they they couldn't be spiritual if they had a job you're not very spiritual if you don't if you don't work you don't eat I love the way that he sets this because he shows us that people would be going about their daytoday activities two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where Lord and amazing how different he wrote it than what Matthew wrote it where Lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is Matthew said carcass Luke said body wheresoever the body is fither will the Eagles be gathered together praise the Lord Brother Donnie how can I make sure that I'm going to be there well one thing of course you have to be in Christ Jesus another thing is you gather with eagles now so you can gather with them after a while you see you can't go to church with buzzards and chickens and expect to be gathered with Eagles at that day you can't belong to a denominational prostitute and be identified as a wise virgin it's totally impossible to be a wise virgin and a foolish virgin at the same time how many wants to be a part of that more than anything else in your life me too let's pray together Lord Jesus these great words that were spoken over 2,000 years ago for Millennia men have read these these scriptures taken text and given different titles to it some of sincerity some not some genuine God call men some not so much but father we have come here tonight that we could be prepared for this hour I don't think any anyone here in the right mind would want to fulfill that part of the verse of scripture about the one that was LIF oh Jesus I pray that our hearts our ears our minds would be open to the spirit of God that we would be able to be prepared for this hour that lays before us help us to see and believe that only a people with a perfect heart will ever leave this world people with perfect Hearts they hold no grudges they forgive they are peacemakers they love your word they love you oh God God I pray if there's one here tonight without a perfect heart may they realize the value of it father may it be their goal their desire Above All Things help us tonight father we ask in the name of Jesus and the Saints said God bless you you may be seated I realized to preach the coming of the Lord in the traditional Church way is what people expect when they hear these scriptures I know that it makes us quite unusual that we believe the coming of the Lord has so many aspects I'm not sure if you've ever looked at this before but in Matthew there 2427 Jesus said so shall it be at the coming of the son of man that Greek word there coming is parosa now it's sad that that word was used among a rank an element around our message that made basically a denomination out of it but yet it is a word that Jesus spoke and it can mean his Vis his Invisible Presence or it can also mean a Corporal return and the Lord Jesus we know spoke of a invisible coming as well as a visible one an invisible one would be for a a certain category of people those who are quickened by the spirit of God they are by God's presence known to be a mystical people they are mythical but they are also mystical now I know that word can be frightening because the devil uses it but a scarecrow shouldn't scare Eagles it should only scare crows now whenever we look at the coming of the Lord and the Rapture and the consummation of all the ages and the way that it's going to wind up with this great wonderful thing that we're anticipating every day of of our life we believe that it certainly will take more faith than has ever been in any other age and that faith that was once delivered to the Saints has been prophesy of course to be restored again in the last day with that would be a building and I know sometimes we may look at it and think what difference does it make if we go to church if we don't go to church what difference it make if we hear the word we believe the word why do your preachers keep saying listen to the tapes feed on the word what what what does that do well it's quite simple actually as you feed upon the word you actually become it which is the very reason Satan wants you so busy that you don't have time to read your Bible you don't have time to pray you don't have time to listen to tapes no more and I wonder if the things that are taking so much of our time are they actually worth it are they giving back to us things of Eternal value or are they things that just Rob us and make us more carnal more Earthly minded but it will truly be a special very unique people that will leave this world in a body change they are going to be a mystical people now watch's this in the message entitled perfect faith brother random says Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was so he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was but I remember he was still a mortal so it's like he was a mortal a human being get hungry get tired get weary have aches pains frustrations be troubled about issues in life feel the burdens of people all that sort of say and yet still live in a world of perfect Faith now watch he says if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then people then the people begin to say You' be a Mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they're a Mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Now isn't that peculiar they live in a world to themselves yet they're human like other humans they get hungry they get tired they get weary they can get sick frustrations even doubts can come in their minds fears oh my all kinds of of things like that yet at the same time from their soul they can live in another world that is totally unseen now what's this that's the way it is to all believers they're a Mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Jesus Jesus lived in that world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them they say about this he says and they said why you talk in riddles we don't understand this how can this be you see they wasn't in the world that he lived in know isn't that strange they they ate with him they slept with him as they sleep on the ground and they they was around him more than anybody else and they knew after a while his mannerisms his vocabulary certain ways he would say things and they could learn that of course by repetition and watching him but yet Jesus lived in a world that they did not understand so he would say certain things and they'd say what did you mean what what what are you talking about and he said well Lazarus is asleep and they said well if he's asleep he's he's doing good and he said Lazarus is dead amen now first he spoke from his world now they were part of his ministry but they were not in his world yet let me say it again they were part of his ministry they had received power to cast out Devils heal the sick do all sorts of wonderful things but their souls had not been transported into his world yet oh God help us Lord they wasn't in the world that he lived in see they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him now listen what Webster this is a combination of Webster and Miriam and a couple of different dictionaries that I got this word the meaning of the word Mystic from a Mystic is a person who seeks by contemplation and self surrender to obtain Unity with or absorption into deity or the absolute so a Mystic then is one who seeks by contemplation they they think it's not just you know that it passes through their mind every fourth day or every sixth Sunday or you know whatever but by contemplation it's their heart it's it's where they live so they seek by contemplation and they know that just can't think their way through it but also selfs surrender to obtain Unity with or absorption into deity or the absolute or who believes in the spiritual apprehension of truths that are beyond the intellect and the church said now believe it or not I just defined every member that will go in the Rapture now this is not something that you try to make yourself odd and make yourself different it's not that at all a lot of us have already got that anyhow so we don't need more of that actually we need to get away from some of that nonsense someone who attempts listen to this last part someone who attempts to be United with God so how many wants to be a Mystic if you never did before a Mystic listen to this in Matthew 13:10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given now you see this is one thing that makes us so different of our comprehension and our belief about God even with the majority of the churches that would be in the tric Ci's area because we believe this is the way God's nature is that he will reveal himself to whom he chooses to and he will say things in such a way that some will not get it that's right and others will now if you don't believe that you don't believe what I just read from your very Bible so this puzzled the disciples why would it puzzle them they were not yet Mystics now listen to me carefully there is a vast difference between a Christian believer and a true disciple search the New Testament and see when you go to looking at those that were identified as disciples even some of the Pharisees believed but it did not call them disciples now our word disciple comes from the same root word that we get the word discipline from so a Believer can believe in the cross Believe In The Blood II even believe in the Holy Ghost believe in heaven Believe In Hell believe in all kinds of things and therefore that would make them in one sense a Believer because the word pistol which is where we get the word believe and Faith from actually means one of the meanings of that word is an intellectual face so from your mind somebody explains it to you and it makes perfect sense to you so a person that would believe they said oh yes I believe I I do I do I'm not saying that they don't but it does not mean that that person is a disciple because when they hear disciplinary word preached they will say nobody's going to tell me how to live nobody's going to tell me what to do nobody's going to tell me I can't cut my hair nobody's going to tell me that I can't wear makeup and I can't do this well you see that's what separates them from being a believer that believes in the cross to a daughter of God who wants to be disciplined by the word you see what I'm saying because they love the Lord Jesus and they want to be not only a believer in heaven and hell they want to be a disciple so they want their lives to be disciplined I hope that's what we've got here tonight that we want our lives to be disciplined by the word you follow me so far so whenever we hear the word preached and we see in our lives we're not quite matching up to that and just because we hear it say on Wednesday night doesn't mean that automatically it kicks in gear and starting right at the end of the service you automatically have it it may take you some time to be able to move up to that spot but by the grace of God you're going to do it because you are a disciple and when you hear the words you don't think that you're just sitting there listening to your pastor or brother Daryl or some other minister but you believe that God took that man's mouth and spoke through him to you and you took that personally as if it was the Lord Jesus himself now come on church now you know the prophet told us that that your pastor was God's angel that was sent to you y'all believe that so I wonder if we made an announcement now that come Sunday morning an angel of God will be speaking here behind the pulpit I wonder how many people if I didn't make it too clear now who that angel was they say Lord have mercy I wouldn't want to miss church if an angel's coming when your pastor is speaking to you that is an angel of God but yet people don't care to miss a little headache a little backache whatever why they simply don't believe what's been taught well come on now now what's the Lord Jesus as he speaks this to the disciples now remember they're not in this world yet but he's going to give them a little insight and they will recall it of course thank God Matthew wrote this down because he's the only one actually in the four gospels are quite rooted this way and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the Mysteries notice this word again that Jesus used it is muston Mysterion it is a hidden thing or a secret or a mystery or a religious secret confided only to to the initiated and not to ordinary Mortals now remember this is the founder of the church himself really we have no right to tell him how he ought to make his church he is the designer of his church and it is him that is telling us in the future ages how the church will be so then there will be a group that will be initiated to them will be given the mystery on there will be another group that will only come to hang around the initiated they will not be a partaker of mystery on they will come to church they might get saved they might partak in communion you have a fellowship dinner after church they'll be there you know you have a youth service Serv whatever they will come but the Lord Jesus is the only one that can actually initiate us into the mysteries of God oh I'm so glad I'm in ain't you now watch this is something then confided only to the initiated and not to ordinary Mortals oh my goodness you mean some of you all believe tonight sitting here that there are beings in this church that are more than ordinary morals am I'm one of them how many is one of them now listen as we go on the meaning of this word a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding so now the other part of that meaning actually separated categories of people the initiated and the non-initiated then the latter half of this meaning actually separates the part of you that has been initiated and the part of you that hasn't because there's an element of our human understanding that never has understood God and never ever will come on let's just say that that's exactly the truth there's things God says and things that God does I don't understand it you don't understand it and we probably never will as a mortal but we still believe him with all of our hearts and we trust him is that right I trust him this has been the secret of my life for many many decades that I trust him even when I don't understand what he is doing when he moves in a certain way and it seems to me that it's backwards that it does not make any sense I trust him even when I don't understand a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding a hidden purpose or counsel secret will the secret councils which govern God in dealing with the righteous which are hidden from ungodly and wicked men but plain to The Godly listen to this I thought this was awesome in the rinic writings which is the rabbis it denotes the Mystic uh oh here we go the Mystic or hidden sense now I know you may think brother Donnie this is far out out it really is way out but I I don't know if you know it yet but I hope the time I get done tonight it will help you to see that you already have a connection with the mystical of God you already have it you already have it you are identified with that Supernatural element many things of this last day message has already identified it watch's this and who is god let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it like a little white light huh little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo so there's no humans there's no Earth there's no universe but here is the mystical part of God what is it God giving birth to a son like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father what is it it's going to be the first visible manifestation of the invisible God and you don't remember it but actually you were there when he came out because in the beginning was the word that's what we just saw right there that was the beginning in the beginning was the word so what what is was it before the beginning it was the Eternal but the Eternal wanted to manifest himself so when every attribute every name that would ever be on the Lamb's Book of Life went out of God in the form of the son of himself notice that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word so God can never add anymore that was a complete volume of every word God would ever say and it went out of him in the form of logos so if you ever have eternal life you was in that logos when it went out of God that's why there ain't no Devils there ain't no sickness there ain't no besetting sin there ain't nothing that'll ever keep you away from that father God who loved you because you were there before you ever sinned you were there before you ever was born a mortal and started drinking and cussing and lying and running around remember all that sin that was not you in the first place that was not who you was you was identified there before you ever come to this Earth as a baby oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God that out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of god notice again in my commission he says I was baptizing in the Ohio river at the foot of Spring Street and I heard something speak and I felt something take a hold of me and I looked up and when I did coming down from Glory came this worldl coming down where I was at Courier Journal newspaper pack article of it and said a Mystic star appears over a local Baptist while baptizing in the river so here was the mystical part of God which was in him way back in the beginning now we see that mystical part showing up again when whenever our Prophet is baptizing the 17th person at the Ohio River what did the voice say as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming so don't you think it would be very fitting that the mystical would show up praise be to God I'd like to debate that brother Donnie I'd like to I ain't got no time for a bunch of these unbelievers well come on somebody oh my let them argue and fuss and debate and go on do whatever they want to do let us just move on closer to God and closer to God oh you know it's like the little old little old old squirrel that was out when brother Brandon was there shouting and worshiping God and he said it chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter days of Miracles has passed God don't do this no more that's all it is this is Chatter chatter chatter if they don't fear it why do they to spend so much of their time trying to defeat it but let me tell them no matter how much time what a waste of time it is to be able to try to disprove it and one day they're going to stand before God and God himself is going to let that Prophet step right out there and judge them come on Saints oh my so here comes a Mystic star so he said they couldn't make it out oh up to probably 10,000 people so I guess all 10,000 were deceived so all 10,000 people that was there actually didn't didn't see that it was just a figment of their imagination well praise the Lord you see why people that even set in message churches never connect with this message you've got to be born in the same world that the author who wrote it oh my oh probably 10,000 people saw it as it moved down where I was at and it went back up in the skies now watch this again in marriage and divorce now you remember the voice said go to Tucson remember the Mystic light in the sky the seventh Angels standing there come back and they opening of the Seven Seals watch what's taking place that is true rising of the sun and it went into the air and Life Magazine packed the picture Mystic something way in the Spheres where there could be no moisture where there could be no evaporation of anything 30 Mi High 27 Mi across coming right up from where those Ang Angels were oh but I would like to be there and I'd have to take my Polaroid and I'd have to have my iPhone I'd have to have this so are you going to do the same thing to make sure that Moses didn't write those Ten Commandments has anybody got a personal iPhone that you have a personal uh picture of God riding the 10 commandments what does anyone have a picture of Josh UA holding up his hand and stopping this movement which had been for maybe hundreds of thousands of years and the Bible says it was never such a day like it or since that God hearkened to the voice of a man that God called it he said Son stand still and moon hang now over the valley of aelon as we was there five or six years ago whenever our last trip was there and driving down the bus down through there and the guy gets on the microphone in the bus and said now right here is a very famous uh Bible stories I know you all believe the Bible and he said it was right in this General vicinity right here that Joshua had the Sun and the Moon to stand still well scientifically they said well that's totally impossible well it is for a scientific person but it's not for a Mystic it's not for a Mystic because we believe what we cannot understand we believe what we cannot even prove come on somebody what do you say we have church here tonight I cannot understand how God can call somebody whose body has went beyond acids and gases mind there's absolutely nothing left and yet he will speak and thousands times thousands will come forth in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and those of us that are alive our mortal bodies will be changed how is that possible that the spirit of God will move over me and my gray hair will go back to being Brown and my wrinkles will all vanish away Hallelujah and you will go back to being a young man or a young woman brother Donnie scientifically explaining I can't I can scripturally explain it I can messagely explain it but I'll never explain it to make an unbeliever believe it only the initiated can believe such a thing because I granted it seems to be an impossible event but our God Specializes in doing things that are totally impossible oh Hallelujah watch this Christ have been in his own word get used to the mystical you see these little pockets going through the air they call saucers so forth well we better leave that alone here all these people come up missing and you say they don't hear from them they're standing there and they're not there that's the way the Rapture is going to be now let me tell you what's ahead of you I have no idea what you're going to face tomorrow I have no idea what I will face tomorrow but there are some things that I can tell you about your future that are more certain than about anything else in this life by the word of God listen what's going to happen to you mystical people one of them will drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a Celestial body there'll be hide a hair or bones Left Behind it'll be trans transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space Glory dropping right out of space I've always been interested in space I used to watch the jeton whenever I was a kid some of y'all don't even know what that is do you some of you that laughed you watched it too ain't you uhhuh you give away your age yeah so there was something about him and that all get out there and fly around in space I've got a connection not with the Jetson but with space Oh Glory to God listen here what oh in a moment of time dropping out of space look at what it'll do taking home that we'll see all this going on now the Pentagon wondering about these lights and Mystic lights now you know in the last 10 to 15 years there was a law after the 60s and 70s but it's picked back up again Air Force pilots Delta Pilots different ones seeing it and they can't figure it out it can appear and disappear our f16s cannot keep up with them our f35s our F 22s cannot keep up with them so they follow them and they disappear what you reckon it is maybe trial runs on theophanies they call them UFOs I call them ifs identified flying theophanies now of course see this this is very strange right this is not the the church Naturals version of The Rapture no it's too mystical so the Pentagon wondering about these lights and Mystic lights and everything they're seeing in the sky you've seen the had one in the paper at Jeffersonville this week H that'd be a good place to show up isn't it get ready Johnson City Press get ready Elizabeth and star cuz we may be calling some down before long for a visit hallelujah oh I know you may not think you're worse nothing but heaven's got a great prize set on your soul oh my how Heaven values you and the paper in Jeffersonville this week and so forth a Mystic white so oh they don't know what that is but listen little children it's going to pick you up one of these days see see don't worry I don't mind telling you one thing I'm going to have to be changed if a light comes down and picks me up anybody here with me I'm going to have to be changed I'm not scared of heights I can get up in a ladder and I can work off of a boom and all that sort of thing but I did say a ladder or my feet on a boom but if something picks me up something picks me up in the middle of the air I mean here it comes right out of heaven and reaches right down and picks you up glory to God that sounds like that sounds like me amen it reaches down so he said don't worry don't worry amen hallelujah don't worry listen little children it's going to pick you up one of these days see see don't worry remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom friend there has never been a time like there is on the Earth right now with all this sexual perversion come on you might as well say Amen you know it's a truth it's unbelievable they don't realize they're fulfilling prophecy what if they fulfill it and don't know it what about us that want to serve him and want to please him don't you worry Little Children You are going to fulfill the word of your hour if they can fulfill the prophetic things that have been said about them and they don't even know it Ephesus prophesied and didn't even know what he was doing Joseph was giving up a type and a shadow of a coming Lord Jesus years and years after Joseph lived on the earth he didn't even know what he was doing what about us as the people of God that have a Bible and we have a prophet's message to be able to give us an Insight oh thank God we need to have confidence in the promise of the word of God we will not miss our Vision you imagine how brother bll must have felt that day when he looked and realized that he had on that green checkered shirt my sister bisc did not know she was getting ready to work toward prophecy brother bisc did not know when he fell in the water that day that was a word from God and yet the prophet knew it but he just kept it inside of his heart and he said the only thing troubles about me is he said there ain't nobody with a green checken shirt and he looks right there and brother bis go stands with that green checken shirt on they didn't get together and said now you do this and you do that and you do that now call call Sister you know so and and then sister B going to tell her to they no that's the way the Rapture will be you get up and fix breakfast you'll get up brothers and go to work some of you sisters will do this and that you children will go to school and the Lord will say today is your day in the vision oh praise be to God today is your day in the vision let me say this friends if K Cala whatever you want to call her if she was a woman God's Prophet saw in that Vision there ain't enough politics there ain't enough nothing to keep her out of there and she will walk right into it not even knowing about that prophecy but I'll tell you one thing as unbelievers they fulfill it what about us as Believers it's our heart it's our soul it's our desire to obey God and fulf his word is that not what you want it ain't no wonder Satan tries to assail us with so much trouble so much heartache so much difference in our life and so much difference in the church it's to beset your thinking away from the word of God Amen in this message perfect faith if you haven't listened to it in a bit Carol and I listen to it going to oh high and we listen to it coming back be a good one for you to listen to so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material bride material so whoever decided to make a handkerchief I don't mind telling you I am some kind of glad amen that they didn't use a piece of fabric that would say a grass sack or an a sheet of ASB bestus or something like uh ad0 grit sandpaper I'd be renewing my use ever service wouldn't I there is an appropriate material for the appropriate use now before long we had one yesterday when the mornings are going to start getting cool right and I'm a my metabolism is so high about burn up if I bat in my eyes I I tell Carol it's above 50 and I bat my eyes on the outside I go to sweating so I I I'm good right about 50\u00b0 on up when I go outside just with a t-shirt on if I'm moving around but now I come over to spray some weeds and stuff around the church and I wasn't moving very fast so it was a little bit chilly so I had on my t-shirt underneath but I had on a long sleeve shirt now that t-shirt is the appropriate attire for certain temperatures well the bride is the only type of material that is appropriate to make the groom a wife with now when you take foolish virgin material they can be worldly they can be rough on the edges they never let you straighten them out they never really come to a dedicated consecrated full complete surrender in the Lord so they got bumps and ins and outs and ups and downs and all this that and other and the Lord Jesus is wanting a mature bride who loves him more than anything else in this world she's in this world but she's not of it and she will use it yes she will use the world but she is constantly watching that she does not become marred by the world that she's using every day so he had to cut out to make this bride he had to have a specific type of material and it would be a Word Perfect material that would be a perfect reflection of the man she would marry so he did not take a big big old piece of rough Humane material and get that bride at it I'm talking about before you come to the Lord I'm talking about how he looks at you when you reach your completion now he looks at you by his own ability and he sees what you are in Christ Jesus which is not what you and I see at all we see old lump of clay an old pile of dust that we did so discouraged who you ever get discouraged with yourself and you think you ought to be farther along and y'all to be doing better and y'all to know this and y'all to know that oh my I tell you we can be pretty discouraging to ourselves can we not but he doesn't look at that what he looks at is the finished product of what the material will come into so he can take that material and cut it out oh he'll let it be chopped out by the prophets and then he'll send the finishing tools and the finishing tools will come in the form of pastors and teachers and evangelists and and missionaries and he'll start working on them and honing them down if you could have seen this Lumber that some of the brothers started here with it was just all rough Sawmill Lumber splinters all over it rough as it could be and yet to be able to see what it's been transformed into what if you can look by by the eyes side of face and realize that's what the Lord Jesus sees about our life now watch's this there now you're getting into bride material see see see you're getting into rapturing condition so he says the words rapturing strengths rapturing Faith rapturing power watch this one rapturing condition now that means listen to this each one of us not just the pastor deacons trustees that means for the Ley every individual walks in a world with God Alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shout of a doubt nowhere you walk right on now watch on down in that paragraph he says now you're coming into perfect face perfect Perfection that cannot fail that face never fails yes he wanted he was was a Mystic to them with his perfect Faith so is it now with those who have perfect face are a Mystic to others can't you see why there is an element of carnal Believers around this message for years they have looked for a supplement to the message that they felt like would bring them to a rapturing face that would bring them to a rapturing condition now remember it's all based upon supply and demand if there was no demand among the people for things that aren't always word based there would be no Supply that's and if there was a supply and there wasn't people that would follow it the supply line would automatically die of itself and it's amazing I mean a man can preach whatever and there will be somebody that'll believe him a man can go contrary to the scripture and contrary to the message of the hour and there will be an element I I Marvel at people I honestly do and the the things that preachers will stand and preach and people will leave churches you know oh my uh good word-based ministers it's been that way for years it happened in the days of Paul whenever Paul dealt with the Galatians and he said at one time you would have pulled out your eyes and given them to me and he said now have I become your enemy because I've told you the truth well why because the judaizers came from Jerusalem and they tried to convert the Galatians and they did some of them and they turned them a people who Paul led to the Lord Jesus and they with their cunning words of wisdom actually turned them people right against God's Prophet who come and brought the word to him in the first place don't you understand Satan has done the same thing on down through every Church age he's doing the same thing right now he will get people and many times are not even preachers they're businessmen or this and that and the other and they debate about this and all you can't prove that I couldn't find the article for this and that and the other well while you're spending your time looking for it we're enjoying the blessings of God over here now if you need an article go ahead and see if you can find it but while you're hunting for that I'm going to be hunting for more quotes that I can be able to preach people into a body change with I don't figure there's no newspaper article that I'm going to find that's going to enhance my face in God's promised word of this hour and the church said but you see for those who need that type of thing it's like they simply cannot trust they've got to be able to put their hands on they've got to be able to feel it oh I've got to have an eyewitness of was I've got to have an eyewitness now you're a lying hypocrite that's right I said you are a lying hypocrite because you're requiring something of this Prophet that you never required of naam that you never required of habac so you're going to wait till all of habac of's word come to pass before you believe he was a prophet because they all ain't come to pass yet there's prophecies that Isaiah made thousands of years ago that still have not come to pass so are we going to wait to see if they all come to pass before we believe he was a prophet you're backwards God lets prophecies come to pass in your day and that gives you Faith to believe and wait on the others that will come to pass maybe even after you've left the Earth well come on some of Isaiah's prophecies will not be fulfilled to the Millennium some of his prophecies and Isaiah 66 will not be fulfilled until the eth day Ezekiel 44-48 will not be fulfilled until the Millennium Temple is built in the Millennium now you going to wait till that's fulfilled before you see if Ezekiel was a prophet oh come on wake up but a real son or daughter of God they just have it they read the same books they listen to the same types it's evident people can set under the same Pastor go to the same church have the same Association and have the same fellowship and one it will be revealed to and the other one it will pass right over and they argue and they debate about it well Benny hen said this you know and Charles swend said that and so and so said this and so and so if you want to read Benny hen go right ahead maybe he's a hen for you hen but if you're an eagle I don't figure that Benny hen has got a whole lot to tell me Well Benny hen talked about William brandham so if you're going to listen to something Benny hen said go to what that hen said about an eagle but I got news for you there ain't no chicken going to be able to give me a diet where it's going to produce a Rapture in my soul I need to hear message Pastor I need to hear message evangelist I need to hear message teacher I need to hear the message prophet of God in order to build a faith in me to get me ready to meet my loved ones woo now now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that faith never fails yes he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa now this is 1963 so brother Brandon was saying that there was some people on the Earth even then that already had perfect Faith come on Saints they have perfect faith when was this preached August the 25th 1963 August the 25th 1963 so what about August of 2024 don't you see those elect were living right up as far as they could go now remember the rising of the sun hadn't been preaching Easter cell hadn't been preached yet Harvest Time hadn't been preached yet turn on the light hadn't been preached many sermons had not yet been preached by August the 25th 1963 and yet there was an element of people there that had already attained to perfect Faith which is what mature Faith so you ask God for something sometimes sometimes God says yes sometimes God says no sometimes God says wait a while and you still believe it amen how many's had it happen to you you still trust him oh you might get disappointed now anybody ever get disappointed when God says no anybody ever get disappointed whenever God says wait I sure that's the human element of us but our disappointment does not override the spiritual mystical part in our soul what is that friended that's born by the Breath of God Wow Let's stand praise be to God Amen I want you to listen to how this leads up and jariah a secret believer notice this date 1955 my how great it is to know that the anointing of the holy spirit that will take the church and the Rapture someday is present already there in 1955 and the seals hadn't been opened so an anointing was already here watch this I love this part end time evangelism the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture can't you see why Satan is going to do everything he can to pull you away from this message that's why all these scoffers in the last days had to raise to get you to question the validity of this message cuz if you listen to it with the question well I'm not sure and trusted I'm not sure and trusted I'm not sure and trusted I'm not sure and trusted that's what it's all for to get you to question the validity and the authenticity of this prophet and his message you see that's what Satan done in the book of numbers to the people of Israel amen you remember the story of course Joshua and Caleb go 10 other spies come back and they come back with an evil report of God no of the land right they didn't say God's mean God's awful I tell what that God I'll tell you boy he's a man alive that God he is sorry he ain't no good it wouldn't saying nothing about God they were saying it about their supposed inheritance oh it's a big land oh it's up the inhabitants of the land thereof there ain't no way we can ever do it but K said wait a minute what are you talking about it's laying right before us it's ours let's go take it and where did that report come from well according to what Caleb said about it I preached it brother Paul Sunday night it come from among his Brethren you understand it ain't the Catholics it ain't the Baptists it ain't the method Methodist people rather that has tried to do so much damage to this message it's former message people our brethren Mama the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints Oh my bring them back to the face of the fathers the Pentecostal part right how many wants the Pentecostal part the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore sayith the Lord that's the real event or end time evangelism end time evangelism is getting the bride ready or we're going to pray for sick that ain't bride sure well we're going to preach the foolish virgins if I foodish vir I'm going to do it if I can help a Baptist my goodness they may never Embrace this message I'll do whatever I can for everybody amen I'm going to say a kind word I'm going to pray for him I'll do whatever I can do that woman I told you about in Sams not long ago that woman had on pants a woman had cut hair I didn't say said look S I can't pray for you my faith will not allow it but I felt the spirit of God St me right there in Sams I figured I better obey him I told you was going to call an ambulance or get her a wheelchair whatever to C her out of there me and Carol went through the store getting the rest of the stuff we need and Carol said look at there we looked up between the aisles they wasn't that woman wasn't in a wheelchair and she wasn't a no C but she was walking out pushing that buggy out why the Lord God come down in Sam's amen hallelujah praise the Lord let your light so shine before men come on children let's let the Lord Jesus manifest himself don't you love him with all your hearts oh my let's let's bow our heads together if you would my my Lord Jesus Lord I pray tonight father help us if we have to go back and listen to it again or again God I pray you'd make it real to us father we're not trying to make ourselves unusual and peculiar and odd we will be odd enough when the new birth transforms us we will be a very unique and very strange people those of our families that aren't converted will not understand us I know Lord by some of my own family that think I'm too religious and I'm probably a religious crank and I'm a religious fanatic but I'd rather be a religious fanatic than a football or a baseball or a basketball or a denominational fanatic everybody's going to be addicted to something so I'm going to be addicted to Jesus help us Lord I don't want to try to make myself different and make myself odd Lord but I just believe that if we live with you in our hearts as the type of HST in the center of gravity everything we do we pray about we pray about where we live we pray about business ventures we pray about where we go to school we pray about friends that we have we pray about the company that we keep I'm convinced you would keep us from a lot of hurts and things in life if we would pray about them I'd rather have two or three good friends than 500 497 of them's going to break my heart lie on you or whatever you might have spared me of a lot of them I pray Lord that you would help us Lord Jesus May the elect of the Word of Life Church pull their eyes from mother father brother sister College High School careers or they'll do that on the side that's just side stuff but their main focus is Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not really strange that would be be odd and unusual to the world and odd and unusual to denominational people but what's really bizarre Lord yeah is whenever we're odd and unusual to folks who say they believe this message cuz we live and walk in a world that only the initiated understand Lord God as I sat Carol and I in a room the other day ministering to someone hundreds and hundreds of miles away from here sitting there just praying under my breast and waiting on you we sat there for a couple of hours just talking Carol was sitting there with me praying I'm sure and all of a sudden your presence hit me as I looked up it was like I could see it in the lights and I knew it was time so I Rose from my seat and went over prayed for the individual and your presence come down oh Jesus I know if we follow you we'll be laughed at ridicule made fun of Jesus I love you and I want to put you first help me father and how many young men young women maybe older ones as well you want to be what God has made you to be and remember keep in mind I'm not talking about you making yourself odd I'm just talking about you surrendering to the Lord Jesus and he uses you for whatever he's called you to do and remember he will never lead you contrary to his word he will never lead you contrary to do anything contrary to his scripture or what the teaching of his Prophet has told us and when you feel led to do something and either you find it yourself or it's sent to you by other people and they show you that what you feel led to do is contrary to scripture and the message of the hour leave that thing as fast as you can because you'll be given a period of Grace and if you override it you'll move out of the perfect will of God into the permissive will of God then you open yourself up to all kinds of demons oh Jesus Keep Me Lord Keep Me Jesus Keep Me true Lord help me Father Lord I know even in the realm of gifts your Prophet told us Satan can hand out them gifts them Supernatural gifts by the handfuls oh God how many have we seen down through the years that felt like they had a gift of God and watch what it leads to the people that it leads astray and even people say they believe the message and speaking in tongues and prophesying and telling people to leave their wives or their husbands and go be married to somebody else in the the church and saying thus sayeth the Lord dear God no Lord I will speak I think I can on behalf of this church we do not want any of them kind of gifts we want gifts that tell the truth that's contrary to your word oh Jesus we worship you tonight father Hallelujah thank you Lord can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh Jesus We Worship You Lord great awesome Mighty God may your mystical power come down among us tonight father heal those that are sick Lord several in our church are going through really difficult times father Lord you know the same with sister Tres we're believing you Lord God for your Mighty hand to move Upon Our sister's body Lord and I don't just pray for her I pray for her children I pray for brother Randy Lord I know that as a human he can't keep from being concerned and troubled Lord naturally about such a thing that doctors would say but father May that mystical part of us kick in Lord I pray for Brother Steve Nome tonight as well Lord you see surgery and Lord waiting on a pathology report you don't know what that report's going to say but even if it says something bad we already know another report and we choose to believe the report of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus as I sat and talked with him and his wife yesterday and heard their confession of Faith there in the hospital Lord and we had prayer you moved in a little little while and it text me later to let me know a couple of different things that they praying about and you moved by your great presence our brother able to go home today by the grace of God lord you see people who live in that realm and as I was listening to this perfect Faith sermon I stopped the tape and I I copied and paste it and sent it to Carol and told her to send it back to me so I could send it to Brother Steve sister tresa if you haven't read it brother Bram says it's something like this faith in your heart you believe God's word you're a Mystic and all that sort of thing the doctor could tell you you're going to die your respiration is gone your heart your blood pressure all that he mentioned several things and it'd say there's no hope for you you could life in that doctor's face face rather and he said you could be like Elijah as he was talking to them false prophets and so why don't you scream a little louder maybe he's gone on a hunting trip or a fishing trip you could life in the doctor's face because it has been revealed to you oh praise the Lord Jesus now friends if you're not there tonight don't be discouraged cuz we have a word from the Lord through this prophet and his message of the hour that there is a church in the making that is going to rise to this place Hallelujah just as the foolish virgin will rise to theirs as the Antichrist will rise to his you and I will rise to ours they're doing it without a surrendered will to God how much more can God do with us if we will surrender our all to him tonight they're doing it not even with the intention they don't even believe in God many of them they don't love him they're not doing it to fulfill his purpose God has put it in their hearts the Bible said to fulfill his will they don't even want to do it but he's put it inside their heart it's a power that overpowers them well if the spirit of Prophecy is that powerful to move on people that are agnostics and infidels and the spirit of Prophecy would drive them to obey God's word what about the spirit of love that moves upon bride material and that bride is crying day and light Lord Jesus I love you Lord I want to please you Lord forgive me Lord I I'm not where I want to be that's your petition that's your cry and you think you're not going to fulfill God's word hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus oh we worship you tonight father Lord move for the needs of your people Lord many that are sick and couldn't be here tonight in this service We join our faith together for him Lord as priests we come for you tonight on their behalf Lord we believe we will see Miracles we will see Miracles we will see the phenomenal power of God we will see what seemed like impossible because we are believers in your promis word lord and there ain't enough devils in hell to stop us from fulfilling our prophecy maybe there's a daughter of God tonight that's got on a green chcken shirt maybe there's a mama here tonight that's been asking God for healing asking God for salvation for her son or her daughter but she's veiled tonight in a green checkered shirt of Prophecy she's arriving right this very night for God to fulfill that promised word oh make it real to us Lord Jesus make it real to us Lord God I give my strength I give my energy I give my body I give my mind I give my spirit Lord God I ain't got much but whatever I've got I give to you Lord use it for your glory father how many will pray that prayer with me not right now do you mean it with all all your

hallelujah oh Jesus take us Lord take us Lord Jesus use our youth like never before Lord use our ministers like never before Use Me Lord God I pray like never before help us father that we can bring the anointed word to your people it's no wonder to me that we've even got message preachers that don't want to preach the message no more and they don't want to read no more and I'm thinking what are they thinking what are they thinking that they do not want to preach the message from their pulpits apparently they put more value on their own words than they do the value of God's Prophet but Lord Jesus as long as you give me strength and wisdom help me father to be able to preach the message of the hour I'm not called to read I'm called to preach I'm not called to P play I am called to preach the gospel and your Prophet said the highest form of the Gospel being brought is by the preaching of the word I have brought the highest form tonight that there is in the land lord and that is preaching of the word of God we receive it Lord Jesus as if you here were standing before us I receive it myself Lord as if it was you that walked out of that office with that iPad as if it was you that read those scriptures and that quotes I believe father your presence is that real I believe your presence and your anointing in this prophetic hour that we are living is so upon the Earth to anoint your bride material that we can say hallelujah that you are not just coming but you are here here you are here your presence is here to heal your presence is here to save your presence is here

Lord face to face cuz my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true everything he has said he will [Applause] do every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true and in every situation Lord you have proved your love for me when I lack the understanding you give more grace to me my redeemer is faithful and true everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you Lord Jesus how many can say Amen to that amen he is so faithful thank you Lord I wish I could say that about me I wish I could say it about you all too but the truth of it is we've not always been faithful have we we've not always been true true to our god true to his his word sometimes even faithful and true to one another I'm just so glad he's so forgiving when may fall short of his glory you may be here today and you may feel like a total complete failure in whatever you're called to be whether it's a husband or a father or a preacher or a businessman whatever you do but I'm glad that we're serving a God today that is a god of new beginnings and every morning his mercies are renewed thank god let's turn together to Mark chap 15:39 if you would I want to speak to you again today on the right to a Ministry each Christian here today has a call a multi aspect multifaceted call it may change and evolve over the years from when your life is dedicated to the Lord ultimately we want to be able to serve his purpose only those who serve God's purpose have a resurrection to life so people may wonder what is our part in the economy of God is our purpose in the economy of God that important it is you see if we don't serve him well in this life and fulfill that purpose there will be no Resurrection for us none I'm talking about onean to life not un judgment so it's so serious today and so important so let's approach it with that in mind if you would and when the Centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost He said truly this man was the son of God there were also women looking on a far off among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the Le and Joseph and salomi who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered unto him so women were ministering unto the Lord Jesus and we know that they were not as we've said taking the scriptures and telling Jesus to sat down they going to preach him a sermon but they were ministering to him things that he had need of remember Jesus called his disciples and they all quit their jobs Jesus was a carpenter for him many every years he quit put his job so how they going to pay for this work remember there's quite a following around them who bought all the food who paid for the lodging who paid for the trips to be able to go here and there and people saying well I don't never preach I could never do anything you realize whenever you will contribute your tithes and offerings and then I will delegate that and help pay for a brother trip here and a trip there and a trip there and somewhere else and there Souls that are being saved people's lives who are changed do you understand you will stand there that day and the Lord will reward you along with that preacher because youve done your part so every one of us have an important thing to do Philippians chapter 2:5 I love the way Paul was that he he was not the type of preacher that was so caught up in his own Ministry and complimenting his own self and talking about all the great things that God did through him and not acknowledging what God had did through others which were less than him he mentioned so many uh people in the gospels here he's going to speak about apodius yet I suppose it necessary to send unto you apodius my brother and companion in labor and fell a soldier but your messenger now look at the categories that this brother apodius served so to Paul he was a brother and a companion in labor but to others he was a messenger look at the aspects that this brother served now he wasn't a church age messenger he wasn't a prophet wasn't a major or Sage or a prophet but yet he ministered to Paul he was a companion in labor you know sometimes a secondary position like that is so hard for some preachers to ever take it's like they feel like they have to have their own aspect of this and that and the other and yet God had this brother's name mentioned for such a position your messenger he that ministered to my wants and the word there is need or necessity or lack I may like to be remembered today as we pray and me just wants the Lord to open your hearts to the word and to be able to speak to us Lord Jesus we thank you so much for what you mean to us thank you for another day that we can be able to come to the house of God on Sunday morning Lord God we ask that that you'd be mindful of us our needs are many Lord God we pray in the name of Jesus that you'd also be mindful of your nation Israel you see father that uh Hezbollah attacking them and them making a move a preemptive strike upon them and Lord you see the way this is going to go we pray Lord Jesus that you would just help them we know every Jew is not one of yours the same way every Christian is not bride but we pray father you'd watch over them we know it's in the charter of Hezbollah poo Hamas many many of the Arabs of their countries to absolutely annihilate and Destroy Israel they will not be happy so they say until every one of them are dead but they might as well say they're going to cause the Moon Not To Shine Anymore or the sun cuz you have said you will have a seed of Israel and then then how much more father can we look at our position as the Gentile bride and say neither will you forget us you're mindful of us pray that you'd help us today may we be able to look into your word and find our position and give us more faith to be able to act on what we're called to do granted father we pray in the name of Jesus amen God bless you Saints you may be seated what a great thing to be a child of God to be able to find our position in Christ Jesus as I hear the prophet said in things that ought to be 12765 in cavina California oh it means so much nowadays Church to see ourselves positionally placed in Christ Jesus not only naturally but of course spiritually but it's not only spiritually but also naturally and it's amazing how they coincide together I'd like to sometime if the Lord would ever let me do it I've done a study for several years and taken each Church in the New Testament the Church of Ephesus the church at colassi the church at thessalonica the church at leoda all the different churches that are mentioned in the New Testament by which letters have been sent to them it's quite quite a an enlightening thing because you see no matter where they lived and what they were dealing with each church had its good points and each church had its points that they needed to be corrected and that was of course because of the area that they live the spirits they were fighting in that area I may have to preach against things here or I may not have to preach against certain things that say brother Tim PR will have to deal with over and over again I may have to deal with things he may never have to mention or other brothers around the world and it's not you know people compare well brother Donnie's preaching this brother Tim saying that brother so and so is saying that but we have to be mindful that if there are things that are being said it's because there's a need for it like the church at Corinth very carnal Church very carnal yet they absolutely loved spiritual gifts and at the same time their church had more issues and more troubles with spiritual gifts than any other Church in the New Testament but if that go Paul had not written it down led by the spirit of God to write it down and deal with their problems how many examples would we have in the entire New Testament of how gifts ought to be operated so God took the trouble in the Corinthian Church and allowed his servant to take that trouble and be able to lay out the word in order to show not only that church but the future generations of people how they should should be done you understand well the church at Ephesus now they were a spiritual church too and they had gifts Prophet said they did they had gifts and they had manifestations of God but you never find Paul having to write to the church at Ephesus and said now don't get up and talk in tongues if there's no interpreter there you never you never find him writing about that because their problems were not like that you never find Paul ever having to address like it did the Corinthian Church of a man that was actually living with his stepmother and they were coming inside the church living that kind of life in sin and the church was just basically letting it go nothing was being said about it so Paul had to deal with that and yet you look at the church at colossia they were a total different Church very revelated church church of great understanding Church of thes the same way but when you go to look at each one of them they were missing certain parts now if we would take the Word of Life church and we would compare it to say evening light Tabernacle in Minden Louisiana Full Gospel uh Lighthouse church up in Virginia or we would take and compare it to this church in India this one in Africa and that one there and we say oh my well them folks have got some real problem problems y now you're living in the real world every Church you go to has problems and I hate to be the bear of bad news but if you're looking for a perfect one let me just tell you right now you might as well look for a needle and a haystack cuz you ain't going to find one and if you did when you got there you'd ruin the whole thing so just accept it for what it is every church has issues every church has problems every church has great traits of the word of God I'm talk about those that are following the word of the hour now and then every church is going to have issues and problems that need to be dealt with by the word and the church said amen now whenever we look at position then I find it amazing that this great revelated church in Ephesus that had such understanding about election they were so able to perceive about the unity of the bride and the groom in the spiritual as aspect in Ephesians 5 that Paul really didn't have to go into a lot of depth and understanding and explained to them what God had done to the Gentile bride remember the church at Ephesus was mainly Gentiles as the church at coloss also the Church of Corinth and also the Church of thessalonica the Lord never spoke to Paul as far as we know and told him that he had a bunch of people at Ephesus we have no record that the Lord ever told him that in coloss or or thessalonica but the Lord knew the church at Corinth was going to be a Troublesome church so the Lord spoke to Paul early on in the in the early stages of the work at Corinth and he told him this I have much people in this city much people no doubt he fell back on that over and over and over again he must have got so discouraged with that church he felt like he was wasting his time he would preach on Holiness and they would have all types of sin he would preach on love and and and they was more emphasizing on speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever more they thought that was the spiritual aspect and Paul had to go down the Avenue of 1 Corinthians 13 and teach them without love their gifts were absolutely Vain and of no value but think of it if he had not dealt with that would we have ever known what we know about charity show me in any other books of the New Testament where any of the authors pin such great Revelation about what charity the love of God really is so if we look at it in the right way even in our shortcomings and our failures and when Servants of God whether it's a pastor or others are LED of the spirit of God to deal with shortcomings in our assembly and our lives if we look look at it the right way will know that God is Not only using that for us for our families for our lives for our church but more than likely there'll be other people that'll be able to hear it and say you know what I needed that too praise the Lord so God knew exactly how to put these people together and no doubt the people in that day you'd go to to the church at Corinth now remember Corinth was a port city so there's a lot of Greeks and a lot of Phoenicians and a lot of different ones because it was a major port city so it be similar to Los Angeles or something like that so there were ships that was coming from Ty and siden there would have been Ships coming from Europe there would have been ships that would have been coming from all different types of places and they would have had you know it's based upon supply and demand so they would have been having everything imaginable in that City the sex trade was unbelievable the drinking and all the things that was there it was a horrible horrible place but yet God said I've got a lot of people here I'm going to start a church I guess he can start one wherever he wants to can't he and what did he do that church was able to be able to rescue the seed of God but they come with baggage like you and I did when we come to the Lord so they love the Lord they wanted to do something for God and boy somehow they tapped into them gifts and there must have been a bunch of people that went there and they just was able to grab a hold to tongues and interpretation and prophecy and they made the offest mess out of it that ever was and they begin to make the main emphasis of every service speaking in tongues and spiritual this and spiritual that no doubt they would compare thems to the church at Ephesus and the church at Colossians said well I'll tell you one thing they may they understand predestination but they sure ain't as spiritual as we are I'm telling you what we have meetings in our church and we're so caught up in the spirit of God the preacher can't even preach boy I'm telling you we had a time man alive we is doing walls of Jericho and marching around this and jumping and leaping over the tops of the pews and we was doing this and that and other Paul said what did the word of God come out from you and out from you only let any man acknowledge if he thinks himself to be a spiritual that what I say are the words of the Lord now you imagine when he went to correcting the Corinthian people on their gifts and some of the sisters now remember some of these women they were formerly goddesses goddesses they were worshiped in the Greek culture now part of their religion was they would have sex acts in their religion so when they would worship these Idols they would have these things so some of the sisters that were in the Corinthian Church now born again they were former prostitutes and they gave themselves at the house of Diana or the house of some of these other gods and goddesses so then when they get saved you know they've got this thing about them they want to they want to give their all to the Lord now they're ashamed of their backline they're so was shame so they come to the Corinthian Church and boy I mean it's a gungho Pentecostal one my I imagine their music was just loud and Fast and they had tambourines and they had all kinds of little oh boy and it was it was really a drawing card to a lot of them boy some of them former prostitutes come in there for some of them former Idol worshippers and boy they love that worship they love that singing and my my they' set their somebody jump up and start speaking in tongues and then think what in the world I ain't never seen nothing like this in my life and there was something about it that Satan knows exactly how to when he sees the Dynamics of a church being molded and made by the personalities of the type of people that it draws and Satan can see the direction that God is going to move with that church and then he will start setting up his war of how to attack that church now if he can't keep them from being spiritual so-called all he's got to do is just push them over the edge a we bit toward fanaticism now I grant you myself I would rather have a little bit of wildfire than no fire at all come on now you go to preaching against the real emotion of God it don't take but about that much preaching against it and you'll silence the whole church and people think well we don't want no Wildfire around here I understand that a lot of message folks don't want no Wildfire so they put out every Fire coming and going because they don't know what Wildfire is and what true fire is so they just come to church sit there like a bump on a pickle and they sleep halfway through church some of them fix the tractor some of them fix their lawn more some of them's fixing lasagna they're making a chocolate cake and they're going to kabas after church we ought not to be baking no cake when we're in the house of God leave you lawnmower tore up leave you tractor tore up come on somebody we're here to have church today and if the Lord pours out his anointing and we go to acting like a bunch of Corinthians well I say send it on Lord Jesus if the Lord wants us to make more act like at the Ephesian Church whatever I don't know how you feel about it this service ain't mine no way and it ain't yours it don't Belong To You Well I want it to go this way when you become God then you can tell us how the service needs to go but until you do we want to follow the leading of the Holy Ghost amen now when you look at the issues in the New Testament churches that was just a preview of the last 15 years but I've been studying on this subject but when you go to looking at it and them finding their position and wanting to be what God made them to be there's always going to be similarities and you're going to find people that you honor they're your mentors and you want to be them you see that was a danger that me having a a background formerly in Pentecost and the prophet said that we take on one another's spirit so you this person you'll make them your mentor and they're they're really emotional or estatic or maybe they're the astute type and they don't move and they don't worship and they come to the house of God and depending on your makeup you will lean to toward one or the other instead of being what God wants you to be now God may not actually let you be what you want to be more than likely won't he'll more than likely cause you to be something that you're not actually you know preferably that you want to be now that does not mean that God not does not use us in the way that he's made us now this was the Insight that the prophet gave us and we'll get to it hopefully here today but whenever the Ephesian Church the great church of Ephesus now whenever you compare how many verses and chapters is in the book of Ephesians very few they did not get the second book of Ephesians third book of Ephesians as a matter of fact they only got one book and it only had a few chapters now that's quite an outstanding thing about the spirituality of that church same with the church at colassi yet when you look at the book of Corinthians you got First Corinthians many many chapters and verses and then you've got second Corinthians which is written about 5 years later and Paul was able to shorten the amount of chapters because they had finally become more stable the man that was living with his stepmother got straightened out and Paul said that he did not want to whip him you know and some people they look at and say oh my we can't say nothing against this because it might hurt somebody's feelings but you also got to realize if you don't say something about it the devil's looking for an entryway into the church so it takes the spirit of God to lead men of God to know when they've said enough and to keep their mouth shut when they don't need to say anything and the church said so you imagine what a responsibility then down Through the Ages since the New Testament that pastors and ministers have really had to be able to do now I I find this so overwhelming that whenever Paul ter with me if you would Ephesians 5:22 that Paul writing to this great deep revelated church at Ephesus and they understood predestination they understood election no doubt they understood the Redemptive power of the blood of the Lord Jesus just great things because Paul doesn't have to deal with it at all so we can assume by that not not being preached that they had a really good understanding but notice what they lacked Ephesians 5:22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord so you mean a revelated daughter of God that can understand predestination and election and maybe the marriage of the lamb and so many wonderful things but yet she can struggle with her position to her husband now remember what the New Testament done it liberated a lot of the women on under the law and brought the women from a place of basically a piece of property to where she is also filled with the Holy Ghost just like the men are and that God could actually speak in tongues to her and prophesy through her which is unheard of basically in the Old Testament except for prophetesses so it's only a Selected Few that God did that there but it elevated the women in the New Testament to where that they were Daughters of God now if you go to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem you'll still find of course they have a a great curtain I was stood there several years ago and the men will be on the left left hand side facing the Wailing Wall and the women will be on the right hand side they still separate to this day some of the churches in Africa still do the same thing but we know that God brought men and women both into one baptism of the spirit of God and that's why Paul would say that in Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female but that does not change the gender that God would allow women to preach so you think of this great deep church at Ephesus and yet he had to write to them this simple something You' think any daughter of God would know wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord so wives submit now not be a slave not be a slave but submit to your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife well shouldn't any woman with the Holy Ghost know this well apparently there was a need in Ephesus for this to be brought back to their understanding say they' remembered it maybe they forgot it maybe they got away from it we don't know even as Christ is the head of the church now being a prophet he's going to bring it in parabolic form and in symbol form to help the sisters to see and no doubt they did as it has helped us through the ages to be able to see as Christ is subject to his church or rather the church subject to him and there's things that Christ says for us to do that we don't understand it we just flat don't understand it but we don't have to do it when we understand it we do it when he makes it known and then sometimes later he tells us why sometimes he don't but we just do it because he is our head now notice for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body now you imagine the daughters of God now in the city of Ephesus another great City uh many Gentiles and whenever they saw this and it was received to them of course in Greek and it been translated to us in the English says a little bit different the Greek to the transliteration but it's still very close but whenever they got this and the daughters of God s there they thought that is so beautiful that's wonderful so the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body so the daughters of God that were may be having a hard time with the headship of their husband could realize so my husband a true Son of God if I am married to a true Son of God then it's not like that he's is going to be my boss and I and I'm I'm a slave under him but God's actually put him there to help me through life to help me through decisions that I'm going to make in life therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and whatever things that they agree with their husbands in and then all those things and the wives can say Amen oh I'm sorry I'm I'm quoting from the word of life version aren't I oh my so let the wives be to their own husbands say it with me sisters a brother say kind of weak can y'all help me out Brothers say it with me in ain't that amazing how much louder them men were some of your brothers have been wanting to say that for years ain't you now sisters you read these next four words with me husbands even as Christ loved the church now you think men may have a great advantage over the women being that they're the head of the home and the wives are to be subject to them but I want you to listen to this next verse how the husbands are supposed to love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it now listen what kind of a husband then that a man that believes this word ought to be that he ought to love his wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it so how did Christ do what did he do when we was unworthy we were undeserving now why in the world would a deep Church which understood Redemption and mercy and predestination and election why in the world would they need to hear this maybe it was their former life maybe it was coming out from Judaism there was a mixture of Jews there coming out from Judaism and remember by the time the Lord Jesus come on the earth there was two great teachers that had come along uh uh teaching marriage and divorce and all of that and most of the disciples were actually Pharisees so when Jesus began to preach on marriage and divorce and the disciples heard this and Jesus said whosoever putteth away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and then in Mark Mark pins it and said whosoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery and when the disciples heard this they said it's good for a man not to even get married if that's the case you ever wonder why they said that because the upbringing that they had been under Judaism for years and years let me tell you how they were under the SK the schooling of some of these rabbis they taught that if the wife raised her voice to the Mother-in-law or the father-in-law or burnt the bread her husband had a right to put her away and marry another Carol honey ain't you glad that law don't in God's word I was eating Cajun blackened before it was popular some of your brothers don't have to move just just sit there and just nod your head I know you understand but now look when Jesus comes he changes that totally he said that was not what Moses said God gave you that writing of divorce but because of the hardness of your hearts it was never God's will so the disciples said well if that's the way it is a man's better off not to even get married so can you imagine how that their thinking of their wives is going to be changed so you're a Jew and you come to Christian ity and then your wife gets the Holy Ghost just like you right you are supposed to love your wife the way Christ Jesus loves the church are you kidding me when basically their wives were no more than a donkey or a horse or a sheep or a cow so if you got tired of the cow what would you do You' take her to the market and seller her so you get rid of her well the woman had no say as far as property the woman had no say as far as in the home you imagine how that some of those Jewish converts must have just shuddered whenever Paul wrote it in the New Testament that the woman was to guide the house guide yes sir now you see we're Gentiles and we're living under 2,000 years of this but there was Jews there and they must have read this and said what is wrong wrong with this man ain't no woman got in my house I'm the boss here I do this I'm afraid we still got some Jews in the message well Hallelujah you see if a man really loves his wife as Christ loved the church then if he's married to a daughter of God she will not struggle to be able to be submissive to that type of a man because even whenever he will say no honey you know I I don't think we need to do this or do that she knows he's not doing it from a self-centered selfish motive but he's actually looking at the betterment of the home the betterment of the unity of the family of what God wants and that's the way we love the Lord Jesus is it not we've all prayed prayers and the Lord Jesus didn't answer the maybe the way we we thought he should or maybe he didn't answer it in the time frame that we thought he should but if we trust him we believe him and we trust him even when we don't understanding oh there's so many things he's done in my life that I have not understood it and I may never understand it but I trust his headship better than my own reasoning because my reasoning sometimes is lying to me and so is yours but you imagine now that these ISS issues were there in this deep deep church now husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself forth so this is our example brothers that we love our wives as Christ loved the church and we would be willing to give ourselves for our wives oh brother Donnie I would do that I'll tell you one thing if anybody walked in the church this morning with a gun and said I'm going to kill somebody and they're pointing to you and your wife I give my life for yeah that's that's a great heroic trait I'm not talking about you men doing this as Heroes I'm talking about you doing it every day at home that's right when nobody knows anything about it that's when it gets a little bit harder ain't it amen's not required they are appreciated though watch again now in Ephesians chapter 6 verse4 and ye fathers provoke not your children to rest so here was some of these deep fathers in The Message Church of Ephesus man what understanding of election what understanding of the great mercy of God but some of them men still did not know how apparently to be able to correct their children so in doing it they were making them mad and actually the fathers the head of the home home were provoking their children to anger wow and you fathers provoke not your children to WRA bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord you mean to tell me there was some people there that wasn't even doing that right oh my now we all remember the great man Moses what a great prophet of God he was and yet Moses got so caught up that's right in his position that he forgot to circumcise his own son wow so you mean we can worry about the lost and worry about doing Mission work and worry about doing this and that and other for the kingdom of God and forget our own children our own nephews our own nieces our own homes and the church said let's look also at the church of colossia 3:18 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord I love the way he wrote this as it is fit or appropriate so if your husband is not a real word believer and ask you to do things that are contrary to the word you're not subject to that you obey them as it is fit in the lord well my husband's not a Believer and he wants me to wear this and that and the other he wants me to cut my hair he wants me to put makeup that's not fit for a daughter of god notice husbands love your wives and be not bitter wow be not bitter against them now we will not ask for the showing of hands on any of these verses I will be a merciful and faithful pastor this morning no commitments being made believe me the smiles and the frowns are already enough so again what a deep revelated Church th this is the church in chapter one oh my verse 15 we're expresses the great mystery of God in the godhead where the prophet's textt from in chist Myster of God reveal chapter 2 verse 9 when he goes to bringing in all the great deep things of God chapter 3 verse 15 and yet having to be corrected now this is not just a passing something but aren't you glad that God allowed this prophet of God to write such things you know why you won't find these exact words nowhere else in the New Testament it all depends on how we look at correction you know we can take Corrections oh my oh that was so hard that was so difficult but out of Correction God can do so many wonderful things how many wives have come to their place in Christ Jesus by reading these passages of scripture for the last 2,000 years how many husbands had had dealt with bitterness now Paul does not go into the detail of what was causing the men in that day and I find it amazing that he didn't turn it right around and tell the wives not to be bitter against their husbands itn't this strange that in certain cultures and in certain regions even that there will be things that will need to be dealt with but don't need to be dealt with everywhere else husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord father Here We Go Again fathers now brother D what are you talking about I thought you was talking about a Ministry I am I'm talking about your ministry at home you see being a husband is a Ministry being a father is a Ministry being a wife is a Ministry being even a child under the headship of your father you are learning your ministry or you say I can't wait till I get out and get married I'll do this and other well I'll tell you what you could be a whole lot better daddy if you've got a Godly one and you watch how he does he'll be able to spare you so much stuff I've watched preachers ever since I got in church and ever since I got saved especially after I become one and I watch preachers and and watch decisions that they make and watch how they handle scenarios bad ones good ones and different ones and all that and those are in the middle too so you can be able to learn I can learn by reading the word yes I can learn by listening to tapes and I do that but I've also learned it by watching Men especially men in position and Leadership that it might help me in my life and my own position and God knows that so this is why that he wants us to have Godly fathers Godly mothers and that our little children they learn the way other nature does so wonder how all the antelope on the plains of East Africa in the Serengeti where I've stood there a couple of times and look at tens of thousands times thousands of bbba of Impala of dier of all kinds of all these things and yet all those Acres that I've drove across years and years ago and go up in a hot air balloon and fly for several miles over the top of the elephants and the zebra and the giraffe and all that and I never saw one zebra school and I never saw one elephant School school now I saw the villages in the Messiah Mara and I saw the Messiah people there but I never saw one BBU College I never saw one Impala school well wonder how them little Impala learned to be able within a matter of minutes when they are born whenever they go to moving in this transitory time the largest migration on the entire face of the Earth and it's amazing how that these these mothers will give birth in this migration you got to be kidding me so in migration tens of thousands of little babies are being born all over the serengetti Plains and them babies are dropped and in a matter of minutes they've got to be able to run like crazy because the Lions also know it's baby dropping time and so do the Cheetahs so do the wild dogs so do the leopards and them babies are so designed unlike us as babies we can't run we can't walk we can't crawl but God made them in the time of danger so they would be able to get up off of that ground after their mother gives birth to them and take off running some of them 45 to 50 miles an hour and they've been carried in their mother's belly for all those months and the first time they use their legs may be running from a wild dog or a cheetah now what did God do God provided for them and then whenever a zebra baby is born the mother will shield her little baby from all the rest of the zebras now remember there's thousands of them giving birth at one time that mother stripes and her spots are unique to herself they've never found two of them that are identical so that mother will give birth to her little baby zebra and she will keep herself from the rest of the herd and that little baby will set sat there and look at her and the imprint of his mama Stripes will be on him it is a permanent marker he will know the way she her voice is and he will see that imprint he will go out and play with all of his little zebra buddies and they all come back but you know what they're looking for they're looking for mama if a baby zebra can do that what about a seed of God that's lost out there in the world but God puts an imprint on you it's called a predes destinated seed and there ain't enough devils in hell to keep you away from the imprint of your father oh my now think of the children that we we long to be spiritual and we long to be great things but we think well just being a daddy what's that got to do and being a mother what's that got to do and you know being honest in my business and what's that got to do that is part of your ministry watch this the prophet talking about his wife and he said I said Lord she didn't mean what she did that morning now brother Randon was talking about sister mey and she was very disrespectful to brother Brandon you remember the story and it was about correcting their son their youngest son Joseph and she said if you was here you would do this and that and other she raised her voice to brother brandom you know he went on out she slam the door and he said the Lord spoke to him and told him he washing his car told him to to go read the scripture in the book of numbers so he comes back and he tells her that oh Bill Bill he said mey the lord gave me something so he said you should not have said that sometime later she develops this tumor in her body remember friends God says touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm if God would allow this to happen to the prophet's wife I feel sorry for the people in this age that are calling this prophet of God a liar and a deceiver it's going to be rough I'm telling you it's going to be bad now what so she's at this stage and that this tor is getting bigger and bigger now now brother renham found it by accident he was talking to someone and said brother renham how does that work cuz the Lord in the early stage of his ministry gave him a gift and he'd take his hand or take the Pati's hand and put on on his hand and and bumps would start breaking out on the on his body and then it would come to him exactly what was wrong with the individual so he was talking to his sister she said that is so marvelous how does that work I said well sister he's explaining to her and said just works like this and said now look at mey she she ain't got nothing wrong with her and as soon as he took mey's hand and laid on his hand he said you've got a tumor in the over so it got bigger and bigger and I want you to notice now how brother Bram is approaching God on behalf of his wife Lord she didn't mean that Lord not one time as she ever said one word about me going in the meeting stay months and whatever it was not one time as she ever opened her mouth about it she was always sent my clothes to the cleaners and washed my shirts and had everything ready to go in the meeting and then she wonders how she can serve God you women as you serve your husband you serve God of course now remember maybe some of you sisters sent your day and you say but brother Dy my husband is gone the Lord took him well maybe that aspect of your ministry is stopped for some others they might get remarried to another man it'll continue on that way but remember you still have a Ministry don't think because God takes your husband or your wife you don't still have a Ministry you still do it might be ministering to other widows but let me tell you this as a warning one of the worst things you can do when you suffer a tragic loss is pull yourself in to it's only about you and your world is about you God never saves any of us without giving us something to do to help the body now watch you women as you serve your husband you serve God of course and now then when I come in all tired and worn out people coming from everywhere and I have to go out somewhere on a fishing trip or a hunting trip why many women would have blowed up at that what'd she do got my hunting clothes ready for me to go now not just so happens and I'm reading this close to hunting season either I said Lord she didn't mean that and I said she had to be cut open three times on account of Shan now want you to notice how the prophet is intervening you said this is one aspect of a prophet that a lot of these blind Le ofans don't understand you look at the Old Testament and you see that prophets are given a position of intercessory prayer to intercede for kings and for Nations you understand what America did God sent America her own prophet he could have interceded for her but she turned him down oh my so notice he said she had to be cut open three times on account of cyrian and I said Lord I I hate to see her have to go through that again CU they're going to have to do a surgery order and what did God do he kneels down and res by himself he's fixing to drive to spport and said Lord I'm So Lonesome for him they had a little foot stool he said they'd all kneel down and pray oh my and he was afraid he might lose her why lost his first one we all know how that is don't we when Satan will try to bring fear and grip your heart but the mercy of God come and said whatever you say and he said before the doctor ever touches her let it be gone that's right now remember she didn't know this was going on but the prophet is now interceding for his wife and God heard his prayer I believe there are still people that can intercede for us don't you now look how important it was now if iall want you to notice brother Ram never mentions to God how many times sister mey spoke in tongues he never mentions to God how many time she shouted she ran she jumped she D she may have done all that I I I really don't know but whenever he's bringing to God that which would say now Lord she's done this and this and this is why I I don't I I don't don't do this don't allow this to happen to what does he mention washing shirts taking his clothes to the dry cleaners wow but do we look at such things as being spiritual or do we say what you do today mop the floors cleaned out the closets wash dishes I'm just getting ready to do the same thing tomorrow and some of you women might get so bored with the drudgery of life I some of you men get so bored with a treasure do you understand the Lord God called you to be what many women can never be a Godly wife a Godly mother oh you say brother Donnie there's millions of mothers I never said mothers I said Godly mothers Godly wives oh speak to us Jesus notice this in the adoption oh it's glorious to find your position and no one can do anything oh my unless you properly know what you're doing but the purpose of this now remember this is the beginning of the adoption or the chapter four part four of the adoption series the purpose of this is seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into or something that might have you merited somewhere but it's what God did for you himself amen God did for you himself not that you were so good that you went to a church one night and some poor old brother LED you up to the alar wasn't that it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner but don't do that you can never race corn in ephraim's corner if you're a manasse you got to take your place in Christ positionally take it and now after you live that don't mean you're free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on and let me just remind you today once you get in the land of Canaan you may stop fighting to take it but you'll have to start fighting to keep it how many's ever been healed with something and they find that same thing coming right back on you again maybe you laid aside a besetting sin or something that hadn't bothered you in years and yet it comes back and some of you let's just be honest some of you may have fallen right back into the same thing again and you say well Lord there ain't no hope for me no it means you're in the land and them same Devils that you run off before by the grace of of God don't give up very easy so if you whip pornography at one time in your life said boy glory to God it'll never bother me again don't you think that you have to watch that devil he'll come sneaking right back same way with your healing the prophet said that faith will cast that devil out and kill that gross in your body fear and unbelief will resurrect it can you imagine fear and unbelief having such power that it could resurrect a dead tumor in our bodies no wonder God wants us to have such a positive confession somebody say amen God wants us to never lose our praise if you don't get anything out of what I'm saying today other than this let me say this to you in the middle of your trials in the middle of your test don't never lose your praise don't give up on your adoration and how you feel you may not be able to thank God for having a flat tire for coming to church but thank God you had a spare and if you didn't have a spare thank God you had triaa there's always things to thank God for no matter what we're going through come on somebody and if we're not careful we'll let the devil steal our praise steal our joy and we're so sad and we're so down oh my I believe if there was ever a time that we as the people of God needed a restoration of our joy a restoration of our praise and of our worship is now I'm not talking about with the music going 90 miles an hour I'm talking about you having a praise in your heart for the Living God he has done so much for every one of us we were lost and he found us we were wretched and blind and naked and he saved us and filled us with him Spirit oh I love the way he deals with this and the type Canaan did not represent the great Heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk Joshua said Gad I want you right in your lays your place according to the blueprint your place lays here right here you get in here Gad you stay here Benjamin you go right down there oh then whenever they find their spot they can operate then a housewife can come to the house of God she don't have to feel ashamed and be embarrassed you know you hear Brother Daryl talking about the people he's led to the Lord hear these other brothers talking about they prayed for so and so and this happened oh my I don't know of any Miracles that I've ever done well maybe not but maybe you prayed for brother Daryl and God anointed him to do it God still used you do you understand the Lord don't want any of us to stand before him that day with nothing in our hands but brother Donnie what have I done all I've got my children what do you mean that's all you've got is your children when one of them is worth millions of Worlds and you're thinking I haven't done anything for God yes you have in this Dark Age that we're living when Satan is doing everything in the world to pull our youth to the world and the Darkness of the world how we thank God for the use of our church how I thank God for every one of them that are sent you they could have been home sleeping over a drunk from last night or trying to recover from some high but instead they're sitting here in the house of God and they're worshiping the Lord and they're clapping their hands and it ain't just do to the youth leader it ain't just due to the pastor but it's due to mamas and daddies as [Applause] well oh Lord Jesus you've got to know your position you've got to know your place is that right brother West that's right know your position Christ promised the things that I do shall you do also you believe it with all to your heart again reproach for the word you're born for a purpose and nobody nobody on now y'all hearing me nobody can take your place I can't sing like Harry I can't sing like brother Caleb I can't preach like brother Tim prud is known as the prince of preachers I can't preach Faith Like brother Daryl can I can't preach like Brother David Siler man that got can preach up a storm can he but they Ain neither one of them brothers can take my place I can't take theirs they can't take mine and I do not feel intimidated because I cannot preach like this man that man that man sing like this man that man that man I can only be what God's made me my voice may be grally and rough and I you know whatever more I might get off Pitch every now and then but I ain't singing I'm not I'm not applying for some Opera position I'm making a Joyful Noise to the Lord sometime an octave may be a high off or a little bit lower a little bit of gravel here I'd rather give Jesus my gravel then give it to the devil come on somebody what I've got I'm going to give to the Lord I'm going to give my ears to hear his word I'm going to give my eyes to read and study I'm going to give my hands to cast out death devil and lay hands on the sick Hallelujah I'm going to give my feet to the cause of Jesus Christ because no one in this message can take my place nor [Applause] yours you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place that's right God's word will Triumph it cannot fail that's where every Christian ought to stand and trials will come and every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it will all work right so you see it's not just that we get in trouble if we miss it let me go this direction then we'll close here if we serve his purpose we will raise in the resurrection of Life notice this God's creation reflects God God made everything for a purpose and everything that serves God's purpose when it dies it has a resurrection thank you Lord there is no resurrection of life for pontious pilot no resurrection of life for rameses thei no resurrection of life for SAR rib that come against the children of Israel Nebuchadnezzar nebuch caradan no resurrection of life and yet all some of you will be will be a housewife a farmer but you will have a resurrection of life and you will enter into the City and you will never die and great Kings and monarchs and princes and potentates and Priests your name will never be found in the book who's who but I'm glad my name has been found in God's book of who is who my name is actually in the book of Who's Who mhm didn't do me no good though I've still got it I don't know why they wanted to put it in there for it reckon redneck hillbilly whatever I'm not sure why but they wanted to put my name in there under the who's who some of y'all shocked a you but didn't do no good but Jesus wrote my name on the palm of his hand so he looks over in the condensed version and see who's who so the rich the wealthy the infamous and the famous the important the not so important this is really what matters if a man serves God's purpose there is a resurrection just as sure as anything I'm going to quote this next and it's from the title I am the resurrection it's actually preached in camville Kentucky formerly this was titled Garnet Peaks funeral a young boy that was in an iron Lum a young boy that never got to be married a young boy that never got to do much in life but his life's dream was to be a tobacco Auctioneer but he never hardly got to play he never hardly got to do anything as a mortal much that's what it would seem like for God now listen these words from this boy's funeral service we find out that the resurrection only comes when it serves God's purpose if it doesn't serve God's purpose no matter how beautiful how pretty it looks how much better it might look than some other seed that is gerti it'll never rise it lives this and settles that settles it but if it's gerti it must rise am again so is it my friends we here this afternoon to see what death has done to our brother about 18 19 years old it's got to be gered we might belong to church we might might be fine people we might be a good character in the neighborhood a fine father mother son daughter but unless we are germatize with the spirit of God will'll never rise in the resurrection it's finished yes sir now you imagine when he goes on into this funeral service and he said if Garnet doesn't rise there is no rising of the Sun it would be irrational to say that Garnet will not rise a little boy that lived in an arm lung a little boy that had a poor family a little boy that none of his dreams and motives and objectives was ever able to be fulfilled and yet brother brandham preached this little boy's funeral if you haven't listened to in a while do good listen to it he preached this boy's funeral as as if he was a prince a prince why he caught a perspective of life that we look at so different we look at stocks bonds Investments four years of this degree and six years of that degree and I've got this reputation I'm a CEO I'm a whatever oh you know oh i' I've got this and I've got that I'm I'm fulfilling my dream in life and here laid the wed poor little body of a poor little guy that hardly nobody knew but he served God's purpose CU a prophet said he had been gerti by eternal life that's the reason the sun rises it because it serves God's purpose and we rise when we serve God's purpose I believe that brother Williams now I referring to another man that had passed serve God's purpose in life listen what part of the purpose was a real father I see his Darling Companion Mrs Williams sitting here a real husband that's one of God's purposes a father other one of God's purposes and he was dramatized to God by the Holy Spirit God's main purpose let me close with this if everything serve God's purpose it's got a resurrection but it can only rise up if it serves God's purpose I down the basement yesterday listen listen to a tape the devil come to me like he does to you sometimes hey you understand this and you understand that you understand why God let this happen and that happened and that happened I said ' nope sure don't and he come back and said and you still going to serve him am you're you're still going to live for him you're still going to preach I said yep he said how can you do that I said you wouldn't understand [Applause] praise the Lord oh he don't understand how that you can keep on serving him even whenever the Lord may not answer your prayer he don't understand how you can keep coming to church and you may come service after service and you may be going through a dry spell it seem like you ain't getting nothing you said you going back and said yep sure him said why I said you wouldn't understand it in the first place you wouldn't understand it I'm a Child of God filled with the Holy Ghost I've got something you ain't never got something you can't never get well come on somebody he's all the time trying to jump on you you need to jump on him sometime and just wear him out I just think the Lord dropped that down in my heart so you know what the devil done he left me alone I said good Riders get out of here and leave me alone you wouldn't understand I just started preaching my little sermon I paused my tape I started preaching those sermon D D devil I put my hand over here I said devil let me just tell you something old boy you don't understand what it's like to serve God you don't understand what it's like to be filled with the Holy Ghost you don't understand I got to feeling pretty good I'm feeling pretty good right now that's what you need to do sisters go ahead and preach to him at your house and just tell them you don't understand what it's like to be a daughter of God who loves the Lord when the Lord did not answer my prayer yet my love for him is greater than anything I know in this world demons he wouldn't understand it world you wouldn't understand nothing about it why because we have been called by God and we are serving God's [Applause] purpose but brother Donnie I've messed up so bad now Moses after taking the situation in his own hand found out he was a total fail run from the presence of pharaoh and from the presence of God and was a stranger for 40 years way back married an Ethiopian girl so she had a lot of temper Moses had a lot of temper and that was his trouble I just imagine things wasn't so peaceful on the back there of the desert at times but God gave it to him now if you think you married a woman that has a little temper don't nobody move don't nobody bat no eyes or nothing now I'm not even looking at y'all don't y'all look at me now if you think you married a woman has a little temper maybe God's trying to tame you down a little so and vice versa so he was a total failure it's amazing what God can do with total failures glory to God so the P was kind of high she proved it when she cut the foreskin from her son and thre it before Moses and said thou are a bloody husband to me I might imagine things wasn't too peaceful at times what was he doing schooling into the boy's n mind or the man's mind what the program of God was let's jump down to paragraph 33 Moses had been a total failure and maybe there's men here this afternoon maybe ministers that's been total fail years maybe you've been as a housewife maybe you've been as a student at school a child to your parents whatever you've been let that be has been Oh Glory to God let that be has been well what was it when you went to church Sunday morning I was a total failure but I left with hope I had been a failure I had been totally messed up I had been really this and that and the other but I walked out them same doors I walked into I walked in with no hope but I walked out hopeful I walked in it seemed like I was an absolute hopeless case I walked in a total failure but I walked out a redeemed total failure Hallelujah Can We Stand Together whatever you have been let that be has been and start from today no matter what it is maybe you've been a failure as a Christian maybe you failed to go on with God if it has been take note to what I'm going to say in a few moments Moses failed down in Egypt when he was born he been delivered to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt why because he did it in himself he took it upon himself to do it and anytime you take things upon yourself and leave God out you're going to be a failure like Moses oh how many wants God to take you today and help you Moses life consisted of 120 years 40 Years of it coming up to be taught 40 years was a total failure 40 years then he serve the Lord so imagine 80 years 80 years of his life that he wasn't serving God with all of his heart but he done more in them last 40 than all the damage that the devil done in the early 80 but brother Donnie is there any hope are you breathing your heart still pumping There's Hope now you can just go ahead and get down and water all the mistakes and all the fairies if you wish to or you can say how much every time I've got left I can see him as he stood there that day between them two gigantic columns in this Auditorium that was shaped like a mushroom his heart was broken he was blinded cuz he' been a failure his name was Samson he loved one of the daughters of the valley of Sak loved Delilah the very Nation God had called him to deliver his people from and finally conquered him they chained him and he's going around and around and around in circles in the Gris Mill of Satan you imagine him as they go down there and they take them hot poers and they burn his eyeballs out he can no longer see and he's working in the place of a mule an animal but his hair starts growing out tears coming out of those sockets that used to contain eyes now they want to use him for entertainment how many former Christians are now entertainment at a drunken party the prophet said I can see him as he can tell that little boy that's leading him you imagine they got this little b old guy as an act of humiliation they don't bring out this bronny guy leading Samson but a little bitty old fella and he leads him up and he ask him would you put my hands how's this building made so he says there's two columns right in the middle would you put my right hand on one and my left hand on the other and then he prays this prayer Lord once more avenge me of my eyes Lord I'm so sorry I failed you fallen short of the glory of God and the spirit of God comes on Samson and he begins to feel as the Holy Ghost goes to moveing through his body again and he begins to push and all the popping and the cracking and the Bible tells us that he slayed more at his deaths and he did through his entire life a man that was a failure it one like that he was a drunk and then he got saved and had all these great victories he was a leader for God and fell flat on his face he was a failure to God and God's people but God was not going to let his life be crowned with such may God allow you to put your hands on whatever it is that's ending your life and the strength of the Holy Ghost if it's a habit of besetting sin you're past let it be what the prophet called it a has been a has been and forgetting those things which are behind us let us press toward the mark of the High Calling of God which is in Christ Jesus let's bow our heads together hallelujah how many would like to be remembered here today maybe some of you just need strength for your journey some of you need a restoration of your joy maybe some of you finding yourself down in that old grind and Mill of the Philistines you're just going around in circles living with the memories of what you used to be it must have been absolutely tormenting on that man's mind day in and day out remembering how the anointing fell remembering previous victories maybe there's some here today maybe someone streaming this service from New Zealand Australia France Germany Europe wherever you are around the world you find yourself reminiscing of the way you used to be and the way you are today and there's no comparison cuz you've slipped so far oh god father I pray today in the name of Jesus May the presence of God sweep across this place this morning may you deal with every heart Lord we don't want our victories just to be in the past we don't want just to be faint memories I used to be dedicated to God I used to be consecrated to God I used to pray and reading my Bible but God blessed me so much and I got so much in my business and boy I just I ain't got time for it no more I don't want them blessings God I personally would rather have less of this world's goods and have a walk with you than I would what the world identifies as blessings from God no time to pray no time to read my Bible no time with my wife no time with my family no Lord help us Jesus when it's all said and done is it going to be all the money that we make that we stand before you that day and the books are open and say wowy you done great man I'll tell you what you've done so much help us all to realize we're not going to be rewarded for how much we kept but rather for what we gave away but somehow for a lot of business people they think that's theirs they think it's theirs and they don't even acknowledge that you were the one who gave them that ability everybody is not business-minded they can't make money they can't do this that they just don't have it they don't know how to do it I'm one of them I don't know how have no desire to never have but Lord help me help the business People Help the mothers help the fathers if we ever accomplish anything in this life it'll be by what you gave us the talents and the abilities to do help us Lord Jesus I pray the young ladies would walk out of these doors today with a different look at thems the young men they think that well I'll never be a preacher I'll never be this or that or the other no that may be true but they may witness to somebody and bring them to the Lord Jesus at a school they're going to or a college someone I would never see brother Daryl would never see the rest of these preachers would never even meet and that person will be Iden ified with them for eternity help us Lord Jesus we worship you father hallelujah hallelujah how many wants help in

desire to work [Music] man Hallelujah you know if there's something in us that longs for more of him that's the evidence that there's more of him for you to receive for we know there's a deep that calls a to the deep and I'm so glad this morning that we're gathered here with people we don't desire the fame and the riches of the world I don't care I don't care if this mayor knows my name I don't care if the governor of Tennessee knows my name I don't care if the president he knows my name amen and the god that created the heavens and earth has placed a desire in you to serve him Amen to be a minister oh I haven't enjoyed this so much on the ministry we talking back today in the study and I told brother Donnie I said you know one day I believe we'll stand there and we'll find out that some of these sisters pray and some of these things that that was done that we don't even know about will be greater than some of the ministers who stood behind the pull pit I believe that friends amen you never know the prayer of a mother how it changes a boy's heart somewhere God put that on her that's an ability for a mother to pray for a child and there's always something that we can do like the little boy you know that was Out on the Ocean we're I know you're going to go but he just he Out on the Ocean and these these starfish had beached theel and thousands of starfish was on the beach and the boys picking them up and throwing them back in the water and this fell said hey little buddy what are you doing he said I'm I'm helping these starfish I'm I'm I'm I'm making a difference and he picked it up you know and he he said Son look at this there's thousands of them up on this beach you can never make a difference he picked up one and threw it in the water and he said I made a difference to that one amen sir if I can't reach the world just let me reach that one for your name will be associated with them throughout eternity and you know as I said before God don't need something big he just needs something yielded to give oursel away Lord use me whatever capacity Lord you want to use me and I give myself to you have you enjoyed the word of God Amen so grateful for brother dar go and enjoy your day enjoy your family and meditate upon the things that you've heard and if you if he comes up on your heart pray for my little buddy my grandson Aiden he they named him Aiden which means little fire and he's certainly living up to that to that name he had surgery on Wednesday uh they did some surgery on his tongue and his upper lip and put I think 10 stitches and he fell this morning when they was getting ready for church and busted his chin and so allly just told me that they glued that back together so if you think about it just say a little prayer for him and pray for these other needs and and I tell you something that's and I noticed in the last few weeks I I get several texts on my phone people some sometimes you don't even know who they are but they say brother Dar would you pray but in the last week or so I've got three or four different text from families saying please pray for my son or my daughter that there's a spirit of suicide on them and they're I just pray that God will spare them and so if you want to pray for something let's pray for our young people for it seems like Satan's really attacking them right now trying to pull them out of this message or trying to tell them they're worthless and they need to take their own life but we ain't going to let the devil have our children I said we ain't going to let the devil have our children amen so if you got you need something to pray about pray for that need right there that God will just move up on these young people and they have a real experience because you see if you're just in the message Satan can talk you out of it but if the message is in you all hell can't get it out of you and that's what we want today do you love him let's just bow our heads heavenly father I I'm just so grateful today Lord that we can gather here and Lord and set under a Ministry like brother Donnie Lord and and father I I'm not just bragging on brother Donnie but the gift that you placed into his life to minister to your people we're so thankful for that father and Lord I pray that you just strengthen our brother Lord and as he said sometimes this is the easy part to stand here it's the it's the counseling Lord and the studying and those aspects of the ministry Lord that some people never see that that weighs the heaviest but Lord I pray that you'd guide him Lord that ever interview that ever ever need that he would have to witness or speak to someone may you just give him the words to say Lord and renew his strength father we pray and God be with us today as we travel Lord and what we have planned for this afternoon may you be a part of that Lord and father we pray for our families and for our children and our grandchildren oh that your spirit would just move upon each of them dear God that they would have their own experience and come to the knowledge and the grace and the saving power of the almighty God and Lord we're just so grateful for the things that we've heard today and Lord I it's it's not important whether we would have the greatest Ministry in the world or maybe the least Ministry in the world all that matters Lord is that we are faithful to the ministry that you've given us and Lord may we only look at that father and just be what you want us to be we thank you for the service today the songs everything that was done For Your Glory go with your people now Lord give them traveling grace watch over us until we come back on Wednesday night we pray and father as a song says may we draw closer to you may we draw nearer to you Lord as we

done some great things I believe that the Lord is been Among Us spoke to us moved so appreciate our brothers and the ministry that we've heard uh just absolutely outstanding we want to also thank brother Donnie for this opportunity to be here amen how many's looking forward to the word oh I'm looking forward I can't wait to hear what's going to come out of my mouth today Hallelujah Leviticus chapter 13 verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising anybody ever had a rising in your flesh a scab or a bright spot and it be the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy then he shall be brought into Aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the priest and the priest shall look on the plague and the skin of the flesh and when the hair in the plague is turned white and the plague in the sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh so if he looks at the skin and it's superficial it's one thing but then to look at the skin and see that it goes deeper than just the flesh but it actually affects the bloodline and he says it's deeper than the skin of the flesh it's a plague of leprosy and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him unclean if the bright spot be wi in the skin of his flesh and the sight be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof not turn white then the priest shall shut him up that have the plague for seven days and the priest shall look on him on the seventh day and behold if the plague in his sight be at stay and the pr spread not in the skin then the priest shall shut him up seven more days and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day and if the plague be somewhat dark and the spread not in the skin the priest shall pronounce him clean it's just a scab he shall wash his clothes and be clean but at the scab spread a much abroad in the skin after he has seen of the priest for his cleansing he shall be seen priest seen of the priest again and if the priest see that behold the scab spreadeth in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a leprosy may the Lord add His blessings to the word today you can be seated I want to speak to you today on this law of the leper here is Israel in the middle of this journey Israel's on their way to the promise they're headed to The Inheritance that God has spoken to them and that God has G them and in the middle of this journey they're going to fight all kinds of battles they're going to go through all kinds of troubles and they come to this place in the journey to where now they are actually Contracting things that has affected these other nations that's around them and now they come to this place to where God has looked down upon them and the Bible said the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron and he spake to them concerning this plague of leprosy so this is something that God is concerned about God's concerned about leprosy God's concerned about diseases God's concerned about our battles he's concerned about our troubles you believe that he is and because of this disease that would come among them he's going to instruct Moses as the Lord is going to tell them how to deal with this leprosy once it comes into the camp now leprosy in the scripture is one of the most feared diseases of the Bible for an individual to contract leprosy it's considered to be a des sentence people that would actually contract this they actually considered this to be actually inflicted by God himself which we know is not true but they would call it divine retribution from God because of evil deeds and evil works and evil thoughts so here they are in this place of the journey and God is wanting to actually instruct them that if someone would come with this Mark upon their skin that it would look like leprosy he wants them to know how they are to deal with a leper once he comes into the camp now and truly once someone comes in the last stages of leprosy there was no way for that person to be able to be help there was no way for them to be able to get past it because there was no for it there was no remedy for it that person as we would say would be destined to die because of what they've contracted because there's no cure and that person that would contract leprosy they would live a life of Torment because leprosy is a bacterial disease it's a disease of the flesh amen I said it's a disease of the flesh it's a disease that will take and it starts in in the flesh but then as it begins to get worse and worse it actually takes and it gets into the bloodline where it flows to every part of the body it affects every part of the body once it begins to flow it affects their hands it affects their fingers it affects their toes symptoms that they develop is actually it's it's granulous inside of the nerves it affects the respiratory tract it affects their speech Hallelujah it actually affects their skin it affects their Vision it affects their sight and because of this this disease that comes upon their hands their hands become numb and it becomes desensitized where they can't feel the way they anybody hear me today they can't feel the way they used to feel they cannot sense the way that they use the sense and they actually take because of the dentation of their fing fingers they would actually take and they would have these wounds and they would injure their fingers until they become so infected and because of this disease they become weak they become poor and they live this way in torment because leprosy makes you weak leprosy brings paralysis leprosy affects your eyes it affects your voice it causes you to lose the ability to feel the way that you used to feel and see things the way that you used to see and the longer that they would have it the worse that they would get so the priest then after seven days if a spot should come upon them he would take and he wants to examine the sore that is upon their body he wants to examine the priest wants to examine the flesh he would examine to see how infected that they really are if there's any chance for them\n"}, {"id": "2024-06-09 - The Bride's Bill Of Rights Pt.42 - Unknown

new little son and we'll offer him to the Lord today bring them in bring them them in bring them in from the fear of sin bring them in congratulations bring them in bring the little on to Jesus thank you Lord it's more than my mind can comprehend how any mother or any father would want to kill such a thing amen shows the darkness that has moved Upon Our World does it know it makes me so honor and appreciate parents that desire to face this awesome responsibility it's not all the goo and the laughs and all that but it's also the heartache the disappointments up late at night sickness trouble aren't you glad God has parents like that you ought to be you wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't let's pray together dear Jesus thank you for life life itself is the greatest gift that we could be given as Mortals then we move into eternal life I'm grateful for my brother and sister who desire Lord to be able to bring up their children in the way that's pleasing to you we know it's not always easy there's no way for them to know the heartaches that may lay before them with their little son there's no way for them to know the diseases or sickness or the darkness of the age that they may face but the way they look at it it's worth it for we know that if we can train them up in the right way then they will not depart from it this is the shortest time that we'll ever have them we're looking Beyond the Veil father when we'll be able to gather with our children again my brother and sister bring their little son to you today to dedicate his life to you father help my sister that it can be the Fifth Gospel the Declaration of Jesus May the angels of God feel so comfortable in their home May the presence of the spirit of God be near him Lord if time would tear that he'd be old enough to reach the age of accountability and to be able to know right from wrong may he be able to give his little heart to you when he's young before the evil days come upon him keep him from the sickness disease his evils of the day I dedicate his life to you Lord Jesus for a life of service for it's in your precious Holy Name that we ask it amen yep he'll fit really good look at that sleeping wow can we stand together praise the Lord let's turn to Romans chapter 7 if you would today I'm sure brother Lou already mentioned it but the um Vacation Bible School will start tomorrow actually I want to say how much I appreciate all the work and all the effort that's been um gone into it for our children um also ask brother Michael if he would reach out to the other churches in our area professing to follow the message and U invite them their children if they wish to come I don't think the lord gave us this place just for us you know and some of the other churches around or smaller churches and they don't really have some of them don't have that many young people so they maybe they couldn't do something like like this but I wanted to open up for them as well and um if they can come so if you see some kids maybe you don't know and you know I believe that if we could get them to Jesus and say something that would help their hearts I read the other day where that the houti which is a a rebel group in Yemen they are having summer camps this summer they have over a million of these kids that are attending these camps and the main theme of their entire Camp is hating Jews learning how to kill them learning how to torment them learning how to torture them rape them you imagine little bitty children I saw pictures of little bitty old boys standing there with fake guns and their arms and the hamos things and all that around their heads Satan knows exactly what he's doing to try to influence you remember Hitler years and years ago had a group called Hitler Youth and they was taking them when they were young teenagers and instill this hatred well if they can do that how much more should we do it with the truth of the Gospel amen so remember that this week that the Lord will just be with them they'll be having fun of course and they're going to have um different things that they're going to teach them so just pray the presence of God will be able to be here for every night that that's going on you know what it might be a little child I just read it to you the other day where the Prophet said there's a little boy a little girl in here that was born over in Seattle Washington they're not old enough to receive it yet but the church will plug play along slug along have meetings and so forth until that child is old enough so what if this week a child will come to the age of accountability and that last one might not be a 40 year old man or a 50 year old man maybe it's a nine or 10 year old little boy or little girl and the presence of God will deal with their hearts wouldn't that be awesome it would be awesome [Music] sorry I personally don't want to say anybody lost you I don't want to say nobody go to hell let's do everything we can to reach those that are redeemable Romans chapter 7 verse one I want to speak to you again today on the right to be married to God know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hasth dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from the law from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another married to another even to him what an honor who is raised raed from the dead that we should bring forth fruit so now we're talking about a marriage and then Paul says so that once we are married to him we should not be fruitless or Barren but that we should bring forth fruit unto God may the Lord bless his word you may be seated let me read the quote that I've been sharing with you for a couple of weeks from invisible Union Paul here is giving an illustration in her scripture about the law and Grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce this passage is very seldom preached on because it more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he's trying to set in order that we as a church now I believe also it is to my belief it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy so one of the great Mysteries of the last day is the greater portion of marriage and divorce so it's not just about men and women getting married and and all of that but it is also about Christ being able to achieve a bride that would move Beyond just religion move Beyond organized systems of man led by man called by man put together by man orchestrated by man and it would be a body that he himself would step inside that body now individually we are baptized collectively into the body of Christ so we don't all get the Holy Ghost at one time we don't all grow at the same rate we don't all even in feed at the same time and sometimes on the same amount same amount of food but we are individually baptized collectively into the body of God this like every other special event down through time it requires a special manifestation of God now we know that there's been different times down to the ages by which God would do great Supernatural things and it would be like a changing of a dispensation when everything runs normal as we'd say and it may go that way for a long time 50 years 100 years 200 years and then all of a sudden God will appear on the scene in an abnormal unusual way sometimes he sends an Angel sometimes it would be a theophonic appearance of Christ himself before the Incarnate body of Flesh was brought on the earth other times it would be a supernatural manifestation of the father appearing in the form of lights or fire or a visible manifestation of God and whenever we look then at the last days if this is what we believe it is one of the great mysteries of Prophecy it would lead us to believe that this will also require a special manifestation of God to reveal himself in a way that would be quite unusual from the way that he's done before so we could go back in the time of manoah and his wife and God is fixing to send a deliver by the name of Samson and we can see that an angel of the Lord comes and wondrously performs a very unusual appearance there before mon Noah and his wife we could also go back to Moses of course in the burning bush we could go to Gideon we could go to different various times when the Lord appeared in such a way and sometimes depending upon the seriousness of the cause God would choose whichever administrative spirit that would be able to most definitely meet the need of that age now remember when God sends an angel it's for a specific need so God would send Gabriel from time to time and then God sent wormwood at the anti deluvian destruction God sends different ones because when we see that Angelic presence it's not just here in a body form but it's releasing something so when Daniel was there and he was praying and seeking God and God sent an angel down we remember reading the scripture and that angel was detained by a war then the the angel of God was able to break loose and another one came and he was able to come and give Daniel this great message of what he needed but it wasn't just an understanding of scripture alone but it was the releasing of an anointing something that would help them to be able to take the message that God gave and be able to live it now you see whenever God reveals a greater portion of his word it's not just like God shines the light on a certain portion of the scripture and then people look at oh oh okay yeah wow wow I see that my that's that's wonderful but there must be a release in the Supernatural to be able to anoint the people to live what they have seen if not they'll try to take the same kind of life and the same kind of experience and all that produces is a carnal impersonation but God releases with that a special anointing there has to be because God knows exactly how we are now we're talking about then a marriage in the last days by which the bride of Christ will come through all of these systems now in the early church they did not need this special type of anointing because it was the age of the personal life of Christ revealed in the first church age so God revealed the anointing in that age and it was the personal life of Christ and it anointed them to be able to preach the gospel live their lives not only that but give their lives in this then we move from that to another church age then a seal was open trumpet sounded seal tore off it released a mystery but also released the life or the anointing to help the people in that day how could the people be able to stand by and watch their children be taken from them how could husbands watch their wives be killed how could mothers and father s watch their children be beheaded and all that they did how could they do that with just the scripture No the scripture plus a special anointing that would release and anoint them to help them to be able to do it cuz remember they were not superhumans they were humans just like us how is God ever going to help them to do it he must release an anointing that would anoint them individuals to receive the message of that day and help them to live it I believe we need the same thing don't you so then we look at the culmination of seven Church ages and we've got thousands of denominations when the prophet was here there was 900 and something but now there's multiplied thousands of them all types of different religions around the world and of course every one of them say they are the way they have a special Enlightenment they have a special understanding so they claim if not why not just have one major Church in every city and everybody go to that church and everybody just believe the same thing but every church with whatever name that's tacked onto it is an identification of someone who feels like they have a special something different than every other church that you pass to come here this morning is that right if not why not just shut this one down and shut down every other one and will All Join one great big gigantic mega church because if we all believe the same thing all go to the same place and we're all carrying out the same Divine Purpose of God what's the use in having a whole bunch of different ones let's just all be the same thing but of course we know we are not the same now because the devil wants to project that doesn't mean that we believe it because we know God is always a separationist that God separates his people not from other people so much but from sin and unbelief now that's the way we believe the gospel so in this day through all the theology all the hierarchy of religion all the nonsense that God knew would be in the last days there will have to be not only certain scriptures that would prophetically apply to this hour such as Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7 revelation 3:14 uh Zechariah 14 different scriptures that would pertain to the last day but there must also be an anointing that would come on the earth to help those people who live in this hour to help call them out from all the rest of these systems now remember there'll be more in this last age than has ever been before of all the different religions and systems of the world but it won't just be an anointing that will make them shout and rejoice and be happy and all that because a lot of religions of the world do that and we certainly are not the only one that even has Miracles and signs and wonders there's many religions that do that so it can't be that alone and yet we do believe in that it cannot just be that our music is nice and our singers are nice and we've got a nice place to come because there's people that have a whole lot better music than we do a whole lot nicer place than we do so what is it going to be that is going to make the people of this day called what we believe to be the bride that is going to make them different than all the rest of the religions and the churches well it must be a supernatural manifestation will it be a profit only will it be just special ministry will it be special meal that God has given a great insight and somehow they will understand more than other men will it be a a special type of ability that maybe they will have above others nope none of the above now God will use men of course and God will anoint men but God is not going to allow this to be carried out by men only you see in this end time it must have been a special need for a special anointing and it cannot be just the anointing on an ordinary human being it cannot be the anointing just upon ordinary people that are struggling and trying to move along trying to do the best they can and try to hold out to the end no there must be something really Supernatural now what it is it's the divine manifestation of the revealing of the son of man himself which is more than just a Revival it is more than just a group of people getting together with a bunch of Creeds and Theology and ideas and deciding to form a a special group or a special church but it must be something that the Lord God will declare himself and we know that there's been a handful of these events down through time whenever God himself would actually slip down on the earth and would intervene himself we know of course it had happened in the time of Abraham when God was going to destroy Sodom and before he destroys Sodom he appears to his prophet Abraham is that right so it was what was this manifestation it was a Supernatural manifestation of the Eternal himself but what he did he simply took the elements of the Earth the 16 elements and he blew into them and Ste into a body that could eat a calf sandwich and drink milk and be able to have his feet washed he also blew two more bodies and two angels of God one stepped into one and one stepped into the other now this was a great change Abraham had had all types of events in his life but now something great must be fixing to happen and this appearing theophonic appearing of God not in a form of a fire not in a form of a bush but a theophany in a man the opony in human flesh now notice what did this forun it forun Abraham and Sarah's bodies being changed now God never done this of course whenever he calls him out of of Mesopotamia God does not do this even when he backslides and goes down to the land of Egypt God does not do it at other times but this was a special time that required a special anointing and God didn't just send them two angels oh my angels are profound it's amazing what angels can do but there's certain things that God Saves for himself you hearing me this morning now in this it was the the visible manifestation of the son of man now the son of man is a special entity of God it's different from the burning bush it's different of course than just a pillar of Fire Light smoke different manifestations by which the presence of God has been revealed but it is him revealing himself in a prophet form Prophet form now listen every time the manifestation of the son of man would appear on the earth it's always attached to a prophetic message that something needs to be revealed in the New Testament we would know it in the term as the Messianic sign now listen the Messianic sign the Messianic sign and the ministry of the son of man are not one of the nine spiritual gifts in the book of Corinthians now listen carefully let me say it again the Messianic sign is not one of the nine spiritual gifts in the book of Corinthians Faith Miracles healings word of knowledge word of wisdom so on and so on it is a special manifestation of God that's quite unlike anything else it will be so unique that God himself will be the only one that can perform it amen now he can create himself a body or if he chooses he can able to step inside of another human's body which was actually brought forth by natural births doesn't make any difference to him just a special manifestation but the thing is it's the revealing of the son of man in a body of Flesh now God himself called Ezekiel son of man and it was absolutely essential that he himself coming in the New Testament must call himself the son of man who do men say I the son of man not Son of God but who do men say I the son of man am so in the last days this will require a special manifestation again of the son of man why because of all the religions and all the demons that's going to be released Out of Hell will produce such a power of deception without the people of God having a special anointing to pull them it would be so close it would deceive the very elected if possible now say the first church age under the administration of the first church Angel Paul did not need the personal presence of the son of man to to be able to influence that church age as bad as the second Church age third fourth fifth sixth on down as bad as it was they did not need the son of man to come down and call out the bride but the seventh Church age would be so horrible and the Darkness would be so severe and Satan would be going about to deceive even the very elected if it were possible God himself had to come down in the form of the son of man and not only give scriptures but to release a special anointing on the bride in the last days that would help her beyond what any of the other ages needed to be helped by now do you understand by this very manifestation it shows us how dark that it really is but it ought to make us rejoice as well now let me read this to you and proving his word Jesus said I said was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being reveal not no more as a church see not no more uh the bride is called in the day when the son of man will be revealed what why is the son of man being revealed to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride now this could have been done under the administration of Paul in the first church age because Paul tells us that he had presented them as a Chase virgin to Christ so the son of man the manifestation of the son of man was not needed in the Ephesian age now you look around you didn't see any churches back there in the first church age called Baptist Methodist Church of God unarian Church of Christ Presbyterian Catholic honor and on and on and on there were no such a thing so the deception of Christianity had only started in its infant stage so they did not need this type of manifestation Everybody follow me this morning to be able to see because the the Perpetual darkness that Satan was going to produce in such a way it had not yet been founded the Devil Himself was just learning how to do this in the first church age same with the second third fourth and sixth but in the seventh it's going to be so horrible it's going to be so bad that the prophet talking about gifts from God and he said that Satan can impersonate everyone of those gifts from the Lord amen and it would be so close in the last days it would deceive the very elect if possible I personally believe that's also a prophetic utterance that was never applied in such strength as it is in this hour now what he said what's what's this son of man for to join the church to the Hedge and not the marriage of the Bride now notice what will happen the bridegroom call will come right through this the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down Lord God and come in human flesh to unite the two together so the bridegroom call will come through the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man I realize that many theologians for years taking Matthew 24 also Luke 17 and other scriptures that pertain to the last day and they tried to take and put it all together as it was in referring to the coming of the Lord Jesus and the Lord tells us remember Lot's wife remember Lot's wife isn't it amazing that Jesus there when he says Luke 17:28 and remember Lot's wife then he goes on to tell us as it was in the days of Sodom thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed not comes not corporal coming different word altoe when the son of man now remember friends this is not a bunch of nonsense I'm making up in my mind I'm telling you the words of the Lord Jesus Jesus was the one that said the son of man would be revealed in the last day but yet in the bride coming or the Rapture coming of Christ the world will never even see him because where he hangs there suspended in the the heavens and we rise from our home he lives his home and there we meet in the middle but when the son of man is going to be revealed isn't it amazing that he gives us the warning of Lot's Li wife before he tells us of the manifestation of the son of man remember Lot's wife I found it astounding he never did tell us remember Sarah remember Rebecca remember Rachel remember Solomon's mother remember remember but he tells us remember Lot's wife and then he tells us why we should remember her and then he gives us the revealing of the son of man so it was prior to Lot's wife destruction right over the hill where the son of man had made himself known to Abraham now lot did not see the son of man but Abraham did he come down and talked to him in the form of a human being and what did he do he gave him a promise by this time next year Sarah will have a son what is it prop prophesying prophetic word Discerning Sarah's heart in the tent now remember Sarah was in the tent he did not see her he did not not hear her physically but he said why did Sarah life Sarah said how did life he said yes you did life you imagine calling God a liar to his face but you do know why God couldn't kill her don't you her husband had a covenant was God sir a't it amazing Lot's wife could be turned to a pill of salt she never called God a liar she never withstood God to his face she simply turned back to hear the the cries of her grandchildren in Sodom as they were burning up in the flames and God turned her to a pillar of salt why her husband had no Covenant with God so after the manifestation of the son of man then Lord 's wife which had hung around the message for a long time remember lot and his wife we don't even know what her name is so apparently must not be significant but lot and his wife and their children their daughters had walked with the prophet's message they had stayed with the prophet's message for several years until light looked down toward the well-watered plains and it reminded him of Egypt you see Abraham had backslid years before this and lot went with him and where did they go they went to the land of Egypt and Egypt made an imprint so much on lot that he never got over it so as he looked toward the well-watered plains that was laying there toward solom and gamar and the five cities that were there and he sees and it reminds him of what he saw in the land of EG Egypt he does not consult the prophet he does not go and say Abraham my uncle you know I'm thinking about going here and you know doing this and that and the other what do you think lead me help me to know exactly what to do he doesn't apparently considered essential for him so he makes up his mind and they go down there into the land of Sodom and God never went to Sodom but God sent two angels to Sodom Sodom never received the manifestation of the son of man but it was Abraham and under the opes of this administration of the son of man now watch what the son of man Ministry does it's always prophetic and with it is a supernatural discernment You Follow Me Now what so the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman I don't know do you see what I mean see it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us amen now you see take the words of the Lord Jesus in Luke 17 thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed apocalypsis which means take the cover off oh only the elect will be able to look at what God has done in this hour some will look at the veil and make God out of the veil others will look beyond the Veil and know that it's the son of man hiding in humanity well I hope somebody's sharing me this morning and don't just get St stuck on the messenger that God used to initiate the bridegroom call but God wants you and I to realize it's also still ongoing in the sense of us carrying the exact same message of the bridegroom the remember the call is not the Malachi for call it is not the prophet called we're not called to marry the prophet of the age we're not called to marry a pastor come on somebody we're not called to marry some clergyman or some preacher we're called to marry Jesus Christ the son of man Oh my he will come down in human flesh Among Us and make his word notice what he's going to do he he's going to make his words so real he's going to make his word so real that it will unite the church and him as one so he's going to make his word so real in our services in our move and our hearts and our home he is going to make his word so real that it will produce a supernatural uniting time and Son now notice what he's going to do it isn't just going to anoint us to heal the sick it isn't just going to anoint us to have signs and wonders and it will do that but it is going to anoint us on the greatest phase of the bride's Revival and that is it will bring us and him together by making the words so real that within itself produces the uniting time and sign it ain't no wonder to me the devil hates this message it ain't no wonder to me that he wants preachers to stop preaching it and just say well you know now everybody's streaming their services and and we're on YouTube and we're here and there so we can't we can't no longer preach this stuff and I get to a place that I can no longer preach this stuff it's time for me to go off YouTube it's time for me to go off Instagram and all the come on somebody brother it ain't a time to hus preaching it it's a time to Herald it from the rooftop and let people know we're under the administration of the son of man himself Christ Jesus but Brother Don the prophet is gone I agree with that he is gone but Christ Jesus is still here Among Us and he's not just at Word of Life he is around the world getting a bride ready filling her with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and wanting to CP to her and make love to her and doing so if he can get her to harmonize with him and she will see his word under his own personal presence his own personal presence of the anointing of the son of man it will make her one with him and there ain't enough devils in hell that will ever pull her away from that one [Applause] so Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united we go to the wedding supper not the [Music] marriage amen there's people sitting in this building today that are already married to almighty God hallelujah already righty married to almighty God then he quotes part of the scripture there in Revelation fill your flesh of the Mighty Men cuz the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding Supper The Rapture is not us getting married don't you understand the son of man his presence is here it's not just a repeat of Pentecost it's not a repeat of 1906 they did not get the promise of the son of man on Aza street but we did I said we did but after the restoration of the gifts come with a Pentecostal message the Lord Jesus knew it would be so close and so deceiving he couldn't send just a church Angel he couldn't send just a man with a message but he said I've got to go down myself I've got to go Oh Glory I've got to go down myself and take human instrumentality don't let that stumble you if the Lord God could pick up dust out of the earth and step into that dust why would you struggle with God been able to use a human being's body it shows you the power of the blood but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they to become one glory and then when what does it then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man you understand when you and I become one with this word we're still acting out the Fulfillment of the son of man himself because we heard the word and it was so real to us when we heard it we United with him and a bond was made for eternity Oh Glory the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing well Glory so what was this manifestation then of the son of man it was called many different things it was the life son it was the Messianic son it was in one sense the coming of the Lord no one knew that was the minute or the hour that Christ would come as he revealed it to us but you see people were looking for a visible manifestation I'm not saying there wasn't a manifestation there was yeah and it was actually visible amen yes it was look like a head look like a head well praise the Lord look like a head out there in the west oh Hallelujah to God formed the W the Angels formed the wig over the revealed son of man and if you notice whenever the prophet and the voice told him turn it to the right turn it to the right I think I had it to the right turn it to the right and when he did he said there he was Christ in all his glory so the head was there oh my goodness the head appeared there and the angels formed that wig he was glory to God what was he doing look at the way the head was positioned so the head was not looking back up toward Heaven the head was not looking this way or that way but the head was looking down to the Earth what's he looking for it's the son of man Glory the son of man come looking for his bride where are you honey where are you sweetheart where are you he found some of us in the Church of God he found some of us in a barroom he found some of us in a honky Tong but brother there won't be one of them that will be lost because the head come down looking for the [Applause] body proving his word in Los Angeles remember Abraham and his group never received one more sign from God until the promised son arrived how many knows that's true and the congregation said amen yes that sign of discernment and the Royal Seed of Abraham let me tell you thus sayith the Lord you're receiving your last son thank you neither we believe this or we don't this is why I'm not looking for some super preacher I'm not looking for some mega church well don't get quiet on me now according to the words of a Vindicated Prophet we have already received our last son now will we look at Israel of course is that a sign yes but notice that's World signs that's World signs Israel what's going on out here our sign is not Israel so much our sign is not the mark of the beast and the economy of this and that and the other our sign is our husband our sign is our husband that come down with an anointing to anoint us to live this message look friend it's not us trying to live right it's not us trying to make oursel do it it is the anointing of the Lord Jesus himself when he come he release an anointing on this Earth and there ain't enough powers in hell to stop the bride of Christ from manifesting what God ordained her to do thus sayith the Lord you're receiving your last sign that's according to the scriptures and the revelation of God that's in my heart that speaks this is the truth wow again he says look Look what Jesus said oh it just Thrills my soul as it was in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the son of man what did the angel do he had the spirit of discernment and he said as it was then so will it be when the son of man is being revealed from heaven now remember this is not one of the nine gifts of the Spirit Discerning of spirits according to Paul was one of the nine spiritual gifts that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about the son of man the word in human beings think of it in our midst now stands that same angel of God which is none other but the Lord Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Holy Ghost it's in our midst he was God and that was his message just before the destruction came can't you see we need more than just shouting we need more than a return to isusa Street Pentecost look what that produced for them it didn't produce a Rapture for them how in the world can it produce one for us do we believe in restoration of gifts if we believe the word we do but I am not going to Major on a minor and God's Prophet said gifts have to be watched because they're not perfect come on somebody don't get quiet on me I'm not going to try to produce to you some super church somewhere or some super preacher somewhere this is a body move it's going on around the world there are people in India and Africa all over the world that are being united to Christ the word that never heard the name Word of Life Church they never heard the name of some of these preachers around the message but they have heard the bridegroom call which come through what the anointing of the last day to bring us a message not just to come out that's all we preach for years and year come out the denomination come out come out well don't just lead me out lead me in I don't want to be led into another man way group take me under the wings of the son of man himself be not afraid it is ey remember thus saith the Holy Spirit write it in your Bible if something else Rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet cat got y'all's tongue Amen brother T I'll tell you one thing boy I've been scanning the TV and a man I've been looking over here and boy this preacher's got this gift and that got that gift I don't doubt it at all but remember the devil can impersonate every one of them right oh but Brother D I want somebody to tell me my name I've know my name since I was knee high to a grasshopper why do I need somebody else to tell me what my name is oh I want somebody to tell me what I ate for breakfast why I don't know what I ate for breakfast somebody tell me how to get one with God so come on some preachers get in the word get in the word Brothers get in the word tell me what to do tell me how to live tell me how to to be able to live a Godly life that rapturing Faith Can ooze out of my soul Hallelujah that I can love the unlovable I can reach those that seem like they're [Applause] unreachable write it in your Bible if something Rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet that's quite a statement I watch what I say I'm in better listen to this in contact with better than 10 million people around the world so I have to say that and I know I didn't say that myself uh-oh I said uhoh so there's somebody else here doing the talking somebody else here doing the walking well Glory to God we didn't just need a man that could stand up and speak in tongues and somebody interpret it according to the teaching of God's Prophet that's not even to be received by the church until three people with the Discerning of spirits on them has the ability to say that was the Lord that was the Lord come on children there ain't nobody stands before the son of man there ain't nobody that stands before Christ [Applause] Jesus I thank God for his prophet of Malachi 4 but to be honest I needed even more than that I thank God for every Godly holy message preacher that's preaching the truth but Harry I needed more than that I needed the son of man himself you'll never re receive another sign this is it thus saith the Lord would a prophet of God make a statement like that if it wasn't true you're receiving your greatest son and your last son before the appearing of Christ there's only one way that can be true is that the son of man was there in order to answer to the anti type of Abraham and Sarah that's the last sign they saw there might have been streaks across the sky there might have been Thunder there might have been lightning the mean might the moon might have looked pink and the sun might have looked orange everything said oh my there it is yeah oh praise the Lord praise the Lord yeah we look at that too but we've done had our greatest son come on children I'm not believeing any signs that God sent to the Earth but my greatest sign is not Russia oh I know they're talking World War II and they're talking this and that and the other what difference is that matter to me I've already received my greatest son and I have heard from that voice not the voice of a Kian not the voice of an illiterate preacher I heard Christ Jesus the son of man call I didn't hear William brandom I'm not hearing Donnie Reagan I hope you're hearing more than Donnie Reagan today I hope you're hearing more than Tim pro and the rest of these brothers that are preaching I hope you're hearing Jesus Christ calling you to that Oneness with himself lay aside the world lay aside everything that hinders you and become one was Christ Jesus remember I tell you in the name of the Lord if you regard me to be his servant this is the last sign the church will see according to the scripture that was the last thing that Abraham seen done before the promised son arrived Hallelujah and somebody said again spiritual Amnesia this is the last sign remember thus sayith the Lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you are seeing your last son that scripture you've seen your last sign Pentecost now Lance when we were still in it the last sign had done been seen yet we were jumping running shouting screaming holling glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God what it's good to say glory to God but what am I glorying to God for well this is what I'm gloring to God for the son of man has come down in the end time the Lord Jesus borrowed a body a body that he Sanctified by his cleansing blood and was able to use that human anatomy to speak things that only the Lord God himself knew do you think a lot of these things that brother renon preached about was brother Brandon brother Brandon was not a smart man he was not an intellectual man God didn't need an intellectual man all he needed was a body huah was a body then God could speak through that man things that had never been uttered before and by doing so it would form an invisible Union between Christ and the bride and the bride would be so magnetized to him and the devil say say away stay away say away that's a cult that's a cult that's a call and the bride can't help us you just overcome oh oh Hallelujah here I go here I go oh it's a cult it's a cult you imagine that little Eagle down in the barnyard him trying to come up on that Roost pole he taking big long claws and you know kind of set them around that pole tell to set up poor guy I mean he was just rocking back and forth every day didn't hard sleep a wink during the night cuz his body was so big he wasn't made for a pole he made for a tree that's the way we were we was out there in

you Mama that is such a good corn are you kidding me are you kidding me you ought to know some maybe that's the way we used to get our little dab of [Applause] corn but the prophet said when he heard that he said that sounded right it echoed a voice from within him and he looked up there and he saw a being like what he wanted to be brother Paul it's the first time had had ever seen the son of man

get the crck out of our neck by the anointing of the son of man where we can hang up here and say glory to God look what great things are there and there and there and there in the presence of Christ Jesus what am I going to do Mama jump again and the third pull will catch you so here he goes you ready son I think so Mama all right here we go Ephesus samarina pamus 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven lift off

last report is from the h house uh yeah we are here today um uh we we've come to uh uh we've kind of come to interview this uh in- housee church and we understand that someone has went missing and we're here to warn all the rest of the hen houses around be sure and watch all of your people because there's an eagle on the [Applause] loose just want to warn you in case there might be another one sitting here and there and everywhere because there's something about that drawing power of that eagle it mesmerizes them Birds it actually changes their thinking and convinces them they can fly is anybody here convinced today beside me we can not only can we we shall we shall we shall be changed Hallelujah since I was a little boy I've dreamed about flying I'll be 68 in a couple months I've dreamed about it my whole life I don't have a pack on my back I don't have a suit on or respect but I just kind of take off running like this and I'm gone I figure somehow it must be embedded in My DNA maybe that I'm not a chicken after all GL Hallelujah aren't you glad you ain't a chicken after all but it took more than Miracles it took more than signs took the revealing of the son of man this is the LI sign remember thus sayeth the Lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you're seeing your Li sign that's scriptural you've seen your last son Pentecost bride you have seen yours The Living Word don't follow this person that person this move my goodness look at how many moves we have you understand what the issue has been for decades around our message the search for the Messiah is still on cuz people have not recognized who and what the Messiah is it's Christ it's not some preacher it's not some church it's not some great big move it's Christ Jesus Jus and his presence is unrecognized you imagine that little guy when he finally got up off the fence post and he got remember him never flew in his life he didn't know how to fly but he had to trust her he didn't how to bend his wings brother Jack to be able to cup them in order to catch the wind you know Eagle Eagle spends a whole lot more time soaring than he actually does exercising glory to God I'm a Christian Hallelujah I'll tell you one thing I'm that another but he knows how to set his wings brother sister that's where we need to be in this hour setting our wings in the Wind of the anointing of the son of man instead of you and I struggling trying to be this and trying to do that let's just go in the wings and set it in the Wind of the hour and you'll find out it ain't you no more it ain't your faithfulness no more it ain't me it ain't this man it ain't that man it's this son of man up here Jesus Christ CHR the [Applause] word you see but Satan tries to upset the bride with things to keep her from letting Christ being formed in her own being so whether it's Troubles of Life anxieties moves you know around us or this man or that man or this Doctrine or whatever more it's to try to keep Christ from being formed into the stage of maturity in our life we'll pick it up again Galatians 4:19 my little children of whom I travail in birth again I travailed in birth again so it had already happened but some things had attacked the galatian church what was it legalism it couldn't take Christ out of them but Satan found a way to keep the Christ from being formed into the fullness of what God wanted it to be the stature of a perfect man so get them sidetracked on this and get them sidetracked on that and sidetracked on something else so here they throw Paul back into this labor my little children of whom I travail notice he doesn't say Christ but I travail this is what Real Men of God go through they want you to be what Jesus has made you to be I'm not looking for any reganit you don't want to be me why would you settle to be like me when he wants you to be like him yes but Paul said I travail and birth again until Christ be formed in you so as a formless embryo by degrees takes the shape of a human being so the Christian by degrees starts taking the shape and the form of the perfect man and the perfect man is not you it's not me it's not you and I think well we'll get to a place we'll never make another mistake you'll never get to that place in this life the perfect man we're struggling for is not us anyway it's Christ Jesus so Paul sent legalism among the galatian Believers and what it did it reversed their growth in Christ Jesus and then it sent the man of God back into labor pain so he had to go back and and redeal with some of the very fundamental foundations of the faith you why because they listen to things they shouldn't listen to amen but as that embryo when the mother begins to grow and many of you have seen scans of your children and your grandchildren absolutely amazing a few weeks old and have that thumb stuck in its mouth it don't look like a dog or a cat or an airplane or a go-kart is taking on the image of a human being the galatian church had this Christ child being formed in them so he sent this legalism among them what he calls it to regress they would lose part of that imagery then they're fussing and fighting and arguing over who's got the biggest church and who's got the most important Ministry and all that stuff and it throw the man of God right back into this birth cycle again my little children of whom I travail in birth again again children how many times have you thrown me again and again and again but I love you with all of my heart and I am not giving up on you you hear me you hear me I am not giving up on you and don't you give up on me but Brother D I messed up so many times so what else is new so what do men of God do they do like Paul did he goes right back and he trails and if has to start at the Bottom Rung on faith and salvation predestination whatever he's got to do and he'll get them pass up that stage again and then the embryo will start taking on the very image of Christ not your pastor not your Prophet Christ amen till it becomes more and more defined till it starts looking like the Lord Jesus don't you love him let's bow our heads together if you would oh how many wants that in your heart that God can just help you that Christ Jesus can be seen from your soul don't stop at the embryo praise God praise God I got it I got it what you got was the start don't just Rejoice because of the start and then stop but keep growing to the image of the perfect man thank you Lord thank you Lord God so we can love like him we can forgive like like him we can move Beyond grudges we can forgive those that don't even ask us for forgiveness i't talking about just seen on the sick and casting out Devils I'm talking about living and acting and living and believing like Jesus Christ through the revealing of this word how many with me this morning say Lord that's what I want to be that's what I want to be Lord Heavenly Father oh dear Jesus this is what I want to be father help me Lord help me dear God mold me shape me this year Lord I've been preaching for 50 years pastoring for 40 what good does that do to come up to the end of the way and get sidetracked on this or that or the other some of these folks have been Christians for longer than I've been preaching but what good does that do any of us if we don't allow you to finish your work and as it was an impossibility as it seemed for Abraham and Sarah to be turned back to young men or young women this so it may seem that way to us today proving the providential mercy of God the Sarah didn't even believe it anyway a matter of fact your Prophet said she never did finally she received enough strength to conceive because she considered you Faithful but Abraham was way ahead of her but because she was part of Abraham you couldn't leave her out the Lord Jesus is way ahead of us but because we're part of him you can't leave us out thank you Father forgive us for our smirking forgive us of our laughing in the tent forgive us of our Humanity our shortcomings remember us Lord God may become more and more under the influence of what you have done in this day it's no wonder to me that Satan wants people to be so occupied with things of Life they don't listen to tapes no more they don't read books no more they'd rather read Instagram than read the future home they'd rather read Facebook than read the church ages but it ain't going to be Facebook that's going to unite us to the body change it's not going to be Instagram or this or that or the other it'll be us feeding on the word because as we feed on that word we actually become the word yeah somehow that little Eagle had to trust his mama he couldn't trust himself CU he' never flown before he couldn't trust his understanding he didn't understand it or his reasoning he had to trust her imagine as he flew off that fence post and got higher and higher in one way the more scared that he got but he had to believe that she could die faster as Brother David Siler said it here in that awesome sermon he brought to us Lord that that mother Eagle can fly down faster than them babies can fall praise God because they have been clocked at flying down at 200 miles an hour so Lord God you can fly down to rescue me faster than I can hit the ground may we by faith today Lord spread our wings maybe there's some that's sick and they need healing may they spread their wings may they flop Them Wings of Faith to the land of good health yes Lord God just as it happened here last Sunday at the end of the service Lord when you put it on my heart to speak those words to the church Hallelujah Lord several different ones hearing back from them and the anointing fell on their heart and something that had bothered them for years it fell around their feet that that day thank you Lord they walked out of here changed oh Jesus it's great as the discernment was yet looking at it yesterday I found where the Prophet said it several times over there is something greater than the discernment coming something greater than the discernment what was it he said it was the speaking of the word I'm so glad that the full manifestation did not stop with just the discernment since the one you used to discern is not here so before he left you went to the last phas which is not the discernment of a prophet Discerning and telling people this and that and the other but speaking the word most of us don't discern we don't have the ability to discern but Lord God if that word can become alive in our hearts and a son or of daughter of God can take that word and place it on their lips and speak the word it's the same as deity speaking oh Hallelujah May that anointing drop up here this morning Father and they've got a wered son a wavered daughter sickness and disease may they be able to speak to it today in the name of Jesus oh I know what a lot of preachers want some of these preachers want to be the one that'll speak the word so it can bring them all the credit and all the tribute but Lord God I pray you would let that fall in the hearts of mamas daddies maybe some teenagers here today are fighting besetting sins and they can't get the best of it may their word drop in their heart Hallelujah the Bible tells us in the Book of Psalms about Joseph the word of the Lord tried him until his word came so the word of the Lord tried him until his word came and then he took his word and could place it on his lips Lord Jesus no wonder the prophet said the power of God living in us today if we have the Holy Ghost we will call our own bodies from the dust of the Earth We Worship You Jesus We Worship You Lord God we worship you Lord we need you Lord we need you Lord right now [Music] we need you Lord we

God take our bodies as his own thank you Lord Jesus we worship you father come we just raise our hands up into his presence right now what could God do in this place every one of us could lay aside our own thinking our plans for the day for tomorrow just shut the world out our schedules Lord what do you want to do in this service we got a little sister that give her heart to the Lord just a little while back she's been talking to her mom and daddy about wanting to be baptized and we're going to baptize her this morning keep in mind now this might be the last one we'll ever baptize I don't know there could be a million more but this could be the last one the important thing is is that we're ready and we're feeding on the unfailing body word remember what he tells us you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man so as you feed upon that word you're becoming that word oh you say how can that be brother Donnie why do you think the devil is so pushing the social media thing movies games video games look at all this stuff that he's doing pushing it into that realm feed it into people where they feed on it day and night day and night day and night and then they go to acting it out he broke into that understanding that God had a long time ago you become what you feed on constantly oh praise the Lord God bless you Saints I love you and the Lord we sung this course

[Music] I wanna see I'm almost the same and a greater way than ever before Heavenly Father we counted such an honor and a privilege that we could be gathered together in this place once again Lord in your presence for us to be gathered together with each other it's it's an honor and we so enjoy that but if it wasn't any more than that it wouldn't change us forever but when we're gathered in your presence if we will come of the right attitude every time we come we'll get something that'll make us a better person make us Lord Jesus where we can be more like you understand your ways your word your call on our lives fathers we've gathered here tonight we pray that you would just help us anoint us I pray with your spirit open our understanding Lord God to more of you that we that we might stumble in our Humanity help us to look Beyond tradition help us to look beyond what we think about this or that may we look into your word that it may change us more into that image of what you want us to be help us to not father we pray that you've been mindful Lord there's many that are battling different things flu and some with the covet again and various things that are going around but we're just asking you Lord that should be mindful of all of those touch the sick Lord those that have had surgery those that are facing various things in their lives be mindful of them tonight we pray father amen well how are y'all wonderful well praise the Lord and he was less than wonderful some of you well your last and wonderful all right well it's an honor for us to be gathered together you know even whenever we're going through things and facing so much difficulty in things in life where would we be if it wasn't for the Lord and our hearts and lives I said it to you many times I'll probably keep on saying it as long as you'll let me preach to you I don't see how people live without him I don't see how that I know they do I know they do and they think that they've got this great fine wonderful life but I'm so glad I can't even walk without him holding my hand I wouldn't want to live one day without him God bless you let's turn to the Book of Revelation tonight chapter 18 verse 17. and I was supposed to be in Kansas this week supposed to last Monday uh to go hunting but with all the work there is to be done over the church I thought it'd be more beneficial for me to stick around here and do what little bit I can do but brother Andrew Glover was scheduled to be here on Sunday so I thought we'd just let him come on back and be with us anyway so you'll get to hear a good picture on Sunday and a young one too at that God bless you let's read together Revelation 18 17. for in one hour so great riches has come to naught and every shipmaster and all the company and ships and sailors and as many as traded by sea stood afar off and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great City and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas I sent this now what they say alas alas that great City we're in we were made rich and all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness now listen how much of this is tied to her I'm convinced we don't know how much she does for in one hour is she made desolate Rejoice over her wow so some people are crying some are lamenting some are wailing some are just saying alas alas what are we going to do oh what are we going to do but look in verse 20 Rejoice over her thou heaven and you Holy Apostles so we got people on the Earth that's act in one way and we've got people in heaven that's acting another way I guess the question is tonight which are we going to be now once again it proves to us that the people of the earth that are carnal-minded so miss how God thinks about certain things how could one thing that would make people wail and a man can cry and then other people are rejoicing and again it proves to us that when God wants it to be so that he enlightens people in heaven to things that are happening on the Earth I'm sure he doesn't to all sorts of things that we go through but I want you to notice this Rejoice over her thou heaven and you Holy Apostles and Prophets for God hath Avenged you on her so they are to Rejoice because God is getting back at him and God is getting evil with this city This Woman This power that Ruled the Earth may the Lord bless his words you may be seated now for the most part it's hard for us humans whenever we think about revenge or avenge being a vengeful spirit and we know that the word forbids us from being revengeful the word forbids us for wanting to have an attitude to where so and so do something to us we're going to get back at him and if it's the last thing I do I'll take it one thing I'll get back at him well you know the Lord does not want us to have that attitude but yet God can have that attitude and when he does it is so pure and so holy that God considers it to be righteous now for us when we look at it why because the difference is in his being God and us being merely humans that are still contaminated with the things about us that want to get even with people in the wrong attitude but yet notice what a strange thing that this is so this is of course during the time of the tribulation period very very close to the end of it and the heavens are so in tune with what's going on the earth that God actually lets a voice come out of heaven and Heaven is told to Rejoice because explosions Annihilation destruction this city has been destroyed in one hour by an atomic bomb people have lost their wealth they have lost nearly everything that they would own and Heaven is supposed to Rejoice over such a thing how can that be isn't that the wrong Spirit no actually it's not the wrong Spirit but now for most of us if someone would do something bad against us and we would hear that they had a car wreck or say I knew it I knew it they shouldn't have never thought that about me they shouldn't have never said that about me but isn't it amazing though if we have a car wreck the next day that Old Devil I'll tell you what he nearly killed me it died old Devil's after me well how do you know which one was the devil that caused them to have the one and the other God calls them so you see there's still something about our Humanity that is not yet attained to that purity of being able to Revenge the way God can now I'm sure there's nobody here like that tonight but there's some pretty low down people that stream these services so I'm sure that somebody needed to hear this tonight so you goodly Little Darlings you just sat here and and pray for me what I have to deliver this to them sorry outfits that stream in this service and maybe I'll be able to get to the Angelic choir and something that you Little Darlings can Rejoice with ah you know it's amazing because heaven I can't say that I understand how and when the transition is made but as we come to the close of the end time here before going into the Millennium the heavens are commanded by God to start rejoicing and it it synced up with things that are happening on the earth now I believe that heaven is is absolutely in tune to things that are going on on the earth as a matter of fact the prophet tells us that whenever we get ready to leave this world that God will send one of our loved ones down to the river and they will be waiting for us now how do they know that they're in the sixth Dimension God's in the seventh Dimension but they're still communication that goes between the six and the seventh Dimension and the person living here on the earth contacting the Earthly home and yet the father knows they're fixing to cross over so what does he do he sends a message to someone a loved one in the sixth Dimension and they come down from the sixth Dimension wherever they are to where they themselves crossed over at the River Jordan and there they are waiting for that son that daughter that brother that sister whoever it was by a command from God and they are there to welcome them on the other side now I Know that heaven communicates and those use the things that are on the earth the angel of Revelation 18 1 whenever he sound his message of come out of her my people then the voice from heaven in verse 4 echoed and begin to say the same thing from heaven so we know that God is absolutely synchronized with what is happening on the Earth but I'm sure Heaven would not be Heaven if they were aware of all the anxiety and all the trouble how in the world could they enjoy being there in this type of body of theophany if they knew we were still here and we were sick and we were suffering and we were going through all kinds of different things so no doubt the Lord only allows certain things to be conveyed to them and you know brother Brandon would mention it many times I heard it not long ago and there was a man that come up in a prayer line and he had a he had a need in his body but yet the man was not saved and the prophet told him he said your mother has gone on before you and she prayed many prayers for you and tonight they're being answered now God brother M didn't even know the woman but God knew the prayers of this woman and her son had come up for a need and God was answering the Prayer of Salvation now we know that according to the Book of Revelation that the prayers of the Saints are stored up I'm so glad of that they are stored up now you may think God didn't hear you well if there may be a prayer of a mother that had prayed for a son or a daughter that prayer may be stored in a vases which say in heaven for 20 years 25 years 40 years 45 years who knows how long it'll be but God will hear and remember and honor that prayer now here stands this man on the earth and the prophet tells him of the prayer how did he know goes out how did he hear that well that prayer was kept in heaven and God communicated by Vision the prayer that had been stored up and revealing it to the prophet as he's standing on the earth in the realm of the fourth dimension as he's seeing this Vision so it will be something similar to that as we see the end time events now Heaven is so close to being birthed upon the earth now we know that when the bride takes it takes her flight and leaves out of here then there'll be no more blood on the mercy seat for the church ages they will be totally done we know that 144 000 will be called by the overlapping mercy of God that's been given under the dispensation of Esther and the bride and ruse and the bride and God be dealing with sin and sealing twelve thousand out of each tribe but remember it will be such a short span of time as far as Heavenly time is concerned it'll only be three and a half years the that'll be less than that to God so it will be so fast that the events on the earth will be so in tune with what is happening in the heavens that several times during the events that happen the heavens are told to Rejoice now I'm sure that even those of us that are enlightened by the end time message still do not see properly how God views this system which he has spoken so against down through the church ages now remember it's not always necessary to the people that are called inside of there because the voice of God said come out of her my people so it shows everybody in there was not part of their system by Nature they were simply called as it would be an eagle in a cage but they heard the voice of God and they came out of them so keep in mind when you say well this person's a Baptist this is the Catholic this one this and the other well they may be that as of tonight but you have no clue what they'll be this time tomorrow so the spirit of God can be able to reach in there and get them just like he did many of us now once you notice three times Heaven is actually told to rejoice and the first time in the Book of Revelation is actually Revelation 12 12. and that is when Satan is cast down and the second time is in Revelation 18 20 whenever Babylon which is what we just read is going to be destroyed and then the third time is when the marriage of the Lamb is declared which is revelation 19 7. and the men of the earth never have the same point of view as Heaven does you know how blessed you are tonight if you see things the way that God sees them you ought to be one happy individual because most of Humanity on the earth just the other day I read and I saw a picture of the eight billions baby that was born on the Earth imagine the Earth's population has reached 8 billion and they had a picture of this little baby and it had on its little you know its little outfit and it had eight billions written on there eight billion people on the face of their wonder how many out of 8 billion no one little thing about the real truth of the end time message now a lot of them believe in a god a lot of them believe in many gods many of them are polytheistic some of them are monotheistic some of them trinitarians some of them all types of denomination but I wonder how many of them really really know the god of the Bible that is the resurrected Lord Jesus said he's the same yesterday today and forever so here we set tonight not because they're any better not because we deserve it not because there's something great and wonderful about our family or our personality but it's simply one thing God chose you before the foundation of the world that he might be able to share his personal truth with you you're one blessed person tonight so whenever the people on the Earth for the most part they will always be out of synchronization with God just like it was in the days of Noah one man catches the message from God almost everybody else on the face of the Earth was absolutely totally wrong it's been that same scenario over and over again and yet here we said tonight by the grace of God and we are synchronized so in tune with Heaven that one day we will feel a sudden change that will surge through our bodies we won't get a text we won't get a what's that it won't be on Instagram it'll be suffice Instagram will never be able to catch it it'll never be on social media but you will be so in tune with God by your new birth that all of a sudden your sales will start obeying that Great Mighty voice of God and your tissues and your muscles and your bones and all of us sudden the blood will dissipate out of your body because flesh and blood does not inherit the kingdom of God and your gray hairs will go out if you ain't got no hair they'll come back and if you've got false teeth well guess what you're going to get brand new ones and you're going to change in a moment and a twinkling of an eye why because you were praying at that moment nope some of you may not be praying some of you may be asleep some of you may be at work you may be brushing your teeth eating your breakfast and all of a sudden because you are synchronized to Heaven's voice something will begin to happen in you and you're scared to death that you're going to miss it you ain't going to miss it as long as you're synchronized with Heaven how can you miss it you are the very reason that there is a rapture I have no fear of missing the Rapture I never get up one day of my life and say oh no did it happen did it happen why of course not I'm still here I'm still here Immortal and it ain't happened yet when it happens I'm going not possibly not perhaps I am guaranteed why brother Donnie I've got the token in my life he cannot leave me here and I'm synchronized with what he's saying I'm synchronized with what he's doing so when the Rapture transpires I'm going to be synchronized with that but the majority of the earth is always so out of context with what God does what God thinks and what God says that they never know his move until it's way way out and they miss it a million miles oh we're blessed in our church now watch Heaven itself is told to rejoice as these events happen and yet you know I hope you understand this judgment is actually a Vindication of the righteousness of God judgment is a Vindication of the righteousness of God so the voice said Rejoice over her o heaven now while the other people are crying lamenting they're sad they're tore all to pieces but yet Heaven is told to rejoice and now at the same time that this event has happened close to the end of the tribulation period the people on the Earth are lamenting and crying and going honestly hurt and yet the people of the heavens while they're going and enjoying the marriage supper of the Lamb they are interrupted momentarily and they are told to Rejoice well why are they rejoicing because the lamb is there nope because the bride is there nope because the city's been prepared no because Victory is coming to its ultimate goal now again I'm sure that we still don't see this in the way that God does because it was so great that the saints of God God that are now there in their glorified bodies and whatever we'll be doing for three and a half years the Lord God brought that to a halt for a moment and tells us to Rejoice because of something that happened on the earth and it wasn't a virgin birth it wasn't when Jesus got up at the resurrection it wasn't when the Holy Ghost come unto the day of Pentecost that this happened we don't have any record that this happened when Jesus got up from the dead we don't have any record that they were told to rejoice when the Holy Ghost come on Acts chapter one we don't have any record they've won the spirit of God begin to move and the Lord Jesus ascended up into heaven but in this strange when this great city is destroyed and annihilated the people in heaven are told to Rejoice you know what that tells me that tells me we need more understanding of how God is looking forward to this hour of destruction of his greatest enemy that that has been on the earth as far as a government or a system or a move now again I know we say well thank God we're not part of that system and we let it go with that but can you imagine that Heavens are told to Rejoice so this is said now from a voice which is coming from Heaven itself and it calls upon the elect of God which are there in heaven to Rejoice over what they've just been blown away they have just been annihilated by an atomic bomb and the people in heaven are told to Rejoice What A peculiar seeing what a strange thing you see part of our Victory is tied to him being crowned once he consummates all of this when it's going to be put under his feet don't you understand he cannot be brought into being the son of David I was awakened early yesterday morning and I turned over and looked at the clock and it was 503. I lay down I was thinking a little bit praying for different ones it was sick and as I lay there for a few moments the Lord deals with me but sometimes early like that and as I laid there I heard the voice of the Lord say this The Surety of the mercies of David the sure mercies of David the sure mercies of David I knew that that was a scripture but I could not remember exactly what it said but whenever I got up I got on my phone and I began to look at it and I found it in Isaiah and I also found it of course in the book of Acts in the New Testament and it was God a telling of the Covenant which he had made with David and I realized that it was the mercies of God of why actor David did all he did that we've been looking at that God did not blot him out and God so identified it that he called it the sure mercies of David but yet you realize that mercies are not extended to everybody on the earth in that sure way how is it that David did not lose his Covenant now he lost his Joy he lost much of the great things health of his body and things like that because of the sin that he was in but he never lost his Covenant because it was an Everlasting Covenant that God made with him even so identified it and called it the sure mercies of David and when Paul preached about in the book of Acts Paul even quoted that and identified it with the Lord Jesus in the resurrection and placed it as if Jesus was the greater son of David himself and applied that sure mercies of David to the resurrection of our Lord and yet the Lord Jesus cannot become heir to the world until all these enemies are placed under his feet remember what he said in the Psalms he said that he would give him the his enemy for his footstool and that he would Place him under his feet and he promised David of the fruit of thy body well I set upon thy Throne God's saying this of the fruit of of thy body while I set upon thy Throne what the annihilation of this church of this city of this power is one more thing of him coming closer to the Millennium Reign oh how he's been longing for it now can you imagine that he's now going to execute judgment upon them and it's righteous and he said you Holy Apostles and Prophets for God hath Avenged you on her he has judged her with the proper judgment now notice in Revelation 18 24 and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth now this is another reason for her destruction it's not just because of all the money and all the Commerce but in her was found the very blood of the Saints and how was that because she threw her system through her governmental power and control has a and issued the death of many a child of God and because of that I want you to notice what was in her cup when John saw her on the Scarlet colored beast and it was a cut but it had what in it not wine so much but the blood of the saints of God and God is holding her guilty now and now her time has come therefore because she had drunk of that blood it shows by what she is drinking what her Destiny is well if you and I are drinking of the cup of laodicea then I'm afraid our cuff is going to be filled with the Judgment of God as well but if we are drinking of the wine of the stimulation by revelation of the mercy of God guess what your judgment's going to be it's placed over on Christ and you will stand there as being absolutely forgiven in the eyes of God and because of what you're drinking from your cut show us where you are you've got the wine of Revelation in your cut you can't go through the tribulation where are you going in the Rapture because it's been revealed to you by the Holy Ghost and you are waiting on that Revelation and the church said amen so notice that God is now going to avenge upon them so the very beginning of Apostles say I hope you understand this that the prophet said the Catholic Church actually began on the day of Pentecost now he said they were the original Church oh not Peter James and John but those that come out of that and identified themselves as saying they were Apostolic yeah right they're about as Apostolic as I am a groundhog they're not original Apostolic at all is that right no they think they are and they think they got a right to change the Bible but they don't they don't believe what the apostles taught or wrote or preached they don't do it at all but yet they claim that and because they claim it God will judge them for the claim so God says and all that were slain upon the earth now they know as far as individuals they didn't kill everybody but they kill many many of them and at their declaration and their decree they had many of them killed down Through the Ages and we know through this Spanish Inquisition and the Jewish Inquisition many different ones by the Catholic church and they thought they'd got by with it but they haven't gone by with it at all now notice in Revelation 19 1 and after these things notice this after these things what things the thing that we just saw here in revelation 18. after these things I heard a great voice of much people notice what they were doing in heaven I heard a great noise of much people in heaven now notice what these people were doing after these things were done on the earth so here come an atomic bombing and all they did wrong and all these people were weeping and crying and going on the office ever was and after all of that happened on the earth then Sean said I looked up this way and after those things I Heard a Voice of much people praise God Saints you were right there with them I heard voice of much people and this and what they were saying they were saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord Our God so I to the angel had declared the fall of Babylon you imagine this must been pretty important to God because we're all just up our fellowship and enjoying the blessings of God sent around a marriage supper of the lamb and just talking about the goodness of God wow this is a glorious time for us but all of a sudden what we're doing whatever we're doing we hear this voice that said hey Saints Rejoice rejoice and we say okay wow yeah that's what we do we did that on Earth we're really good at Rejoice what are we rejoicing about an atomic bomb just fell on your enemy an atomic bomb just annihilated this Roman Empire an atomic bomb just destroyed it which means your husband is closer to his song this is her glory to God this is just one more saying that brings him closer to his strong why tell my brother died his Millennium Throne as the son of David amen notice so the angel has declared that Babylon has fallen and then our response is supposed to be what we're supposed to Rejoice well don't you see why then whenever we see a brother or sister delivered of a sickness or a disease or maybe an addiction or a habit or something like that what should we as the saints of God do we should rejoice in the Lord shall we not we see a brother or sister of ours that's been bearing a heavy load or a real difficult time in their life and we hear that God's done something for him well brother Donnie it wasn't me you should Rejoice with them because they are your brothers and sisters now Heaven is going to be so moved and Heaven itself is so moved by this destruction on the earth that this voice reverberates down through eternity you imagine down to the universe and back and here they are the millions of saints of God and they are rejoice and because of what they were saved rejoicing because they got the Holy Ghost rejoice and because they were in the rapture sure rejoicing because Rome's been annihilated well see y'all y'all ain't in tune oh okay Rome's going to be destroyed wow Brother Don that's really something that's really something it is really something it is so important to God now and this voice that screams out of heaven and it's the the way that the word that John used here to write is that the the terms in the Greek language so powerful and it's a voice that he's wanting them not just say Amen amen praise the Lord some of y'all get wilder than bucks sometimes in church you do this you're just beside yourself but John said I don't want you to do this I want you to scream Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you mean we're rejoicing because people are destroyed we are rejoicing because this Kingdom has been annihilated yes don't you understand how a heaven looks at such things come on I heard a great voice of much people in heaven so the idolatry city is destroyed the idolatrous government is absolutely annihilated and these people are in such Unison with the will of God and this Universal Joy is all forever there won't be a half a dozen send them here me and brother Joel saying well glory to God hallelujah and then this quiet Baptist section over here they said well packages amen amen that's right glory to God but here come this loud voice and they were worshiping and praising and you know what they're all doing it for said praise God it has been destroyed it has been annihilated all glory to God I don't know about you when I've been healed of the sickness in my body or somebody else that I love has been healed I can Rejoice oh I can praise God when I know somebody's been delivered or something they're going through you know when you imagine when we get there and this happens on on the earth and we are so in sync with God in heaven and what's going on that we will rejoice and say hallelujah don't drag out your handkerchief to cry you ain't going to be crying you're not going to be the Lord so sad it's so sad no it is not sad they had their opportunity and they turned it down remember God is not me and God is Not unjust and God would have never done this had they not spurned his Mercy and his grace amen now look at this the word hallelujah it means praise ye yah praise ye yah j-a-h now remember David was the first one in the Old Testament to mention this name yah and the first time it appears David mentions it when he's talking about the wicked being destroyed on the earth wow so David mentions this word praise ye yah in the Book of Psalms and he's mentioning it when the wicked are going to be annihilated now it's amazing because you come from Psalms and then you come through the Old Testament prophetic books they never mentioned it again Matthew Mark Luke and John don't mention it again Pauline Epistles do not mention it again what does it show up again in the Book of Revelation so this tells me that at the end time there's going to be a people that's going to recognize the kingdom is coming so close it's time to praise ye yah amen so what is it praise ye yah or the better name we know it is Jehovah now the Septuagint and also John takes those Greek words and puts it together like a contraction of the Greek letters and makes it an Alleluia instead of a Hallelujah it is an Allelujah so what is it we praise ye yah now the Psalms are divided into ten sorts of Psalms they say but they say that this word hallelujah is the most perfect one because it is praise and yah in one compact form so when you say hallelujah you are praising yah and David was a praising man now I know we've been laying pretty low in the last couple of weeks but don't leave David in the pit because I'm telling you David ain't in the pit but I want to paint him like he was and then I want to show you how God brought him back out again and all glory and God still extended to him the sure mercies of David isn't that an awesome statement you never find that being called the sheer mercies of Abraham or the sheer mercies of Isaac or the sheer mercies of Jacob but the sure mercies of David so God did not leave him in that spot but God raised him up and brought him out no wonder the man could say praise ye yah praise ye yah because David could see himself as a sinner he could see himself as one that fell away from the Providence of God and the will of God and what did God do he reached right down to that muck and he got a hold to David and he lifted him out oh brother I can imagine he was a shouting man I'm telling you what before that fall but after he got renewed I'd say they had a hard time keeping that guy in church when you he was probably so grateful that God forgive him he was so thankful well I'll tell you I feel kind of the same way tonight I'm so thankful know that God called me I'm so thankful that the Lord called you I'm so thankful that the Lord give us the message of the end time I say praise ye yah praise ye yah I always spend more time praising the Democrats and praising the Republicans praising our sickness well the doctor told me this and the doctor told me that my lumbay going my bursitis and my pneumonia and all this what about your God why don't you quit claiming that old bursitis why don't you cook claiming that old or whatever else you've got in your body and go to praise in your God and you might praise your way right out of that Valley praise your way right out of that trial that you're going through or you can sit around and feel sorry for yourself and never move um all glory well I'll tell you I'm longing for the time when we're going to hear those four alleluias I've heard a lot of hallelujahs in my life I've heard him since I was a little 12 year old boy I didn't know what the word meant I just seen my uncle and them at the church why God saved glory to God my uncle was a shouter he take him feet like that and hold them hands up and go to speaking in tongues I'll tell you what whoa he'd say he'd shout hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Oh yes sir he was I'm looking I'm planning on meeting him too hey yeah you you tell me no matter how low he was if I get the guitar and I'd hit the right key and I'd sing I would not be denied Uncle Harold go to stomping them feet I would not be denied you're going to throwing them hands up on the air and dancing around why because he loved the Lord there's something about that song that Minister turned that he wasn't going to be denied and I don't believe he was neither but you know what I've heard a lot of hallelujahs I've heard them in Africa I've heard him in India I've heard them in Europe not as many in Europe I have heard them in England I hope did hear a few actually in England I've heard of you in Norway I've heard a few there but I ain't never heard them like I'm fixing to hear them before long because I'm going to hear it from a bunch of redeemed people that are going to stand there Hallelujah and glorified bodies no more trouble no more heartache no more sorrow not one more day of a sickness not another migraine not another headache not another belly a not another test not another child not another holiday oh you talking about a group of people all being able to say hallelujah praise you how God is mighty well I'll tell you one thing I'm not going to wait till then I'm going to praise him tonight I want to love him I'm going to give him my all what about you I feel like praising him a little let me tell you one thing several several weeks ago I went over to the church and I was going to lay some Stone I started about eight o'clock that morning and I lay till about 4 30 5 o'clock that afternoon on the concrete floor I couldn't hardly walk whenever I got ready to go to my truck by the time I got ready to get in my bed at that night Carol had to help me into the bed my feet were killing me they were inflamed the plantar fasciitis I've been dealing with oh my goodness I thought Lord what in the world am I going to do but you know what in the last several weeks I've been over four and five days every week sometimes eight and ten hours I was there this morning at 6 30 and been laying Stone been staining been doing this and that and the other on the concrete I think it's time I give him a great big Hallelujah Oh Glory why smooth for me well is anybody else in here got something to praise him for is anybody else in here got something that God's moved for you so many times not because she was worthy not because you was good it's because he's good not because we're good but because he loves us and he loves to manifest himself although she'll bother me a little bit but a little bit's better than a whole lot I'm on my way out oh my goodness I'm probably the only preacher that you know of that's been packing six pairs of shoes in his pickup because I want I wear one pair for a couple of hours and then I trade out and wear another pair and then they'll trade out and want another pair to keep my feet from getting by but I feel pretty good right here tonight you know why because the Lord is healing me now he could have done a miracle if he'd wanted to but apparently said no Donnie I ain't going to give you a miracle this time but I'm going to give you a little dab of healing on Monday and another little dab on Tuesday and another little dab on Wednesday and I'm going to get a little bit more on week one and week two and week three praise the Lord I'm about on week four right now look out devil we five might be my complete Miracle but I'll tell you a friend when we is the saints of God realize who we are well we're going the little things of Life shouldn't even slow us down you understand the trials you go through is a sign of coming judgment to Demons ever test you go sir every trial ever disease that God puts under your feet it's a sign of oncoming judgment to Demons it will not go unpunished no wonder they said Hallelujah after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God verse 3. and again a bunch of Holy Rollers and again they said Hallelujah but notice the next words and her smoke rose up forever and ever wow so these people are praising God and smoke is rising up see we have a hard time with that nobody we have a hard time synchronizing that remember how can we Rejoice over such why do we have that that problem between us we don't see his enemy the way he does again they said Hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever the Greek word there is anyone and anyon which means space of time and space of time not eternal or the devil will no doubt be the longest one that will burn and he may be down there for millions of years hope he gets added another couple million just for what he's put us through don't you just burn his old hide down there all his demons with him but it will eventually come to a time to when all of these people will cease to exist now people call us mean yeah mean and having no mercy because we preach election and predestination and they say they're full of Mercy and preaching eternal hell so a person lived 16 years of their life and they go out and get drunk on their 16th birthday or 17th birthday and they die and they're going to go to a lake of fire and Burn For Eternity for 17 years of sin and then you tell me when God Mercy I say you don't understand Mercy my God is a just God he is not going to judge a 17 year old boy an 18 year old girl for the same amount that he's going to judge the prince of the power of the air that old boy has gone a long time I'm telling you and I'm going to be rejoicing when he gets thrown in ain't you I'm going to Rejoice whenever they lock him up with a chain of circumstance that he ain't got nobody in the Millennium to be able to work through notice them when our hearts really get in tune with God it's not that we look at upon people and say well I'm glad they're going through this and I'm glad we're going to that but we look at it in a higher form in a God form that God is bringing the kingdoms of this world in subjection to his word I know some of you it kills you because you're your party whatever it is your party's not the controlling this and this and that you're wanting your party to make things better it's too far gone it's too far gone I don't care who we get in the White House the White House is doomed our nation is finished come on Saints it's the truth there's no hope for the nation itself but there is hope for individuals there's only one hope for this world and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus now watch this in the 4 and 20 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped wow what a peculiar thing to worship God over people smoke is coming up and you're just having a spell I mean you're just glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord and they just fall down the elders just fall down they say this is awesome this is absolutely wonderful this is tremendous this is great this is a great sign of victory y'all sitting there look at him and trying to figure this out this has been and the throne is right before him cannot take it as long as they rule notice this in the 420 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God said on the throne saying amen Hallelujah in verse 6. and I heard it's a word of voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters any all ever stood at the Niagara Falls and y'all ever sit at great great waterfalls and you hear that sound of all those millions of gallons of water coming over there that that Roar and that splashing and all I've seen some of the large rivers of the world and been in Africa and places like that and to see some of those Falls it's just absolutely breathtaking and each one of those is a drop of water so it's a drop in another drop and another drop in another drop now you take one of those drops out of that that water that's going to come down on the Niagara and you take that one drop and isolate it and let it make it sound you probably wouldn't even hear it you just dropped that little one drop of water and you just try to listen listen when you're nothing but you take it and it's brothers and its uncles and his cousin and his grandma and his nephew and his great grandma and his great nephew and his third grandma and all that sort of thing and you put them all together then what do you get and you're back saying your little voice ain't much well it may not be much to you but to him it's a whole lot but you put yours with yours and yours and yours and yours and mine and then with yours and without one then what does it do and John heard all of these voices as they were thundering down there can you imagine all the saints now in glorified bodies that was Paul that was Luther that was Western that was all the saints of all the ages that was Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all the elect of God and they are told to Rejoice you think they had to be pumped up you think they had to have a service leader in heaven all right everybody let's get into the spirit now let's everybody worship God clap your hands and two of you clap your hands and the rest of you said to her all right let's try it again now we're here tonight to not be Spectators but participator and boy whenever that voice said time to worship they said yes Lord hallelujah all right it's time to worship and it sound like foreign Hallelujah to our God Hallelujah to our god that same enemy that had us bound when we were down on the earth and he set us free now he's broke that hold on the earth we're fixing to go back down there and take the Earth over why what not you rejoice knowing that the Millennium is right before you oh brother sister the whole creation is groaning for that Oh Glory out of herd as it were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters and it's the voice of Mighty thunderings ah mighty thunderings but listen what they was thundering Hallelujah Hallelujah that wasn't thundering a theory or a Doctrine or a church catechism but praise ye yah praise ye yeah you think Heaven is just going to be all of us sitting around debating on the serpent scene you think we're just going to go down this Avenue and you know there'll be two brothers over and they're talking about Serpentine you go down the other Avenue and there'll be two more brothers so they got a different opinion on Serpentine and then you go on the other side of Praise Avenue where it meets The Glory Avenue and there's going to be three more brothers Sam Anderson I'll tell you one thing I don't believe the way he just you you believe it I did no I don't either I know I could say that there ain't going to be none of that there there won't be no arguing boy that'll be Heaven itself won't it that won't be no difference of opinion nobody will ever shun you and you won't you never show nobody nobody will ever speak one word about anybody there because there ain't no bad bodies there there ain't no bad words there there ain't no bad talking there's never be one person ever standing on the streets of gold and gossip about another nobody will ever put their hand over their mouth and Whisper to somebody else and somebody walked down through there and get accomplice because they just knew you was talking about them and actually was talking about the price of Ajax between between the Food City and English and that's it you know how we are with our complexes we see nobody looking to say he was looking right at me oh my goodness when I walk about you watch them put your hand over that you know that's the way come on don't sit there and look at me that's the way we are but we need a new birth not only in our soul but in our bodies our bodies need to be changed oh praise God there'll be no racial problems there there'll be no political parties there there'll be no differences take part the world this will be nobody will ever get hurt nobody will ever get upset nobody will ever get mad boy if I ain't enough to shout about nobody will ever get all bent out of shape and nobody will ever ever be broke down nobody will ever be sad it'll all be praised and worship and love and adoration and Perfection and Eternity and Eternity and more eternity and whenever you think you've come to the end of it you'll find out you've just started and you say how long does it go forever forever it never stops [Applause] oh I just wish we could go tonight man after preaching this stuff tonight I don't want to go to work tomorrow sorry brother say nothing against you oh Hallelujah praise ye yah Hallelujah praise the Lord and they're just worshiping and praising and hell is breaking loose down on the Earth and they're not necessarily praising God that people are annihilated they're not praising God that these people are going through so much trouble they're praising God that the end is so close at hand and their husband is fixing to be the son of David going to be crying cracking Hallelujah the destruction of sin and the destruction of the man of sin you see it will reverberate can you imagine voices like that all the way down Rippling down through eternity to the universe where it ceases to exist if it does and turns and comes back that's what Reverb is reverberation so in every room you have an acoustic now this and you're pretty dead so whenever I cut my hands it's pretty much dead but you're going to a building you can pretty well tell how much Acoustics you got there but you clap your hands in one two three four five and that's how much soundproofing that you're going to have to do can you imagine in heaven when the Acoustics are absolutely perfect and all these millions times millions of voices begin to ring out and they begin to worship and praise and somebody brings out on a course and we'll begin to bless the name of the Lord and sing and all this is going on they say praise the Lord praise the Lord what's going on down in heaven nukes uh watching me y'all y'all are Rejoice him because some people got blowed up no no we're rejoicing because it's one step closer for us and our husband to get back our inheritance praise the Lord now remember they're not doing this out of a vindictive spirit they're not doing this because they're events they seek somebody down there that they didn't lock on Earth and they see somebody that done them wrong oh I knew they'd get it on there they'd get it no that's not their Spirit at all now they're totally changed into his image oh praise the Lord notice verse 2. for true and righteous ah now you see this is why we have a problem true and righteous are his judgments not his Mercy not his grace not his forgiveness but his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication I'd hath Avenge the blood of his servants at her hand and their rejoicing because of that I mean you understand we need help see the calamities that come upon these people are rightly deserved rightly deserved the Hittites the amorites the jebusites all the Canaanite people the seven tribes God did not go in there and drive out a good sincere God loving god-abiding people and give their land to the children of Israel they burned their children they offered their children to moloch to keemosh they've done horrible horrible things and God judged them for it and took their land and gave it to the children of Israel the children of Israel several Generations after that what did they start doing burning their children offering their children to Molech to keemosh and what did God do drive them out and send them to Babylon so it was just judgment so now God is annihilating this enemy oh my for he has judged the great horde Jezebel of course Babylon the romish Antichrist um notice this let me bring it on down now second Thessalonians chapter one verse 6. seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you just a little bit of friendly advice if I was you I'd be good to everybody not just your friends not just your family those that you like now think what Paul said seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that troubled you so persecution is an affliction those who persecute us those who laugh at your hair sisters your dress those that life at the doctrines that we hold on to and hold us dear those who make fun of us and run us down and so on and so on and so on it's not just what they say about us in social media and what they do but it brings a pressure in our spirit it brings a tribulation as it were to our mind what will they do what will they say how will they react now listen what Paul said you see Paul it broke in to this understanding about an aspect of the righteousness of God that as I can tell from looking some of you tonight you're still struggling with Paul only broke into it to recompense tribulation to them that was troubling the saints of God is that God will trouble the troublemakers God will trouble the troublemakers but he will relieve the troubled amen I don't want to be no Troublemaker to you well I mean except for the devil and for hell of course I do want to do that you see your trials are a sign of a coming judgment yeah someone is persecuting you now many times it's people under demonic influence say themselves are not necessarily Wicked or evil but they just get under the influence of an evil spirit and they go to troubling you and harassing you and saying things against you whatever more that it is and it's like something that hangs over you and you just can't get over it you know sometimes it can be somebody you work with sometimes it can be a family member it can be a friend it can be all kinds of people and yet they just it's like they get joy out of trouble you anybody ever deal with anybody like that well sure you have and yet it's something that you try your best to work around you nice to them and you try to do whatever you can do just to calm them and settle them and it seems like nothing that you ever do makes any difference remember most of the time that's an evil spirit that is using that individual don't don't hate them don't get angry and all upset at them just pray for them that God will have mercy on them help them to see that they're just an instrument is all they are but notice what Paul said the same that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you so God will punish punish those who trouble his bride those who ridicule this message those who make fun of God's Prophet oh my goodness God will bring anguish and anxiety and trouble and if they do not repent they will stand before God at the white throne and give an account for every word they have said against this word it's righteous with God to trouble troublemakers sweet Jesus I thought I was in trouble a while ago I'm really in trouble now well that friend this ought to make every one of us not be a troublemaker in her home and our church in the move of God in our business on your job United some people I don't care what you do they are never happy it just seemed like they are born for adversity and I don't care what you do it's just they do they're never happy if you paint if you put Green carpet on the floor they'll say I didn't want green I wanted purple and if you put purple on the floor they say I didn't want that shade of purple I wanted the other shade of purple and if you paint the walls green they wanted Yeller and if you paint it yellow they say I don't like that Yeller I wanted that Yeller I don't want this and I don't like that and it seemed like they're not happy unless they're causing trouble but Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God oh my now Paul is speaking this from experience and where this is written from of course is the city of thessalonica and remember that Paul had been driven from thessalonica by persecution of a bunch of zealous Jews which hated him a mob attacked several of the Saints some of them were arrested the children of God Paul had to sneak out of the city by night so Paul is speaking this from experience I don't believe he was writing in this now I had a vindictiveness I can't wait till God Burns her height and hell I'll tell you one thing he is declaring a decree from God it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you right well you see the word there are trouble is this word philipsis the Greek word philipsis and it means great emotional stress caused by external or internal pressure great emotional and spiritual stress caused by internal or external stress or pressure let's stand for real oh the final destruction of the great enemy of the church was so momentous that God tells them to say hallelujah and they do the great voice out of heaven or smoke starts rising up and they are so happy of what they see happening that they say it again and then the voice of many Waters and then in verse 6 I heard of voices of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reignus they were rejoicing and rejoicing why they saw their King coming closer to his crowd and they rejoiced oh I'll tell you one thing friends I think we ought to Rejoice more and complain less I believe we'd be better off don't you let me read this to you this is the fourth time in which this is uttered in an expressive of the joy of the heavenly host in the view of the overthrow of the enemies of the church and the occasion was so momentous in heaven they just couldn't stop praising they just couldn't stop rejoicing hallelujah hallelujah and then they stopped and somebody else started again well Hallelujah and it was just catching it was just like it was catching and then they kind of calmed down a little bit and they heard another voice say I wish somebody would praise the Lord and somebody said hallelujah hallelujah mama I wish we'd become a little bit more like that you ever get around anybody that you ask them how they're doing and 30 minutes later you wish you hadn't they've got their CT scan on their phone they've got their MRI they've got the brain scan their liver scan the pancreas scan the gallbladder scan they've got to ever scan them and they tell you and you say dear God I wish I hadn't even asked and you whenever have you ever felt worse after being around people like that you ever wow wow so why is that because it creates that kind of an atmosphere well I wonder if we'd be a little bit more contagious with praise and love and worship don't you figure that's kind of contagious too wonder what service to be here Sunday if we come in here and brother Aaron and some of you brothers and some of you sisters and you young sisters you would commend you and say praise God I'm so excited about the service I'm just so happy I'm just so excited oh man can you imagine now people that love football and all these things you know they're going to be buying tickets and they're going to be going out there to freeze to death and they got electric socks and they got electric shawls and electric ear warmers and electric hats and electric electric a lot and it never Struck it boom The Smithereens with it they're sitting out there and they're going to scream and raw raw raw they'll paint their face red and green and black because they want to look like their team and they'll jump up and down the snow will be a flying they'll drink hot chocolate they'll do everything they can why that's their God they love all of that and if they looked at us they'd think them people's crazy they jump up when the preachers preaching and they clap their hands and they say hallelujah what in the world is a matter of some people we're getting a little bit of touch from the other side amen and we've got something to praise him about we've got something to worship him about well I've seen if we would become a little bit more contagious to one another we might rub off on the brother that's having a really hard time or the sister that's going through a little bit of a trial and she come to the house of God and God knew that she needed a little bit more of a tug than maybe what you did you might be responsible for helping them through that wouldn't that be a wonderful thing wouldn't that be a wonderful thing you stand before the Lord that day and say you know what you didn't know it but that day there on Wednesday night there on the Holiday Inn and you come in there and you just made up your mind I'm going to praise him tonight there's three or four of my children standing by you and they were so weary and they watched you raising your hands and it uplifted them and you saying I ain't never done nothing for the kingdom of God when you serve God's bride you serve God say an encouraging word say a prayer be kind to someone you just help Jesus how many of you would like to be in here when the Lord Jesus was here and if Jesus was carrying that cross wouldn't you like to bend like the man that come up there and bore his cross wouldn't that been wouldn't that been an opportunity a privilege in the blood of Jesus on that cross God on your back and God on your face and maybe you're Jesus rubbed faces and the blood of Jesus you got down off of there and you looked and there was the blood of Jesus you said oh my Lord the blood of Jesus he said oh what an honor you'd never want to wash your face again you'd never want to wash your hands again or if I'd have been there by the time I'd love to give him a drink you can give somebody in his body one if you give one of my disciples a drink of water you ought to know why a solution hey we're not talking about just preachers don't look out preachers you can be kind to be kind to anybody in the body Paul said especially the household of faith I like to say kind words to people in the Drive-Thru especially when they get my order wrong which is just about every time so I just do what I tell y'all do just go and give me what you want to you will anyhow but you realize a kind word a kind word I come through one not long ago and I'd ordered whatever it was and I pulled up to the window the God said you order so and so and so I said no I sure didn't I ordered a pumpkin sandwich and I ordered I mean I went through a bunch of stuff and that guy busted out of life and I'll come through there in a couple days and he said you want that pumpkin sandwich again now you see it made him laugh it made some of you life and you've been sitting the Earth's hours on the water all night long you never know what a kind word can do to somebody have we got enough goodness to spread it out have we got enough joy to kind of just spread it out if you ain't got enough tonight this is a good place to get filled with it don't you love him with all your heart the spirits together Heavenly Father we love you so much we thank you for your word Lord I'll be the first to admit Lord God I need your help too looking at these things in my Humanity Lord I I would have a hard time being able to differentiate

believe with all of my heart there are people here in this place tonight and many many hundreds of thousands of more that will hear this service that will be some of the voices that will ring out in

[music] Hallelujah. Amen. And is that your heart's desire that you would just see the Lord this weekend? [music] And maybe you've come with a need or an expectation or maybe you don't have an expectation at all. Well, that happens. I mean, I I've come to church many times. You've been busy and you're running and you're going and you come to church and they sing the songs and before you know it, you just the word's coming forth. But maybe as we start &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh before the minister in the word, maybe we'll just allow a an opportunity to start forming an expectation [music] in your heart and maybe a need that you have in your life for yourself or for a family member, a brother, sister, maybe somebody in the church. I believe God can meet that need and I believe the Holy Spirit can just come in a supernatural way [music] and that the word can come forth and faith can rise up and bring forth the manifestation of the promise. Maybe as we just have the musicians, why don't we just go before the Lord in prayer? Lord Jesus, Lord, we're thankful that we could be here this evening. Lord, it's all that it's all by your grace and your mercy that Lord, you've called us and you've elected us. Lord, you've called us out from the things of the world and to this great glorious truth that we've received in this [music] last day. Lord, we just pray that this meeting here tonight, Lord, you'd just come. [music] And Lord, we have some scriptures and some quotes that are put down. But Lord, if you don't come by, then what would be the benefit? So Lord, I [music] just ask that you would come and you'd break the bread of life. And Lord, you distribute it to the needs that are represented here. And Lord, may in our heart we just start to form an expectation. Lord, may Lord, may there be ones that are in bondage set [music] free. And Lord, may where ones that need the revelation, Lord, may revelation break forth. And those that need to be born again and filled with the Holy Spirit. Oh God, may your mercy and your grace just go to each one, Lord, as only you can. Lord, we just surrender ourselves to you that you could just come just have your perfect will and way in the service now. In your name, the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of numbers. I just want to thank brother Donnie and brother Joe for the invitation to be able to come and to be in fellowship with you. It's uh certainly a great privilege and opportunity. We don't take it take it lightly. My name's Brother Matthew McGary and I'm from Bedford, Texas. My dad, brother David McGary, is the pastor there at Christian Life Tabernacle. So, we bring your greetings and we're just excited for what the Lord would have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't be afraid to talk back. I'm going to be preaching at you. So, don't don't be afraid to let me know that you're here. But, um, we just have maybe a little something on our heart. Don't know what the direction we might go, but just want it to be a benefit to you. Is everybody feeling good this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure some of you have tired. Maybe you you drove a little bit away, maybe not, but we'll just move right into the word just to appreciate this. Numbers chapter 13 and verse 23- 27 says, \"And they came under the brook of Eshkll and cut down from then a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff, and they brought up the pomegranates and the figs, the and the place was called the brook of Eshkll, because of the clusters of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thins. And they returned from searching of the land for 40 days. And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Piran and Kadesh, and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. And they told them And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whether thou sentest us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it. And also if you just turn in your Bibles to Galatians chapter 3 just reading here out of Galatians chapter 3 and verse 29 it says and if you be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. Amen. You may be seated. If you be Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. And I was just listening to a sermon Brother Brandon preached. It's called the conflict between God and Satan. And he says, \"And the other night I was preaching. I believe it was the tabernacle. And I struck something that's done me more good than anything I've thought of since I've been converted.\" And I might repeat it again if it's all right. I know where you know where I'm going to. But it was that evidence of salvation. And I thought, my if here's the prophet preaching in 1962 and he says he struck a thought uh that that did him done him more good than than his conversion. I thought my I want to know a little bit about that, too. I'd like to look into this and see maybe maybe what he was talking about. And he starts to to to to show this how it was on the evidence of salvation. You know, as I thought about that, I I just thought I would ask, you know, what does salvation mean to you? &gt;&gt; You know, what is even the word salvation when when it when it's said, what does it mean to you? You know, h have you experienced it? you know, and and that's just kind of the way life is, you know, is is maybe uh there might be certain places if you drive around town and you go to certain places and and they might not mean anything to you, but somebody else they might have had an experience there or maybe uh they were proposed to or or something would have happened and maybe there's certain church grounds or certain camps and where you where you met the Lord and and or maybe there's a certain place that becomes really special to you because it has meaning and it it has it has some value to you and So when you when you hear it, you know, you maybe you perk up or you you know, you recognize it like, \"Oh, I know a little bit about that.\" You know, that's how it is with certain hobbies and things, you know, uh you can start talking about hunting and and and you know, there's some people who go hunting and there's some people who are hunters and and you can just get to talking a little bit and somebody can say, \"Well, I I bought a gun and I go out in the woods and and that's about as far as they can talk about hunting.\" And then you talk to some other people who my they can just start talking in such a way that it's Greek to you, you know, like I don't even know what you're talking about. I I just I I get a gun and I go out and make a loud noise and and I never shoot anything. Well, maybe that's cuz you're not a hunter. But, you know, that's just the way it is. You could even think about maybe dates and I I was thinking about that, you know, is, you know, October 20th. I mean, does [clears throat] does that mean anything to anybody? October 20th, you know, does somebody in here? Maybe maybe 200 October 20th, 2007. YOU CAN START TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN DATES AND AND THAT MIGHT mean something to you cuz maybe it's your birthday or maybe somebody was born on that day and and and so your ears will perk up and and and you you know it might it might cause an expression and you know I was thinking about that and the other day I was on the phone and I I I was talking and I said I'll be there in six seven minutes and and all a sudden my kids you know they just I'm like what what did I say? What did I say? And it's it's just amazing now that there's some you can just say a couple NUMBERS AND PEOPLE LIKE WOW WOW YOU KNOW my because because it's some type of thing that that people are their ears are perked up to and and and it causes some type of REACTION AND AND I wonder though when WE WAS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SALVATION &gt;&gt; WOULD would you perk UP? WOULD IF SOMEBODY SAID SALVATION or the message of the HOUR WOULD WOULD ALL A SUDDEN YOU SAY HEY WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? I WANT TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. But but but but MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE WE DON'T HAVE THE VALUE THAT it should have and and maybe it doesn't have the meaning that it should have. And and HERE THE PROPHET IS TALKING ABOUT THE EVIDENCE OF SALVATION. And and I say it ought to mean something to you. I I I say, \"What about the grace and the mercy of God?\" AND WHAT ABOUT SALVATION? &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, \"I I THINK THAT SALVATION is the greatest miracle.\" G. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'd want to by the help of God just talk to you a little bit this evening is the evidence of salvation. &gt;&gt; He goes on in this message. He says, \"It struck me and I and I and I I said I went home and I got in my room and I I I walked up and down the floor and I I just had a little good old time by myself, you know, just in there thinking about it.\" You know, we could preach a little bit right there for a little bit. Has has the preacher ever been preaching or have you ever been read reading your Bible or have you ever been listening to the message and the word struck you in such a way that you got excited about it? &gt;&gt; Now look, I'm not here to condemn. I I'm here to encourage you. If that has not happened in your life, I just want to say you're missing out. You you can read about who won the World Series and who won the Super Bowl and you can read the news and you can study this career and you can study that and I tell YOU ALL THOSE THINGS are going to burn. They're they're they're going to just be BURNING ATOMIC FIRE. BUT I want to tell you there's one thing that won't pass away and that is the WORD OF GOD. AND I WANT TO SAY IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORTH GETTING EXCITED ABOUT, I WANT TO SAY IT'S about the grace OF GOD. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORTH TALKING ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT SALVATION. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORTH TALKING ABOUT, IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND I SAY, \"OH, GOD, HELP ME THAT SOMETHING IN THE WORD OF GOD WOULD STRIKE MY HEART IN SUCH A WAY THAT I COULD GO HOME AND I WOULD PACE BACK UP INTO THE FLOOR SAY,\"LORD, I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. I HEARD MY PASTOR PREACHING ON THE SUBJECT AND AND MAYBE I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT ALL, LORD, BUT SOMETHING IN MY SOUL WANTS TO KNOW MORE. I WANT TO HAVE SOME MORE REVELATION, LORD. I I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR GRACE AND YOUR MERCY, LORD. I I WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR WORD MORE.\" I SAY SOMETHING OUGHT TO STIR OUR HEARTS. SOMETHING OUGHT TO MAKE US SAY, \"I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT.\" BUT IT'S SO EASY TO GET STIRRED UP WITH THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; So easy to get STIRRED UP WITH OUR JOBS AND WHAT FRIENDS THINK AND WHAT PEOPLE SAY. &gt;&gt; But just to think here he is. He's he HE'S WALKING UP AND PACING BACK AND FORTH on the floor and and here's what it was. I MIGHT PASS THIS ON to you for just a minute. I was talking about we are possessors of all things. Everything is ours. &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. Glory to God. That ought to be enough right there to make somebody shout to think that if we are heirs of Christ, then we are heirs to all things. LOOK, YOU YOU YOU MIGHT NOT EVER BE ABLE TO GO TO ITALY ON THIS SIDE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO EVER GO OVER HERE, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU OWN IT. IT'S YOURS. YOU MIGHT DRIVE DOWN. I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TO TO JOHNSON CITY. THIS is a pretty place, brother Don. I TELL YOU WHAT, I GOT HERE AND I WAS FLYING IN. I WAS LOOKING AT THE HILLS and the trees and everything. I WAS LIKE, \"MY MY, THEY DONE FIGURED IT OUT. THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE. JUST JUST BEAUTIFUL. AND YOU MIGHT DRIVE AROUND. YOU MIGHT SEE BIG HOMES UP ON THE HILLS. I WAS I WAS COMING FROM THE AIRPORT AND THERE'S SOME BIG OLD HOUSE UP ON THE HILL AND IT WAS ALL MOWED AND ALL THE TREES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THE COWS WERE EVERYTHING. MAN, MY THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE. WOULDN'T IT BE SOMETHING TO LIVE UP THERE? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S MINE. &gt;&gt; I own it. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, BROTHER? BECAUSE I'M HEIR TO EVERYTHING. YOU SEE, SO MANY TIMES WE WE JUST GET SO CAUGHT UP WITH THE NATURAL THINGS AND THE RAT run uh the RAT RACE OF SOCIETY. WE GET SO BOGGED DOWN AND WE FORGET THE BENEFITS AND THE BLESSINGS THAT WERE BENEFICIARIES OF HIS RESURRECTION. [applause] &gt;&gt; WE POSSESS ALL THINGS. AND THE PROPHET WOULD GO ON AND SAY THAT'S WHY THEY CALL US CRAZY, you know, and and and because we we act funny. WHY? BECAUSE WE POSSESS ALL THINGS. WE POSSESS love and joy and peace. I DON'T KNOW. DOES ANYBODY NEED SOME JOY TONIGHT? DOES ANYBODY NEED SOME PEACE? WELL, YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO WALMART and and go out to the clerk THERE AND SAY, \"HEY, I I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU. I I JUST COME DOWN HERE. I'VE GONE UP ALL AND DOWN THE AISLES AND I WAS TRYING TO FIND ME SOME JOY.\" They would, \"Excuse me, what are YOU WHAT ARE YOU TALKING? I NEED SOME JOY.\" YOU KNOW, LIKE THE JOY OF YOUR SALVATION. THEY WOULD LOOK AT YOU FUNNY. &gt;&gt; You say, \"Well, ACTUALLY, I'M HERE TO BUY SOME LOVE OR I'M HERE TO BUY SOME PEACE.\" YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO THE GROCERY STORE. YOU CAN'T GO TO THE PHARMACY AND YOU CAN'T BUY TELL YOU WHAT, THE DEVIL GOTS A LOT OF SUBSTITUTES. And I want TO TELL YOU, IF YOU GOT INTO SOME TYPE OF ADDICTION AND YOU GOT SOME TYPE OF MEDICINE THE DOCTORS PRESCRIBED TO YOU, WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. BUT I WOULD TELL YOU, WHY DON'T YOU PRAY FOR A REVELATION? AND I TELL YOU, THE WORD CAN COME IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU CAN THROW THAT MEDICINE AWAY AND SAY, \"I AIN'T GOT TO GO DOWN TO THE PHARMACY ANYMORE FOR MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, FOR MY DEPRESSION, WHATEVER IT IS.\" WHY? BECAUSE I'M HEIR TO ALL THINGS. I own joy. I own peace. I OWN LONGSUFFERING. I'M A CHILD OF THE KING. AND IT'S ALL MINE. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; SEE, all of those things ARE ALL ALREADY OURS. YOU YOU CAN'T GO DOWN TO THE STORE and buy it, but God gives us that. &gt;&gt; We possess it. That's our possession. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. And and we're JUST FOLLOWING A LITTLE THOUGHT HERE. OUR BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE'S IN THIS MESSAGE, THE CONFLICT between God and Satan. And and I believe he's referencing uh what he preaches earlier that month at the tabernacle uh possessing all things. And he says, \"YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT OUR INHERITANCE.\" And and he got to thinking about Israel and how they were in bondage. And here Israel's in bondage for 400 years. And and and my I can't you can't even imagine uh those task masters and and how they beat them. And and my they they they maybe killed you if you if you weren't working the way they wanted and they kill your children or take your daughters. And here they're THEY'VE BEEN IN BONDAGE FOR 400 YEARS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HERE COMES A PROPHET COMING OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND HE'S TELLING THEM, \"HEY, HEY, HEY, I GOD GIVE A PROMISE AND WE'RE GOING TO A PROMISED LAND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN BONDAGE ANYMORE.\" &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. HERE HE COME OUT OF THERE AND HE'S TELLING THEM, \"LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE MUD PITS ANYMORE AND AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THESE TAX MASTERS ANYMORE CUZ THE TIME HAS COME THAT THAT GOD IS GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS BONDAGE.\" WELL, I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN FIND THAT AND LOOK INTO THE BIBLE. BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED TO UPDATE THE BIBLE EXPERIENCES INTO OUR OWN LIFE AND START TO LOOK, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'VE HAD A TASKMASTER. MAYBE SOMETHING'S BEEN RULING AND REIGNING OVER MY LIFE AND AND MAYBE I'VE BEEN DOING THINGS THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO AND AND I COME TO CHURCH AND I GO TO CAMP AND I HAVE AN EXPERIENCE AND THEN I GO BACK AWAY AND I FALL TO THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER AND OVER. WELL, I WANT TO TELL YOU, SOMETIMES WE MAKE MISTAKES AND SOMETIMES WE FALL. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, IF YOU'RE IN BONDAGE TO THAT THING AND IT'S RULING AND REIGNING IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER YOUR BODY AND OVER YOUR VESSEL, LOOK, WE ARE TO POSSESS OUR VESSELS AND SANCTIFICATION AND HONOR. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN DO THAT, AND THAT'S BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND IF YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN BONDAGE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW TO THAT LUST DEVIL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW TO THOSE SPIRITS. YOU CAN BE SET FREE AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND SHOUT THE VICTORY. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; OH, AND HERE'S THE MESSAGE COMING FORTH. LOOK, YOU DON'T YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE THAT WAY ANYMORE. The prophet of God would say this. He says uh but now they they they're told they're COMING OUT OF THIS BONDAGE AND AND AND THEY'RE GOING UH THEY'RE going to a land that flowth with milk and honey, and they can have their own farm. they they can raise their OWN STUFF AND AND feed their own children and send them to school and live in peace and and this GREAT LAND THAT BELONGS TO THEM, YOU KNOW, TO TO THEM. WHAT WHAT A GREAT PROMISE. THINK OF WHAT THAT MEANT. &gt;&gt; WELL, once again, why don't we bring it up to our day? &gt;&gt; God's Hey, God's given us great and precious promises &gt;&gt; that by these we might be partakers of divine nature. A and if we're not careful, WE SELL OURSELVES SHORT OF WHAT CHRIST DIED FOR. THAT THE VERY LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST COULD COME BACK AND IN TABERNACLE YOUR BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LOOK, I I have it right here. I I I GUESS THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT OUT. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, \"AND AS THE FATHER HAS SENT ME, SO SEND YOU.\" JESUS SEE. NOW WATCH. THE FATHER THAT SENT HIM went in him to vindicate himself. Right? For he was THE WORD. AND THE SAME JESUS THAT SENT YOU GOES WITH you and in you TO VINDICATE THE SAME GOD. AS THE FATHER HAS SENT ME, I live by the father, so I send you AND YOU LIVE BY ME. WHAT IS HE? HE IS THE WORD AND YOU LIVE BY THE WORD. LOOK, THE THE GOD DID NOT SEND A MESSAGE BY A VINDICATED PROPHET. SO IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD NEVER OBTAIN AND IT'S JUST SOME MESSAGE AND SOME GREAT PROPHET AND HE DID THE GREATER WORKS AND YOU CAN NEVER SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN AND YOU CAN NEVER GET THE TOTAL VICTORY AND YOU CAN NEVER COME TO THESE PLACES AND YOU'RE ALWAYS JUST TRYING AND YOU'RE ALWAYS FALLING SHORT AND AND YOU'RE ALWAYS JUST HOPING AND AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT EVERYBODY ELSE AND WHY ARE THEY SO GOOD AND WHY ARE THEY SUCH A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND WHY I'M ALWAYS HAVING PROBLEMS. LOOK, THIS MESSAGE CAME TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE HEIR TO EVERYTHING. AND JUST AS THE PROPHET OF GOD WAS ABLE TO LIVE A OVERCOMING, VICTORIOUS LIFE. LOOK, I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE TO MATURITY, SHOWING US THIS MESSAGE WORKS. &gt;&gt; HEY, THIS MESSAGE WORKS. I TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU EVER COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND YOU CONFESS YOUR SINS AND SAY, \"LORD, I AM SORRY. PLEASE FORGIVE ME.\" I TELL YOU, THERE'S A GUSHER FROM HEAVEN THAT'LL COME DOWN. IT'LL CHANGE THE WAY YOU ACT. IT'LL CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR NATURE. IT WILL FILL YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND THEREFORE, IT'S NO MORE I THAT LIVETH. IT IS CHRIST THAT LIVETH IN ME. AND THE VERY CHRIST ANOINTING IN MY LIFE IS FULFILLING THE VERY SPOKEN WORD OF THE HOUR. IT AIN'T SOMETHING THAT A MAN CAN DO. IT AIN'T SOMETHING THAT I CAN THINK OF OR SOMETHING THAT I CAN MUSTER. LOOK, IT GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU SURRENDER TO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Today is the day of salvation. &gt;&gt; What about it, young people? Hey, tonight's a new night. &gt;&gt; YESTERDAY'S GONE AND THE OTHER CAMPS, THEY'RE ALL GONE. BUT TONIGHT'S A NEW NIGHT. &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE SALVATION of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I say like THEM LEPERS SAY, \"WHY SIT YE HERE UNTIL YOU DIE?\" &gt;&gt; You got a need. You got something YOU HAVE NEED OF. LOOK, UH UH GET GET RID OF YOUR PRIDE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBOR. THERE IS SOMETHING here for you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S MORE HOLY GHOST. THERE'S MORE LIBERTY. THERE'S MORE FREEDOM. THERE'S MORE REVELATION. &gt;&gt; WELL, all right. &gt;&gt; So, we're just in THIS STORY HERE HOW HE BRINGS THEM THIS GREAT PROMISE and what that must have meant to them. And then we KNOW HOW GOD BROUGHT THEM OUT BY A MIGHTY HAND WITH ALL THE PLAGUES and and THEN THEY WERE BACKED UP THERE AT AT THE RED SEA AND and my we just we just moved through so MANY THINGS THAT YOU COULD TAP INTO THERE. BUT GOD BRINGS THEM OUT AND I WANT TO GET DOWN TO WHERE OUR TEXT WAS AND WHERE WHERE NOW BROTHER BRANDHAM'S referring to Joshua AND CALEB AND THE SPIES GOING OVER. HE SAYS, \"AND JOSHUA WENT OVER INTO THE promised land.\" Now remember, none of them had ever been there. They didn't know whether the land was actually there or not. They just by faith went by what was told them that God had a place for them and they was going to that place just by faith. Now think of that. left Egypt and God brought them out and now they're nearing that land. And when they get near the land, Joshua goes over into the land and brings back the evidence. &gt;&gt; CROSSES JORDAN, GOES OVER INTO PALESTINE, BRINGS BACK THE EVIDENCE. A GREAT BUNCH OF GRAPES THAT TAKEN TWO MEN TO PACK AND THEY could eat those grapes. And he said, \"THE LAND IS JUST EXACTLY what God said it was.\" &gt;&gt; SO HERE'S JOSHUA AND CALEB. THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH THE FRUIT. THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH THE EVIDENCE. THEY ACTUALLY have proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're like, \"Well, brother, yeah. What so what do you what does that even mean, brother Matthew?\" You know, I was kind of thinking about that. You know, sometimes I'll take my kids to an ice cream shop. You know, you go in there and they got all the flavors and everything like that. Little Evan, you know, six years old, he I want that one. Okay. You want the mocha frappuccino chocolate chip chunk special? Yeah, I want that one. Like, all right. Can Can we get a sample of that? And we get a little sample, right? And I give it to him. And he puts that and he tastes he goes, \"Yeah, I want that one.\" I say, \"Okay, son. You can have that one.\" You know what? what he starts doing. He starts jumping. HE STARTS GETTING EXCITED. HE STARTS TELLING HIS SISTERS. &gt;&gt; He He ain't worried about how much it cost. &gt;&gt; He He ain't worried of how long it took to make it. &gt;&gt; He He HE HE DON'T CARE BECAUSE HIS DADDY, his father said, \"Son, you can have it.\" &gt;&gt; AND NOW ALL HE'S ACTUALLY DONE IS HE'S JUST TASTED A LITTLE SPOONFUL. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE STARTS DOING? JUST HEAD. I I'M GOING TO GET ME SOME ICE CREAM. MY THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY DOES HE GET SO EXCITED? CUZ HE KNOWS THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; WELL, COME ON, CHILDREN OF GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF EXPERIENCE. I don't know WHAT KIND OF BLESSING, BUT I KNOW THAT JESUS CHRIST IS HERE AND YOU CAN HAVE AN EXPERIENCE. AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S JUST A LITTLE TASTE. IT'S JUST A LITTLE DOWN PAYMENT. COME ON. AND IF HEY, IF IF WE CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT ICE CREAM, HOW MUCH MORE CAN WE GET EXCITED ABOUT THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD? IF YOU'VE EVER COME INTO HIS PRESENCE, IF YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED THE GRACE OF GOD COMING INTO THE CHURCH AND WALKING UP AND DOWN THE AISLES AND IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED HIS BLESSING, OH, THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT RAISES UP ON THE ON THE INSIDE OF YOU SAYS, \"HEY, THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.\" I SERVE A A GOD THAT OWNS A CATTLE ON A THOUSAND EELS AND I'VE JUST GOT A LITTLE BITTY TASTE, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. OH, &gt;&gt; he he got the evidence. &gt;&gt; You know, he when he tasted that, it was evidence. SEE, YOU YOU CAN TRY to look at something and just just think, well, yeah, it it looks good. But my Bible says, \"Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.\" &gt;&gt; You know, so when you when you look at those things and and here in our text is where we're at. He says, \"AND WE CAME UNDER THE LAND WHETHER WHETHER thou sentest us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it.\" You know, I don't know about you, but I remember maybe as a kid thinking about that. I'm like, a land flowing with milk and honey? Like, does it have like rivers of milk &gt;&gt; and are like the trees dripping like with honey? You know, and I I'm like, what what does that even mean? And and I was thinking about that and I thought, you know what? Because when you hear something in the word of God or you hear something in that, what do you start to do? You try to make a mental image or you try to interpret the word &gt;&gt; a land that maybe there's a lot of cows and bees &gt;&gt; because you're trying to understand or interpret, you know, you start to THINK ABOUT AND I AND I I I GOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT. AND I said, \"You know, there's this thing called now chat, GPT, whatever.\" &gt;&gt; And and I and I put in the description, and sure enough, it painted a beautiful picture with some big old mountains. And here come right out of one mountain, a big river of milk. And here come out of the other mountain, a big river of honey. Because what was it? It was it was an intellectual conception of what the word promise meant. And I want to tell you, IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL, we start to accept an explanation. We start to expect accept an idea or we read something there and there and if we're not careful, we accept some definition as the revelation and we never actually experience the true promise or the benefit of it. &gt;&gt; Look, we live in an age where everything can be altered and everything can be edited and and I mean now they making things, you know, pictures you don't even know if it's real or not. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You say, \"Look at this, man. Isn't this No, no, no. That's AI.\" &gt;&gt; You know, I I was I was up in Montana and and uh you know, we were just blessed to be coming around this this bin. I was able to take this shot just perfect cuz there's this big uh uh uh uh ram just with the horns and everything. And and the way I was able to take the picture, I mean, it should be long in a magazine. I showed it to people like that. You Oh, that's AI. You didn't take that. And I'm like, \"Well, actually, I I'll show you the video.\" And it just so happened this thing wandered right into a guest parking area and and I didn't have to go and do anything. I just pulled up the car and got out and took the picture. But some people didn't even believe me like, \"Oh, that that's AI. It's fabricated.\" I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL THE THINGS THAT YOU FEED on and the things you look at and and the things that you start thinking that's true and that's obtainable. And you know, I was just here. It just reminds me. I was just here at a coffee shop uh uh uh yesterday and and there was this young man in the shop and I got to talking to him a little bit and about the Lord and he was a a young Christian and he he was actually going to be doing a podcast. He was going to be doing a podcast on on uh uh uh comparing yourself and and and you know and I just got to think just talking to him a little bit about that, you know, and and and how uh uh he was just talking about how you get online and and you get on these these social medias and everything like that and it it's all fake. It's all edited AND IT'S JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS of people's LIFE AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU GET ON THERE AND YOU START FEEDING on that stuff, it's an unrealistic expectation of things that you can never obtain. And then you get on THERE AND ALL A SUDDEN YOU GET A SPIRIT OF LUST ON YOU BECAUSE you're lusting after all these things that are they're fake and edited. And I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, LOOK, EVERYTHING THE DEVIL HAS TO offer is fake. LOOK, I'VE BEEN OUT there in the world and I've ran after the things of the world. AND I WAS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD FOR A LONG TIME. AND AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, EVERYTHING THAT THE DEVIL HAD TO OFFER ME WAS JUST A FAKE. IT WAS JUST A BOGUS. THERE WAS NO LIFE. IT WAS JUST DEATH. THERE WAS NO DRUGS. THERE WAS NO ALCOHOL. THERE WAS NOTHING OUT THERE THAT COULD EVER FILL UH THAT VOID AND THAT HUNGER ON THE INSIDE OF ME. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REAL. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, IT AIN'T OUT IN THE WORLD. IT AIN'T ON SOME WEBSITE. IT AIN'T SOME BOY. IT AIN'T SOME GIRL. IT AIN'T SOME CAREER. IT AIN'T SOME JOB. IT AIN'T SOME BIG HOUSE. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT'LL EVER FILL THAT VOID INSIDE OF YOUR HEART. THAT'S THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST TO YOU PERSONALLY. THAT THIS MESSAGE IS THE ONLY SALVATION IN THE END TIME. I WANT TO TELL YOU, LOOK, I I I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY OUT OF HERE. I KNOW GOD SENT A VINDICATED PROPHET JUST LIKE HE SAID NOAH. AND IF YOU WANT TO GO IN THE RAPTURE, YOU BETTER GET ON THE BOAT. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING ELSE IS SINKING. SAID, I TRIED IT OUT THERE. I WENT OUT THERE. I WANT TO TELL YOU, OH, AND NOTHING OUT THERE CAN COMPARE. &gt;&gt; AND I LIKE TO SAY THIS, MY BEST day as a sinner &gt;&gt; is worse than my worst day as a Christian. Oh, I like saying that. &gt;&gt; Oh, because when you get some evidence in your life, &gt;&gt; I started telling this young man, I was like, \"Look, we're not we don't we don't compare ourselves to the world.\" I said, \"We actually are supposed to compare oursel to the word.\" &gt;&gt; I said, \"The scripture said, let this mind BE IN YOU, WHICH WAS ALSO in Christ Jesus, who thought it not robbery TO BE EQUAL WITH GOD.\" And he kind of looked at me. I said, \"Well, let me let me just say it LIKE A LIKE A PROPHET OF GOD SAID. HE HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IN A LITTLE WHILE THE WORLD seeth me no more, but you shall see me, BUT I PERSONAL PRONOUN, I'LL BE WITH YOU, EVEN IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He says, THEN THEN GO SEE WHAT HE DID. &gt;&gt; SEE THE WORKS THAT HE did and then look at your own life and then compare yourself. Now look, SATAN ALWAYS WANTS TO TURN QUOTES around and condemn us &gt;&gt; when they should encourage you that there's more for you. &gt;&gt; LOOK THAT BY GOD'S GRACE, WE'LL GET TO THERE, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN JOSHUA AND CALEB CAME BACK WITH THE EVIDENCE HERE. They had the evidence that IT WAS EVERYTHING THAT GOD PROMISED. AND SATAN'S ALWAYS THERE TO MAKE AN EVIL REPORT. WELL, YEAH, but Well, yeah, but and SO WHENEVER YOU HEAR SOMETHING IN THE MESSAGE THAT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT CHALLENGE OR SOMETHING LIKE, MY HOW COULD I EVER GET OBTAINED? YOU OUGHT TO JUST GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS. SAY, MAN, I'M CALLED TO THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I COULD LOOK INTO THE WORD AND SAY, WELL, I'M NOT QUITE ADDING UP RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M COMING. &gt;&gt; Some people might BE FURTHER AHEAD OF ME, BUT I'M COMING. BROTHER DONNIE, JUST WAIT A LITTLE WHILE. I MIGHT NOT GET IT ALL FIGURED OUT. I might not GOT ALL THE REVELATION, AND I MIGHT MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES, BUT I'M COMING. WHY? BECAUSE I'M THERE. HALLELUJAH. I can be like THE KID IN THE ice cream shop. I CAN JUST START GETTING HAPPY. HALLELUJAH. It's coming. &gt;&gt; So, just kind of move it in here. You know, YOU KNOW, CHRIST UH SHOULD BE OUR EXAMPLE. &gt;&gt; You know, that that's what we ought to strive TO BE AS A AS A REAL true Christian. And and so we're just moving in this thought HOW UH THE GREAT WARRIOR JOSHUA, HE LED THEM INTO THE PROMISED LAND. And and so they're no LONGER SLAVES AND AND NOW THEY'RE IN THE PROMISED LAND AND AND THEY'RE ENJOYING the blessings and the benefits and they're raising THEIR FAMILY. AND THE PROPHET SHOWS ABOUT HOW EACH ONE OF THEM CAME INTO THAT NATURAL PROMISED LAND. BUT ALL OF THEM HAD TO DIE. AND HE HE SAYS THEN ONE DAY DOWN COME THE GREATEST WARRIOR OF THEM ALL, the Lord Jesus, the son of God. And he SAID THERE IS A land where a man don't die. Amen. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, \"THEN ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, HE SENT BACK THE EARNEST OF THIS PLACE, the assurance, the evidence that this land is real.\" JUST LIKE JOSHUA BROUGHT BACK THE EVIDENCE, Jesus brought back the evidence of the Holy Ghost. Now, we reckon ourselves dead. We're buried with him in baptism unto death, and we raise with him in the resurrection. And now we are in already. &gt;&gt; Not we're going to &gt;&gt; we're already raised. OH BY WE ARE NOW NOT WILL BE. WE ARE NOW TONIGHT SETTING IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; LOOK, THIS IS NOT JUST SOME HOPE SO GOSPEL WHERE WE WHERE WE JUST COME TOGETHER AND WE TALK ABOUT SOME PIE IN THE SKY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN NEVER BE OBTAINED AND AND WE JUST KIND OF COME UP WITH CATCHPHRASES AND THINGS TO GET ALL EXCITED ABOUT AND AND AND that your FAITH MIGHT REST IN and in in in the the EXCELLENCY OF SPEECH AND THE WISDOM OF MAN. LOOK, THAT'S NOT WHY THE GOSPEL CAME. THIS GOSPEL CAME IN POWER AND MANIFESTATION OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT YOUR FAITH WOULD NOT REST IN THE WISDOM OF MAN BUT REST IN THE POWER OF GOD. AND I LIKE HOW THE PROPHET OF GOD PICKS UP THAT SCRIPTURE AND CHRIST THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED AND HE SAYS IN THE POWER OF GOD TO CHANGE the [screaming] man. HEY, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TONIGHT IS WE NEED TO BE changed &gt;&gt; from THE YOUNGEST TO THE OLDEST. I DON'T CARE IF WE'VE BEEN IN THE MESSAGE OUR WHOLE LIFE. I SAY, \"OH, I NEED TO BE CHANGED. LORD, MAKE ME MORE LIKE YOU, LORD. MORE MORE OF YOUR MEEKNESS, MORE OF YOUR HUMILITY, LORD, I WANT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE OF THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; WELL, MY BIBLE TELLS ME IF THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS CHRIST FROM THE DEAD DWELL IN YOU, &gt;&gt; IT WILL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL BODY. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, YES, THERE'S COMING A FINAL QUICKENING WHEN WE'LL DROP THIS MORTAL BODY AND WE'LL STEP INTO A THEOPHONY. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT TO BE QUICKENED. There's a quickening POWER RIGHT NOW HERE TO QUICKEN THE PREDESTINATED SEED ON THE INSIDE of you. AND IT'LL QUICKEN THE WAY YOU THINK. IT'LL QUICKEN THE WAY YOU ACT. IT'LL QUICKEN YOUR THOUGHTS. IT'LL QUICKEN YOUR IDEAS. IT WILL QUICKEN YOU TO THE WORD. IT WILL QUICKEN YOU TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IF YOU'RE BEING QUICKENED TO OTHER THINGS, TO MAN'S IDEAS AND MAN'S OPINIONS AND TO WEBSITES AND JEBUSITES AND ALL THESE THINGS, I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S NOT THE RIGHT SPIRIT. BUT THERE IS THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT IS HERE. HE CAN SET YOU FREE FROM ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND HE CAN QUICKEN YOU BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST TO THE WORD OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; OH, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, HE SAID, WHEN YOU GET THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, THAT'S THE EARNEST of your salvation. Is that right? IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT. And if it'll MAKE US FEEL LIKE THIS ON A DOWN PAYMENT, WHAT WILL IT DO WHEN WE GET THE full benefit? &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise man. &gt;&gt; Am I talking about salvation? &gt;&gt; Do I need to talk about something else to get you excited? &gt;&gt; We need to talk about some ball games. We need to talk about some sports. &gt;&gt; We need to talk about the latest and the greatest tech. &gt;&gt; We We ARE WE ARE THERE. THERE IS A PROMISED LAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO &gt;&gt; WHERE WE SHALL NEVER DIE. &gt;&gt; AND THOSE THAT WE LOVE [screaming] AND HOLD DEAR WILL SEE THEM AGAIN. And I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE HAVEN'T LOST ONE THING. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, THAT WHEN YOU GET THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S THE EARNEST. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT THAT YOU ARE YOU ALL THESE THINGS ARE YOURS. &gt;&gt; And the PROPHET'S SAYING, IF IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE THAT down here, &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE WHEN WE GET THERE? It ought to make YOU JUST AS EXCITED LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY SON. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We are going to a land where we never get old. NO, I KNOW Y'ALL young people don't got to worry about it, but no more hurting back and no more aching knees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And maybe some of you are, but you know what? YOU KNOW, TIME GOES ON A LITTLE BIT, YOU START appreciating that a little bit more. &gt;&gt; BUT I SAY IT OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, SAINTS. I WELL, I'M TRYING to minister to you a little bit on the evidence of salvation. THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING EVIDENT in your life. There ought to BE SOMETHING THAT YOU POSSESS THAT IT OUGHT TO MEAN something to you. I remember one time I was at Louisiana camp many years ago and you know the the the spirit of the Lord was just moving so precious and you know it was back when when the building was split in half between a gym and a and a sanctuary and and it just seemed like all the kids that were coming through the prayer line and everything they they were all ending back up in in the gym and I just remember uh uh uh it was just such a wonderful thing. We're back there just uh just just praying and and praying with certain other young people and and and you could just see the the spirit of the Lord. It was like a wave. It would just move upon a group here and and go around. I remember it just coming over there. Oh, and there's nothing like it. It just hit the little group we were there praying with and and all a sudden this little boy, he threw us up threw up his arms. HE SAID, \"IT'S REAL. IT'S REALLY REAL. IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE.\" OH, I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT IT IS, SAINTS OF GOD. WHEN THIS MESSAGE AIN'T A STORY ANYMORE. IT AIN'T A BUNCH OF RULES AND REGULATIONS AND I GOT TO WEAR MY DRESS LIKE THIS AND MY HAIR LIKE THAT AND I CAN'T GO OVER THERE AND I CAN'T GO THERE. LOOK, THAT'S JUST A BUNCH OF THAT'S JUST A THAT'S JUST YOU TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK BY YOUR OWN WORKS AND THAT'S JUST YOU LOOKING AT UH SOMETHING THAT'S A liberty to everything ELSE, BUT IT'S MORE OF A BONDAGE TO YOU. BUT WHEN YOU CATCH A REVELATION THAT IT IS THE GRACE OF GOD AND YOU'VE MET HIM FOR YOURSELF, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU REALIZE, LOOK, MAN, THIS AIN'T THIS AIN'T SOME STORY. THIS AIN'T SOMETHING THAT'S FAKE. THIS AIN'T SOMETHING JUST MY MOMMY AND MY DADDY AND MY PRE PREACHERS AND ALL THESE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. BUT WHEN YOU MEET JESUS CHRIST FACE TO FACE, YOU CAN THROW YOUR HANDS UP TO SAY IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE. IT'S REALLY, REALLY REAL. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT CAN HAPPEN FOR YOU TONIGHT. IF IT'S JUST BEEN A STORY AND IT'S JUST BUILT WITHIN THE RULES OF REGULATION AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAS A TESTIMONY AND YOU DON'T HAVE NO TESTIMONY, IT DON'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD, BUT HE'S JUST LOOKING FOR YOU TO MAKE A SURRENDER. AND I SAY, WHY NOT TONIGHT BE THE NIGHT THAT YOU CAN GET THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR SALVATION AND your inheritance and you can just surrender YOURSELF AND COME INTO THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. [applause] &gt;&gt; THEN IT'S A JOY TO SERVE HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OLD THINGS PASS AWAY. ALL THINGS BECOME NEW. &gt;&gt; You're a new creature. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, \"Religion is a covering, but salvation is freedom.\" Salvation is freedom. Yes. &gt;&gt; So when we when we see the word of God and the standard and maybe in your heart you know there's things that are right and you don't do it and it's more of a a burden to you to try and you do good for so long. That should speak to something in your heart to say there's something more for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, I I don't know why I keep coming back to this, but I didn't have to talk my son into going to the ice cream shop. &gt;&gt; I didn't have say, \"Well, son, you don't understand. Like, it tastes really good. You know, you'll really like it. &gt;&gt; It'll it'll give you so much energy. You'll be bouncing off the walls and your parents will wonder why we ever took you there. Right. But but when when when you're born again and you get a new nature, &gt;&gt; I don't I don't got to be talked into it. &gt;&gt; EVEN IF I EVEN IF I REALIZE THERE'S AN AREA IN MY LIFE THAT maybe I haven't totally got the victory, something in my heart will say amen to the word of God. Lord, I know you promised it. It's it's it's NOT A IT'S NOT a burden. I've shared this many times when when I got converted and I got uh born again and filled with the Holy Ghost. You know, it was just a couple days later I was I was at my job and and forgive me for, you know, this is just what happened. I you know, lunch came up and I thought, you know, I'm I I I go I'll go next door to the pub and have a beer and I GOT FOUR FEET FOR YOU KNOW, I STARTED walking all I said [laughter] I don't even drink anymore. That's funny. And I turned around and walked right back TO MY STATION. NOW, IF I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN DOWN, oh man, I'm a Christian. I can't do that anymore. You see now? You see the difference? &gt;&gt; Now, once again, I'm trying TO HELP YOU YOUNG PEOPLE. I IT THAT'S THAT'S A BONDAGE. THAT'S A THAT THAT THAT MEANS SOMETHING ELSE GOTS A HOLD OF YOU. AND AND DON'T LET SATAN UH CONDEMN YOU AND HOLD YOU IN BONDAGE. THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU. SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? SALVATION IS FREEDOM. AND IF I DON'T HAVE A FREEDOM in the message OF THE HOUR, IF I DON'T HAVE A FREEDOM TO WEAR MY HAIR LONG, AND IF I DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DRESS IN MODESTY, AND YOU YOUNG MEN, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM NOT TO GIVE INTO THOSE JOKES AND TO GO ONTO THEM WEBSITES AND TO CONSTANTLY BE BOMBARDED WITH LUST AND NEVER HAVE THE VICTORY, I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE IS AN EVIDENCE OF SALVATION THAT WILL BRING PURE LIBERTY AND FREEDOM THAT YOU CAN BE FREE FROM THOSE THINGS. Now certainly WE CAN WE CAN MAKE MISTAKES AND IF WE DON'T UH IF WE'RE NOT PRAYED UP AND and and and we're not doing THE THINGS THAT WE DO. LOOK UH YOU YOU A TEST WILL COME AND YOU'LL YOU'LL FAIL THE TEST AND YOU'LL REALIZE WELL PRAISE GOD FOR THE TEST. I I AIN'T BEEN PRAYING LIKE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRAYING. I I HAVEN'T BEEN READING MY BIBLE LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PRAYING. AND THE SON OF GOD WILL REPENT. HE'LL GET UP AND KEEP GOING ON WITH GOD. BUT IF YOU'RE JUST ALWAYS STRUGGLING AND YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING AND AND YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FIT, THAT'S BECAUSE THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A DEATH. THAT FIRST NATURE HAS TO DIE. AND THEN THE NATURE OF CHRIST HAS TO COME. YOU GOT TO GET THAT NATURE OF A LAMB. &gt;&gt; That will say yes Lord. Amen Lord. And then it becomes a liberty. It becomes a freedom. &gt;&gt; Well, let me say it like this. I don't need the internet to be happy. I don't need social media to be happy. &gt;&gt; I don't need somebody to tell me I look good to be happy. I don't need my job or any of these things to tell me. Why? Because I am not even of this world. I come from another world. I came from this world. &gt;&gt; I salvation and my satisfaction from this world. I GET MY SATISFACTION FROM THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. I GET MY JOY AND MY SATISFACTION [applause] FROM JESUS CHRIST. I GET MY JOY AND MY SATISFACTION FROM THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. I DON'T NEED NO DRUGS. I DON'T NEED NO ALCOHOL. I don't need no [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; That makes me happy. &gt;&gt; I SAID THAT MAKES ME HAPPY. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD GET YOU DOWN &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL LIKE NOTHING'S GOING RIGHT, START TO THINK ABOUT YOUR INHERITANCE. START TO THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING. THERE'S A LAND BEYOND THE RIVER. THEY CALL THE SWEET FOREVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] THAT'S WHERE I GET MY JOY. THAT'S WHERE I GET MY HAPPINESS. THAT'S WHERE I GET MY PEACE. &gt;&gt; And to think, this is JUST A SMALL LITTLE TASTE. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I pray that somebody here this evening that the evidence of salvation will become real to you. And I just want TO SAY IT'S NOT YOUR good works. &gt;&gt; It's not your efforts. &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, we'll get to this a little later, but I want to show you how IT WAS NEVER YOUR good works or your efforts that warranted salvation. So then when you receive the evidence of salvation, you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, IT WAS NEVER YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT WARRANTED you to get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN SOMEHOW, YOUNG PEOPLE, WE DO SOMETHING BAD AND WE LOSE IT. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to preach to you tonight. &gt;&gt; SATAN KEEPS TRYING TO ROB YOU OF A TRUE EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. But it WAS NEVER YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT MADE YOU EARN IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO IT AIN'T YOUR BAD WORKS THAT CAN LOSE IT. OH, I FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW. IT WASN'T YOUR GOOD WORKS THAT SAVED YOU. IT AIN'T YOUR BAD WORKS THAT UNSAVE YOU. &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT OUGHT TO MAKE SOMEBODY GET HAPPY. THAT OUGHT TO MAKE SOMEBODY SHOUT TO KNOW THAT THIS THING'S RIGGED. I CAN'T LOSE. [applause] I CAN NO MORE DIE THAN GOD CAN DIE. HEY, THAT'S WHAT A PROPHET TOLD ME. IF YOU HAD ETERNAL LIFE, YOU ALWAYS HAD ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; NOW, I AIN'T DOING AWAY WITH GOOD WORKS. WE'LL GET THERE ALSO. BUT I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU THE SCRIPTURE SAYS IN EPHESIANS 2:8, \"FOR BY grace &gt;&gt; you ARE SAVED THROUGH FAITH, AND NOT OF YOURSELVES. IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD, NOT OF WORKS, &gt;&gt; LEST ANY MAN CAN BOAST.\" &gt;&gt; So listen to how the prophet SAYS THIS IN THE PHILADELPHIA church age. Now works are fine but they don't save you. &gt;&gt; Now we we God does a tremendous work in our life. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? WHEN GOD DOES A TRUE WORK IN your life, the test is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Donnie can correct me if I'm wrong, BUT YOU DON'T PASS EVERY SINGLE ONE of them &gt;&gt; the first time. GOD DID SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; NOW, I I WHAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET TO YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, QUIT LOOKING AT THE SYMPTOMS. &gt;&gt; Quit looking at the giants IN THE LAND. &gt;&gt; QUIT LOOKING AT ALL THE THINGS YOU GOT TO OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; Look at the promise. &gt;&gt; YOU COME TO THE ALTAR. YOU PRAYED. YOU REPENTED OF YOUR SINS. YOU GOT UP WITH FAITH IN YOUR HEART. YOU CONFESSED. AND SALVATION IS MADE. CONFESSION. SALVATION IS MADE UNDER CONFESSION. AND YOU PROFESS, I'M A BORNAG AGAIN SON OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And then you come to the test &gt;&gt; and you fail. &gt;&gt; Does that change that you're a son or daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Should that change your confession? I I &gt;&gt; works don't save you in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hold on. This is a vindicated prophet. I love this stuff. They don't make you perfect. &gt;&gt; That's right. YOU MEAN ALL THIS TIME I'VE HAD THE HOLY GHOST AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF PERFECT BY MY OWN EFFORT BY MY OWN ABILITY AND EVERY TEST AND EVERY TRIAL. IF I FAIL IT OR IF I PASS IT, I'M MEASURING MY SUCCESS BY MY ABILITIES. AND YOU ARE NEVER [screaming] CALLED &gt;&gt; TO MEASURE YOUR SALVATION AND THE GRACE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE BY YOUR WORKS. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T MAKE YOU PERFECT. IT IS CHRIST or perish. And it is NOT EVEN CHRIST AND WORKS. &gt;&gt; It is Christ alone. &gt;&gt; This age began in the years of ARMENIANISM THAT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN CHRIST as a reality. IT DOES NOT SING OF NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD. FOR IT SINGS OF NOTHING BUT the blood and my own conduct. OH, IF THE DEVIL HAS HASN'T EVER BEEN ON a rampage with us to THINK THAT IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR GOOD EFFORTS AND OUR GOOD WORKS IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT AIN'T NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD AND YOUR OWN GOOD WORKS. IT'S NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD AND IT IS CHRIST ALONE. &gt;&gt; NOW, I believe in good conduct. If you are saved, you will do righteously. We have already gone over that. But let me tell you now, salvation is not Jesus plus. &gt;&gt; It is Jesus alone. &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord from start to finish. IT IS ALL GOD. LET HIS LIFE be in me. LET IT BE HIS BLOOD THAT CLEANSES ME. LET IT BE HIS SPIRIT THAT FILLS ME. LET IT BE HIS WORD IN MY HEART AND IN MY MOUTH. LET IT BE HIS STRIPES THAT HEAL ME. LET IT BE JESUS AND JESUS ALONE, NOT BY WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH I HAVE DONE. NO SIR, CHRIST IS MY LIFE. YOU ARE NOT SAVED BY YOUR GOOD WORKS. YOU ARE SAVED BY THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. SALVATION IS OF THE LORD FROM START TO FINISH. MY BIBLE SAYS AND NEITHER IS THERE SALVATION IN ANY OTHER. FOR THERE IS NO OTHER NAME UNDER HEAVEN GIVEN AMONG MEN WHEREBY MEN MUST BE SAVED OTHER THAN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT'S THE NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES. THERE'S NO NAME GREATER. THERE'S NO NAME HIGHER. EVERY TONGUE AND EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW AND CONFESS THAT HE IS THE LORD OF LORDS. HE IS THE KING OF KINGS. HE IS THE ALPHA. HE IS THE OMEGA. HE IS THE ROSE OF SHARED. HE IS THE OFFSPRING OF DAVID. HE'S THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR. HE'S THE GOD THAT CONQUERS ALL. HE CONQUERED DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE. HE IS MY SAVIOR AND MY SALVATION IS HIM AND HIM ALONE. LET IT BE HIS BLOOD THAT CLEANSES ME. LET IT BE HIS SPIRIT THAT FILLS ME. LET IT BE HIS WORD IN MY HEART AND IN MY MOUTH. LET IT BE HIS STRIPES THAT HEAL ME. LET IT BE JESUS AND JESUS ALONE, NOT BY WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH I HAVE DONE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, praise his wonderful name. But you don't understand, brother Matthew. I've gone too far. I've tried so many times. Just this recent camp, maybe I went to the altar. I experienced the Lord. I even confessed I had the Holy Ghost and I w I went right back and I got mixed up in this thing and now I'm lost. Now I there's no hope for me. Says who? My Bible said where sin abound, &gt;&gt; grace &gt;&gt; did much more abound. &gt;&gt; Devil, I don't care how much sin. I don't care about how much unbelief. I don't CARE HOW MANY FAULTS. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY FAILURES. YOU CAN POINT TO THIS MISTAKE. YOU CAN POINT TO THAT MISTAKE. YOU CAN SAY, \"I'M THE WORST SINNER there ever was in the world.\" But then MY LORD AND SAVIOR WHO CONQUERED DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE, HE CAME BACK AND SAID, \"SON, IT DON'T MATTER WHERE SIN ABOUND. Grace did much MORE ABOUND.\" THERE'S GRACE FOR EVERY WEAKNESS. THERE'S GRACE FOR EVERY TRIAL. THERE'S GRACE FOR EVERY MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW CUZ I I DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT. I MAKE MISTAKES. I FALL FLAT ON MY FACE, BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT I'M A SON OF GOD. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT I'M GOING TO RAPTURE. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT I GOT THE HOLY GHOST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M AN HEIR. &gt;&gt; FIRST THESSALONIANS 5:9. FOR GOD HATH not appointed us under wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus. Now, we'll try to start moving towards a close. Hallelujah. The prophet says, now we've moved to that sermon he's been referring to and possessing all things. He says, \"Hallelujah. There you are. This is my story. This is my song. I'm an heir of salvation. Look, I I I don't know where where each of you are at in the journey. I know there's some here that you're only here because your parents made you come. And I was I was there. That's okay. That's all right. Maybe some of you, you're you're struggling in sanctification. Maybe you've been born again and filled with the Holy. Maybe you're believing for the Holy Ghost. Maybe you made a confession and and here at this last camp, you went right back and went into the same traps that you you were believing and professing to be out uh uh delivered from. &gt;&gt; Listen to this now. But I'm wanting I'm wanting us to start looking at the word. Look at the promise. Look at the evidence. &gt;&gt; Look at what God has done. Look at what he's doing. Look at where you are. &gt;&gt; And if you know you need him, then you need to make a decision. &gt;&gt; I I I made the decision when I was 21 years old. I could have saved myself a lot of scars, a lot of heartache. I'm an heir of salvation. What is salvation? It's something that's given to you. It's a gift. Are are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; I'M HEIR OF SALVATION. WHAT KIND? FOR ETERNAL LIFE. SALVATION for my soul. Salvation for my body. SALVATION FOR MY WEARINESS. SALVATION FOR EVERYTHING. GOD MADE ME HEIR OF EVERYTHING THROUGH CHRIST. AND HE DIED AND ROSE AND RETURNED BACK AND BROUGHT THE EVIDENCE AND POURED IT OUT UPON US. OH. OH MY GLORY. OH MY. NOW YOU YOU YOU GO UP THERE. WHAT DO YOU DO? WE WE YOU GO UP JUST LIKE ABRAHAM DID. GO UP THERE WITH THAT PROMISE. GOD, you told me it's mine. I got faith in your promise. I'm bringing your word. You promised this. YOU SAID, \"ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE. Seek and you shall find. Ask and it shall be given. Knock and it shall be opened.\" HERE I AM, LORD. I DON'T KNOW. IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS TO BE DELIVERED? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS TO LIVE AN OVERCOMING LIFE? GOD, IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT LOOKS INTO THE WORD OF GOD? AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S A PROMISE FOR YOU. IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE? &gt;&gt; AM I THE ONLY ONE? YOUNG PEOPLE, HELP ME OUT HERE. IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT WANTS DELIVERANCE? IS THERE SOMEBODY here that wants to be an overcomer? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT LOOKS INTO THE WORD OF GOD AND YOU SEE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE THAT AREN'T MEASURING UP? IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE THAT SAYS, \"LORD, I WANT TO MANIFEST THAT PROMISE IN MY LIFE.\" THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT WORD OF GOD AND SAY, \"LORD, HERE I AM. I'M COMING IT. I'M KNOCKING. ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE. SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN. KNOCK and it shall be open. Here I am, Lord. I'm here. I'M KNOCKING. I'M SEEKING. I'M ASKING. I'VE GOT TO RECEIVE IT. THERE YOU ARE. SOMETHING TAKES PLACE when you lay that word down. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Young people, GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOME OF YOU TONIGHT TO LAY THAT WORD DOWN AND SAY, \"I'M STAKING IT ALL ON YOUR WORD. LORD, YOU PROMISED IT AND I'M STAYING WITH IT. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD IT GETS. I DON'T CARE HOW THE DEVIL RAGES AND HOW HE ROARS AND HOW HE TRIES TO POINT TO THIS FOG AND THIS FAILURE. LORD, YOU PROMISED IT AND I'M AN HEIR OF ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; LOOK, it's all yours. You're an heir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A JOY, PEACE, DELIVERANCE, THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; SO, we just we'll end along these lines here with the help of God. SO, HERE IN OUR TEXT, JOSHUA BROUGHT BACK THE EVIDENCE. Here it is. [snorts] He said, \"It's a a land flowing with milk and honey.\" Maybe the kids are like, \"Where's the bucket of milk?\" Oh, it's it's it's a a land plentiful. It's it has a bunch of fruits and a and it it has everything that we have need of. It's a fertile land and IT HAS EVERYTHING. OH, OKAY. OKAY. AND HERE'S JOSHUA SAYING, \"HEY, it's everything that God said it was.\" &gt;&gt; But guess who's right there to bring up an evil report. &gt;&gt; So that's where we continue in Numbers 13:28. It says, \"Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and very great. And moreover, we saw the children of Anoch there. The Amalocites dwell in the land of the south, and the Hittites, the Jebsites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and BY THE COAST OF JORDAN.\" And now, what's happening? ALL OF A SUDDEN, JOSHUA AND CALEB have brought back an evidence. But isn't it funny how the devil has his own evidence? &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you fight right now. I'm trying to help you ON HOW GOD GIVES YOU AN EVIDENCE. GOD GIVES YOU AN EXPERIENCE. GOD BLESSES YOU. YOU HAVE AN EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW, MAYBE MAYBE IT'S AN EXPERIENCE OF JUSTIFICATION. MAYBE MAYBE YOU'RE IN THAT THAT WORK OF SANCTIFICATION. MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN UH UH BORN AGAIN AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU HAVE AN EVIDENCE THE GRACE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE. GOD IS DOING SOMETHING. AND AS SOON AS YOU START TO PRESENT THE EVIDENCE and you SAY, \"LOOK WHAT GOD DID FOR ME. I BROTHER D. I WAS REALLY BLESSED AT CAMP LAST TIME. GOD REALLY COME BY AND HE HE HE HE TOUCHED ME AND I'M REALLY ON FIRE FOR GOD.\" AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT DEVIL COMES UP AND SAYS, \"YEAH, but Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you got to go back to school. &gt;&gt; You You got to go to work. You got to go back out and, you know, YOU GOT TO DO ALL THESE THINGS AND WELL, WHAT ABOUT THIS AND YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THAT AND YOU LIKE THIS AND you got this channel and you got that and and all these things. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE STARTS TO PAINT THIS big picture OF HOW HARD IT'S GOING TO be &gt;&gt; and how you can Oh, you could never No, that's that's for everybody else. YOU JUST YOU JUST HAVE YOUR little experience, but you can still hold on to all those other things. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; See, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID IN REDEMPTION BY JUDGMENT, HE SAID, \"EVERYTHING WITHOUT FAITH IS SIN. Unbelief is absolutely sin. Everything that's not OF FAITH IS NOT OF GOD. You must believe.\" And the only way you CAN HAVE FAITH IS FIRST SEE WHAT GOD said about it. &gt;&gt; Well, ain't that the only thing that matters? &gt;&gt; And then believe his word. That's the only way you can do it. &gt;&gt; Do I need to read it again? &gt;&gt; SO JOSHUA AND CALEB KNEW THAT GOD had promised and they came back. They wasn't afraid to say, \"We can take it.\" G &gt;&gt; because they based their faith not on what they saw &gt;&gt; but what they believed. &gt;&gt; Now there's the key, young people. Are you looking at the promise or are you looking at the symptoms? Are &gt;&gt; are YOU LOOKING AT THE WORD or are you looking at your ability? &gt;&gt; Are are YOU LOOKING AT THE challenge or are you looking at the promise? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hey, let's get down home where we're living. &gt;&gt; You got friends. We go to school. WE GOT JOBS. things you subscribe to and and you you got apps on your phone you shouldn't have and all these things and and you know you you know that there's A HIGHER CALLING AND A HIGHER CALLING IN THE WAY YOU'RE dressing and a HIGHER CALLING IN THE WAY YOU'RE acting and the people that you're associating with and the things that you're liking and the things that you're subscribing. You know what would Jesus do? I don't think he'd be subscribing to that. I don't think he'd be liking that. I don't think he'd be following that profile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? There's a lot of things that we're doing. There's a lot of things that we're subscribing to. And then we we make a profession. We say, \"You know what? I really do. I'm going to I'm going to clean up my life.\" But then what happens? Satan's right there to start trying to make a compromise and try to say, \"Well, you don't have to give up this. You don't have to give up that.\" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I like verse 30. It says, \"AND CALEB STEALED the people before Moses [snorts] and said, 'Let us go over at once and possess it, for we are well able &gt;&gt; to overcome it.\" &gt;&gt; I'm wondering, DO WE HAVE SOME JOSHUA and Caleb still? is there's some young men and some young women &gt;&gt; THAT REGARDLESS OF THE OPPOSITION, &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF ALL THE GIANTS, REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD LADY OSIA LOOKS, NO MATTER H HOW HARD IT MIGHT LOOK AT SCHOOL, HOW HARD IT MIGHT LOOK AT YOUR JOB, IS THERE SOME JOSHUA AND CALEBS THAT'LL STAND UP AND SAY, \"LOOK, I DON'T CARE HOW DARK IT IS IN LADY OSIA. I DON'T CARE HOW BAD THE ENTICEMENTS ARE. I DON'T CARE HOW BAD BIG THE GIANTS ARE. WE ARE WELL MORE ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND BECAUSE GOD PROMISED IT. IT'S OUR INHERITANCE. LOOK, YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW YOURSELF DOWN TO THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW YOURSELF DOWN TO THAT NONSENSE. YOU CAN LOOK AT GOD'S WORD AND SAY, \"GOD PROMISED IT. IT'S MY INHERITANCE. I CAN HAVE TOTAL VICTORY. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GIANTS OF DEPRESSION. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GIANTS OF PORNOGRAPHY AND ALL THEM THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. GOD, GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST TO DEFEAT EVERY SINGLE DEVIL AND EVERY SINGLE DEMON. AND WE ARE WELL MORE ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND. COME ON, YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU CAN TAKE THE LAND. YOU CAN DO IT. YOU CAN PUT EVERY DEVIL, EVERY COMPLEX, EVERY SIN, EVERY OH, COME ON. YOU'RE MORE THAN ABLE TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR INHERITANCE. IT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN CALLED TO DO. [applause] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God SAID, \"THE PROMISE IS YOURS.\" &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But if you ever get it, &gt;&gt; you ain't going to get it easy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan captures your health. &gt;&gt; You got a right to say, \"Satan, give it back. &gt;&gt; Hand it over. I come in the name of the Lord, the possessor of heaven and earth, and I'm heir. GIVE IT BACK. YOU TOOK MY CHILD. YOU GOT HER MIXED UP WITH THE WRONG BOY. YOU TOOK MY BOY AND YOU MIXED HIM UP WITH the wrong girl. I CLAIM THEM. THAT'S RIGHT. I CLAIM MY CHILDREN. I CLAIM MY BROTHER. I CLAIM MY SISTER. &gt;&gt; NOW, maybe you're that boy. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're that girl &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL TRAPPED AND YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO WAY OUT AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. &gt;&gt; We have a right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I feel it right now. I have a right as a son of God to say, \"SATAN, YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF GOD'S PROPERTY. &gt;&gt; GIVE THEM BACK IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I CLAIM MY BROTHER. I CLAIM MY SISTER. YOU GOT THEM MIXED UP OUT THERE IN THE WORLD WITH SOME BOY OR SOME GIRL OR SOME TEMPTATION OR SOME LESS DEVIL. I REBUKE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I CLAIM THEM FOR THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD. YOU CAN BE FREE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; NOW, I want to speak to somebody. If you've never received the Holy Ghost as yet, don't know nothing about it. We've been preaching on the evidence of salvation. And maybe somebody here's like, \"I don't even have a clue. What does that even mean?\" Holy Ghost. I hear all about the Holy Ghost. If you've never received the Holy Ghost as of yet and don't know nothing about it and something in your heart telling you that you want it, &gt;&gt; you stay right there. &gt;&gt; That's eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's what you're heir to. &gt;&gt; Stay right there and look Satan right in the face and say, &gt;&gt; \"You mean you you don't even have to have the Holy Ghost yet?\" That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU MEAN I HAVE AUTHORITY AS A SON OF GOD EVEN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. WHAT ARE WE TAPPING INTO, young people? &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL TRIES TO SAY, \"WELL, YOU DON'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST. YOU DON'T GOT THIS, AND YOU DON'T GOT THAT, AND A VINDICATED PROPHET COMES AROUND, SAYS, \"IF YOU DON'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT, YOU LOOK SATAN RIGHT IN THE FACE AND SAY, YOU ARE THE ROBBER. YOU ARE THE ONE I'VE COME TO POSSESS WHAT JESUS CHRIST DIED for &gt;&gt; for ME TO HAVE. NOW HAND IT BACK. GET OUT OF MY WAY. THEN THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW, THE HOLY GHOST WILL POUR DOWN UPON YOU. THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS. SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. HALLELUJAH. GOD VINDICATES HIS WORD. I SAY EVERYBODY IN HERE, YOU GOT TO LOOK THAT OLD DEVIL IN THE FACE AND SAY, \"SATAN, YOU'RE THE OLD ROBBER. GOD, GIVE IT TO ME. GIVE IT BACK. I'M GOING TO TAKE BACK THE JOY OF MY SALVATION. I'M TAKING BACK MY PEACE. I'M TAKING BACK MY VICTORY. I'M TAKING BACK MY SONG. I'M TAKING BACK MY DANCE. I AM A SON OF GOD. I'M A CHILD OF GOD. I'M HEIR OF ALL THINGS. I AM DELIVERED. I AM FREE. I DO GOT THE HOLY GHOST. I DO GOT JOY. I DO GOT PEACE. I AM GOING TO RAPTURE. I AM GOING TO GET MY HEALING. I'LL GET MY BROTHER. I'LL GET MY SISTER. I'LL CLAIM THEM. IF THEY GOT MIXED UP IN THE THINGS OF THE WORLD, I CLAIM THEM FOR THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; SATAN, YOU'RE THE ROBBER. &gt;&gt; The musicians will come. &gt;&gt; He is the captain &gt;&gt; OF OUR SALVATION. &gt;&gt; Salvation is of THE LORD WHOM THE SON HAS MADE free is free [screaming] indeed. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if somebody wants to say like Caleb and Joshua, &gt;&gt; LET US GO UP AT once and possess it &gt;&gt; for we are well able to overcome it. &gt;&gt; Just what Joshua did for the children of Israel, Joshua means savior. THE WORD JOSHUA. AND THAT'S the same thing Jesus done for the church when they killed him. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered THE GRAVE. HE ROSE up again with THE EVIDENCE, THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, THAT THERE IS A LAND BEYOND THE RIVER THAT THEY CALL THE SWEET FOREVER. AMEN. HE COME BACK AND BROUGHT US AN EVIDENCE. WHAT DOES IT DO, BROTHER BRANDHAM? IT MAKES YOU STOP YOUR LYING, STEALING, DRINKING, CURSING, IMMORALS, EVERYTHING. IT MAKES A new creature OUT OF YOU. I WHO WAS ONCE DEAD IN SIN AND TRESPASSES, NEVERTHELESS, I LIVE, NOT ME, BUT CHRIST LIVES IN ME. I'M A NEW CREATURE IN CHRIST JESUS. AMEN. HEIR TO the promise. HALLELUJAH. YES, SIR. THAT LAND BELONGS TO US. HOW DO YOU KNOW? JOSHUA ROSE FROM THE DEAD, BROUGHT BACK THE EVIDENCE, THE HOLY GHOST, AND I GOT IT. AMEN. GLORY. I'M AN HEIR. I'M A CHILD OF THE KING, [screaming] HEIR TO ALL THINGS. I WANT TO TELL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, THERE IS A REAL BORN-AGAIN EXPERIENCE. AND BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. DON'T YOU LET ANY PREACHER, DON'T YOU LET ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU THAT IT WAS FOR A DAY GONE BY. THERE IS A REAL BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST WHERE YOU MEET THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND IT'LL CHANGE YOU IN A MOMENT. I WANT TO TELL YOU JUST ONE ONE MOMENT IN HIS PRESENCE. IT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR SITUATION. IT'LL CHANGE WHAT YOU'RE BATTLING. [applause] &gt;&gt; And I want to invite you &gt;&gt; to receive the evidence of salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Why don't you all stand as we sing something? &gt;&gt; Why don't you just play something? Look, I I don't know maybe where to go from here, but I kind of wanted to preach something [music] different, but Lord just kept bringing this back to me. You ask me, \"Brother Matthew, what does salvation mean to you?\" I was such a rotten sinner. I was deserving to go to hell. I've done so many bad things. Oh, if Satan could point to a past, he could try to point to mine, but it wouldn't do him any good. Cuz my Bible says, \"If you call upon the name of the Lord, you shall be saved.\" And one day I had gotten myself into some pretty big messes in trouble with the law and I was wanting to clean up my life and I realized I didn't have the strength. I didn't have the ability. I wanted to but there was something else there saying no way. I remember saying God whatever this is it's bigger than me and I need your help. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And it was that day that the Holy Spirit dropped down into my life. I made a move for him. Maybe I could share this portion another time, but I made a move for God. I I meant business. I I made an action and all a sudden the sweetest presence, the greatest feeling just dropped down and it changed me. I I got a new nature. I became a new creature. That's God's transforming power and [music] my past just became a testimony. Just like the woman at the well, [music] she went to the well and the word started to discern her thought, the thoughts of intents of her heart. And just think, the very reason she was at the well that time of day is [music] because she was an outcast. But when she met the Lord Jesus, she ran back with a joy into the city and said, \"Come see a man [music] who told me all the things that I've done.\" Look, I know that many of us have grown up in church and we've grown up on message pews and sometimes it's real hard when we've made mistakes and we've done things we shouldn't have done. We feel like there's a microscope. But I want to tell you one moment in his presence, we'll turn all that into just to a testimony. [music] Is there somebody here that wants to experience that? I I I'm I'm just leaving this up to the Lord. How however the Lord would move, I'm I'm just asking, you know, is I just want to see God do something for you that he [music] did for me. A true change. Not not trying to not struggling and pulling [music] and trying and doing good for 2 months and 6 months and falling back to bondage to certain things and only to feel like to start it over again. Am I talking to somebody? Is there somebody here know? [music] Help me out. Young people, come on. Look, we're all in this together. There's no big eyes. There's no big You know what I We're we're all we're all fighting [music] this fight of faith. We're all living in Lady OC in the most wicked age there ever was and seems like the devil's pressing on every every side and we make mistakes and and we go through hard times and and [music] we fall short. But you know what? There's grace. Where sin abound, grace did much more abound. [music] Hey, we'll just start singing this song and just see how the Lord will deal with our hearts. Help me sing it. [snorts] Freedom is [singing] here. [music] Hallelujah. Freedom is [singing] here and I believe it. [singing] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just accept it tonight, young people? [music] &gt;&gt; Freedom. &gt;&gt; Freedom's here is here. [singing] Deliverance is here. Salvation is here. Healing is here. &gt;&gt; Freedom is [singing and music] here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, freedom [singing] is here. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I receive [singing] it. Lord. Oh, freom [singing and music] is here. Oh, freom is [singing and music] here. [music] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just pray where you're at? Why don't you just &gt;&gt; make an altar in your heart? If you feel like you [music] want to move to an altar, there's an altar here. If you need prayer, &gt;&gt; there's prayer for you. Just &gt;&gt; why don't you make it personal between you and the Lord? If [music] you need deliverance, if you need freedom [singing] to the heavens, I lift my eyes where [singing] my help comes [music] from. I look to you, my rock, my [music and singing] healer. I'll trust in you. [singing] [music] Freedom [singing] is here. [music] Freedom [singing] is here. [music] [singing] Freedom [music] is here. [singing] Oh, and I receive [singing] it. [music] Freedom [singing] is here. [music] Freedom [singing] is here. [music] Freedom [singing] is here. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I believe it. [singing] I [music] reach my hands to [singing] the heavens. I lift [music] my eyes where my [singing] help comes [music] from. I'll look to you, [music] my rock, my healer. I will trust in [music and singing] you. Oo, I reach my [singing] hands [music] to the heavens. I lift my [music and singing] eyes where my help comes from. &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; I'll look to you, my rock, my [music] healer. [singing] I will trust in you, Lord. I'll trust in you. [music and singing] Oh, I'll trust in [singing] you. Oh, [music and singing] I'll trust in you, [music] Lord. [singing] I'll trust in you. Oh, [singing] salvation [music] is here.

[music] Salvation [singing] is here. [music] Oh, and I believe it. [singing] [music] Oh, I reach my hands [music] to the heavens. I lift my eyes [singing] where [music] my help comes from. I'll look to [singing] you, my rock, my [music] healer. [singing] Lord, I'll trust in you. [singing and music] Oh, deliverance is [singing] here. Oh, [music] deliverance is [singing] here. Deliverance [singing] [music] is here. Oh, and I receive [singing] it. Oh, deliverance is [music] here. &gt;&gt; Oh, deliverance is here. [singing] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just light them your way? &gt;&gt; Deliverance is here. [singing] [music] Deliverance is here. [singing] Oh, [music] and I believe. [singing] I lift my hands. Oh, [music] and I lift my hands to the heavens. [music] I lift my [singing] life where my help comes from. I look to you. [music] Oh my rock, my healer. I trust in you. [music and singing] Oh, Jesus is here. Oh, and Jesus [singing] is. [music] Oh, [singing] Jesus is here. [music] Jesus [singing] is here. [music] Oh, and I receive [singing] him. him. [music] Oh, Jesus is here. [singing and music] Jesus is [singing] here. [music] Jesus is here. [singing and music] Oh, and I [singing] believe [music] him. Oh, I'll reach [singing] my hands to the heavens. I'll lift [music] my eyes where my help comes [singing] from. I look to you, my rock, my healer. [singing and music] Lord, I'll trust in you. [music] Oh, I'll reach my hands to the heavens. [music] I lift my eyes where my [singing] help comes [music] from. I'll look to you, [music] my rock, my healer. [singing] Lord, I'll trust in you. [music] I'll trust in you, [music] Lord. [singing] I'll trust in you. Oh, I'll trust in [music] you, Lord. [singing] I'll trust in you. [music] Oh, we are [singing] more than coner, overcomers [singing] in this [music] life. We've [singing] been made victorious through the [singing] blood of Jesus Christ. Oh, we've [singing] been made more [music] than coners, [singing] overcomeers in this life. We've [singing and music] been made victorious [music] through the blood of Jesus [singing] Christ. [music] Oh, we've been made [singing] more than coners, [music] overcomeers [singing] in this life. [music] Oh, we've [singing] been made victorious [music and singing] through the blood of Jesus Christ. [music and singing] Oh, we've been made more than [music] coner, overcomers [singing] in this life. [music] We've been made [music] victorious [singing] through the blood of Jesus [music] Christ. [singing] Amen. Did you enjoy [music] that? Let's give the Lord a hand. [applause] [music] I really, really enjoyed that was evidence of salvation. The funny thing about evidence, you know, I don't know how many cases I've had in court over the years, but I never took a case into [music] court that I didn't have evidence on. Evidence is proof. &gt;&gt; It's proof that something happened. And I always wondered, you know, why why God let a mortal like John [music] go up and see the lamb on the throne, the slain lamb. It's the only human being on the face of the earth at that time that saw with his own eyes [music] the evidence that salvation had been obtained. [music] &gt;&gt; He had to come back and tell you and me there's proof. Anything that's allowed in court without evidence is considered hearsay. The judge can't look at it. The judge won't look at it cuz it's [music] hearsay. It could be a lie. And when Satan looks at your life, you look at your life. I don't know how many times I've I've had the young some young people come to me and brother Rob go to him as well. You know, want the Holy Ghost. I, you know, I feel like I got it and and then, you know, I've go through these things. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The thing about getting the Holy Ghost, the evidence of the Holy Ghost, all them battles that you were fighting before you had the Holy Ghost, they did not leave. &gt;&gt; They didn't leave. &gt;&gt; They're still there. &gt;&gt; You know, if if what what if Job is sitting on this this ash heap, he's lost everything and and and he he's the evidence of of redemption. God, brother Brandham said he had revelation. What if he never got it? [music] &gt;&gt; If he never got it, he would have rotted on that ash heap. But God gave him evidence. &gt;&gt; This is this is what God's trying to do to you tonight. &gt;&gt; Let's tell you, it's not about the battle. When when when the children of Israel crossed into the promised land, Brother Brandham said the promised land was a type of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But all them giants didn't automatically just disappear and leave. When they crossed Jordan and went to the promised land, what them giants do? They came for them. &gt;&gt; But Paul tells us in Ephesians, God gave you an armor. He gave you an armor. &gt;&gt; But the great thing about that armor, God armored you with a helmet of salvation, the shield of faith. He girded you with truth, &gt;&gt; breastplate of righteousness, and give you the sword of the spirit. [music] &gt;&gt; But he said, \"Let me do the fighting.\" &gt;&gt; That's true evidence. When you know that you have the evidence is when you you get the Holy Ghost and all them battles still lay there in front of you. You can do like Job said, still on his ash heap. I know he is God. &gt;&gt; And he can do all things. [music] &gt;&gt; You have a God that can do all things. &gt;&gt; Your battle might be bigger tomorrow. &gt;&gt; It might be worse. but with the Holy Ghost. As our brother was saying tonight, when you go face that giant, you can face him with joy. You can face him with peace with with with with everything that comes with it, you're an heir to it. [music] &gt;&gt; But there, can we sing that song? If if not for grace, I don't know how it starts. Where would I be? Let's sing this and then we'll go. Just remember the sisters have made sandwiches and snacks next door. And uh youth, you're welcome to to come over there and fellowship. [music] Um some of the brothers, I think we're going to set up some tables. So, if you wouldn't mind helping us do that. Let's worship him a minute. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You only [singing] know. [music] I'm glad you see [singing] through eyes of love. A hopeless case, an empty [music and singing] space. If not for grace, where would [singing] I be? [music] You only know. [singing] I'm [music] glad you see through eyes of love. A hopeless case, an [music and singing] empty space. If not for grace. [singing] Amazing [music] grace, how [singing] sweet the sound. I once was [singing] lost, but [music] now I'm found. A hopeless case, [singing] an [music] empty space. If not for grace, [singing] where would [music] I be? [singing] You only know. I'm glad you see [music] [singing] through eyes of love. I was a hopeless case, an empty [singing and music] space. If not for grace, [singing] [music] where would I be? [singing] You only [music] know. I'm glad you [singing] see [music] through eyes of love. [singing] I was a [music] hopeless case, an [singing] empty space. If not for grace. Amazing [music and singing] grace, how sweet the sound. I once was [music] lost, [singing] but now I'm found. A [music] hopeless case, an [singing] empty space. If not for grace, where would [music and singing] I be? You only know. [singing] I'm glad [music] you see through eyes of love. A hopeless case, [singing and music] an empty space. If not for grace. [music] Oh amazing [singing] grace, how [music] sweet the sound. [singing] I once was lost but [music] now I found a hopeless case [singing] in [music] deep space. If not for grace, [music] oh precious Lord, take my [singing and music] hand, lead me on and [singing] let me stand. I'm a hopeless case, [music and singing] an empty space. If not [singing] for grace, [music] oh where would I be? [singing] You only [music] know. I'm glad you [singing] see through eyes [music] of love. [music] Oh, an [singing] empty space. If [music] not for grace. Oh, [singing] where would I be? [music] You only know. I'm [singing] glad you see [music] through eyes of love. [singing] A hopeless case, an empty [music and singing] space, not for grace. [music] Oh preious Lord, [singing] take my hand. [music] Lead me on [singing] [music] and let me stand. I'm a hopeless case, [music and singing] an empty space. If not for grace, [singing and music] where would I be? [music] You only [singing] know. I'm glad you see [singing] through eyes of [music] love. A whole case, an empty [music and singing] space if not for grace. [singing] [music] [music] Oh, I wasn't [singing] made to be tending [music] a grave. I was called by name, born and [singing] raised back [music] to life again. I was made for more. [singing and music] So why would I make [music and singing] a bed in my shame when a fountain of grace is running [music and singing] my way? I know I am yours. And I was made [singing] from home. [music] I know who I am cuz I know [music and singing] who you are. The cross of salvation [singing] was only [music] the start. Now I [singing] am chosen, free and forgi. [singing] [music] I have a future and it's worth living. [singing] I wasn't made [music] to be tended in [singing] a grave. I was called by name. Born [singing] and raised [music] back to life again. I was made for more. [singing] [music] So why would I make a bed in my shame when a fountain [music] of grace is running my way? [singing] I know I am yours and I was made for more. [music and singing] Oh, I know who I am cuz I know [music and singing] who you are. The cross of salvation [music] [singing] was only the start. [singing] [music] Now I am chosen, free and forgiven. [music] [singing] I have a future [music] and it's worth the living. [singing] [music] Sing it as you go tonight. Oh, I wasn't [singing] made to be tended in a grave. I was called [music] by name.

thinking about when we worship and how often times we're looking to get something out of it but then I thought about the real reason we worship the Lord is because of who he is and everything that he is to us so I just want to focus on that it really had this on my heart last night [Music] because of who you are I give you glory Because of Who You Are if you praise because of who you are I will live my voice and say Lord I worship you because of who you are Lord I worship you because of who you are Jehovah my providers [Music] [Applause] [Music] my presence of peace and I worship you because

surface how the service was he was dwelling with you he was abiding with you and when you got in the car and your mom and dad brought you here or your brother or you drove yourself he was with you when you come through them doors he came with you that's why we worship that's why we sing to worship the one you brought with you to give praises to the one that you brought with you so tonight with we're going to keep feeding on that we're going to keep worshiping that you can worship that with amens with raising your hands by glorifying God what the word is coming forth so we're going to have

you today we certainly counted a privilege to be standing before the Bride of Jesus Christ as as young people we encountered a privilege to be able to speak to God's young people and God bless you Sister Mariah so good to see you and and you know you're very special people you know when brother Brandon was up there on that mountain and getting ready to hear what the to go back east and reveal the seals that the angel said something specifically about the young people he said especially about those young people and you're a special class of people and we counted it such an honor to be standing with you today in this hour and just want to say God bless you we bring greetings from our home Church Full Gospel Lighthouse and our our pastor brother Ron Spencer and and he just wants to send his greetings to you and just say God bless you we certainly appreciate brother Joe inviting us and having us come here we've you guys have been a part of our family forever we just counted an honor that brother Donnie would open up the services here for this this weekend so how many has a need that you'd like to make known unto the Lord here tonight and man God sees each and every one of your hands so let's just talk to the master tonight and invite him to come and take the service Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord it means so much to us Lord to recognize that Lord that your presence is he your father and that you're doing a special very special things right here in this moment Lord and we just ask Lord that you would come and Lord take control of this service Lord every person and every ability that is went in to make this service possible we want you to come father and put your blessings upon this weekend father I believe God that you have something very particular in story here tonight Lord and we just asked Lord that you would come down in a very Supernatural way and begin to express yourself through your word Lord I don't know all of these young people I've stood before them many times Lord Jesus in different places father and I've watched you work in their lives but Lord they've come back again one more time Lord to ask you that you administer to them in a supernatural way Lord let us just step aside and may the Holy Spirit get in the word tonight may we just get into a channel where you can pour out your spirit like never before in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look in a couple portions of scripture in the Old Testament here in the book Genesis chapter 22 and verse 13 just one scripture there also Exodus chapter 2 and verse 23. Genesis chapter 22 and verse 13. and by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you something that the Lord woke me up about about a month ago and specifically asked me to say these things here or or just begin to deal with me and I personally never it's not how I would typically open up a youth service it's not how I would typically become acquainted with a congregation to speak some things like this but he he laid some things on my heart about a month ago to speak tonight on The Cry for Help The Cry for Help Genesis chapter 22 and verse 13 and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his Thorns by by his horns and Abraham went and took the realm and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son Exodus chapter 2 and verse 23. amen Exodus chapter 2 and verse 23 and it came to pass that in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel's Side by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham and it's a very powerful thing when God goes to remembering his promises when God goes to remembering his promises something is laying there in store for his children and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them verse chapter 3 and verse 1. now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to up and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why this bush is not burned and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and Moses and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hi hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou stand is is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the afflictions of my people can we say that together I've seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their Cry by reason of the taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and enlarge in a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place under the place of the Canaanites the Hittites the amorites the rizats and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as we said we'd like to speak to you just for a few minutes tonight on the cry for help and we realize tonight that we are serving a God who is a very caring God a God that knows all things he understands all things and we recognize that that by the teachings of the Bible that our God is an omniscient God and him being omniscient we recognize that he is omnipresent he knows all things he understands all things he sees all things there is nothing that is happening that our Lord Jesus Christ doesn't already know or have in his control and this conference that we've just read about here in Exodus chapter 2 came from a time when when God was speaking to Abraham and he told him that I am going to watch over your seed and your seed is going to sojourn in a Strange Land they're going to be there for 400 years and he recognizes that that that there in this moment that before Moses ever got on the scene that God had already made a way of Escape out for the children of God before they ever got in the midst of trouble and I think it's a wonderful thing tonight that before we ever got ourselves in the mess that we got ourself in that God has already pre-planned a way to get us out of the chaos of life that we sometimes get ourself into and it's a wonderful thing to know that the god that you're serving is already working everything for the good to them that love God and we recognize that that when Moses was in this spot that he was in that he was serving a God that would never leave him and never forsake Him and I say this tonight that tonight we're not serving a different God that Moses was serving but we're serving the same exact God tonight that can do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think and tonight we recognize that his eyes run to and fro and I know as young people that there are certain things in your life that you face in and there's certain calamities of life and things or anxieties of life that you're going through but there is nothing that our Lord Jesus Christ can't help you out with tonight can you say Amen tonight that God is able to get me out of the chaos that I am in and we recognize that very very familiar to the word of the three Hebrew children that God didn't send somebody else down there to get them out when they were in need of help that God himself came down there and he showed up now the Bible said in Psalms 18 and 6 that in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even unto his ears so David found him that in his midst of his distress and in the midst of his danger he called upon God and he found out that God was ready to help him in Psalms 34 and 15 it says the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are up open under their cry Psalms 139 and 4 it says that therefore there is not a word in my tongue but Lo O Lord thou knowest it all together thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful me for me it is high and I cannot attain it wither shall I go from thy Spirit or wither shall I flee from thy presence if I ascended to the heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there so what was David finding out he was finding out that he was serving the god that is known as Jehovah's Hammer that the Lord is there if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there so there is showing to you as young people there is nowhere that you can run to that our God isn't already there and to think that tonight before you got in the Trap of sin and before you got in your sickness and before you got in your pain God heard you and he saw you where you are Psalms 107 and 6 says then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses so you see there is a spot in life and I understand that you can go over in Exodus 14 when God is having a conversation with Moses and he says why cry speak but there are times in your life that you just have to have a cry session there's some times in your life that you are in the midst of distress and you need to be able to roll upon the Billows roll upon the bosom of Abraham's father upon almighty God and lay your head over on El Shady eye and nurse from El shadiah brother Bosworth told us he told us that the baby that cries aloud us is the one that gets the most attention and brother Branham says so I think it pays us to cry a little bit once in a while you recognize that immediately in the Bible that the Bible tells us about a woman that was a persistent Widow that was constantly knocking upon the unjust judge's door laying there and telling him to avenge me of my adversary but tonight you are not a widow you have a you have a faithful husband that is willing to help you out of any chaos of life that you are in but we recognize going back to our text tonight that God had a Time that he was going to fulfill his word he promised to Abraham and his seed that his seed was going to sojourn in a Strange Land I don't know if that's all right to put it there but I'm gonna put it there but he promised that Abraham that his seed was going to sojourn in a Strange Land for a long time for 400 years but he was going to bring them out of it when the time of the promise Drew not and it's a wonderful thing to know that God has a perfect time that he's going to do things and I want you to know that you're in the time of that now so God raised up a Boy by the name of Moses and Moses was born for a specific purpose you know Moses had never heard of the voice of God he'd just been told about it by his mama and the daddy and the teachers of that day that such and such was coming that God was going to send a deliverer and he said it his mama would tell him says son I believe that you are the one and Moses didn't necessarily know it for sure but he was laying upon the experience of a his mother or his father and I believe that's the problem with so many children today or young people is that they're relying upon their mother or their father's experiences and they've never had an experience with a pillar of fire for themselves but they want you to know young people that that same Pillar of Fire that Moses met is in the building tonight so that you can have a conference with him say that you met him for yourself it's not just for brother Joe it's not just for brother Rob it's not just for brother Joel it's for everyone here tonight so Moses knew that God he knew God by intellects he understood him by intellects but there was something that was placed on the inside of Moses that seed that was born in him he was laying there in his heart and even though he tried with an intellectual experience with the word to bring them out to deliver them because he knowed that he was born for that promise or for that purpose and I want you to know that all the schools of our Theology and all the intellects can never be able to improve or never produce that power to get you out of the mess that you're in but the god that met Moses in a burning bush has the ability to get you out you see Israel needed Deliverance but Moses couldn't do it on his own on his own you need help but you can't do it on your own you know you've tried but you can't do it on your own but there is a faithful father Hallelujah they couldn't be delivered upon their own intellectual conceptions they needed a deliverer and they needed somebody that had met a mighty Angel that's why we needed more than just a school theology to get us out of the chaos that we were in that's why we needed a prophet messenger that had personally met the mighty Angel for himself you see Moses had that great call upon his life and he was basing it upon all that he knew until one day he found out that it was for him you see what it was all of the intellects was laying there but then the anointing came upon his intellects and it anointed what he had on the inside of him so you see your intellects are all right as long as the anointing comes upon it but your intellects as long as it ain't got no anointing on it it ain't worth nothing more than a piece of paper Hallelujah but you recognize that tonight that William Branham told us that the pillar of fire has what you lack so that pillar Fire come whirling Out of Heaven Come whirling out of heaven and came down upon that bush Dropped Out of Heaven came down upon that bush what was it it was God he was attracting the attention of his Prophet to show him that it was time for their attention to be drawn to Israel that their eyes needed not to be upon Egypt but their eyes needed to be upon God and his promise to be honest young people we sometimes we get into a spot when we focus ourselves so much upon the problems that we're facing and the current world crisis or the demographic that we're in and the thermometer of the world that we're in but God is doing these things he's sowing the supernatural he's showing us a supernatural to get our attention upon him you see if the pillar of fire would show up in this building tonight and I believe that it's here it is only doing that to get your attention you see brother Madam said that he was simply trying to attract the attention of Moses he said and you know he said how today the church is in bondage of sickness and he said the church is crying and been crying for years for deliverance you see and the devil will try to tell you that there is no help for you and there is no relief for you that there's no way out of your problem but I want to assure to you young people tonight that the devil would like to implant in your mind that that you are his and there's no way out of the problem and that he's got a claim on you but I want to tell you that is a lie straight from the pits of hell because the Bible tells us that you are of God little children and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now if there's a spirit that is a spirit of fear that is afflicting your life God didn't put that on you if it's a spirit of chaos or a spirit of unsetterness or a spirit of bitterness God didn't put that upon you you know the Bible tells us in second Timothy 1 and 7 that God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind so God wants you here tonight in a sound mind upon his word the Bible says in Psalms 82 and 6 that you are gods and all of you are the children of the most high God look at your neighbor say I'm a child of the most high God but Satan would like to whisper in your ear over and over again that you're his and there's no way out of the crisis that you're in but I want to tell you by the word of God that there is a way when there seems to be no way you know what it's like to be in a spot when you need help when you need help and you can't get yourself out of it you need somebody bigger than yourself to get you out of it you know that the devil would lie to you over and over and over again and I find that a lot of times young people have a better opportunity to quote Satan's lie what he said about them than what they're quoting about God's word now we know that that there's over 8 800 promises in the Bible and I want you to know that over 8 800 times God never lied but nine times in the Bible the devil made promises and I want you to know that the devil never kept any of his promises the devil if he's whispering in your ear it's alive if he's telling you you're not good enough it's a lie if he tells you that healing isn't coming for you it's a lie if he's telling you that you can't get out of your trouble it's a lie if he tells you you're not good enough it's a lie if he tells you you're not qualified it's a lie if he tells you you're not election it's a lie I'll tell you what kind of person I am I'm a positive and a negative kind of person so if the devil is telling me that I'm not good enough that means I am good enough if he tells me there is no help for me that means there is help for me if he tells me I can't get out of my crisis that means I'm already out young people I don't care where you are I don't care what family you came out of I don't care what problem you're going through there is nothing too big there is nothing too big for my God I've watched for the past three years my father facing brain cancer and lung cancer and I have witnessed the power of the Holy Spirit that my God is greater than cancer my God's bigger than brain bleach not God's bigger than sugar diabetes you see remember the story when brother Brandon would talk about that man that came to Lincoln that he came up there that his friend had been put in prison for something that he didn't mean to do and he got himself in jail and he got himself before the firing squad but there was a faithful friend that went to the president or the land and he and it was talking to him he said look Mr President you had the power to release him or you have the power to kill him and he'd give him the pardon but the man went back to the prison cell he went back there gave him the piece of slip that Abraham Lincoln signed but what did the man do in the prison cell he refused the pardon there's a way out of your chaos there's a way out of your situation there's a way out of your depression there's a way out of it but you've got to accept what God has put before you you see a pardon is only a part and if you accept it as a pardon you see he had the power to release him and there is one in the building right now that has the power to release you from Every Chain of every complex of every sickness when you cry yourself to sleep he hurt you when you're asking for a breakthrough he heard you when you are asking for the Holy Ghost he heard you when you thought you weren't good enough he heard you don't you listen to the devil's life because brother Bynum told us in a church age book he said to listen or believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan don't listen to his lie it don't matter whether you hear me now or whether you hear this 10 years from now don't listen to The Devil's lie you were never his child hell was not made for you hell was built for him and his angels but you're not a child of Satan you're the child of the most high God you see you see I understand what the battles that you go through as young people I'm not too I'm 35 years old my wife told me when I turned 30 that I had to finally grow up I turned her down I understand what it's like facing the pressures of the age that you're in and I'm about 17 years past graduation and we recognize that every generation gets ten thousand or ten times worse so I can't even imagine what you're facing in the world that you're in but I want to Turn Your Eyes Upon the word of God you've not been given a vision to look at upon the world and see things as though they are not you've been given an Eagle Eye Vision to be able to look at the word of God and see the word of God as your preeminence in this life you see you see brother Brandon preached a very powerful message on the message look and if you go in there brother random starts talking about those binoculars how that you've got to learn to focus those binoculars he said at one time he said somebody was telling me to look out there at those lines or those antelopes and he said I was looking out there and he said I seen three he said but I knew it was one he said but what I had to do he said I had to focus it down I had to get my vision correct with what was out there and a lot of times Satan will try to blur up your vision to get you construed misconstrued on what you are to be seen you're not supposed to be seeing three Gods you're supposed to be seeing one God you're not supposed to be looking at something as seeing that you can't get out of it I want to say this to you there is nothing too big for my God Erica Parker's situation is not big enough to roll God's eyes and say well I just ain't got enough power to do it he's got enough power to do it and I happen to believe that he's more than able to do it because I've got my eyes turned the other day uh the other day I was getting out of the shower and I put my glasses on and I thought dear Lord I'm going blind I couldn't see anything everything was blurry I thought I can't read nothing something's going on but the big dummy right here forgot to have my contacts in so everything was double blurred I couldn't see things I wasn't focusing right and if you've got a filter over top of the word of God you won't be able to see the word of God correctly you see Moses had got to a spot that he had to turn his Focus away from what Pharaoh was telling him Pharaoh had the ability they looked out the same window Pharaoh only seen slaves and mud daubers but Moses looked out there and he'd seen Children of the promise what did he do he focused himself away from the lust of the world and the pride of the life and the beauty and the power of Egypt and he had those potentials laying on the inside of him Pharaoh didn't have those potentials there but Moses had the potentials to be able to focus it down to see what God was saying you ever looked at a problem and you looked at it in your eyes and then you turned it and looked it from God's point of view if you look at it from your house you're always going to say well I'm not I'm not able to get it I I'm not going to be able to have my breakthrough like this person had their breakthrough but if you look at it in the word of God you'll be able to see that it's for every one of you that whosoever the world the Lord will call it's for you so Moses simply he turned and he refused to see he refused to focus on the things of the world what was Moses doing he was taking his faith in the word of God and that's what faith is it's designed to see what God wills and God wants you see that's what your faith will do here tonight it's designed to see what God wants for you and the faith that is in you will focus you right to the word of God I can't imagine 400 years walking past Joseph's bones being beat being whipped but I got a promise land right here that were coming out of here I can't imagine a young people saying it's not for me when we've got the word laying right here I can't imagine what it was like to be beat day in and day out making bricks for somebody else but God had a promise you're coming out of here it might look like you are never going to get out of the spot that you are in but remember when the prophet was up there on Hurricane Mountain and he thought he was good enough to get himself out of their mess that he got himself in he thought I've got it in my nature I can get out of here but it finally got to a spot when he was on that Indian death walk that he realized that he didn't have the ability to get back down the mountain to where his what he truly loved his wife and his son down there he didn't have the human abilities to get himself down off of that mountain and go back there but he heard these words of Psalms 46 that God is our refuge a very present help in a time of trouble and you remember the story when William branham's up there and he sees there's a hand that touches him lays his hand on his shoulder and tells him look back there and he sees the point that he needs to be walking but what was he doing he had his hands up looking for a Lifeline looking for that line that he'd put up those years before let me tell you young people keep your hand up lift up those hands at once hung low lift up those hands keep your hands up brother random said one time I thought I grabbed it thought I grabbed it and I I began to shout about it he said but I found out it was just a twig or a branch but he kept his hands up and finally when his hand Struck it it was a sure fact that he was going to the spot that he loved and if you can find your name in the word of God you're going you're not saying on that mountain you've circled the mountain long enough you've been in depression long enough you've been in anxiety long enough you've listened to the world long enough get your hands up get your hands up God's heard your cry he's heard you cry when Zacharias was a priest and he walked into the house of God time after time he walked in there and he was offering incense when him and his wife had prayed year after year about having a baby but finally one day he walked into the house of God when he was offering incense unto the Lord and Gabriel said these words I have heard your prayer I have heard your prayer and William Branham told us he said if you want an angel appear to you get your life right get your heart right he said and God will hear your prayer and the angels will come if you've got the right atmosphere I'm on my own in this journey no you're not look at these brothers they would not have had this meeting if it was just for themselves they had it for you you are not alone you're not in the midst of a trial all alone there is one that sticketh closer than a brother brother Bynum said just walk unconscious of fear he said walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious under the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right hand or the left he said just keep moving on something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah his sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God he said Enoch one day walk like that you know what he done he walked all the way home he walked with God so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore Walk Of God doctor says you're going to die walk with God doctor says you can't walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you and to the end of the world he took an oath by the Covenant that he give you that he would confirm and just walk with God you're going to have your ups and downs don't you worry you go to the third you're going to go through Briar patches and over shop rocks over Bluffs down over the hillsides up to the mountains over Waters but walk with God what am I supposed to do brother Andrew walk with God just walk with God when Abraham was up on Mount Moriah and he was up there with his Isaac what was he doing he was walking with God surely if he can trust him in his 100 Year age to make him new again surely he can give him Isaac back again and when Isaac and Abraham was found faithful God provided for them a sacrifice to get themselves out but Abraham didn't have some intellectual Faith he had a genuine faith he'd already seen what God could do laughs I've already seen God feel young people of the Holy Ghost so I know he's going to do it again this weekend I've already seen our God deliver young girls out of all kinds of chaos of spirits so I know he'll do it again this weekend already know that God heals the sick so I know he'll do it again this weekend I know God listens to his promises and he remembers them and he cast out the devil so I know he'll do it again this weekend you don't have an intellectual Faith or you would be in the building you know what intellectual faith is and I'll tell you what it is it's a discount of Faith it's a faith that only gets you so far and you don't want discounted Faith you want the real genuine faith you feel the atmosphere in the room don't you you recognize it it's been set by your worship and by you Amen in the word of God but there's coming a time on Monday morning when you don't feel this atmosphere and you're going to have to walk with God you better hope that you have a genuine Faith because an intellectual faith will let you down intellectual faith is like buying something down to the Dollar Tree you know good and well it's going to let you down at some time is that right you buy yourself you buy yourself a car at the Dollar Tree it's going to leave you on the road sitting somewhere but if you're fired be careful here but if you find yourself a real genuine Ford at the Ford dealership he won't leave you Hank and I know they say that it's found on the roadside sitting dead but if you buy it down at the Dollar Tree it's going to leave you sitting somewhere hey if the prophet had it for it I guess it's all right for me to have afford sorry for you Chevrolet fans I guess you got your own heartbeat help me Jesus Genie a genuine Faith Ain't Gonna Let You Down but an intellectual faith will let you down you'll see if Abraham was dealing with intellectual faith he would have got up there brother Randall said he would have got up there and that intellectual Faith would have went to work and Satan would have said now what's Sarah going to say about this if you commit Isaac to that Altar and you slay him what's Sarah going to say about this but he didn't listen to his intellectual Faith he listened to what God Said and when he listened to what God Said God provided his way out let me tell you young people God has already provided on the cross 2 000 years ago a way for you to go free a way to get out of depression a way to get out of suicide a way to get out of your chaos you remember when William Branham you remember when William Branham is in his early Ministry and he has a vision he has a vision of a sheep caught in a Thicket and he and he kept hearing this this sheep hollering hollering and crying for help and brother Brandon said I was going through those Briar patches trying to find my way find my way to and he said I heard that sheep behind you buying for it and he said I finally found it and he said when I got there it was crying Middletown Middletown brother Burnham didn't know anything about Milltown or of where it was or anything about it so he presented it to his church and he went up there went up to Milltown and you know that brother Branham was holding a Revival up there just trying to find where where the will of the Lord was and he began to hold a Revival and those things and he he's up there and he's just he's preaching away and while he's preaching there they begin to tell him that there's a little girl by the name of Georgie Carter that had been laying in the bed for nine years nine years and so many days dealing with tuberculosis all over throughout her body and there but the random goes up and he begins to pray for her begins to go up there and see her and she said I heard your story or I heard the story about the nailed little girl I heard that story you see faith comes by hearing and she said what brother back let have a vision for me do the same thing that you did for her he said I can't do that he said the Lord just did that for her he said that little nail girl was eat up with arthritis couldn't hardly move got up out of the wheelchair and went back completely normal Georgie Carter was laying in this condition and you know the story you've heard it over and over again but she was laying there because of a condition where her uncle took and abused the situation and because of that situation of him mishandling a situation he went in there I noticed immediately what happened because of that condition or that emotional uh thing that happened immediately tuberculosis is attached to her spirit and destroys her body Georgie Carter is ringing her wrist out upon those bed posts ringing out in pain she's ringing out in pain going through the motions trying to get help but she finds faith in a man of God and said I if he could do it for her the Lord Our God can do it for me the Bantam said he just prayed for and let it go and as it was he said I didn't see no vision that said but they had been taught by the current denomination that they were under that God didn't do those things no more I'm afraid that too many times that people have the belief that God doesn't do those things no more I'm not just talking about natural things of your body but I believe there's a lot of people that God don't give out the Holy Ghost no more there's a lot of people that believe that that she that we shouldn't we shouldn't preach emotion that we shouldn't preach all of these things and they say well that's not for our church or it's or we're past those days just preach us the word I believe that if it's in the word of God no matter if it's from Genesis or Revelation then we ought to preach it if healing is in the body then we ought to preach it if there's gifts in the body then we ought to preach it if there's a power of the Holy Ghost you ought to preach it had a God one time tell me he said well all you are is a holy ghost preacher so what else you want me to do what else you want me to do that's what I'm here to do this weekend it's preach the Holy Ghost I can't get you out of your trouble I can't help you 10 days from now but the Holy Ghost can and something may have happened to you not as bad as Georgia Carter but all of a sudden a complex can attach itself to your spirit and because of it it eats at your body it eats at your mind but God has heard your cry for help Georgie he's heard you he's heard your little lamb he's heard you crying he's heard you weeping he's heard you asking Georgie he's heard you crying he's heard you in your trial you ain't got some discounted faith what happened he worked his way through those Briars until he found the lamb what happened when William Brandon was up there praying and seeking the Lord them Briars were hitting him in his face trying to get him distracted from prayer but all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord come whirling over top of those mountains said go by the way of the corridors what was about to happen it was something in the natural that was getting ready to happen but I believe that it's for the spiritual tonight you may have been laying in your condition for nine years nine years you may have been laying there how long how much longer are you going to lay there how much longer are you going to cry yourself to sleep how much longer are you going to ask for your breakthrough but we're here to break some barriers down this weekend we are here to tear down every stronghold that the enemy has tried to attach to you you know what you know that if that plane if he can ever get to a spot that he can pass on past that sound barrier that it begins to move into another realm that it's never built before that it's never been before and you might struggle after struggle after struggle but keep struggling I've been through it over and over again go again press on keep struggling keep struggling because when you press through that barrier you're going to fly like you never flew before it's an unlimited speed when you can break through there and when you can break through your sin barrier young people when you can break through well necessarily what is sin it's unbelief in God's word I'm not saying you've got certain things in your life but sin any type of unbelief is sin against God's word if something comes in and you say well I don't know that's immediately where you sinned right there why well why didn't he do it for this that's where you sin right there it wasn't when you started drinking alcohol you sinned when you disbelieved God's word but if you can break past that sin break past that doubt break past those things you're going to break forth in an unlimited Revival Hallelujah if you can ever get past that sin barrier if you can ever get past it can I prophesy God's going to use these young people he's going to use a mouth of these young people to break cancer he's going to use the mouth of these young people to break doubt and break sin and break change and break circumstance he's going to use the mouth of these young people like the Bible said in Deuteronomy 30 and 14 the word of God is now thee even in thy mouth that thou mayst do it somebody is going to do what Revelations 10 8 says go and take the book and eat the book there's going to be a young boy or a young girl that rise up and said I'm sick and tired of the devil winning if you give up now you're gonna always give up if you always you're never going to win a surrender you keep surrendering to the devil you're never going to win the battle but if you said I'm here to win I'm here to press on I'm here to press the battle I'm here for the Holy Ghost I'm here for healing I'm here for my church I'm here for my breakthrough well the random was one time dealing with a lady that had colon trouble and she said he said he said now you're sitting there wondering when is it your time he said your time is right now I want to say to you young people your time is right now the time is at hand the time to break through is right now the time to overcome is right now don't you go down in defeat don't you walk away from this meeting going down in defeat you are here to win because the Bible said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he I was born a winner because I was born by the Breath of God I was born and Overcomer because God made me what I am I was born to be a devil Destroyer because God made me that way I was born to be a shouter because God made me that way I was born to be a dancer because God made me that way don't you back off when the devil tells you that you shouldn't do things that way God made you that way if God wanted you that way then you ought to be that way it's for you this is your time brother Brandon told us in the message power of God a very powerful message man y'all good group to preach to another man preached a very powerful message in 1955 he preaches he preaches on the power of the devil the power of God and then the power of decision very powerful powerful messages go listen to him and brother Bynum says there in the power of God he said Satan's power is limited so he's like a dog on a chain he can only go so far he can only go so far he can only hear that he can only hinder your walk so far he can only torment your mind so far his power is limited but brother random said directly after that he said but face power brings to pass God's revealed Revelation so faith says I'm more than able to do it I am persuaded that I'm a mighty conqueror [Music] my goodness y'all y'all y'all y'all good people to preach to y'all enjoy the word of God don't you why are you enjoying it because it's your opportunity it's your chance let me tell you William Brandon Brad William Branham had his opportunity he ran his race but it's your turn brother Madam said that each generation has their opportunity at the fresh word of God it's our opportunity brother Branham said brother Burnham said in bless him prophet he said I look out there and I see all of my missed opportunities and you think my I missed my opportunity last Wednesday or last weekend let me tell you if William Bynum missed opportunities you're going to miss opportunities but the thing is is to learn from your mistakes think about this opportunity that you've been given right now you don't see it but there's another world in this room you don't see it but there's power that is moving through this room there's Deliverance moving through this woman there's a breakthrough in this room there's healing in this room there's relief in this room it's time you start letting off the pressure and you find yourself running to a rock that is higher than yourself you remember when William Branham and I'm closing but you remember when William Branham he he one time he goes to it goes to a spot in a psychiatric ward and he and he's he's working the room and he's and there's all those cases that are laying there and he he just simply saying to the brother that's with him he said where do we start at where do we start at all of these cases where do we start he said there was people sitting there in straight jackets and people that were beating their heads and all of these things he said where do we start at and there was a there was a little girl that was sitting there and said why don't you start with me and he said surely you're not a patient she said oh yes I am and she began to tell brother Brandon her story about where things went in her life and how she how she once was a good girl and how she how she once was raised right in all of these things but she got out with the wrong boy one time and it took her down a dark Road you got to watch your friends young people because if your friends aren't leading you to the lord they're not your friends if your friends aren't bringing you closer to an atmosphere like you feel tonight then you need to ditch your friends God will give you new ones you know that was one thing that I I wondered about when I when I gave my heart to the Lord how in the world am I going to get rid of them old friends let me tell you I didn't have no problem getting rid of them they got rid of me they didn't want to hear about the message they didn't want to hear about the gospel they wanted their own things I didn't have to worry about getting rid of them they got rid of me foreign she was raised in her right home did right things but she got around the wrong crowd one time you know brother Brandon said that's what happened to Legion he got out and he started playing cards with the wrong people had a nice family had had about three or four different children back home and the devil took him and put him in a cave chained him up there put him under chains of circumstance and every time he'd start to come back to his right mind he'd start beating himself again it's so easy to get under the enticements of the devil he's only wanting you to smoke one cigarette or take one drink or listen to the wrong piece of rock and roll one time and he's got you and then all of a sudden he's going to call and make you feel like you're not good enough as soon as you do it he's going to make you feel like you're not worthy enough for this gospel and this girl starts telling brother Branham her story of Where She Went she went from this house she she went to this Association she went to this church she went from she went from the Protestant church to the Catholic Church she went from here and went to there and I start to come to myself and finally I I ended up here I ended up in this condition I was a good girl let me tell you young people I grew up in one of the greatest homes that you ever could have been reared in but I still needed to meet the God of this Bible listen to The Prophet every day brother McGrady I listened to it I heard it every day it wasn't because my daddy didn't do the right things in front of me I was born a sinner and I was shaped in iniquity I came to this world speaking lies and I needed my own experience but something on the inside of me was crying for help and one day I found him walking on the streets I dropped and surrendered my life to the Lord and I never went back to that world no more it don't have to be in church but it's a fine place to get it it don't have to be necessarily around Believers but it's a fine place to get it I got it on the streets in Canada so if you can get it in the streets you can surely get in a church building you can surely find the god of Abraham right here tonight but God of Moses is in this room why don't you say start with me Lord start with me Lord and she began to pray she said why don't you pray while I go around to these other ones and you think well the Lord seems like he's dealing here and he starts working the room somewhere else and this girl is over there and she comes on brother Bynum comes back to her said he said now look she said I believe I'm going to go out there and I'm sure going to try he said no you've done that before a lot of times people get the idea of just going to the altar and that's good enough but you've been here before but it's time to go past that I'm a Believer in altar cause I'm a Believer in it but the experience of this altar has got to get you out of the chaos that you're in it's more than a preacher's hands it's more than a preacher's words but there is a power I believe that tonight that we're setting before the greatest power that there is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she'd been here before she'd been at this spot before she prayed through before and she tried before but it failed her but finally when she got down brother Brandon began to talk to her he began to talk to her I said don't you don't you ever want to be married she said what could I offer what could I offer to a husband he said you can offer your soul to Jesus Christ he said I love this he said he can take you back to your innocency he can take you back before you did the wrong he said he has the ability to take you back to your urgency he said the blood is sufficient this girl had tried everything else she looked at everything else she tried Religion she tried church but it didn't help her but what she needed was an experience and finally she got down there when Brethren prayed with her finally there came a breakthrough finally there came what she was asking for I want you to know that what you've been crying for is in the room what you've been asking for is in this room your breakthrough is in this room don't you limit God tonight but let's let the chains off take the limits off Focus your eyes to the word of God say God I'm here for you I know you're here for me I know you want my life I know you want my spirit I know you want my soul God start with me start with me won't you let God take you back to the place before you ever did wrong he said well I'm going to need I'm going to need some scripture for that I want to tell you that God knows how about how to roll back the time in your life when Hezekiah was in his condition and he began to cry out and begin to turn his face towards the wall and begin to plea before God and the prophet told him to prepare to die the prophet had to come back because of his prayer and Hezekiah asked for a son and God rolled back the Sundial upon his he turned back the time it's a sign to you young people before you ever got into trouble before you got into sickness Our God has the ability to restore and roll back the time you said well you don't know my story I don't need to know your story I know his story and his blood is sufficient his holy ghost has the ability to roll back scars and complexes and sickness and change the blood is more than April let the musicians come why don't you have your fresh chance at the word of God once you have your opportunity right now where you are why don't you say God I'm not leaving here the same way I came in here Lazarus was in a worse condition than any of you they're right here in bad condition I'll be honest I didn't walk in here tonight the first thing I seen was a bunch of corpses I didn't come to preach to the Living Dead tonight I didn't see no corpse here Lazarus was in a bad spot but his sister said these powerful words even now Lord even now you know what lazarus's name means without help without help from Jesus he wouldn't get it out of that tomb without help he wasn't coming out from where he was he was enjoying life where he was but because the helper was in the room you might be without help but our lord is

time I was I was at a meeting quite like this I was in a meeting quite like this and there was a young sister to come up to me she began to pour out her heart where some things were in her current life that she was in the spirit of the Lord Dropped In My Heart to say these words you've not lost your salvation sis you've just lost the joy of it and when I when I spoke those words sometimes you say things you don't even realize what you're saying when I spoke those words it had the ability to set her free she took off running and laughing in the spirit because she recognized she hadn't lost her salvation she just lost the joy of it and a lot of times this world has a way of crippling our faith to steal our joy you ain't lost your salvation you just lost the joy of it if I was you I'd say God I'm coming back to get my joy back I'm coming to get everything that the devil stole from me back from it this weekend this opportunity I come to get back with the Lord was rightfully given to me

shouting victory victory is mine victory is mine Victory today is mine I told Satan to get thee behind the victory today is mine Joy is my joy is mine Joy day today's my mind I told Satan to get thee behind Joy Joy today is mine [Applause] what amen Joe enjoy the word tonight amen that was wonderful cry for help I was thinking when he we're sitting there preaching sometimes Satan's going to make you look like you've got something in your life that that God can't deal with that God can't touch you've just you've got that one thing God can do all things except whatever it is you have job thought that one time [Music] Joe thought that that's what he's talking in the upper room last week was you know job said God you know all the flowers died the grass dies everything around me dies but it comes spring it comes back but when I die you know Joe thought what was me this is one thing that God can't do he can't deliver me he can't bring me back and I'm dying and brother Branham said I love it when he talked about that binoculars brother Andrew he said God gave him God's binoculars he said he looked he saw Calvary four thousand years ahead and where was job when he said I know he is God and he can do all things job was still an ash Heap job still had boils job had no more friends he still had no children he had no more possessions he still had a wife that doubted him he still had all that stuff but he said I know he is God he can do all things so no matter what your your situation is we've got about a hundred here so we've probably got 100 different situations he's still God you don't you might be in the middle of your ass sheep you might have just started your ass Heap you might be on it for a year like job but through that year God will still be God [Music] he'll never change what was God doing to job he was showing Satan how perfect he was so if you're going through a trial you're going through something in your life God might be proving something to somebody that when you come Victorious on their on the other side you'll know why God brought you through that do you have a need here tonight don't don't don't don't walk out here carrying in what you and carried out what you carried in brother Andrew's here he'll lay hands and pray for we got brother Joel brother John brother Rob we'll pray for you if you if you've got a need we'll pray for you don't I I urge you do not walk out them doors carrying baggage that's not yours if Satan gave it to you and you carried it in here let's send it back to Hell tonight that's where it came from that's where brother Branham said that's where where Christ took it when she when God hung him on the cross he took it to hell he took your sins to hell he took your sickness to hell he took your fear your anxiety your depression he took it to hell and Satan keeps trying to hand it back let's hand it back to him tonight so if you got a need I'm gonna have uh brother Jesse sing this song my son picks at me all the time because I have him sing the song I wasn't that loved so I love this song and Jesse does a wonderful job on it so if you've got a need we'll uh we'll pray for you we like to pray God bless you

maybe the truth I'm getting over my you but I will never be over the hill never be over the hill I'll never ever be over calary cuz it was their sins power over me was taken away oh happy day overcome

got over the hill yet have you we're talking about the hill of Calvary of course than once people really come in contact with that reality it changes our life doesn't it I'm so happy that I'm I was able as a boy to be able to see that reality years ago and I don't mind telling you I love him tonight more than I've ever loved him greet you tonight sure missed you all good to see you appreciate the goodness of the Lord to us let's turn to U First Peter chapter 1 tonight Lord willing I guess we're still having the we're having the question answers tomorrow night for the Youth at 6:30 we'll be having it in here and um the youth asked me if if um if we would do this so um some of the questions I've had for a month or so some at least three weeks and I've been studying on them for for a bit so last Wednesday night I was going to preach what I'm going to preach tonight and then we was going to do question answers on Thursday night but we got snowed out of course and couldn't do it but what I want to speak to you tonight on is what is the Holy Ghost I'm sure every one of you would surely be able to give me an answer what you think it is no doubt not just a little bit but on the latest Foundation tonight we're because the first question that I want to answer tomorrow night is how can I know G so the Lord just put it on my heart that if we want to be able to know we've got it might need a refresher what it is so we can know what it is got know uh what it is in your life and before we start let me just say it this way the Holy Ghost is not jumping the Holy Ghost is not sh the Holy Ghost is not in motion right the Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues but the Holy Ghost does all so what is the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of God in us so to say that the Holy Ghost is shouting and say that God is a shout or God is a tongue or God is a feeling or God is an emotion but we know that God is a spirit and the Holy Ghost is the attribute of God could be divided divided so the spirit of Christ which refers to what the Old Testament prophets had if you notice we read here in First Peter tonight that it does not say Jesus because Jesus the human body of God never existed in the old so it's not Jesus that Elijah had on Jesus that Moses had in him but it was the spirit of what Christ CH anointed one First Peter 1 verse 10 so the question answers are for alls and we'll be streaming it for those of you that like to stream as well and I believe you'll be blessed amen so if you can listen this careful now 1 Peter 1: 10 of which salvation the prophets have inquired and search diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify Peter says he doesn't say Jesus the humanity of God was in them but the spirit of Christ and it was actually in the prophets that come in them like it did Ezekiel but it did not seal their soul so that's what Peter called the spirit of Christ when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow so the sufferings and then the glory that should follow of course that order and the glory is going to be the glory of the Resurrection but not only that but the glory of the church but it testified before him the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you wow so that first church they Le in vir that's the way God started his church that's way in his church so it was reported unto you by them which have preached the gospel unto you now listen this carefully with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into okay which things the Angels desire to look into now look at the screen there at what the word look means to stoop to a same in order to look at it if you can imagine in your mind ton that every one of you that have the Holy Ghost in your soul it is so overwhelm in and so great to the angels of God that they actually sto and they're looking we should never take Grant look at that meaning to look at with the head bowed forward to look into with the body bent so they don't just stand up real proud and sophisticated but they actually are looking they're trying to understand what in the world how God love them people we're with you all that Amen to suit and to look into metaphorically to look carefully into to inspect curiously yeah so it's like you're looking at something you just you got that look on your face in bewilderment you think wow body armorock orange Clementine wow I wonder what this going tast like and the angels are looking at God deals with us DAV think how can he how could he forgive them how can he put up with and what they have he in them I hope you understand that God uses the church as a school to teach his angels W to look carefully into to expect curiously one of who would become acquainted with something so they're so curious that they like to become acquainted with with that was the Angel's desire to look into so here it portrays the stretching of the neck and the bending of the body to be able to gaze upon some wonderful s that are struck with all yeah as you have the Holy Ghost on thank you Lord thank you Lord father that just about leaves us speechless to think that what you have done in human beings is so great I'm so curious that the angels of God study it in such a curious manner to try to relate to it father I pray you would help us toight would you open our understanding may we be able to leave this place [Music] over and becomes a demon there is no Redemption for the demon ad then demons could live inside of us when we were lost and we can be redeemed but that spirit that was inhabiting our could not be so they look at it in such a curious Manner and try to understand so the Redemption of the Saints and then also this infinite being holds such Marvel to them of his work not only Redemption for us but his work of incarnation that he would come to the Earth and become one of us and so much that he would bleed and die in pain and sorrow and Agony and scream from the cross my God my God why is s foren and they still are looking in this curious manner to understand every generation is different every age of what they go through I wonder how curious they must be tonight of us in this age the darkest most terrible age a person could live and they look with bewilderment at us as God deals with us in Mercy and Grace saves us sanctifies us fills us with the Holy Ghost and then they see us still as humans and we make mistakes and fall short of the glory of God and they see the plan of reconciliation that they say father please forgive me I'm so sorry and they see the mercy of God as it eliminates that sin never to be remembered against us again and they're looking at and thinking how that how can you do that and he don't even remember it how could it be that he that he just totally obliterates that sin and it'll never be remembered against again and they're looking with their bodies bent and their neck stretched and they're trying to comprehend you think the great work of what God has done is it any Wonder Satan hates the True Church of the Living God w't you notice in Ephesians 3:9 that Paul says and to make men all all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ notice the order now Jesus Humanity Christ anointed so anointed Humanity now Paul is bringing it from the stage of the invisible logos to show us that that invisible logos became a man and was crowned with Glory the anointing to the intent that now to the principalities and Power ERS in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God so again principalities is the beginning of the creation of angelic beings Aro so it's the first one in order so Paul broke into it in a little different way than God allowed Peter to and he says to the intent so the purpose is that the principalities and powers and Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God and manifold is the word variegated yall know what a variegated plant is so a variegated plant will have green and light green and I have green and white it's actually and there'll be couple of three different colors sometimes in there and you never know exactly how each Leaf will be so Paul says this is what God did God chose to manifest his manifold wisdom not in angels not in charans but by the church the church the Ecclesia of God the called out of God people who leave their homes and gather in a public place and by their own walk and they're the variegated body of God some were drunk some were alive some were this and that and God brings them all together by the variegated manifold wisdom of God and the angels are still trying to figure it out how can this be how can he love them right now he says that it not be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God the angels are not participants in Salvation the Angels do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Angels do not experience deity in the way you now in a simplified form the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your soul is your portion of deity yes sir from the God Amen it is your portion of deity that once you get in here it will be yours forever you will never that's right it is always yours now remember this is what the Holy Ghost is it is the part of God I know it's difficult for us even looking at the Father and Son relationship because we judge it by human terms and human perception so you would look and say well father and son so here's Brother D Swanson he is a father and then we look at his sons and say well them sons and they they look a little bit different than day and our makeup is a little bit different than the day and that's the way we judge God him but remember Jesus said God is a spirit God is not a man God is Not Not a Human Being right God is a spirit and God never had a permanent human body unto Jesus his word his son come on the earth then from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it will this part now this was God's Humanity he was both human and God is that right so the truth then of God was made manifest in the human body the Lord Jesus so now the manifold wisdom of God will be made manifest not just in Jesus but actually in the church so the Holy Angels are taught by the instrumentality of the church how in the world could a bunch of weaklings a bunch of former Sinners former Liars drug addicts everything of the world you can imagine and God would use them to teach Angels you imagine God speaking to them and say you want to know more about me watch me in my church you want to understand me greater you archangels you cherubims you seraphim you zoom Watch How I deal with my bride Hallelujah so they catch a view of God's Supreme love in a way that they didn't see it in the universe so the prophet tells us to his opinion the first thing that God made was Angels then he become into the position or the object of worship which is God before that he was the Eternal the Eternal so there was no one to worship him so it wasn't God because God is the object of worship so there had to be something to worship him so he created angels and actually the Angels the Fallen Angels actually fell before the foundation of the world was ever Le so they were there when he started creating this aspect of the universe and they never saw with the trillions of Angels the billions of stars and they never saw the great display of his wisdom in the way that they see it and you and I so here the church then becomes God's school for Angelic beings notice in Hebrews chap 1:14 are they not all ministering Spirits talking about the angels of God are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation so their Ministry is for The Heirs on the earth that's going to receive salvation so this within itself makes them more Curious to be able to look into it I wonder how many times them angels have been around us I wonder how many accidents that the angels of God have stopped you from having when Satan laid a a snare or trap or whatever and an angel of God stood between you and that truck or that car or maybe you got out and you was fixing a head somewhere and and you forgot something back at the house and you had to go back and get it and if you would have been 5 minutes earlier you've been right in the middle of a terrible terrible accident God has appointed the angels to watch over you not only to watch but to minister wonder what they're ministering so they minister to those that are Heirs of Salvation so they comprehend they're trying to look imagine these angels they some of the same ones that were assigned to Noah they were the same ones that was assigned to Paul and assigned to the first church age on down to the seventh and they're still pondering and looking at what God did through Paul and looking at us today they're saying they're similar but they're so different look at them and what they're dealing with they're living in the the most terrible age that's ever been on the earth and yet it seems like they're at their wits in sometimes and they don't know what to do but father will allow me to be able to give them a little boost and they don't even know where it comes from but it's like they're all alone and he'll he'll send a message to me and I'm their angel to watch over them and I will get down near where they are are and from my being projects a supernatural strength and they're thinkinking lord I can't go another day I don't think I can put up with anything else and all of a sudden I'm allowed to send a charge through them like a battery and where they were standing there with their heads bowed and crying and in the next moment tears are running out of their eyes and they're saying thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus they didn't even know it was me standing right there by him amen oh Hallelujah to God so what is the Holy Ghost you see the Holy Ghost is not Jesus the human body of God living in US you understand that so God did not divide the human body and give you an eye you an ear you a piece of hair there was not enough Humanity in that body the body itself served as a carrier of the sacrificial blood but the token was not the body of Jesus now listen carefully the token was not even the chemistry of the blood but the token was the spirit which was inside the body that was not enough chemistry in the body of the Lord Jesus if you'd give every one of us a drop of that blood as we say and the songwriters write about it it makes a good song but it's not really true the blood literally is not applied to Your Heart Right There was not enough chemistry inside that body to do it but God was able to hide in the blood cell so what is the Holy Ghost the attribute of God which could be divided you understand the Eternal himself and that original attribute could not divide himself into multiple portions and send it around the world I wonder how many people tonight on the face of the Earth have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's the exact same holy ghost that Peter got on the day of Pentecost and let me just say this tonight in case you're wondering you late folks don't have a lesser Holy Ghost than what preachers have got and US regular preachers don't have a lesser Holy Ghost than what the prophet had it's the same Holy Ghost right but it's our calling and so on that makes us different you young people have got the same Holy Ghost so there's not like a young people version of the Holy Ghost so there in heaven you know God's got a special young people version and that's why young people can listen to rock and roll gospel because they're Holy Ghost allows them it's exactly the same holy ghost that us old people have got so if it is is it should be the same way we should act the same way now let me just go on and say so then the Chinese people that get the Holy Ghost get the same Holy Ghost then the Mexican people right get the same Holy Ghost uh uh the Native Americans get the same Holy Ghost of people in in Czechoslovakia and Poland and all around the world exact same Holy Ghost is that right so then you see whenever God sends a message globally around the world and sends the spirit of Christ into the hearts of those True Believers then this is why the standard of Holiness righteousness Purity and holding to that same gospel can be the same no matter where you are unless of course you hold on to your tradition over the top of the teaching of the word now you find that of course you go into different places and you'll find that they hold on to their original tradition which you're not supposed to do it's you're supposed to be baptized into one mystical body by the Holy Ghost so let's look now so how the Holy Ghost came Acts chapter 2 you're all familiar with it how the Holy Ghost came Acts 2 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting wow what a strange way to get the Holy Ghost they wasn't even at an altar nobody was beating them on the back nobody was taking that g no they were all setting now listen to me this is the only time in the book of Acts that it happened quite this way now it happened of course in Cornelius it actually happened in Acts 19 but nowhere else does it mention exactly in this same way of a rushing Mighty Wind Now read your Bible and you'll find that out watch what God did suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it bu all the house the house the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire now this is the original breaking up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it was like this big Pillar of Fire comes into the upper room and he started whipping around in the room and a lick went off and went clothing tongues of fire begin to set upon each of them notice what it says and it set upon each of them so he didn't say that the fire the burning fire actually went in them read your Bible but it sat so it came and set upon them this is the original dividing of God separating himself s into this attribute where that this is the first time it's ever happened since the dawn of creation that more than a prophet more than just one man in the age would be able to have the spirit of Christ that would testify of what he's going to do but here they are 120 people and it's visible God wanted them to be able to see it that's what I said God never done this in another place in the book of Acts but this was a visible appearing so here you've been looking around 120 of them and you have saw pillar fire there lick over him one over her one over him one over her one over a young person one over another person and it was visible God wanted them to see what he was doing he was dividing himself into this attribute now notice in verse four and they were all filled wow notice how it happens though suddenly there come a sound of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and set upon each of them and then they were all filled with the Holy Ghost one sign leading to another signs to get their attention no wonder that Paul in the book of Corinthians talked about tongues and prophet prophecy about one being assigned to the believer and one was assigned to the unbeliever and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues now notice they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance I love the meaning of this word I can't believe it I honest cannot believe it that I've been preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost now for how many every years I've been preaching and I had never actually looked up the word utterance until today but boy am I glad I did today I want you to look at what this word means speak force not a word of everyday speech but one belonging to dignified and an elevated discourse and the spirit was giving them a dignified elevated discourse well I reckon this is a bunch of ignoramuses they were ignorant and unlearned can you imagine as they begin to speak this way and they were looking around and they were speaking Arabian they were speaking Spanish they were speaking Chalan they were speaking Hebrew they were speaking all these different languages and they were looking at each other and just speaking in these languages they never knew these languages but it was the spirit of God giving them utterance now I realize there's people around the message today they say we're Way Beyond that and we don't need that you show me where he took it out I'll preach the same thing now I do believe that as the people of God we should never major on a minor but I am enough of a musician to know that if a songwriter writes a song and puts miners in the song even if you don't think they belong there and you sing them without it the song will not sound the same without them and it just so happens that the author of the New Testament song put minors in with Majors so when he minored I want to minor with him when he majored I want to Major if he diminishes if he goes to a seventh or a ninth or an argumented whatever he does I want to follow it I to be honest with you I really don't care if you think it sounds good or not because I'm not playing for you I'm playing for him amen that's the way you should look at it as well I'm not here tonight every one of you should look at it exactly the same I'm not here tonight to just necessarily please the church I'm not here tonight to please my wife my husband my family I'm here to please God if some of us would get that out of our mind I think we'd Worship the Lord a little a little bit more than what we do but we're scared to death somebody's going to think we're Pentecostal I'm scared they're going to think I ain't all right now notice in verse 38 whenever Peter begins and the the the 120 go out and the people out there they look at them and they're acting so peculiar and odd and they said they're drunk now do you honestly think they would have said they were drunk had they been setting like this you see us in the message many of us have quit saying amen and instead we nod I wonder what hadie R would have got from God if she would have nodded you see the prophet did not tell her hady because you nodded but he said you said the right thing God wants to hear your amens God wants to hear you see it's not just the preacher that wants to hear them God wants to hear them now Peter's in and they move outside and they're kind of Staggering around and you know my goodness what in the world is wrong with them people and they said well they're trunk and they said no no no it ain't that this is just the third hour of the day while the saloons and taverns ain't even open yet it's the morning time so this is the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel so they begin to say well what what must me what must we do them to get what y'all got then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost H what' he say in the name of Jesus Christ you mean to tell me that he stands right there and says the exact opposite of what Jesus said in Matthew 2819 no he actually said the same thing cuz father ain't a name I'm a father but that ain't my name how many men in here our fathers yes sir so is Father your name brother Matthew so the children go to say father father father father how many of us men would say yes yes so Peter says you got to repent you got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and your children to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call acts 5:32 for we Are Witnesses of these Saints so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that that obey him which is the main reason more people don't have it to them that obey him so this is how it comes acts 8:14 now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent they sent I want you to know Peter and John didn't go on their own read your Bible they didn't go on their own they were sent praise the Lord they sent unto them Peter and John who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was fallen on none of them only they oh no they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus oh my goodness you mean to tell me the Apostolic Church baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus amen is this your Bible Well if you haven't been baptized that way then I ask you tonight why acts 10:43 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins notice through his name verse 44 while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which had heard the word now want you notice in the three accounts that we're reading here about the Holy Ghost coming none of them are exactly identical amen isn't it amazing though how that we want everybody to get it the same way we did and we think boy if you didn't shout you didn't get it if you don't run you didn't get it if you don't speak in tongues if you don't jerk your head a certain way you didn't get it that's not following the book of Acts pattern well come on now and they of the circumcision in which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles now listen to me the Jews were very very set in their National thinking in one sense of the word they were still yet to be enlightened that there was a gentile bride they were shocked Harry they were shocked astonished you mean them dogs got the Holy Ghost this the same one that we got how is that PO possible we are Abraham's chosen race we are Abraham's chosen people how in the world could they get the Holy Ghost come on you see the mystery of the Gentile bride had not yet been made known and God wanted to prove to them Jews look I'm giving the Holy Ghost the exact same one you got to them Gentiles aren't you glad praise the Lord and as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost now I want you to notice what they done for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God but ain't it amazing in every other place it does and say that they spoke in tongues wonder why this is significant because they was looking at it still through the tongue aspect and God said okay I see you're hung up on the tongues so I'm going to let this Bunch speak in tongues too so it'll convince you all that they got the same thing you got did they have to to have the Holy Ghost no oh my for they heard them speak with tongue and magnify God then answered Peter can any forbid water that these should not be baptized which has received the Holy Ghost as well as we now watch this is God pouring out of himself and he's dispersing himself and the angels of God now this is what's going on in the the visible realm but in the invisible realm now the angels of God are being divided so it's like a subdivision being built in a mystical Kingdom so the angels are being divided and they're not only now just watching Jews but some of the angels for the first time in their existence of their creation they're watching over heathens former Gentiles heathens you imagine the angels of God being assigned to former Gentiles which were idolators oh my and they never they never had done this before it was Daniel you know it was it was some great king over in the Old Testament it was some great king Uzziah or Joshua and for the first time in their existence they're being assigned to Gentiles praise the Lord and he said unto them now watch this is Paul going to the upper coast of Ephesus and the prophet you know in order so we'd be able to relate to it he he said he found a bunch of Baptist up there and they hadn't got the Holy Ghost yet so he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they were some message people and they said unto him we've not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost now I find this absolutely amazing because they were following John the Baptist two dispensations had changed and they were behind two dispensations so they hadn't even heard of the Holy Ghost which again I find strange since John had it from his mother's womb his mother got it and his father got it and they hadn't even heard about it so it goes to show you that you can follow a prophet's message and still not have the Holy Ghost now this is pretty pitiful to me oh my and he said unto them unto what notice what unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism so see there are two dispensations behind so John did not baptize in a name now John was not the first one to baptize the ases baptized the zealots baptized so there was different ones that baptized but John was the first one to baptize point in unto a Messianic Advent and he'd say You Must Believe on him which is to come on him which is to come he didn't have no name cuz you weren't sure who he was yet so these people now several years after the Lord Jesus had come and gone several years after the Holy Ghost had been given and they were still baptizing people in this same way you've got to believe on him which is to come but there was some seed among them Baptist there still might be today praise the Lord and he said unto them then what were you baptized and they said unto John baptism then said Paul John verely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him now Paul can give the name that is on Christ Jesus know how he places the order here now Christos anointed Humanity so it's anointed Humanity Christ Jesus you know that the New Testament when the angel of God appeared to Mary and also on to Joseph and spoke his name it did not call him Lord Jesus Christ he was not called that until the book of Acts why he was CHR Christos the anointed one out the river he was named Jesus Jesus the human Jesus when the father came in him at the river he was jeus Christos but he was Lord Jesus Christ after he raised from the dead for God has made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost oh praise be to God notice so here them Paul tells them John baptized the people and tells them what he said they should believe on him which should come which is that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized wow so is there anyone here tonight or anyone that will listen to this if you can show me in the book of Acts or in recorded history of the first century of the church second century as well where the original Church baptized using the titles of father son Holy Ghost I will stand here next Wednesday night and say I was wrong right or of course you can let me re-baptize you tonight cuz you ain't going to find it this is the way the true church baptized praise the Lord now notice how they get the Holy Ghost and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied now notice different from what happened in the upper room and different from what happened when Peter spake the word and they spake the word and when he done it then they just receive the Holy Ghost by by hearing the word but here and this is where the Prophet picks it up of course and he said the apostolic way of receiving the Holy Ghost is to have hands laid on you but notice it does not say in Acts two that when they got the holy ghost that they prophesied but these Believers in the upper coast of Ephesus did so which one are we going to use to say well that's the right way all of them are all of them are a't it amazing that God didn't make every one of them exactly the same so this and spoken tongue this and spoken tongues this and prophesied this and shouted don't you understand what Satan's trying to do he's trying to make a denominational thing out of even receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the message people that lean more toward the emotion and the ecstatic explosion of all of that everybody that don't have that you ain't got it the ones that are more still on the other side and they produce stillborn children well bless God it's a you know the Holy Ghost without sensation you don't have no sensation and no emotion and somehow you just grow into it you know you're just one day you'll just wake up and realize that you've been born again how in the world can that ever happen how can a man that's as lost as lost can be not realize that God has changed his nature oh praise the Lord Now watch how the prophet dealt with what the Holy Ghost actually is and what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the spirit of Christ in you now before we read I just like to say a few commoning words here what is the Holy Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a covenant What is the Holy Ghost it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost then it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you so then it's not emotion it's not shouting though it will bring all types of effects some spoke in tongues some prophesied and yet it's amazing now look you know I believe in Emotion I believe in worshiping God and yet none of those scriptures that we read when they receive the Holy Ghost do we find where any of them as we say today shouted now brother Donnie don't you believe in that I do but I do not believe in making shouting an Evidence of the Holy Ghost you won't find that in the book of Acts as a matter of fact you won't even find where they shouted in the way that we think shouting is don't you believe in the quickening power of God I do and I don't like it when we make a denomination out of it that's exactly what some people are doing they're making a denomination what do you mean a denomination it's where everybody has to do it this way right here because this way's been declared my men it's not declared in the book of acts if it is you show me you preachers that won't like this you send me the scriptures and I'll apologize show me show me what they shouted and they they did all of that I believe in all of that but it is not an Evidence any more than other evidences that we make well somebody say amen and we can see how that these these different examples that God gave and every time that it came it was a little bit different well someone say well how did you get the Holy Ghost I got his sitting right here and her preacher preach the word well they might go up to Ephesus said brother tell me how you got the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what Paul laid his hands on me well my Lord what in the world you must not be near as much of a Believer as I am I sat right there and heard that word hallelujah you know how we are about that I sat right there and heard that word GL to God I'll tell you one thing I'm so spiritual I sat right there and heard the word of God and I sat right there man alive that eternal life entered into me and the other say well Paul laid his hands on me and I got it does it really matter does it really matter whether you were sitting or standing or rolling in the floor like a Holy Roller does it really matter the most important thing is what you got it you got it so whether you spoke in tongues and prophesied or you fell out in the floor you got it how do I know it changed you forever now watch brother Brandon preached this in 1959 and he preached the first service what is the Holy Ghost second service you know what is it given for and then the third service he preached how will you know you got it which I find it so amazing that they recorded it but it's never yet been released and then yet he does question answers so you saying isn't that strange isn't that odd that he would actually allow that to be released well let me say it to you this way it was not released in 1959 but the mystery of it was going to be released when he reti titled it and called it the token so how you going to know well brother Donnie if you're a woman your hair go out and you have a long dress and and if you're a brother you you'll uh you know you dress this way and that way and Men of course won't wear dresses to church and Men won't wear you know this and that look like a woman and that's the way you know it no that's not the way you'll know it that is part of it but you will be changed from what you were unto a brand new creature in Christ Jesus and the church said amen now he said what did the Holy Spirit what did it come for what did he come in you for what did he come in me for now listen it's quite simple was to continue the works of God to continue the works of God now remember part of these things were limited when the Lord Jesus come on the earth he's going to now sh share things of nature that had not been done since Adam lost it in the fall he's going to share things over animals and over nature and over storms that had not been replicated since the Fall In the Garden of Eden he's going to reverse nature he's going to reverse the cycle of death and go to a man's grave and he's been laying there for 4 days and his nose had fallen in and the skin worms were eating on his body and by the spoken word of God he's going to call that man's name and he'll come out of that grave is that right now he didn't just do that for himself and said now look at me you all can't do this but I want you to see what I am but what you all do you just go to church and you try to live right and you try to be be as good good as you can but he said now I'm showing you all what to do and I want you to act like me talk like me preach like me live like me raise the Dead Like Me cast out devils like me yeah now remember he says here that the Holy Ghost was given that we might continue the works of God remember the blind man and St John 11 whenever the disciples said Lord who s this man or his parents and Jesus said neither one but that The Works of God might be made manifest and then of course in another place in John they asked him and said Lord what might we do to do the works of God and he said this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent so the works of God then incorporates healing miraculous but it also means you're able to get in line behind the godall leader of the age and a god call Pastor and so on and so on that's also part of the works of God Jesus knew every woman was not going to cast out Devils Hallelujah come here devil I'm ready for you he knew the daughters of God was not going to do that th and sharan went to Brother Bram said brother brandham I fasted and fasted to cast out devils and I still can't do it he said you're not called to do such he said but you're called to fast and pray for those who are called to cast them out and you said well I can't do nothing brother Donnie's called to do that and brother Joe and brother Daryl and brother Joel these other brother Jonathan these other brothers that are called whoever they are but I can't do nothing yes you can you can pray for me and you can pray for the rest of these brothers because we're not dealing with a little video saying when you're dealing with a demon you're dealing with a fallen angel oh what a comfort it is to know that the saints of God are praying for you so what do we do we continue the works of God which is what building a church having church membership really so it's not just going to church every now and then whether you feel like it or not and and you know you drop a little money in and and you really don't believe in ping ties and you really don't believe in walking right and doing right and you know you just you just go to church that's the work of God that's the way Jesus did the Bible says that Jesus on the Sabbath day went to the synagogue which was his custom so lets me know a lot of the folks around the message don't have the custom of Jesus cuz Jesus went to church and if they really believe what them tapes say they don't because their feet testify they're voting with their feet not with their mouths then they would know exactly that the prophet tells us even Christ The Mystery of God revealed that if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open you see the reason people don't feel that way they're missing God in their heart well come on somebody if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to come open and he said if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got to pray it come on somebody let's say what the tapes say praise the Lord now I love the way that he goes on down in this paragraph a little further and he said the Jesus that sends you goes with you and is in you and if that Spirit living in Jesus Christ made him do and act the way he did you'll have some general idea of how it will do what it's in you because that life cannot change it'll go from body to body but it cannot change its nature listen what it is now for it is God your baptism of the Holy Ghost is your portion of God now you all educate me for a bit dogs bring forth help me now educate me some of y'all been wanting to teach me a few things so help me now cats bring forth horses bring forth so what would God bring forth if he brought forth children say it come on you you can do it come on that's it come on come on honey say it say it what would God bring forth gods in humanity but you see we look so much at our Humanity we suppress the Divine Supernatural and what you and I suppress the angels of God are looking at in amazement and they just are mesmerized by about what's inside of us and we're saying well I ain't nobody I don't ever amount to nothing I guess you know I just make so many mistakes and they're looking at every one of them mistakes and you make and they're not even thinking that about you at all they think don't they know what he told them don't they know what he said that he don't even see their mistakes don't they know that that blood that he shed on the cross don't they know that it ain't no wonder that they look at us and they thinking you know I how how could he love them he gave his life he gave his word he gave his Bible then he sends a message with over 1100 sermon and then they still question does he even love them it's a there's said what in the world is it going to take for them bunch of Noe heads that's Kentucky language translated into Angelic language I guess what's he going to take for them to realize how much he cares and they're looking at you daily and thinking if you only knew what I knew about you thank you Lord praise be to God notice this what is the Holy Ghost again what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ in you the comforter that's the Holy Spirit when the comforter has come he'll do the things that I've done while the comforter is in me so it's a very same father that was in Jesus except he had the fullness all of that fullness was in him but it was the fullness that was going to be divided think of how great he is he could divide himself into millions of parts and he is no less that great August presence around the throne is no less being subdivided into how many ever pieces that he is and he's still as great upon the throne as he ever was before he divided himself now here he is he he on the throne and yet he's on the earth and he's in the United States and he's in Ohio and he's an Africa he's in India and and the angels of God are looking and say I didn't know he was this big I didn't know he was this great I saw that light I saw that shakina I saw that Glory I didn't realize you mean every time they get the Holy Ghost that's him that's him inside of them oh my God how great he is how wonderful he is and they're just saiding oh how awesome how wonderful he is he's everywhere I didn't know he's everywhere they knew he was Everywhere by his omnipotence and by his omnipotence but they didn't know he was going to be everywhere by dividing himself and baptizing himself into a little white boy and a little black girl and a little Indian a little Native American and a swed and a German and so baptizing with the love of God that they by nationality might have great differences but they'll be able to put their arms around one another and say brother I love you sister I love you why it's God don't you understand God in Me will love God in you that don't mean My Flesh will love everything about yours I'm going to say something shocking it don't mean you're going to like everything about me but if God's in you you can't hate God in Me and if God's in me and in you I can't hate God in you we might disagree on the flesh but how can God hate [Applause] God so the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a sign it's a comforter watch paragraph 16 what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate it's an advocate what does it do oh oh Jesus it has Mercy it stands in your place it does things you can't do or say Brother D you're talking about perfect love and all that I just can't do that of course you can't I can't either none of us can do it there's only one that could do that and that was the Lord Jesus but God wants to come in Us in such a way well you say how come some people can do it easier than others it's because they've learned how to submit the key is the more we submit the more he can take over oh praise God it does things you can't do it's a perpetuation for your sins don't you understand you don't need an altar in the church in the sense with blood on it and mercy you make a mistake tomorrow say oh goodness I've got to run by 490 okalona Road and be able to have the brother still at me in the sanctuary so I go up in the front and kneel down no you packed your altar Oh Glory to God you pack your altar and you pack your eternity your eternity is there you pack the blood The Mercy Seat the forgiver The Advocate you carry it with you so you don't have to wait till Sunday to come back and say Lord I'm so sorry I messed up on on Thursday and I've been waiting all week Lord to get back I'll tell you friend you don't have to wait till Thursday evening you don't have to wait till Friday you just bow your head Lord please forgive me I'm sorry Lord please forgive me and the advocate in you will plead your case hallelujah hallelujah oh my it's your righteousness it's your healing you know but friend I I I guess I just I don't understand I I I guess I just don't understand why is it that so many want to just preach the holy ghost that it's all healing it's all miracles it's all signs it's all wonders it's all emotion what about this part right here and preach the Holy Ghost in such a place brother if you look crosseyed to somebody you're about lost you ain't even got it you mess up one time and you make one mistake brother you ain't got the Holy Ghost well if he's not going to have to be an advocate for me why in the world do I need an advocate if after I get it boy I'm fine from that day on I'll never make a mother mistake you ain't preaching the Bible holy ghost on well somebody said amen it's a perpetuation for your bleep what there's a brave person here who was that you brother me thank you so it's a perpetuation for your sins Lord have mercy you don't mean to tell me people of the Holy Ghost is going to fall short of the glory of God it's your righteousness brother Donnie I'll have you to know glory to God I got her 40 years ago I ain't sin since you just sin right then you big liar who do you think you're fooling only yourself cuz you for sure ain't fooling us and you ain't fooling the devil it's your righteousness listen what it is it's your healing you're sick here tonight your healer is living in [Music] you praise be to God if your faith can only contact that what is in you Jesus Christ the healer is in you amen it's your healer it's your life it's your Resurrection it's our all that God has for you he's an advocate what is the Holy Ghost the rest come unto me all you that labor near heavy lad and I will give you rest what is he the one that comes in you gives you peace your sign your comforter oh praise God comforted that rest sealed if you feel the least TG don't turn it away what is the Holy Ghost God in you what's it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together wow to a place in this day far beyond Lutheran Methodist and Pentecostal and to a place to adoption and rapturing Grace this is the only way the bride will ever be able to get together friends we are as divided now if not more so than we have ever been in this message I hate to tell you it's a shame really it's a shame we are so divided and so split up it it it's heartbreaking it's absolutely heart heartbreaking preachers preaching at one another and throwing quotes at one another and throwing scriptures at one another and churches divided young people divided it's pitiful who's the blame for a lot of it preachers are to blame for a lot of it Amen brother Donnie you going to keep on Sir you're going to get me fired but he'll fire me up if I don't tell it so I'd rather y'all Farm it than him Farm me up noce into a place to adoption of rapture Grace that when this part of the church listen what he's waiting on when the spirit moves into this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth all the redeemed that's touched that Spirit no wonder brother Daryl the angels of God are looking at it and say father now you're you're if I understand this right you're not bringing no Resurrection until everyone I'm get to Holy Ghost is that right that's right and according to what them preachers are saying down there you imagine Angels listening to preachers to be updated on what's Happening Lord have mercy so according to what them men are saying you're you're going to bring your people to together for rapturing Faith and it will be their faith when they come to The Headstone crying Grace Grace that when when they come to that spot when they arrive there it'll be such a cosmic upheaval that the dead will be raised father are we getting that right and father said yep that's what's going to happen my church will actually arrive to that place of maturity and the devil's holding his sides laughing you got to be kidding me I don't never happened uh devil maybe I should take you back to Acts chapter 2 on the day of Pentecost them men that you laughed at and said this church won't last three or four days but when that Pillar of Fire come down and divided himself They Live Like Jesus they healed the sick like Jesus they died like Jesus they preach the gospel they rais the dead that same Lord Jesus said he will have a bride in the last day Hallelujah he will have a bride in the last day that will come to the fullness of that maturity again at this time unlike Paul the alpha bride did not cause a resurrection but the Omega bride will glory to God glory to God thank you Lord list stand let me finish this quote here for you it'll bring forth them redeemed that's touched that Spirit those Lutheran who stood there with all the light they had in justification those methodists that fell on the floor and they throw water in their face from the spirit striking them through sanctification those Pentecostals that walked up and down the streets and they called them Tong deong what in the world that ever means and jabberers and Goose language and all of that they'll stand in the righteous in the sight of God at that day just as certain as this Bible stands in here oh my Lord imagine the day it'll be when the Lord Jesus is at wor steps behind the curtain and takes off his Priestly garments when the angel you'll see him rise from the throne and he steps off the platform we say and when he comes out he's got on his marriage garments you understand Peter's never seen him yet Paul's never seen him the Saints in the sixth Dimension haven't seen him yet it would be Unbecoming for them to see him with blood on his garments so he changes close imagine when David come in from slaying the Philistines and laid the forkins of those Philistines down before Saul he did not go directly and take Mall imagine he must have went changed clothes took a bath got Philistine sweat off of him Philistine blood off of him when the Lord Jesus steps out and the angel see him for his first time the bridegroom closed of all they've seen out of him they've never seen him look like this can you imagine the smile I know it maybe seem hard for you to comprehend but the Lord Jesus actually laughed when he was here on the earth I imagine one of his greatest laughs will be whenever he steps out and a smile comes upon his face and they're standing there looking at him and say I've never seen him smile like that and they look at one another and say you know what today is she's coming home him changing clothes is a sign you're fixing to amen praise God then those of us that are alive and and remain will change clothes all of a sudden a sweep will come over us and our muscles and our tissues and our bones and all of that will be changed Oh but before that happens our loved ones will start to appear first I told Carol the other day I said I want I want to you know I said you think about it as long as we've been here I've lost the count now but since ever I've been here 35 36 years whatever it is I buried over aund and some people through the years since I've been here I got to think about the other day I'm not sure my house big enough for all them folks to come in at one time I'm going have to build a bigger house cuz I guarantee you one thing when they raise but I imagine there'll be a little girl yes sir about this talk right her long blonde hair hanging down her back if anybody get in her away they say excuse me excuse me excuse me Hallelujah of course after she stops over the hill sees her husband and her children oh I can't wait to see brother Allen mckenny brother Homer Arnold sister clark brother Jean Littleton oh my it'll be one after another and then the prophet said you'll see your loved ones and you know it won't be long you're going to be changed so may I'll be standing there combing my hair you know for years y'all thought this was a teg it's still mine it's still mine it's all still there it didn't turn loose but it did turn gray thank you all for that y'all help do that and I may be standing in front of the mirror brother Rob I brush my teeth and I take the comb out you know I'm I'm combing it back and all of a sudden I run that comb through that gray and it goes and it'll be Browner than it was of that picture that's hanging out there the sister Sylvia wrote the poem about me years and years ago when I first came here and the wrinkles that go out of my face and I'll look and see my loved ones right the prophet said he knows how we are we'll be looking around to see did this one make it did that one make it so we get together with the rest of the group and you come up missing on the earth can you imagine think of it he says going beond the camp 1964 missing people they can't find you no more I wonder who in the world they are they can't find you no more I imagine humans and demons they said where' doy go where' doy go he was standing there brushing his teeth bam he's gone and then they go to communicate them back and forth what in the world happed to ke he was standing there one minute oh Lord my back oh Lord my knee oh Lord and somehow brother Jack maybe getting up on his things oh Jesus I don't know if I can make it another day or not and in a moment brother Jack was changed to a young man and there s sister bent right by and the devil said Lord have mercy what is it the move is on brother the move is on but I want to tell you it's on tonight too the move is on get filled with the Holy Ghost yeah barot children I'm not sure that I could preach a more serious sermon than tonight you may think well you know brother Donnie I'm kind of messed up in my Doctrine and you know maybe this and that I I already needed that tonight but if you can get filled every fiber filled with the Holy Ghost he'll take care of your Doctrine everything you'll have need of is in you then for your journey no doubt I've not buried the last one I'll probably have to bury more I've walked in front of the casket of many and stand there and say the last words over them stand by their bed and watch them take their last breath my life has been filled with so Much Death I hate death oh sometimes I wish I wasn't a preacher that makes sense to you I have to deal with so much sickness and so much turmoil so much sadness so much deaths thank God one day death will die praise God death will die hallelujah how many of you wouldd like to be remember tonight brother Donnie I I just just want to be sure maybe some of you are sure you've got a rest you know beyond the shadow of a doubt you've got the Holy Ghost but maybe you just need to refilling anybody here like that maybe some of you sick you need a healing maybe some of you fighting oppression whatever more you just need the presence of God to come this way look friend I'm not interested in trying to produce to you an AA Allen Revival a jackco Revival oh they had Great Signs wonders and miracles but I'm more concerned about being able by the grace of God to preach to you a gospel that'll produce the life of Jesus Christ then come the signs then come the Wonders then the signs will follow us instead of us following the signs I am not a sign follower I am a person that signs follow yeah that's the way it should be praise the lord lord Jesus as we bow our heads tonight father as we enter into your August courts I pray the presence of God would move across this place Lord we're sitting in a different type building than Peter and them were in Acts 2 different type of setting than they were no doubt at Ephesus the other places where the Holy Ghost come in the book of Acts that's changed we're glad we can say tonight the Holy Ghost is not changed would you come by this way tonight Lord so what are you once you enter into this attribute by which you can divide yourself then my brother Harry not being a preacher but yet has the same holy ghost that I have my nephew Justin my granddaughters both of my daughters my son-in-law WS the people here at the church the the ones that might feel like oh I'm so insignificant but yet if they have the Holy Ghost they've got exact same holy ghost that I've got the same one and their life is a mystery to angels as they watch them and they minister to them oh Lord God we need your ministering presence tonight father sometimes we go through so much in life Lord we don't know what to do would you send an Angel by our way Lord we know you sent one to Peter there in jail and I hope they take it the right way when I say it this way that was Jesus 2,000 years ago well we're not in a physical jail tonight but we still need angels to come to us L ministering spirits that are sent to minister to the air of Salvation wh what a what a what a thing and the word ministering deonia which is the very word that Deacon comes from so when they chose deacons in the book of Acts they were men that were chosen to minister so the deacons are never called to run the church but actually they placed the deacons in the church to be able to minister to the hungry and to be able to take care of the things like that and that's the Greek word that it com comes from Deacon deonia and it means minister to minister to can we grasp it tonight those great Heavenly beings are our deons you send a Heavenly being that's never said one bad word that's never had one thought of doubt them angelss have never had one thought of ever leaving you and you send them to me and to these people and your people around the world Lord God who would think of such that you would send the greater to minister to the Lesser unless of course the Lesser is actually hid and one day the Lesser will enter into such a stage of glorification that the angels of God will Circle the Earth's one day and bow their heads when the Resurrection The Rapture takes place and the prophet tells us those angels will circle the Earth with bowed heads as the redeemed go to singing the songs of your Redemption and mercy because they don't know what we're singing about they Minister about it and they minister to give us strength and courage and hope and all of that but they don't understand it oh Jesus I'm sorry I'm so sorry we've belittled this great thing you've done for us help us tonight Lord may we never look at our Holy Ghost the same way again praise the lord we worship you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah let's just let's just keep in this presence now I know you got to work tomorrow and you got school and all that but who knows there may not be a tomorrow in no way let's just take a few minutes as if though this might be our last service because it might be for somebody oh praise the Lord can we give him something tonight that an angel cannot can we funnel praise through redeemed lips something that Angels cannot do can we lift hands that were Unholy hands that hell beer cigarettes marijuana fifth of whiskey but now they're classified as holy hands lifting up holy hands praise God I hope you can understand it friends right here in this building tonight are the Angels of God and they are watching you they are watching in bewilderment don't make them wonder why you're not praise him don't make them wonder why that you're not giving him that fruit of your lips oh my but may they see the Fulfillment of Calvary tonight may they see why once again on a Wednesday night that Calvary was a success you know why I know because he saved me because he saved you I a testimony that Calvary worked praise be to God thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus there's a brother right here in our midst tonight came to our church several years ago first service he attended he was taking pills for this pills for that pills for something else one service in the presence of God God delivered him and set him free he's still living right tonight and stands right here in this building as a testimony Calvary was a success each one of you bear your own testimony of what God has brought you through and you stand here tonight and nobody can have your testimony you are unique and you're variegated in the body of God Don't You Love him thank you Lord don't you appreciate him Harry let's just sing a little something together whatever whatever's on your heart let's just Worship the Lord now a little bit before we go I'll try not to hold you too long if you need to go you go on but let's just worship him a little before we go praise God may we now Minister back to our husband brother bam talked about a wife and what a great thing she could be and a man comes in tired from work and he said he's weary and all that and his little wife meets him at the door and she comes in takes him by the hand and sets him down and she goes over and sets in his lap and puts her arms around him he said it just feels like it all goes away I wonder how many times since Sunday the Lord jesus' name has been taken in vain how many people said he don't even live there's no such thing as a God how he's been blasphemed how he's been ridiculed and criticized just in the last couple of days why don't we open the door and say come on in Lord Jesus let's take him by the hand let's take him by the hand and go over and set him down let's sit down in his lap I preached this several years ago in a convention and the Lord helped me to dramatize it like the Song of Solomon and how that she went and got him at the door door and she brought him in and she let him over and set him down and then she sat down on his lap and she took her arm and put around it and let her eyes which at one time could not even look in the face of God but now her Li her eyes looked at him and he was so mesmerized that he said turn away thine eyes for me for one of Thine Eyes has captured my eyes heart there was a brother there from Germany I heard him telling some other people after the service he said I've been a preacher for all these decades I've heard hundreds and thousands of sermons preached I've never heard anything like that in my life he said this is what I got out of it he didn't see me he said but this is what I got out of it that man actually has sat in the lap of Jesus I thought that's one of the greatest compliments I have ever been paid in my life it's one thing to say it but when you tell the story that you have experienced people can tell the difference don't you want to be able to tell the same story that you sat in the lap of Jesus and you put your arm around him and then you you move both of your hands upon his face and you just look into his eyes and you say have I told you today how much I love you I'll do Carol that way sometimes not near enough I'm sure I'll take it by the hands and I'll pull her real close and I'll say have I told you today how much I love you have I told you how much you mean to me and more times than not she'll say no tell me I want to hear it you Brothers need to do that your wife yes sir yes sir praise the Lord I want to do this in this case to my lovely Lord Jesus would you pardon me cuz right now I'm going to enter into that sacred place in behind the veil so actually you all are now without the court it's just me and him oh I love you I remember that day when you dealt with me and I didn't even know how to talk to you I didn't know how to pray so I had to ask my mama and she told me what she knew and I remember whenever I went down to that Altar and then medle boys

We know that you understand better than we could ever even better than we even better than we are when we're going through the trial. Lord, you you know exactly what it's like.

We'll sing an old Happy Valley Church of Jesus Christ song real quick. Amen. Go ahead and play a little bit of it, please. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; When [music] I come to the end of my journey, [singing] I live my lifetime for [music] this day alone. [singing] Well, I just saw the light.

[singing] I'm going to run [music] my last mile. Oh, [music] [applause] [music] that'll make a Baptist shout. It's hard to behave. I tell you what, we'll slow it down a little bit. My hope is in the Lord. The more I think about it, the more I look through my life and I think, man, I just when the times that I said, I don't need it. Don't need it. Nope. And then when I find myself where I am now, I can say I can sing the first line of this first verse with such firmity. Amen. Let's sing. I stand in [music] all [singing] within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom [singing and music] of the aes lies for whom the raging of [singing and music] the sea subides. [music] The [singing] living sacrifice. My [music] only [singing] source of life, my hope [music] is [singing] in the Lord. [music] From this time on and ever more. [singing] Oh my hope [music] is [singing] in the Lord forever more. [music] Let's worship him right here. His tender mercies [music] come with every [singing] rising sun to meet the sinner [music] in his brokenness. [singing] He offers healing [music] and forgiveness.

[music] Oh my hope [singing] is [music] in the Lord [singing] forever [music] more. Oh, [music] amen. Sister Bren, if you'll come, be getting ready to sing. [music] Let's sing through it all. I ain't got a clue on a key. Let's just worship him a little bit more. I'm sorry I get a little carried away. Actually, I'm not really all that sorry, but it's okay. We'll sing through it all. I've had many tears and [singing] sorrows. I've had questions for tomorrow. There have been times I didn't [singing] know right from wrong. [music] But in every situation, [music] God gave me blessed consolation [music and singing] that my trials come to only [music] make [singing] me strong. Let's sing a chorus. Oh, [music] through it all. Through it all, [singing and music] I've learned to trust in [music] Jesus. And I've [singing] learned to trust in [music] God. Oh, through it all. through [music] it all. [singing] I learned to depend upon his word. [music] Well, I've [singing] been a lot of places and I've seen a lot [singing] of faces, [music] but there have been times I felt [singing and music] so all alone. Hold in my lonely [singing] hours. Oh, those precious [music] lonely hours. Jesus [music] let me know that I [singing] was his own. Oh, [music] see through it all. through [music] it all. I learned to trust in Jesus and [music and singing] I learn to trust in God. Oh, through all through it all, [singing] [music] I've learned to depend upon his word. Let's sing this [music] last verse. Sing it with all your heart. [singing] Well, I thank God for my [music] mountains. I thank him for my [singing] valleyies. I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. [music] Oh, for if [singing] I never had a problem, how would I know that [singing] God [music] could solve it? How I know what faith his work [singing] can do. Oh, through it all. [music] Through it all, I've [music] learned to trust in Jesus. [singing] And I've learned to trust in [music] God. Through it all, [music] through it all, [music and singing] I've learned to depend upon his word. [music] Amen. Y'all are singing so good this morning, but you can be seated. Since Brianna, come and sing for us. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your goodness. [singing] Thank you for [music] your kindness. [singing] Thank you for all the things you [music] do. Jesus, thank you, Jesus. [music] [singing] I can hardly count [singing] the [music] times your grace has pulled me [singing] out. S and shame [singing] had left me bound. I once [singing] was lost, but [music] now I'm found. I once was lost, [music and singing] but now I'm found. Thank you for your [singing] goodness. Thank you for your kindness. Thank you for all the things you do, [singing] Jesus. Thank you. Thank you for your blessings. [singing] Thank you for a million little things. [singing and music] Thank you for the ways that you've come through. Jesus, thank you. Looking back, [singing] all I can see is a history [singing] of [music] miracles.

Jesus, [singing] thank you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus, thank you. Jesus, [singing] thank you. Amen. Let's all stand. Ask Ask Dad to sing probably one of his most well-known songs. And I'm just going to put the mic down and not sing a lick. Just get out the way. Amen. We'll ask him to sing Dove Lays the lamb before we have brother Donnie come brothers put the words up on the screen. [clears throat] You all probably know this as good as I do. But aren't you glad for the evening light? &gt;&gt; Like brother Donnie said here a while back. All these people that are trying to get us to turn away from following the prophet and the message. What have you got that you think's better? Where would we go? I mean, don't you feel that way? Where would Lord, where would I go to if I if I couldn't if I didn't have the message? Just take me out of this world. I thank God for the evening light. The spirit and the bride are saying [singing] come. [music] The elect [singing] are feeling the stir inside their heart. [music] Cuz our uniting [singing] time has come. We and the father [music] are one. [singing] [music] who will be with our Lord forever [music and singing] more. Oh, the evening light [music] has come. The bride is making [singing] preparation. We're [music] hearing the shout of our king. [music] The token man. [music] He's cleaning from inside [singing] and the dove leaves [music] a lamb once again. Fine linen clean [music and singing] and white was granted to her. She's [music] been washed in the blood [singing] of God's own son with [music] righteousness. It's not our [singing] own. We stand just before his [music] throne where [singing] we reign with our Lord forever [music] more. Oh, evening [music] light has come. The bride is making preparations. Today [music] we're hearing the shout [singing] of our king. [music] The token man. He's cleaning from [music] inside. And the dumb made a lamb once again. [music] Oh, the evening light has come. The bride is making [music and singing] preparation. We're still hearing the shout [music] of our [singing] king. The tokens [music] been applied. He's cleaning from inside [music and singing] and the t once [music] again. I'm glad the evening light [music] has come. The bride is making preparation. We're still [music] hearing the shout shout of our king. [music] The joken man. He's cleaning [music] from inside. [singing] The go leads the lamb once again. [music] I'm glad the lead [music] once again. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. That's wonderful. God bless you. You can be seated for just a couple of moments. I've got a baby to dedicate today. Brother Tyler and Sister Caitlyn, if I bring a little son, we'll dedicate him to the Lord today. And it a privilege for us to be together in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing it. &gt;&gt; Bring [music] them in. Bring them [singing] in from the [music] fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring [singing] them in. Bring the little ones to [music] Jesus. [singing] Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, what a great honor and a privilege it is another little child that we can bring into your presence. Lord, we can see the darkness and the chaos that's around us every day in the world that we live. If we didn't have you, it would be frightening to think that we would want to bring children into this world in its present state. But Lord, we're grateful that we're not just bringing them into this life, but we're believing that they will be with us in that life that is to come. For Isaiah said it would be them and their offspring with them. My brother and sister want to bring their little son to you today. father. Whenever they brought him home from the hospital, no doubt they told him to do this and that and the other. But no matter how hard they would have searched, there would have been no manual to come home with him, how to raise him, how to influence him, how to affect him in life. But you've already given that to us, Lord. It's your word. So I pray that you'd help my brother. Pray that you'd help my sister. She's been given the great title of the fifth gospel, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Mother. I pray you'd help both of them, Father, to be able to influence his little life in a way that will be pleasing to you. Keep him from the evils of the day, Father. We dedicate his little life to you, Father, in the name of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he wanted to look around a little bit and see you all. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together if you would. We'll turn to second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. Certainly welcome each of you here today in the house of the Lord. um brothers and sisters here from Ukraine, Brother Alex, mom and dad, and those that are with them, any visitors, other visitors that we have. We've been looking at the um the divine nature of God and being partakers of it and God building a body, a mystical body for his presence to dwell in. and those virtues which God by his very own nature wants to put in us. So let's read together. Second Peter 1 verse 2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. According as his divine power hath given unto us all things. Wow. Isn't that wonderful? all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. Whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence and to your faith virtue to virtue, knowledge to knowledge, temperance to temperance, patience, and to patience, godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. How many like to be remembered today as we pray? Amen. God bless each of you. Heavenly Father, we count it such a great honor once again that we could be able to come together, not only just physically that we would have strength and be well enough to do it, but still so far living in a nation that we can have this right. We're grateful, Lord God. We realize our nation is represented in the book of Revelation with those two horns. And we know, Father, one day she will raise up and it will try to take that from us. To me, prophecy is unclear as far as how how far along it will move when the bride is still here. But we know one thing. You will have us prepared for whatever will come. And we believe your word now will help us to be ready for what the future holds. So you saw the hundreds of hands that were uplifted today. Maybe sickness, financial needs, troubles in their homes, whatever they are. Lord Jesus, would you meet each one of us in our need? Help me, Lord, that I can speak that which is only beneficial and helpful. Dear God, shut my mouth to anything that would displease you. I realize I stand in one way in a dreadful place today. Any preacher that stands up behind this pullpit, not only this one, but different ones around the world, what a what a great thing it is. And yet, what a responsibility that goes with it. And if I get to it today, Lord, to read it to them, what your prophet said when he called this pulpit the sacred desk. A sacred desk, the closest thing to heaven on this earth, a pullpit. And dear God, I pray that you'd help me every time I stand, whether it's here or wherever else it is, help me to do it. with that knowledge. Lord, speak to us today. We pray in the name of Jesus. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be may be seated. [laughter] So, we've been looking today again. We want to pick it up at godliness. And we know that godliness is my goodness within a series that anybody could take on that word only and no telling how long that we would be able to go on it because to be godly to be like God would certainly be so many things. And yet we know that it's been made possible by him that we could have a godly nature, godly desires, godly behavior, and that which is pleasing to him in this life. And what I closed out with the last time that we looked at this about being godly was that God goes to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Aren't you glad you believe God goes to church? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you want to go to church? &gt;&gt; We'll read today again in Luke 4:E 16. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read. I remember whenever Jesus would have went to church and started going there in the synagogue as a little boy being dedicated in the temple but there was only one temple but there were all kinds of little towns and villages so each one of them couldn't have a temple so they did have a synagogue so a synagogue was a place which a multi multi-purpose building they would have gatherings and this and that in it but no sacrifice so there was no blood no mercy mercy seat, no shakina glory, no law, no Torah, no Mishna, nothing there as far as divine supernatural. And remember remember these guys would get up and they they take the scroll and they'd stand and read it and read it and comment on it. The bar bar mitzvah would have been held there when a boy turned 12 years old and for the first time he would be allowed to take the scroll and read it publicly. He was considered to be a man when he could do that. So there would have been as far as we have a record of no miracles, nobody got saved, uh nobody got healed, nobody got delivered, but Jesus was faithful to go to church in so much that Luke wrote this many years after the Lord Jesus had left the earth and said that it was his custom. It was his custom to go to church. So if the Lord Jesus would have went to church in that day and there was no move of God at all, I wonder what he'd do today. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now think of it. You'd never see a move of God. It would be the same thing over and over and over again. So they would have the people that would sing the songs and the women was on one side, the men on the other. And the women were never allowed to even stand in the pulpit. They were never allowed to take the Torah and read it openly. They were not allowed to do any of that, participate, only behind a little veil that would have been there. But Jesus was an habitual worshipper in the synagogue. So, it's something about him. Now, remember, wonder if he ever got anything when he went there. Wonder if he got anything out of the service. Well, you know, if Jesus was the word and they would at least stand up and read the word, no doubt he could have got something out of the service. I figure that if you and I go with the right attitude, we can get at least something out of the service. Now, Luke leads up here to a very phenomenal time in Jesus' life. And it's a it's kind of a dispensational change because he's going to take the word and the priest handed him the word. Now, this is not the first time it's happened, of course, but it's the first time that something like this is going to happen. So, he finds a place in the scroll, and it's Isaiah 61. And he read, and you remember what Jesus said, \"This day, this scripture is fulfilled.\" And Luke 4:20, he closed the book and gave it again to the minister, and sat down, and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he be to say unto them, \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\" Now Jesus goes on from there. That within itself would have been overwhelming. But he goes on in several more verses and tells them some more things. Now listen what happens in this church service. Chapter 4 28. And all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath. &gt;&gt; What a church service. &gt;&gt; And rose up and thrust him out of the city. Now Carol and I stood there a few years ago where this happened right there in the little village of Nazareth. So they had a little synagogue that they had rebuilt there. They had a well, they had a wine press. Very, very neat place. But there's a a precipice out from where the synagogue was, a real steep place with rocks and brambles and all types of things like that. Now, this is the way the service ended. And they all in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill where on their city was built. So Nazareth's up in a little high place and then they lead him out to that brow and it's straight down like this that they might cast him down headlong. I wonder if Jesus ever went back to church after they throwed him out. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; He actually did. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he's used to getting thrown out. &gt;&gt; And you know what Jesus does, unlike us? Jesus keeps on going back. Now, I want to ask every one of us here today, if any of us would have been treated like this, &gt;&gt; would we have ever went back to church again? &gt;&gt; Or you say, \"I never would.\" See, that shows you're lacking &gt;&gt; that portion of God in your life &gt;&gt; because Jesus went back. Amen. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, Jesus has kept going back &gt;&gt; for over 2,000 years since this happened. &gt;&gt; The churches are still throwing him out. &gt;&gt; He's been invited all over the Tri Cities this morning. &gt;&gt; No doubt churches everywhere, every denomination that there is here, every independent church. No doubt they w they invited him to come. But then do they welcome him once he shows up. &gt;&gt; Now you see there's a difference in us standing and somebody will come and pray, \"Oh Lord, we invite you to this service. Please come Lord Jesus.\" And then would we turn him loose to have his will in the service. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now notice this is what Jesus does. It wasn't his time yet. So the scripture says, \"But he passing through the midst of them went his way.\" Now the Lord Jesus instead of getting this attitude toward church and saying, \"You know what? I ain't never going back again. I ain't never going back to church. Are you kidding me? I'd go there to help them and they'd lead me up to the brow there and they're going to throw me over and they would have done it had it been time, but it just wasn't time. But instead of Jesus getting burned out on church and I'm so sick and tired of preachers, I'm so fed up with lay people. I'm I'm just fed up with the whole church thing. Jesus is still going to churches where he's not even welcome. &gt;&gt; Jesus this day on Sunday has visited with his presence thousands times, thousands of churches, right? And how many of them let him have his way? &gt;&gt; I guess the question is, will we? &gt;&gt; Is Jesus free in Word of Life Church today to have his will or do we want to put him in a box and say, \"Now, Lord, you can't do this, but you can do that, but you can't do this, and you can't do that.\" &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice this in the sermon that the prophet entitled Pride Campbellville, Kentucky. Some of you were there with me at this setting uh several years ago when brother Charlie Cox had some meetings there and they had a tent set up when brother Random was there. It was a Methodist campground. Sister Nelly uh the Lord dealt with her that service and she gave her heart to God after this service right here. Jesus unnoticed. Jesus with dirty feet made a gazing stock after being invited. Now, you know, to me, it would be awful if people just said, \"Look, you know what, Lord? We're having this thing called the church, but we're not even going to invite you, okay? We hear that you're a miracle worker. We hear that you'll make people shout sometimes, and we hear that you'll make them cry, and we hear you'll make them do all sorts of things.\" and we really don't want that in our place. So, we're not even going to invite you. Okay? Just stay out of our assembly. But the sad part about it is they say he's welcome, but if he come in and started doing any of the above things I just lift listed, they wouldn't want him back anymore. &gt;&gt; So, they invite him, but he's not welcome. Can you imagine how rude that would be to be treated in such a way that someone here in the church or a family member or friend of yours would invite you for supper. &gt;&gt; You walk in the door, you smell it, there's the bread, there's the meat, you can smell the potatoes, the carrots, this or that. And they they let you in and they don't speak to you after that. They tell you, \"Sit down right there.\" them and their family goes to the table. They go to start eating and that aroma is filling your their house and you and your family are sitting in the living room looking at one another and trying to figure out what what what is happening. We thought that we were welcome here. No, you were invited, but you wasn't really welcome. &gt;&gt; So, they sat there and eat and talk about how good it is. past the butter and past the carrots and and past the mashed potatoes and gravy and oh, this is so good. They never acknowledge you. They never look at you. How long would you all stay? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You going to stay for dessert? Not that you're going to get any, but you're going to let them eat it in front of you and your children. Now you all are hungry and you haven't eaten for [clears throat] a while and you saw you thought that you was going to be part of this. So Jesus come to the service here today. He's hoping to be a part of this service. He's wanting to be the object of our worship, &gt;&gt; the main reason that we come here, &gt;&gt; not to see one another. That's well and good, but that's not the reason we're here. &gt;&gt; It's to worship him. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Notice the way the prophet lays this out. I wonder when you have a prayer meeting and you invite him to your church and then he comes down to do something for you and you just let him be unentertained. Too much of that in our home life and everywhere. When the president comes, why am I? They throw out the carpet all the way from the train all the way into the hotel. They they stroll the streets and young ladies will go forth for flowers and the bouquet the sidewalks and hang down the flags and every sign of welcome. But when Jesus comes to to town, he has to stay in a little mission somewhere. He'll be called crazy holy roller Jesus with dirty feet. There he sits unentertained, unwashed, unwelcomed. And you say, \"Jesus, do you take a lesser place? Jesus, do you take a little bitty place when you're called in a home?\" Yes, I take that little place. What? the little room in the upstairs or perhaps maybe on the second floor or the little closet or down in the basement. You're ashamed of him before the celebrity, before your company. You're afraid or ashamed to testify of him, to tell of his saving grace. May God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; But will you come anyhow, Jesus? Yeah, I will come anyhow. That proves to me he's the Lord of Lords. He's a big person. &gt;&gt; I'll come anyhow, no matter just how little of a place you will make for me. Don't you understand? That's the way he'll do in our service. &gt;&gt; That's the way he'll do in our life. &gt;&gt; So he allocates so much time for our life on the earth. And he wants to give us our life and our time and not not make us a robot to where that he programs us and we go here and we do there and we we pray and we read our Bible and then but he wants to give us time and then give us choice and wants us to choose in the right balance of work and pleasure and all of that and him. This is why he ends up shortch changed so much because of our own choice. and we go here and we do that and we do this and do that and the other and we give Jesus this little tiny bit in our life &gt;&gt; and Jesus will take it and hug it up as it were so close to him &gt;&gt; and look back at you and say, \"Thank you. Thank you for that 30 minutes that you gave me. I really do appreciate it cuz I love spending time with you. &gt;&gt; I love hearing you talk to me. I love hear you singing to me. I love hearing you testify to me. Thank you. No matter how little of a place you'll make for me, I'll come anyhow. I like that. He's my Lord and I will come anyhow. No matter how little the place is, I will come. Though you give the president everything, you give Dr. Jones, a great spread. But when Jesus comes, he takes a corner somewhere. What a bunch of Pharisees. Put on entertainers. No love entertainers. I will take that place. You know the prophet said, \"One of the greatest privileges that you and I have been given in our life is to entertain Jesus Christ.\" Now, y'all should be able to say amen to that cuz most human beings love either one form or another of entertainment. &gt;&gt; Now, whether it's reading, whether it's your phone, whether it's movies, whether it's music, whatever sports, everybody has some for form of entertainment. To some, it's Instagram, it's this and that and the other. It's cooking, it's, you know, whatever it is. Is it wrong? No, not necessarily. A lot of entertainment does not. It's not sin of itself, but it's sin into what we make it into in our lives. &gt;&gt; And then the only entertainment that Jesus has has that he asks for is for us to entertain him. Actually, something angels cannot do. And God knows they would do a much better job than I could ever do. and they would be so honored to do it. But yet Jesus has allowed so much entertainment to himself, to the church, and if we don't do it, it don't get done. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Revelation 3 20. One of the saddest scriptures in the Bible. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. And if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s. And the word there, s is short for supper. I will have supper with him. You see, this is where we are. Jesus didn't say breakfast. &gt;&gt; Why? This verse of scripture applies to the last day. It's supper time. &gt;&gt; Jesus ain't offering you breakfast. He ain't offering you lunch. You're in the supper time, the end time. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is wanting to have supper with all of us. I will come into him and we'll have supper with him and he with me. Now listen how the prophet picks this up and he says in this led us to sin church age it was the most messed up church age of all the rest of them. The most messed up of all the rest of them. And we found the most pathetic thing in the last part of the Leodysian church age. Notice not at the beginning at the last part of the Leodysian church age. Jesus standing on the outside of his own church where he had been put out knocking at the door trying to get back in. And you're talking about a sad situation. If I'm going somewhere and I'm going to be gone out preaching somewhere and I'm gone for a few days and I come back and I come over to the church and I'm gonna go in the office here and my key won't work. So I come around to that door and it won't work. Now I've got a master key. So it unlocks every door in here. But all of a sudden I find out my key won't let me in. No doors. I go to the main entrance won't let me in. I go to the handicap entrance, won't let me there. I go to the deacon store in the back, won't let me there. I go over here to the fellowship hall. I can't even get in anywhere. So, it's on Monday morning, 9:00. I call brother Jackie, brother Michael. Neither one of them will answer my phone calls. I text them. They won't even respond. And I'm thinking, what in the world? Did they have an election while I was gone? Yes. &gt;&gt; Have they changed the locks on the door? Now, wouldn't that be sad to say, \"Oh, you're no longer welcome here. Really? What have I done?\" &gt;&gt; What have I done to you all? Now, that would be heartbreaking for me as a man. But what is that in comparison to the Lord Jesus? So, HE TRIES HIS LAW. HE TRIES HIS KEY, it won't work. He tries mercy, that won't work. He tries grace, that won't work. He tries joy, tries deliverance, tries healing, none of it. Well, there they say, \"No, no, no. We want your name and we want your city and we do not want to go to hell and we've gone, you've gone to prepare a place for us and we want that, but we don't want you being the boss of our lives.\" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, if that's the way it is, we're changing the locks on our church door. Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wonder children, have we done that in our lives? NOTICE THIS JESUS ON THE OUTSIDE OF HIS own church where he'd been put out. Not at the beginning of the leis church age, brother Paul, but at the very end where we are. Do you understand? This is going to be part of the consummation of the judgment of God that the churches will put Jesus out. &gt;&gt; You said amen to that. But let me go a little bit farther. And it ain't going to be limited just to denominational churches either. &gt;&gt; Message churches are going to do the same. &gt;&gt; Not all of them. Notice he said trying to get back in. Isn't that sinful? I think that's about one of the most pathetic scriptures I've ever read. Jesus outside of his own door and his church had put him out. His church had put him out and he was trying to get back in. You imagine knocking, let me in, please, church. I'm the one who bought you. I'm the ONE WHO SAVED YOU. I'M THE ONE THAT DELIVERED YOU FROM A LIFE OF sin and of hell and debauchery and darkness and filth and all that. Let Let me please. Will anybody let ME BACK IN? WHAT ABOUT WORD OF LIFE? CAN I COME IN THERE? WORD OF LIFE CHURCH. CAN I COME IN ON WEDNESDAY? CAN I come in in THE YOUTH SERVICE? CAN I COME IN ON SUNDAY? CAN I COME IN? Y'ALL GOING TO MAKE ME STAND OUT HERE AND LAY ON THE SEA WHERE THEY HATE ME AND THEY DESPISE MY NAME AND THEY RIDICULE ME AND THEY MAKE FUN OF MY WORD. Won't anybody give me a shelter? &gt;&gt; I will. Lord, if any man that will open and let me back in my own house. How would you brothers feel if you come in from work tomorrow and your wife change the locks? You push your garage door and it no longer works. You go in the basement door and you can't get in there. You try the front door. You try the back door. And finally her and your children meet you at the door and say, \"We don't want you here no more. You're not welcome.\" Would you keep on knocking, brothers? Would you keep on trying? Do we want to be godly or not? &gt;&gt; You see, WHEN JESUS GETS turned down and put out, what does he do? He keeps coming back. I'll tell you one thing. If we had more people around this message that had that determination, the devil couldn't run you off. The preacher couldn't run you off, the deacons couldn't run you off, there ain't nobody going to run you off and run you away from the presence of God. But if you're a little BABY AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE PETTED AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A BOTTLE AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PACIFIER AND YOU WANT A PREACHER to change your stinking diaper and you want a preacher to baby you and make over you all the time, I'm afraid you're at the wrong place. God ain't looking for a bunch of babies. He's looking for an army. IT'S NOT AN ARMY OF BABIES AND INFANTS, but an army of God. Oh my, let me back in my own house. I'll suck with him. And he with me. And then the prophet said, \"Isn't that pathetic? THE GOD OF HEAVEN PUT OUT OF HIS OWN CHURCH BY their creeds and denominations and the way that they're doing put them put him out of the church and accepted their creed.\" Again, it said Jesus Christ has been put out of his own church and standing knocking at the door trying to get back in and richness and pleasures of the world has drove him from the church until the church has become a lukewarm. It's a very pathetic picture of all the other churches in the church ages. And you know what's the amazing thing about it is Jesus still goes to church and HE'LL BE THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'm convinced this morning? If there were people that have already said their creeds and their dogmas and they've made Jesus not the person of the Godhead but the second one and they've took this from him and that from him and that from him. But no doubt he visited some of these churches around the Tri Cities area today and there may have been somebody that got saved. &gt;&gt; All right. Oh, you say you mean they CAN GET SAVED? YES. THAT'S how much Jesus wants to visit people who have turned him down. How much more than will he visit those of us who want him here and all of his greatness and all of his power and all of his mercy. Oh my. I HOPE AND PRAY TO GOD THAT OUR church never ever gets to a spot to where we say, \"Jesus, your miracles aren't welcome.\" Well, as long as I'm in the pastor, this is going to be our stand. Jesus healing is welcome here. JESUS MIRACLES ARE WELCOME HERE. JESUS DELIVERING THE LOST, IT'S WELCOME HERE. JESUS FILLING WITH THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S WELCOME HERE. Is that right, church? [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He can't heal. He can't deliver. He can't tell them how to dress. He can't tell them what he demands of them because they don't want to hear it. So this you leave that alone. This is our private lives and you stay out of my private life. Oh my. BUT YOU SEE A LOT OF MESSAGE PEOPLE, they don't invite him to their church because they don't believe in going to church. &gt;&gt; So they don't invite him. As a matter of fact, they are guilty of abandoning him. &gt;&gt; They don't invite him. And you know the sad part about it is they take the message of the hour, this precious message, and try to prove their false doctrine &gt;&gt; by the very message of God that's restored the hearts of the children of God in the last days. Are you talking about something that you're going to try to take the message of the hour and use the message to disprove scripture? &gt;&gt; Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as a manner of some is &gt;&gt; and the church said &gt;&gt; now let's look at let's look at David. So to be godly a person a person should have a desire to go to the house of God. Now I'm convinced friends that a lot of the message people have either lost or never had the respect for the house of God. And they're raising a if if time goes on for this younger generation in the way that many message people are teaching their children about church, it won't be but a few more years they will ridicule it and laugh at it. Some are already doing it now. AND WHAT IS THAT MISSING? THE sacredness of what it means to come to the house of God. Notice in Psalms 5:7, \"But as for me, I will come into thy house, in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.\" Now remember, there was not even a solid structure in the days of David when he said that. It was a tent. &gt;&gt; A TENT. But David knew there was something that God had a house. And he said, \"I will come in.\" He could never even enter in behind the veil and go into the Holy of Holies. He was only allowed in the outer court. But he recognized being there was so sacred and so holy and so righteous. Listen as he goes on in Psalms 26:8. Lord, I have loved the hab the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honor dwellest. 654 Blessed is the man whom thou chooses and cause us to approach UNTO THEE, THAT HE MAY DWELL IN THY COURTS, NOT EVEN IN THE Holy of Holies, but a person that would be allowed to dwell in the courts of God. IN THY COURTS, WE SHALL BE SATISFIED WITH the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. PSALM 66:13, I WILL GO INTO THY HOUSE WITH BURNT OFFERINGS. I will pay thee my vows. Psalms 84:1. TO THE CHIEF MUSICIAN UPON GATIS, a psalm for the SONS OF KORA. HOW AMIABLE, HOW amiable are thy tabernacles, oh Lord of hosts. Now remember he make uses the word in plural form tabernacles because there was three dimensions or three spheres of the tabernacle. How amiable are thy tabernacles. Look in Hebrews 9:2. For there was a tabernacle made, the first wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the sheerbread, which is called the sanctuary. And after the second veil, the tabernacle, so plural tabernacles in plural form, which is called the holiest OF ALL, WHICH HAD THE GOLDEN SENSOR, and the ark of the covenant overlaid roundabout with gold. Look, and you talking about David THOUGHT THIS WAS SO HOLY AND SO GODLY and so righteous and it was just things. [snorts] BUT IT WAS THINGS THAT HAD BEEN CONSECRATED TO GOD. And it WAS THINGS THAT GOD SAID, \"I WANT this and I want that and I want that.\" And David knew they were there, ALTHOUGH HE NEVER GOT TO SEE THEM. HIS EYES COULD NEVER BEHOLD THEM. BUT HE SAID THIS IS THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S WORD AND IT IS SO HOLY. IT IS SO SACRED. I wonder children when we come to the house of God have we who even believe in going to church lost some of our sacredness and respect for the place that has been dedicated to God. Notice in verse 5, and over the cherubams of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly. PSALMS 84:2, MY SOUL LONGETH. YEAH. YAY. Even faintth. MY SOUL LONGETH. Even faintest. The word here means to PALE OR TO BE FAINT or weak. to pine after, TO LONG FOR, TO [screaming] DESIRE EARNESTLY. MY SOUL LONGS. YOU MEAN HE HE WANTED JUST TO GET UP TO THE TABERNACLE? &gt;&gt; And he FELT LIKE HE WAS GOING TO PASS OUT IF he didn't get to go to church. &gt;&gt; He was pining. HE WAS SAD. HE FELT LIKE I I'M GOING TO PASS OUT. I'M GOING TO PASS OUT. OH NO. OH NO. WHAT IS IT, DAVID? YOU AIN'T EAT. WHAT IS IT, DAVID? YOUR HIGH BLOOD. YOUR LOW BLOOD. NO. [screaming] NO. NO. I CAN'T GO TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if David would have been allowed to live in Johnson City in 2025? And this was David's home church. The deacons every service would have to set him down. He would be harping and jumping and shouting and running. And if they put HIM ON THE OUTSIDE, HE'D been running ON THE OUTSIDE. CAN YOU IMAGINE A MAN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST THAT LOVE just to go and see a tent &gt;&gt; to SEE A TENT &gt;&gt; AND KNOW THAT THERE WAS OTHER THINGS THERE BUT JUST TO BE THERE BECAUSE HE SENT YOU UNDERSTAND [screaming] MANY MESSAGE PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT GOD CONSCIOUS THIS IS WHAT DAVID [screaming] had &gt;&gt; he could sense God there This word that David used expresses such a longing or desire to make one faint or exhausted with intent desire. And he said, \"I'm going to pass out. &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; David. King David. WHAT? WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? I want to go to church so bad. I'm going to pass out if I don't get to church. Can't you see why Satan don't want you to go? &gt;&gt; HE WON'T FIGHT YOU ABOUT GOING TO WALMART LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; HE WON'T FIGHT YOU ABOUT GOING TO WORK LIKE THAT. COME ON, SOMEBODY. OH MY. [screaming] BUT TO GET IN GOD'S PRESENCE, TO GET IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, WHAT WOULD IT BE? WORD OF LIFE. IF EACH ONE OF US HAD SUCH A DESIRE AND ANTICIPATION TO COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Oh my. [applause] Oh, I'm so exhausted. I'm about to faint. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; If I can't go TO CHURCH, MY SOUL LONGER, YAY, FAINTEST FOR THE COURTS OF THE LORD. MY HEART AND MY flesh cry us out &gt;&gt; for the living God. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, OUR WHOLE nature is benefited when we come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Your flesh will benefit, your spirit will benefit, and your soul DEFINITELY WILL BENEFIT. NOTICE DAVID, BUT JUST AN OLD TESTAMENT PERSPECTIVE. IT BENEFITED HIS SOUL. IT BENEFITED HIS FLESH. &gt;&gt; OUR WHOLE NATURE demands the fellowship of almighty God. &gt;&gt; BODY AND SOUL AND SPIRIT, we are made for the service of our king. &gt;&gt; Oh, he wants your soul. He wants your spirit. But he also wants your hands. He wants you to lift up holy hands before the Lord. He wants your VOCAL CORDS. AMEN. SHOUT WITH A VOICE OF TRIUMPH. IS THAT RIGHT? HE WANTS YOUR FEET. SOMETIMES PATTING THEM. PRAISE GOD. SOMETIMES DANCING THEM. HE WANTS YOUR SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S CHILDREN GET GIVE ALL theirs &gt;&gt; to the devil. Why should not we give all of ours to God? Amen. &gt;&gt; NOTICE HE SAID, \"MY HEART AND MY FLESH CRITH out the cry of earnest longing and desire for the living God, not an idol. That's what I cry for, the living God.\" I don't want to just stand here and say for the rest of my life, where is the Lord God of Brother Random? &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I don't want Where's the Lord God? Where's the Lord God of Paul? Where's the Lord God? I want to be able to say it like this. The Lord God is here. His presence is here. He's doing the same things he's always done. &gt;&gt; That's the living God I crave for. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Psalms 84:4, blessed are they that dwell in thy house. They will still be praising thee. Silah. Verse 10. FOR A DAY IN THY courts is better than a thousand. I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God to dwell in tents of wickedness. JUST A DOORKEEPER. SOMEBODY THAT COME TO CHURCH AND SWEEP THE LEAVES OUT FROM THE DOOR AND SEE CHEWING GUM PAPERS OUT ON THE PARKING LOT, YOU KNOW, JUST PICK UP THIS AND SAY, \"OH MY, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR. I'M SO GLAD TO BE THE TRASH BOY. I'M SO GLAD TO BE THE LEAF BLOWING CHURCH BECAUSE GOD'S HOLY PRESENCE, THIS IS A PLACE CONSECRATED to the presence OF GOD. AND AS LONG AS THE BRIDE'S HERE AND WE NEED IT, HIS PRESENCE WILL ALWAYS BE HERE, FRIENDS. OH YEAH. OH, IT CAN BE IN MY HOME, TOO. IT CAN BE IN YOUR HOME. YES. BUT IT'S NOT the same. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Psalms 122 verse1, a song of degrees of David. I was so sad and I was so troubled and I was so disappointed. I was glad when they said unto me, \"Let us go into the house of the Lord,\" &gt;&gt; which was a tent in that day. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine David being able to walk in here and the brothers up here on their musical instruments and singing and you all clapping [applause] your hands and worshiping God? And as soon as David entered in, he sensed that presence of God. Oh my, what in the world would David done? You talking about a dancing little David? If David could dance under the law, what could he do under grace? I wish somebody would preach with me this morning. BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE OF US that love the Lord Jesus? Hey, I don't believe David loved him any more than SOME OF YOU RIGHT HERE TODAY. I BELIEVE WHAT WE need is an awakening in our walk with God and a REALITY WHEN WE COME TOGETHER. HOW SACRED, HOW HOLY, HOW PRIVILEGED WE ARE AS A PEOPLE OF GOD THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND SAY, \"YES, LORD, MOVE AMONG YOUR PEOPLE. THEY'RE SICK HERE TODAY. GOD, HEAL THEM. THERE'S LOST HERE TODAY. SAVE THEM. PEOPLE NEED THE HOLY GHOST. FILL THEM, LORD. Oh my. But I want you to think, friends, now watch the prophet. I I've I've I've looked at this message right here through the years. I couldn't tell you how many times that I've studied it and looked at it, but somehow another, I've totally missed this quote. I'm fixing to read you. AND STANDING HERE AT THIS BIBLE on the sacred desk. Now listen, sacred desk. Now show me where brother Ram said your kitchen table was sacred &gt;&gt; or your coffee table or your end table where your MP3 player lays. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, if you're going to make him the voice of God and say what is it said, either you take this the same way as that, or you're a filthy hypocrite, &gt;&gt; preach, brother Donnie, &gt;&gt; STANDING HERE WITH THIS BIBLE ON THE SACRED DESK, THE PULL PIT, THE CLOSEST PLACE TO heaven on the earth. So you mean a pulpit where men of God come and stand and preach the WORD IS THE CLOSEST place to heaven on earth and then people don't want to go and be around that place the closest place to heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. I TELL YOU, IT SHOULDN'T JUST AFFECT the leoty, but it should affect the ministry as well. &gt;&gt; TO REALIZE WHEN A PREACHER WALKS UP BEHIND THIS PLACE OR WHEREVER it is that HE'S PREACHING. OH MAN, WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN A BUNCH OF IDEOLOGIES. WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN A BUNCH of I this and I've done that and I've DONE SOMETHING ELSE. BRING US JESUS, BROTHER. DON'T BRING YOUR AGENDA. DON'T BRING YOUR THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER. I GET SO SICK AND TIRED OF PREACHERS AND USING THE PULLPIT as a PLACE TO GET BACK AT PEOPLE AND GET BACK AT ONE ANOTHER. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S TO BRING JESUS CHRIST TO THE CHILDREN OF GOD. IT'S TO LET THE PEOPLE SEE JESUS IS NOT DEAD. [screaming] HE'S [laughter] ALIVE. [applause] I wonder if the message ministers wouldn't be more sincere themselves and respect this holy place more if it wouldn't bring right on out to the leoty. Think about what a statement AS I STAND YOU with this Bible on the sacred desk. Check it out. Study it sometime and he gets times he uses this terms over and over again. SACRED DESK, THE PULPIT, THE CLOSEST PLACE TO HEAVEN ON EARTH. WOW. Listen to this. In the supernatural, many times defining our own ranks of Pentecost. Sometimes our atmosphere becomes an emotion instead of a worship and THAT SOON DIES out and the members become one thing and another. But if we could ever get a group of people &gt;&gt; together WHERE WAS GENUINE HOLY SPIRIT ATMOSPHERE, A sacredness and a sincerity and worship men and women, hallelujah, SITTING IN THERE ARE GOD CONSCIOUS. Now notice the word that HE USES GOD CONSCIENCE. NOT YOUR HUMAN CONSCIENCE BUT GOD CONSCIENCE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU RECOGNIZE GOD is there. Oh my. SITTING IN THERE OUR GOD CONSCIENCE AND KNOW THAT THE GREAT OMNIPOTENT [screaming] GOD is present ready to do all things without one shadow of a doubt and even HAVE AN EFFECT UPON THE UNBELIEVERS ARE SETTING in this evening. YOU CAN NEVER COME INTO THAT GLORY TO GOD ATMOSPHERE WITHOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; How many knows that's the truth by experience? &gt;&gt; Now watch this. THIS IS A dedication of a church of a brother down in Cleveland, Tennessee in 1959. And we know that the church, the spirit of God is in the people that makes the church. But we also have places, GATHERING PLACES DEDICATED WHERE THIS church body gathers together to worship God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AH, YOU SEE THEN FOR THOSE WHO JUST MAKE IT THE SPIRITUAL PART, the mystical body, well, we are the body of Christ and we no longer need to meet together. That's not what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS GIVEN TO OUR PRECIOUS brethren and to this congregation this most beautiful structure. Therefore, we are here this morning FOR THAT PURPOSE TO DEDICATE IT TO BE A place of worship to the Lord our God. So, did brother Brandham look at church buildings as just any other building, any other type of building, or was there something special or sacred about a church, things that are to be my I felt honored tonight to come into a church like this, which if you don't know, it was an Assembly of God church. I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER in a church than I do in those auditoriums. Well, praise the Lord. My my there's nothing AGAINST THE AUDITORIUM, BUT YOU KNOW, maybe just a superstition. Seems like to me a truth. YOU GO INTO THOSE AUDITORIUMS WHERE THERE'S FIGHTS, RRESTLES, BURLESQUE, everything else going on. Evil spirits seem to hang around them places. NOW THAT MAY BE SEEM to be a superstition, but it isn't. SO, BUT WHEN YOU come into a church, YOU FOLKS READ YOUR BIBLE AT HOME, &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO TAPES AT HOME, READ THE MESSAGE AT HOME, PRAY AT HOME, TALK ABOUT THE LORD AT HOME. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHY CAN'T WE ALL JUST START STAYING HOME THEN? Because this part of the message tells us otherwise. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A PLACE THAT WE HAVE HALLOWED and set aside for worship. &gt;&gt; Notice the presence of God is there. You know, it seems to be different. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EFFECT THE BUILDING HAS. It's where the people are congregating. OF COURSE, THE SAME people are at the other place, but on those evil grounds. So, in y'all's homes, there's never any arguing, right? Never any fussing. Uh, testing one, two, one, two, testing one, two. So, IN YOUR HOME, IT'S TOTAL CONSECRATED TO GOD. Y'ALL JUST OFFERING sacrifices and praising God all day long and just worshiping and everything. There's &gt;&gt; ah, that could be one reason it feels different in church. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can I go a little longer? &gt;&gt; Boy, it seems hot in here this morning. Man, a lot of I'm sweating like I don't know what. Is it just me? &gt;&gt; AND AS I SAID, BROTHER BRANDON talked to some preacher and he was talking about having a hard time getting his people to come to church. Said he had to get them to sign a card, you know, would they at least come on Easter and Christmas. AND I SAID, \"YOU GET that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost sets their soul of fire. There'll be no signing cards. GOD'S IN THEIR HEART. GOD [screaming] GOES TO CHURCH.\" &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW, CHILDREN. LET'S SAY WHAT THE TAPE SAY. LET'S PRESS [screaming] PLAY. AND WHEN THIS QUOTE IS SAID, LET'S ALL SAY AMEN. AND NOT LET'S NOT JUST SAY IT WITH OUR VOICE, BUT LET'S SAY IT WITH OUR FEET. LET OUR FEET TAKE US TO THE HOUSE OF GOD BECAUSE GOD GOES TO CHURCH. WOO! [cheering] [applause] My my but as I read this quote, I couldn't keep from wondering if we ain't got a lot of message folks like this brother had in his church. You get that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar, let them pray through till the Holy Ghost SETS THEIR SOUL OF FIRE. THERE'LL BE NO SIGNING CARDS. GOD'S IN THEIR HEART. GOD GOES TO CHURCH. HE LOVES TO WORSHIP. OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY. IF WE GET SO EXCITED ABOUT GOING ON A VACATION SOMEWHERE, WE GET EXCITED ABOUT GOING ON A GOLF TOUR OR GOING TO DOLLYWOOD, WHAT ABOUT COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD WHERE THE MIRACULOUS IS HERE, HEALING IS HERE, DELIVERANCE IS HERE. OH, WHAT IT COULD BE? GOD. [screaming] [applause] &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; SORRY, I'm gonna have to get rid of this thing. [sighs] &gt;&gt; What visions are we? We feel that every person &gt;&gt; rot shaggy IS DUTY [screaming] BOUND. to attend some church and belong to some church as a Christian. Many people say, \"Oh, I stay home and read my Bible. I'm just as well off.\" No. The Bible said we shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves together. WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT. THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION. WELL, I THINK I THINK I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK. THIS IS WHAT THE MESSAGE TEACHES IN THE LAST DAY. I'M TALKING ABOUT BEING [screaming] LIKE GOD. GOD GOES TO CHURCH. GOD LOVES SINGING. GOD LOVES WORSHIP. OH, HALLELUJAH. AND IF YOU'RE LIKE [screaming] GOD, WHAT WILL YOU LOVE? [applause] We've got to do that. And I want somebody to present to me the quote or God's prophet said, \"WE'VE GOT to play the tapes only. I'll wait for the quote, &gt;&gt; but until you send it to me, I'll keep on preaching what he said. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Notice that had a real move of God there at the tabernacle that morning, 1959. Brother Bam said, \"I'm still feasting also on that blessing this morning on the exceeding abundantly.\" It's unknown. Lord have mercy. IT'S UNKNOWN THE THINGS THAT GOD WOULD DO FOR US WHEN we assemble ourselves together. Have you noticed since we made this consecration to God how the things has been going here? Now can you imagine the Brandham tabernacle may needed a reconsecration TO THE LORD. THE CHURCH OF THE PROPHET OF GOD NEEDED MORE CONSECRATION. AND ONCE THEY DEDICATED THEMSELVES, NOT JUST [screaming] HIM BUT THEM, GOD BE TO MOVE IN A GREATER WAY INSIDE THEIR CHURCH THAN IT DONE BEFORE. &gt;&gt; OH MY. BLESSING AFTER BLESSING, POWER AFTER POWER, GLORY AFTER GLORY. IT'S JUST BEEN WONDERFUL. and he will continue to do so. &gt;&gt; If you can't come here, get you a good church home somewhere where they really &gt;&gt; No, brother Brandon said go to a church where they preach. &gt;&gt; Help my time, as my grandma used TO SAY. HELP MY [screaming] TIME. You mean brother Brandon believed IN GOING TO CHURCH WHERE THEY PREACHED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, THEY REALLY PREACHED THE GOSPEL AND SO YOU CAN BE FED BY THE SPIRIT of God. If y'all will get with me right here in a few minutes. Oh my. [sighs] Now listen to this one. after people got saved in Brother Brandham's meetings. Promise me that you'll find a good gospel church somewhere, a church that teaches the full gospel, the power of God, his resurrection. Join up with them people with and make yourself a church home. Don't stray around loose on the streets. Go get a good church somewhere of your choice where the gospel and the power of God is made known and the signs, oh hallelujah, of eternal life is in there. The signs that was in Christ and the church said, &gt;&gt; DISCERNMENT OF SPIRIT. EVERY MAN OUGHT TO HAVE A CHURCH HOME. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A PLACE NOT JUST FLOAT ABOUT FROM PILLAR TO POST, BUT HAVE SOMEWHERE THAT YOU GO TO CHURCH AND CALL IT YOUR CHURCH. COME ON, SOMEBODY. LET'S PRESS PLAY AND OBEY. SOMEWHERE YOU PAY YOUR TITHE, SOMEWHERE THAT YOU HELP SUPPORT THE CAUSE. TAKE YOUR CHOICE. BUT THEN DON'T NEVER DYSFELLOWSHIP the other man because he don't belong WITH YOUR GROUP. GOD GOES TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAY, \"I CAN STAY AT [screaming] home &gt;&gt; then be just as good a Christian as I can at church.\" You can't. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] [applause] The Bible said, \"Oh, so that was important to Brother Brandham.\" &gt;&gt; The Bible said, \"Yeah, he was a a prophet of God.\" &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID, \"NOT FOR SAKE OF ASSEMBLING OURSELVES TOGETHER THAT much more as we see the time coming.\" IF YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN, you long to go. where other Christians are and fellowship with OTHER CHRISTIANS. SO YOU CANNOT STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH AND LIVE THE SAME LIFE. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. YOU CANNOT STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH AND LIVE THE SAME LIFE. I SEE WHY SATAN WANTS MESSAGE FOLKS TO STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH BECAUSE HE KNOWS THEY CAN'T BE AS GODLY. THEY CANNOT LIVE THE SAME KIND OF LIFE. THEY ARE LIVING A SELFISH LIFE. AMEN. BY NOT BRINGING THEIR STRENGTHS AND THEIR SUPPORT TO THE CAUSE OF GOD. I AIN'T TALKING ABOUT YOUR MONEY. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU STANDING BEHIND THE GOSPEL OF THE LAST DAY. [applause] &gt;&gt; You cannot stay away from church and live THE SAME LIFE. YOU you can't do it because it's like I I'm hungry, but I'll never go to a table. I'll never eat. I AIN'T GOING TO do it. You've got to go and feed on the word of God &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; fellowship with one another. We need one another more now than we ever need each other. He said it's now. But when YOU GET YOURSELF SINGLED out from the rest of them, making yourself a little different, YOU DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THIS AND YOU DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THAT. &gt;&gt; You're not the perfect bride. &gt;&gt; You're not the called out bride, but you're on dangerous ground. Can't you see where this move, friends, around this message is leading people? &gt;&gt; It's putting them on dangerous ground, not rapturing ground. &gt;&gt; You're on dangerous ground, right? Then keeping away from church. I EXPECT SOME FOLKS TO GET MAD AT ME. HEY, what's new about that, right? And they may make one of you may want to make a few YouTube videos about me and call my name and whatever or I don't really care. But I'll say to you and those of you who promote such, how is it going to be when you stand before God's prophet &gt;&gt; and him say to you, why did you not say what else I said? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY DID YOU DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GOING TO CHURCH? WHY DID YOU DISCOURAGE PEOPLE? LORD HAVE MERCY. WHAT A THING TO DO TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GOING TO CHURCH. THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL [screaming] DOES. &gt;&gt; THEN THAT PUTS YOU ON THE DEVIL'S side [sighs] years and years ago. I was preaching a camp down in Texas. I preached some things they didn't want me to preach. was about the Godhead and how great Jesus was. And I told him if there's another God in heaven, he's sitting on the floor. Cuz John looked in heaven, he saw only one throne and Jesus was on it. Ain't no three or four thrones ever with the Godhead sitting on top of it. Oh my. Preachers gathered in the back of the building, bigger building than this, gathered in the back of I seen them. I thought, \"Oh boy, you've had her now.\" Sure enough, here they come to me after church said, \"Hey, you can't preach that here.\" THE WHAT WHAT SHOCKED ME WAS THERE SUPPOSED TO BE PEOPLE. WONDNESS PEOPLE THAT SAID THEY BELIEVED IN THE GODHEAD. THEY RUN ME OUT OF THAT CAMP. THE SAD PART ABOUT IT WAS THE YOUTH OUT THERE WAVING GOODBYE AND CRYING LIKE BABIES. Oh my. And yeah MY BUT I'M SO GLAD FRIENDS THAT WHEN WE GET RUN [screaming] OUT THAT JESUS IS RIGHT THERE TO HELP US. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'D GO BACK BUT THEY NEVER WOULD LET ME COME BACK. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING. AND IF YOU'RE IN THIS SPOT TODAY AND YOU SAY, \"LORD, I'VE NOT HAD THE RIGHT ATTITUDE, BUT I'M INVITING YOU BACK, JESUS. I'M INVITING YOU BACK, JESUS. I'M SORRY.\" COME ON, SOMEBODY. WHY DIDN'T I QUIT GOING TO CHURCH? BECAUSE I WAS ORDAINED TO GO TO CHURCH. I WAS ORDAINED TO PREACH. I WAS ORDAINED TO NOT COME TO CHURCH AND SIT THERE LIKE A BUMP ON A PICKLE. I'M ORDAINED TO CLAP MY HANDS. I'M ORDAINED TO PRAISE GOD. I'M ORDAINED TO WORSHIP HIM. THAT'S WHAT I WAS BORN FOR. I WAS ORDAINED TO [screaming] TORMENT HELL. I WAS ORDAINED TO CAST OUT DEVILS. What about you? [applause] [sighs] [gasps] Some of the deacon brothers might want to meet with sister Carol after church and she's see if she's putting gunpowder in my Sunday morning breakfast. You're getting on dangerous ground right then, keeping away from church. Find the one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian. Brother, to all of them, that's the way to be a real Christian. So what does that make people who actually teach against this? Then we've got fellowship. I love this other word, protection. &gt;&gt; People love you and pray for you. &gt;&gt; Can I have you a few more minutes? The Holy Spirit in you will not hunger for the world. It'll hunger for God. If it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come and the church is open, there's something wrong with that spirit. &gt;&gt; Wow. This is the issue, friends. &gt;&gt; This is the problem. So, if it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come when the church is open, there's something wrong with that spirit. It's notice it it's trying to keep you away from God. The spirit OF GOD WILL RUN YOU right straight to the church every time the door opens for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Well, tell me what kind of spirit is on people that runs them away from church and they look for every excuse. I got a backachche. I got a headache. I got a toeache. But it's amazing TO ME THE MIRACULOUS happens as soon as church IS OVER AND YOU RUN INTO THEM AT WALMART ON Sunday evening. &gt;&gt; What cures take place when the amen is said and people say, \"Honey, I feel better. Let's go to Red Lobster. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Can people be sick and can't come to church? Sure. &gt;&gt; But do those same same people that are so sick they can't go here, do they not go to Walmart? Do they not go to Target? Do they not go to TJ Maxx and go here and there and there? &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Uhoh. Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Let me close. Our heavenly father, thou has chosen that we should gather together. It's the will of God. I don't care what revelation you have or what man is teaching you otherwise. If they don't say what the law and the prophet said, they are liars. &gt;&gt; It's the will of God that we should assemble ourselves together as we see the day approaching and that regularly, Lord, to bring ourselves closer to you and closer to each other in the bond of fellowship. through the shed blood of Jesus, which makes it possible. You see, so you're not just coming for yourself, but you're coming for others. &gt;&gt; Again, he says, \"And be not afraid, it is I.\" We're taught that as the day begins to approach to the end, that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together as some who [snorts] have not the faith. Wow. &gt;&gt; Now, what I don't understand is I I I guess I guess probably I must have got the infabase that had all these going to church quotes in it. &gt;&gt; And then a lot of other people, they got a different infabase. Maybe that word, you know, whenever they type in these exact words that I typed in yesterday, gather ourselves together, quotation marks and here it just pulls right up right there in the message. &gt;&gt; Wow. And these are not AI generated. &gt;&gt; Although it wouldn't surprise me in the near future if we don't get some that are generated that says we shouldn't go. Come on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But remember, anything we make the prophet of God say that's contrary to scripture is false doctrine. And we make him a liar. &gt;&gt; Come on. Word of life. God's prophet never come to lead us away from the Bible, but lead us right back to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Is your life worthy of the gospel? We have assembled together, Father, for no other purpose but to try to learn how to live better and to live closer to you. For we see the day approaching, and we &gt;&gt; must assemble ourselves together. oft and take instructions from you. Grant it, Father, in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Donnie, every time I come into church, I don't always get something. Jesus could relate to that. And the Lord God said to so and so, and so and so begat so and so and so be go begat so and so. Some of y'all go to sleep on me and I preach like a firecracker lit on both ends. I can't imagine if you had been in the synagogue, you just stretched out [laughter] so and so begat so and so and he begat so and so and they begat so and so and they went this many perimeters this way and done that and they done that and what do you say? Glory to God. What do you say? &gt;&gt; I love this one. Christ's a mystery. Now you've got tapes on that. You've got tapes on what we believe &gt;&gt; and you've got tapes on discipline &gt;&gt; in the church. I wonder why they ain't hearing them. Wonder why some of you ain't hearing them. &gt;&gt; You come once every two or three weeks, &gt;&gt; way out of church, stay home your sorry hide on Wednesday night when you could come to church. &gt;&gt; Preach it now. Streaming ain't meant to discourage people from going to church. &gt;&gt; It's to help the envalid, the those that wants to stream where else. Oh, but brother Donnie, I've got a slight little pain. Does that stop you from going on your sister's trip? &gt;&gt; I've got a slight little headache. Oh, does that stop you from going on a hunting trip or a golfing tour, some of you brothers, or do you take a little Tylenol in Jesus name and go ahead and pack YOUR BAGS? &gt;&gt; WOO! IF YOU GO ON A GOLFING TOUR WITH A HEADACHE, that shouldn't hinder you from coming to the house of God. And if YOU AIN'T GOT TYLENOL, LET ME KNOW. I'LL BUY YOU SOME. [applause] Lord have mercy. You going to get me killed one of these days. &gt;&gt; You've got tapes on discipline in the church. HOW WE BEHAVE OURSELF IN THE CHURCH of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. how we got to come together. So, we got tapes on that of how we got to come together and set TOGETHER IN HEAVENLY PLACES. DON'T STAY HOME. &gt;&gt; NOW, here's this massive gigantic twolettered word if. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open up yonder, to get in here to fellowship with your brothers, which is going to be pretty hard for you to do if you don't believe in going to church &gt;&gt; because they're in their home and you're in your home and you're in your home and you're all streaming from one location. That's kind of tough. Y'all do remember the COVID days, right? &gt;&gt; I didn't JUST MISS COMING TO CHURCH. I missed you all. &gt;&gt; Y'all might not have missed me, but I missed you. And I'm We miss one another, right? &gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE GOT THAT LONGLASTED COVID EFFECTS. They still don't want to get together, but I believe Jesus is here to deliver the postcoavid effects where you SAY, \"OH LORD, I NEED TO GO TO CHURCH. I NEED TO BE WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTER. I NEED TO WORSHIP. I NEED TO BE THERE AS A STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you friends, this this puzzles me to no end. How people nearly make him God &gt;&gt; and say it's God talking on tapes and it's the literal VOICE OF GOD AND GOD HIMSELF. How can you say that &gt;&gt; and then read a statement like this? Don't stay home. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open yonder and to get into fellowship with your brothers. And if you don't feel that way, then I tell you, it's time you got to praying &gt;&gt; cuz we're in the last days. And the Bible exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another. That's right. Stay right together. Token and shreport. We should love one another more than we ever did in all of our lives. There should be such a hunger to get to church. There should be such a hunger for us to get to one another. &gt;&gt; It should be a love affair. Who is Jesus and Topicus? We should assemble ourselves together. The Bible tells us that as we see the end approaching, not forsaking this of ourselves together, it'll it'll not only do that, it'll strengthen you &gt;&gt; and you your strength will strengthen the church. &gt;&gt; Can't you see what a selfish life that people live that see no need in attending a place of worship? They are robbers and they're being robbed. &gt;&gt; They're being robbed of our strength and they're robbing us of their strength. How can robbers go to heaven? I sure love y'all. &gt;&gt; Wish I had time. Go out and eat with all of you after church. I know everyone want to buy my dinner. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads together. [sighs] Dear Jesus, what a serious hour, Lord. When Paul wrote it so many years ago in the time when the Christians were being killed and to be caught going to church could cost them their life, maybe their wife, their children, unborn babies. So they started kind of pulling back from church a little bit. And Paul felt led to write to them and tell them, \"I know it's hard times and I know it's scary and it's fearful, but forsake not the assembling of yourselves together.\" I'm so glad that he took that opportunity because it's not said like that anywhere else in the entire New Testament. And what a background for it to be written under. people that were losing their life because they were identified as being Christians. And we know that public worship has always been something that you have wanted from the very garden of Eden. Abraham under his oak at memory. Jacob at man. There's something about public worship. You've never wanted your church to be in secret. Lord, it just breaks my heart, Father. As we see the days approaching and around the world in the ranks of the message, this move, it's dividing folks that have been friends for years, people leaving churches, just staying home. How sad. And the sad part about it is, Father, they try to use the very message that all these quotes I read from today come from that very message. and they try to use that very same message to prove we don't need church. Lord Jesus, thank you for your truth. Lord, I may not turn one person today. There'll probably some listen. They'll get mad and angry and all upset and whatever more. But father, even if one person that believes this false doctrine is never turned, I hope that the people here who believe in going to church will be more fired up about going than they've ever been in their entire life. I hope they have a greater desire and a greater determination to realize Lord Jesus this place where we are. Oh dear God, dedicated to your presence, dedicated as a place of worship and you've met with us so many times already, Lord, no longer than we've been here. Already the angels of God have been seen visibly in this place. Lord, I'll never forget it. Several years ago before we left Happy Valley after I'd preached one night and at the end of the service, I looked over to Harry to tell him what song to sing. And standing over by my office door said an angel, a man standing there, dark hair, white garments, looking straight at me. I felt totally paralyzed. I turned my head away because I was feeling so overcome by that presence. I couldn't hardly take it. And then I turned back and he was gone. That's the kind of church we want. That's the kind of place we want. It don't have to be fancy. Lord, if it was a storefront building and had plastered walls that had been repaired over and over again, but it was dedicated to you. It would be a special place. How many have we baptized once we've come here, Lord? How many have renewed their life to you, Lord? Oh, how many things you've done among us, and we're so thankful. Father, I pray that we will never lose the sacredness. I used to hate the years I was in Pentecost, Lord. I thought it was such a waste of my time. But as I look back, I realized there was some things that I gained back there that were true. And going to church and it being sacred and it being holy and a consecrated place. I'm so glad that I realized that years and years ago. And I'm so thankful, Father, that we know, Lord God, it's still the same today. Would you pass through us here this morning, Lord, the sick, the weary, may the angels of God that are standing at their post of duty. Hallelujah. May they minister strength, encouragement. We love you today, Jesus. We want to rededicate our lives to you, Father, in this place today. Oh Lord, take us, use us, Father. Take my hands, my mouth, Lord Jesus. My spirit, my soul, my body. I rededicate it. I reconsecrate it to you today. Lord, I pray for my musician brothers and sisters that play and the song leaders. I pray for the leoty. I pray for the brothers and the sound booths, the recording, the audio, the internet, all of that. Help us, Lord. I pray for the deacons, the trustees. Oh Jesus, may we rededicate ourselves to you today, Father. &gt;&gt; We ask for more sincerity. We ask that we can be more God conscious. Help us, Lord Jesus. Help every minister in our church that climbs behind this pullpit to realize that they're standing at the closest place between heaven and earth. So therefore, we're not interested in their ideas or their agendas or them. But men of God preach Jesus. Help me Lord as the pastor. Oh Lord God, to stay true, stay faithful. I believe your greatness will be made manifest among us in a way that we've not yet seen if we can just dedicate ourselves to you, Father. Praise the Lord. How many just rededicate your life here this morning while we're standing in the presence of the Lord? Would you mind laying a hand on that person there standing by you? You're offering yourself now, but you're praying for them that God will help them. Oh, Wednesday night when you walk in this place next Sunday, when you walk in here, may this sermon be a pivotal point in our lives till we realize this is a sacred place. This is a holy place. God goes to church and God loves to worship. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Brother John, would you come pray for the people? Lord Jesus, thank you, Father. Father, &gt;&gt; oh heavenly father, [snorts] &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; how we love you, Lord Jesus. How we thank you so much for your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father God, &gt;&gt; help us, Father. It helps us realize, Father, where we're sitting at. Lord, maybe we don't sit on the side where we don't want to go to church, Lord. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; but Father, maybe it helps us to realize that there's so many of our our loved ones that do, Father. &gt;&gt; Jesus, I pray. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I pray that you would just move, Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray, Lord Jesus, that you would just help us, each and every one, Lord Jesus, that we might rededicate our lives to you, Lord. We pray, Father God, that we we would be more fervent and more sincere, Lord Jesus, in you, Lord. May we realize, Lord, that as the world gets wicer and evil, Lord Jesus, that you are becoming greater and more holy, Lord Jesus, and you're desiring for us to get closer to you, Father. How we love you, Lord. We thank you, Father, that you make us aware, Father, that that you want us, Lord Jesus, to be more sincere, Lord Jesus. And and and make us more aware, Father God, of what you want to do for us, Lord Jesus. We know that the word is coming down so strong, so pure, Lord Jesus, that you're grabbing our attention, Father, and you're getting us ready for that day, Father God. We long for it, Lord Jesus. We pray that you would just continue to be with each and every one, Lord. We pray, Father, that you would just move for our sister Evelyn, Lord Jesus, as she had to leave, Father God, that she had to leave being sick, Lord. We pray in the name of Jesus that you would just go for forward, Lord Jesus, and meet her. Lord, we ask you, Father, for each and every knee. Lord, we ask it, Lord Jesus. We give you all the praise and the glory, Lord. We have no motive, Lord Jesus. We have no objective, Father God. BUT TO SEE YOU, LORD, that others would see you reflected in our lives, Lord. We love you. We thank you for it, Lord Jesus. Just give to each and every one. Father, we love you. We thank you for it, Lord. How we worship you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing this together and worship him just a bit before we go. Sing it for us here. &gt;&gt; As I walked [singing] through the door, I sensed his presence. And I knew this [singing] was the place where love abounds. [music] For this is the temple Jehovah God abides here. [singing] And we are standing [singing] in his presence [music] on holy [singing] ground. And [singing] we are standing [singing] on holy ground. [singing] And I know there are [singing] angels all around. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let [singing] us praise Jesus [music] now.

Life the prophet you know someone asked him the question you know please explain the mystery of the translation of the Bride he goes and talks about Sarah and Abraham and how he said before that promised son could come they had to have a body change then he goes on to talk about how the word in you that word that's coming will materialize around the word that's already in you my so that's what we're getting ready you say we're both Joel you don't know what I'm going through you don't know how weary and blue I am you're still promised a body change weeping may endure for a night but joy it's coming in the morning I don't know about y'all but I believe these things we've been hearing I believe these things that I read I'm going to take them on one day let's go son let me shut up praise God God's good to us isn't he [Music] who don't have to worry and don't you be afraid Joy comes in the morning troubles they don't last always for there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away and if your heart is broken just lift your hands and say oh I know that I can take it with him I know I will stand no matter what may come my way my life is in his hands with Jesus I can take it with him I know I will stand no matter what may come my way my life is in his hands [Music] so when your tests and trials they seem to get you down and all your friends and loved ones I know where to be found remember there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away and if your heart is broken listen just lift your hands and sing oh I know that I can take it I know I know I know that I can say no matter what may come my way my life is in his hands which Jesus I can take it with him I know I can say no matter what may come my life is in his hand oh I know that I can take it [Music] on my way with Jesus I can take it [Music] may come my way [Music] no matter what they come my way my life is in his again [Music] nope [Music] no matter what gets in your way I read a quote before I come out here brother Andrew whoever had had posted so brother Branham said in 56 and God has provided away he said you look at all the what they went through in the Old Testament they escaped the edge of the sword their dead was raised he said you can do that too if you take the same road he said that was he said you said that was the Bible Way that's what they did in the Bible said we're still in the Bible Way yeah why did he say pray and read your Bible every day because you're in the Bible Way you are the living Bible as you're going to find out today if you've never ever heard how much of the Bible you are after today you have no excuse because I have got bruises and stripes and man I have fell short so don't get mad at the messenger Jimmy while ago and I told Tim Murray Friday night I said brother Donnie heard I was preaching so he went to Gatlinburg [Laughter] I wish he'd took me with him but we're glad to see but they don't want to get some rest yeah he's he's worked and worked and worked he's put in a lot of time over there he might not tell you but he's getting old I watch him walk out the other day I thought who is that man it didn't look like the same guy that stood up here 30 years ago but for him it's a labor of love look I go I don't I've done nothing there right near as much work over there as everybody else uh but I go over there I see them brothers working I'm sorry if I'm taking up your my preaching time I'll cut it short I always do anyway so watching Brothers work and you can tell by the spirit their attitude that they love what they're doing you know I've often thought people that would say I can't believe you're doing this you're building this you're doing that and all that everybody knows it that knows brother Donnie brother Donnie does anything until he's led up the Lord because I remember the brothers came to brother Donny about 25 years ago to do this to build this church and he's said they didn't feel the leading of the Lord to do it so just be careful what you say when you've got a man of God that is doing something I promise you he's doing it prayerfully prayerfully and he's doing it for you he ain't doing it for himself he he loves his he loves God's people so if you have your Bibles and you want to turn with me to Mark chapter 16. if anybody sees anything wrong with my suit this morning my wife tried to dress me but she didn't so I got some looks on the way here I'm not up on fashion sorry she won't post no pictures of me though I guarantee you with this song so anyways let's go to work after he had appeared in another form onto two of them as they walked into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them they didn't believe when he said we saw him they didn't believe him afterward he appeared unto the leaven as they sat at meat and uprighted him with for their unbelief and their Hardness of Heart because they believe on they believe not on them that had seen him after he was risen people are going to see Christ in you what we're going to talk about today is go tell the world that's the title go tell the world because you are the message you are the message people are not going to believe you people are not going to believe you there's some that will believe you just by watching your life your life will bring people into this message without you even opening your mouth that's the Bible Way and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature that means a creature in here today this message was preached to you or you would have not been here there's many of you or most of you are here because someone that carried this message that lived this message expressed it to you and here you are and it wasn't a preacher many of you are here because someone that wasn't a preacher lived a life in front of you if that seed that was in you was never there that deep calm to the Deep on that person whose life that influenced you would never influence you we'll look at that further on but there has to be a life in there to respond to a life does that make sense you know me I don't get deep I'm just real simple it's about our heads Heavenly Father we're so grateful for another day Lord another day Lord to sit around your word Lord we know so many times we've heard Lord this is the House of Correction and Lord we receive that but sometimes this is also the house of blessing this is the house of Praise this is the house of worship Lord I Hope in today's sermon father even if we get correction help us to give you praise help us to worship help us to get blessings Lord lord it's not always just about coming and hearing and and making sure that our lives are just straight and narrow Lord but that's part of it but it's also sometimes Lord it's time to give Glory back to you to give praise and worship back to you because you are the only one that is worthy of that may we do that this morning we advise you Lord help me to get out of the way Lord is as I put these notes together and I sit back there I study them over and I've studied them again and getting ready to come out here just seems like it all goes blank ministers here can tell you that that's how it happens you think you you have it how you're going to do it on your notes and then you walk out it all goes blank but Lord if I have to go blank so you can feel that void Lord may it happen may you speak to us this morning Lord Lord anything that would hinder our lives may be push it out any criticism any anything Lord any bitterness Lord that we if we would come in here and say give me something show me something lord I can't give them anything but Lord you can give them you that's what we're going to look at this morning how you have given you to us we thank you for that bless your people Lord in Jesus name amen you can be seated as I said the title that I've given this is go tell the world and Jesus tells him go eat in all the world and preach the gospel of every creature he wasn't talking just to the disciples that is your commission that is my commission you have a commission your commission is not go Sunday Wednesday and go and listen to the preacher and receive the word I'm going to read you a quote that I found last night that just totally floored me brother Brandon said our job is your job is brother Graham says in question and answers now you remember what I said last Sunday you are a preacher get a Pulpit if you're not live your sermon see that's the best way to do that live your sermon he says it again if you're a preacher get a Pulpit and go to preaching if you're not just live your sermon let your life be your pulpit I don't I think that takes care of a whole lot don't you and you say brother Joe what am I supposed to preach you know we've got preachers all in the message we have to put quotations beside the message now because there's so many versions so many so many opinions so many ideas but there's God still has some God called men that are still in the Bible Way that are still teaching the message as The Seventh-Day messenger who brought it yeah you know the other night I was listening brother Jackie's saying bro I'll tell you what brother Jackie I don't know where to start about brother Jackie brother Jackie his no doubt LED thousands thousands of people to the Lord and influenced Millions but Brothers Jackie his life has said more than every single sermon he's ever preached his life has said more than any one any any message that he ever preached brother Jackie could never preach one sermon that would be better than the life that he lived God still has those well brother Jackie has done is what you and I are supposed to do not going to the jungles where no man's Gone Going Places where and take the gospel to people that nobody's ever heard where they've never heard it that ain't what our job is God didn't call us God didn't call us to go spread the gospel around the world but he called us to spread the gospel so what is the gospel the gospel is by definition it is the good news the Glad Tidings that what we're told it's the Glad Tidings which you know the in the New Testament you said they want to spread the gospel the Glad Tidings of Christ that was what they were commissioned to do to testify what Christ has done in your life Bill Brown said question and answers this is the one that I found last night while I was studying and said since a child I've always known that there was a god and though there was something happening in my life and that's beyond any question but let me say this there will come a message and there will come a messenger I believe that if it is to be a man it'll be somebody after me and don't let that stumble you he said if if there will come a message after me if don't put a period there and stop we've got too many periods on too many quotes don't put a period there and stop I believe if the it's to be a man it'll be somebody after me but this message that I'm preaching is the true message of this day and it's the last message you see what I'm doing brother I'm putting you all in the same place I am the same place you are messengers of this same message there you are your commission go do it we can dismiss that's your commission God's going to hold you to that you are to preach the same message he preached with your life you are to be a messenger of this last age message you've got no excuse so if Christ has set us about in your heart your life will scream louder than any words you can say there's nothing you can say there's nothing I can say this morning that could say anything louder than the Life of Christ in my life in your life you can witness to people you can you can tell them this you can tell them that they're going to watch your life when you be careful when you witness to somebody be careful that whenever you witness to somebody you're living what you're witnessing to when you tell people this is where I go to church this is my pastor this is what I believe I believe in the in The Seventh-Day messenger Malachi 4 and 5. and they go find books they go find messages they start streaming your church and then they watch you at work they watch your life are they seeing what you said you belong to that's the message of this age that's the message that we're supposed to be telling other people how can you bring other people in If You Don't Preach to them now be careful everything I say today don't cross it up with me talking about using your mouth when you get up in the morning you should be ready to preach without opening your mouth my son's over here and he's he's finding out ways to mimic me when I get home he does he makes fun of me so well don't make fun of me but he mimics me dad you do this I hope every one of y'all get one like Kim ah don't confuse the message with your beliefs do not confuse this message with your beliefs people let their beliefs guide them they love their beliefs they love their opinions of this message they love their opinions of God they love their opinions of you they love their opinions of people and that what leads them that what what do you think we've got radicals today in politics and all that radicals because they love their beliefs they love their beliefs they don't love their God if you love God you will let God guide you instead of your beliefs don't let your beliefs your beliefs some many times beliefs come with the wrong spirit that's the Muslims comes with the wrong spirit and they believe 100 that what they're doing is right they believe it that's the message that's the message they're preaching with their lives just their beliefs don't confuse what you believe as far as I hope these beliefs you know in my heart this is what I believe and I believe I believe that let God guide you sometimes your beliefs and your opinions might be wrong why do you think Peter cut off the guy's ear Peter's beliefs this was God's Almighty son right here and nobody was going to take him that was Peter's beliefs this you're not going to take him you're not going to kill him you're not he's not he don't have to die that was Peter's beliefs when he he told him you know that he had to to die they didn't want to believe it but that was their beliefs God's beliefs God's way don't line up with our beliefs sometimes the scripture that I read you this morning go into all the world and preach the gospel for years even as an adult I thought before before I was called to preach I thought I had to go find people and witness to them well they liked it or not that's true that was my belief I believe that's what I had to do was to tell people that hey if you heard of brother Branham you know introducing to people this message with that tactic of telling them about brother Brandon has turned many people away many people away whether brother Branham come to do Point him to Christ so we're supposed to be preaching the same message that he preached Point him to Christ hahaha being zealous of your beliefs brings wrong Spirit many times being led by the holy spirit will never lead you wrong never brings the wrong spirit Revelation 12 10. I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength the kingdom of our God the power of of Christ for the accuser of our Brothers cast down which accused them before God before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death this was the Bible Way they loved not their own lives unto death that was the Bible Way you say that was in the Bible that was the martyrs we're in the Bible Way but I got to looking at that and said by the word of their testimony and I looked in John we've read John 1 1 the beginning of the word was with in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God if you look in the Greek it's the same in the word of their testimony and in the Word was God is the same word so what was the word of their testimony it was God what is the word of your testimony it's God it always is he will always be your testimony that's how you live your life by God so the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us right but what did what did the word when he become flesh what did he say I go away but how come again and I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what else did he say Greater Works than this shall you do you say I've never raised the death you might you your life might have raised somebody that was spiritually dead it's not all about going out to a funeral and standing over a coffin and praying and raising somebody up you're better off dead in the flesh and have God than to be spiritually dead it's a greater work to raise somebody that's spiritually dead it's a greater work because the one that's laying here in the coffin that's not him anyway that's not her anyway they've received ultimate healing but your life the life you live there's many of you in here could can get up and testify right now about people coming up to you and asking you where do you go to church what do you believe this that different things in your life because they watched you what did they watch they watched your sermon they heard your life they heard your life your life is speaking if we realize that when we get up in the morning that when I walk out the door and I go to school and I go to work and I go here and I go there people are going to hear your life you think maybe that might make us more weary of how we Act how we treat others how we treat our family our wives our husbands our kids because people are watching is the life that you're living at home the same life that you're living in front of people are you living the same life are you preaching at home what you're preaching to people where you work with is your wife looking you as the message being spoke is your husband looking at you as the message that's being spoke come on a messenger of this message is a 24 7 Commission 365. there's no days off there's no days off I got the when I got the stadiums I got to thinking your life is two books two books we look at it many times as the old man and the new man God wrote a book about you before the foundation of the world that book has no beginning and no ending it always will be there but Satan's kept a book of you too when you took your first breath he began to writing you say not me brother Joe I was raised in a Christian home I've served God all my life let me tell you a little chapter in your book that Satan's got you came into the world speaking lies born in sin shaped in iniquity you came from a sin birth because the result direct result of the Fall right all the mistakes and failures in your life you think God has those in his book when God looks at Satan's book of your life it's blank God can't read Satan's book of you he can't he has to look through the blood right so when I just read to you that he is the accuser of the brethren day and night he is going before God with your book in his hand and saying look at this chapter look at this page where he done this where she done that God says that looks like all empty pages to me I don't see nothing but that's still your book I still got your name on it your Earthly name God's got one with your Eternal name on it Satan don't want to see that one he's accuser of the brethren and so many times in our life we revert back to a page in Satan's book we make a mistake we fall this book will always be there you get saved get the whole field of the Holy Ghost that book's still there it's still there you say well I I killed the old man you're still dragging him around he might be dead but you're dragging him around yeah if y'all if y'all have if you don't understand that brother Donnie preached a sermon many years ago am I dragging that old Roman soldier around right go back and listen to it I can't preach the way he preached it but I can tell you you're dragging an old man around he might be dead but he stinks and you know he's there and sometimes that old stinky nature wants to rise up sometimes every once in a while we put an AED on him right we try to resuscitate him we do you say brother Joe how do you do that well where should we start when Satan pulls out a little page of you if you remember when you did this and you like oh Lord I forgot or you think it was something way back in the day and it was really cool how you did this and you start talking about the old things you did how you did that how you did this what I did when I was in the bar when I did when I was in the world all the things that you did you start talking about them like you know hey the devil takes a page of your book all the time and gets you to read it all the time he's a messenger too he's got a job he's got a message to preach to you you think he's going to say they got the Holy Ghost can't bother them he's right but God allows him Satan can only do to you what God allows don't ever forget that he don't have free reign at you anytime he wants go back and read Joe you'll understand what will our book read to others let's say we're expressing these two books in our life those you work with which book are they reading your wife just bring it home what book is your wife reading about you husbands what's she reading could she look at your life and say that lines up right with the message that lines up with exactly what what the prophet said his life the way he treats me the way he treats the kids let me tell you explain something to you there's no third book there's no third book there's not a book that's your way so if you was doing something wrong say if you was a a deadbeat dad whatever I hope nobody here is he had another kids nothing to do with your wife it's just the way you were and say your pastor called you in and wanted to talk to you about it and he accused you of living out Satan's book and you would say no there's no way no way what can you honestly say that you're not living it the way the message the message that God sent you to live it no I can't say that but I'm not there's no middle there's no middle your brother Brandon brother Brandon said there's only two forces at work in your life two once of God ones of hell so if you're not live as a husband if you're not living up to what brother Branham said to be or there's the Bible said to be what did Jesus say what did what did Paul say love your wife as Christ loved the church the church is God's Queen it's a birth the bride you get married you go in your honeymoon are you gonna lay around tell your wife hey go cook me some eggs don't go sure go do this start start cleaning up not expressing no love not expressing anything what kind of honeymoon would that be wives are you the kind of wife that lines up with this message hey we're all friends and family are you the kind of wife that could say I I am that Proverbs 31 Woman I am I am the way that Jesus said for the bride to address the groom It's A Love Affair It's A Love Affair can we say that if you're not if you're the wife and you says well he won't do this he you know he's cold on the Lord he's lukewarm okay you be the message to him husband you be the message to her you know I when I was studying this I got to think of the brother when brother Brandon told that story about that that drunk sinner that brought his friends home with him he's going to show him what a wife he had made her go in there and cook for him when they're cooking brought it to me like he threw it on the floor started yelling at her cussing at her she got down her hands and knees began to clean it up wanted to give him more she led them all to the Lord without opening her mouth never opened her mouth we always have something to say we want to be heard well my husband won't listen to me my wife won't listen to me show him the message leave the message in front of them that is the greatest thing on the face of the Earth you could do this counseling session is free it won't cost you a dime don't cost you a thing be the message that's what you were commissioned to do but Brandon said he was to pass that way brother random gets a little deep breath here I don't but he gets a little deep so you decipher it and so a good Praying Wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of God on her knees than sometimes the preacher can do on the platform that's deep in big words that's as plain as he'd be I don't like I don't like getting in people's lives because it's impossible for me to get in people's lives when I study and not get in my own be a perfect testimony of what God speaks through your life are we fathers this is me this is something that I got to looking at and I got a quote here that this really struck me you know we're to express the message to our children and some of you new fathers with new kids mothers even I want to look at the fathers here because you're the head of the home right you're the head of the home your wife's The Fifth Gospel but are we living the testimony one thing that always struck me was I would come in here at church and listen how things about the message and then I'd go out you know my son started getting in teenage years and and stuff and I thought and I got to thinking you know they're understanding things now and what they're hearing do they see that in me do they see the same message they hear on Wednesday let me tell you I fail so much as a death I failed many times I have sat just sat by myself many times at work driving down the road at home thinking of decisions I made actions I did with my kids sometimes thought why why did I do that why did I act that way then I got thinking God's a father too God's the father the greatest lesson that we could learn is how many times has he pulled us back in when we've made mistakes we've made failures as his kids and I thought Lord I want to be the kind of Dad now y'all know me and I've drove my kids crazy because they're my hobby I love them I do if they're doing something my first spit and I want to watch that's it a minister I have drove listen crazy I'm sure he's free now so for a little bit but they're my life they did things because I liked it more than they liked it showed their love for me that's the way God does God's love for you overlook the things in your life God lets you do things you want to do sometimes just because you want to do them just because he loves you but are we living the message as far as the message of this last Tahiti our kids seeing that or are your kids looking to somebody else are they looking for that message somewhere else they're going to get a message somewhere they're going to learn a message from somebody and let me tell you right now dads you better be involved in your kid's life you're in a society now that teaches them everything under the sun and you're a bad parent if you don't allow it according to them you better be this message right now in this age more than any other age you're in a society where it's all about me It's All About Me Society the people in today's society one and whatever anybody can give them they feel the government owns them owes them they feel the world owes them and they're going to take that's the message they're sending out that's the message the world's receiving and they're giving it hahaha sometimes we have to live out a page of the old book for God to open our eyes to see the chapter in the new book yeah yeah sometimes the old book brother Joel has to come at play in our life a mistake a fault of failure sometimes you got to be flat on your back so you can look up and God's holding this book right above you and says this is what you should have done the whole time what is your book reading which one are you reading the most but people today they want all the attention is no exception people in the in the message nowadays they want attention preachers they want to be in a certain big preacher big name preacher group I care less God didn't call me a big preacher group I'm a help all lowercase letters I help if I don't want to be any more than that I don't want to be no more than that there might be guys out here that think you know they're gonna get better recognition if they're with this group of preachers or this group of preachers guess what group I'm in biggest name preacher of all that's what group I'm in Christ that's the biggest name out there [Applause] but we want to give glory to men and and that's sometimes it's not the preacher's fault you get people you could tell when people are stuck on one preacher they'll follow him everywhere he goes if he goes on special meetings they go everywhere that's who that's the preacher they quote all the time they forgot how to spell brother Branham they quote that preacher all the time brother so-and-so said this brother so and so said that brother so and so said this what'd the Bible say God gives gifts he gives Talent to people and people want to steal the glory for it they want to steal the glory that's the message they're sending it's about me I did this I did that what did God do what message are you giving people that you did so and so you laid hands on so and so you sing this song you wrote this song and you want everybody to give you the glory who gave you the talent who gave you the gift that's the part we forget it's given of God what do you think happened to the children of Israel they gave glory to an image that they made they gave Glory God's glory and God destroyed them that spirit is still alive that's it's not changed brother Graham said at 59 when Jesus was here on Earth all things he did he gave God all the glory Jesus gave God all the glory all of it not 99 percent for God to use you he has to empty you of you he has to empty you you have to be a willing vessel so it's not you to start with it's not you to start with it's God using the vessel guys want to get glory for laying hands on somebody and praying for them they get healed of cancer I prayed for this person and they got healed I I I we it's all about God from from the very first scripture I read it's all about God this message that you were supposed to be the messenger of it's all about God Brandon said the mighty conqueror but you see it didn't last because if a man is to conqueror his objectives must be right and motives must be right what are your objective motives and objectives to bring glory to yourself to let everybody know who you are to let everybody know what you did is that your motive I'll read a little more and if you don't play the game fair you're bound to lose no matter how much conqueror you are you have to follow the rules of the game to be a winner if you cheat you're put out of the game no matter how good player you are so Hitler never followed the rules what an example he wanted all the power to himself he wanted all the glory to himself therefore his objective was wrong any man that has those motives and objectives I'm gonna go ahead and stop right there might not want me to read that last part we'll end up just like Hitler did it's quite an example you might say I am giving God the glory is your wife is your life expressing that is your life expressing I'm giving God the glory is your mouth expressing I'm giving God the glory can people look at you and see your humble spirit your Meek and contrite spirit are they seeing somebody that's boastful prideful boastful prideful it's all from hell you can turn it any way you want to your tear and pay you're bringing in Reading pages off your old book all glory goes to God brother Brian said how can I overcome remember your life will testify louder than your mouth what you live will prove to people more than what you say sometimes Satan's going to use somebody else's life to influence you Satan's going to use somebody else's message in their life to influence you you think well Joe how does that happen go ask somebody that still says they believe this message but don't come to church well because there's too many hypocrites there's too many Hypocrites you know why they say that they got nothing else they got nothing else so basically you're allowing Satan to use somebody's message and you're fulfilling it you're fulfilling it you're taking the message they're preaching to you because you're looking at their life oh lord they're claiming to be a Christian they're doing that they're doing this and they're preaching their life is preaching to you and you're accepting it you're accepting it you're fulfilling a page in their book that Satan wrote about them why don't you come to church and you influence them with the right message if they're being a hypocrite maybe God wants you to come in and you can preach your life to them let your life speak to them I'm going down here and it says close them to wind it down influence now you know there is somebody that you are influencing your life has a written epistle read of all man therefore if your life isn't according to your testimony or your testimony according to your life rather you are putting a stumbling block in somebody's way for somebody is watching you some little child is watching his mother watching his dad your life's going to be contagious one way or the other it's going to be contagious if your life is preaching this word this message if it's preaching the same message when you buy yourself as it is when you're in church you're going to be contagious but if your life is preaching something different you're still going to be contagious because people are watching you your kids are watching you they're watching how Mom and Daddy interact they're watching how dad treats mom and Mom treats dad there's got to be a life there has to be a life that speaks what is what is that life going to speak it's going to speak the name of Jesus Christ your life preaches Christ that's what the message is right that's what brother Branham pointed everyone to that's what his whole the Malachi 4 and 5 was to come to turn the hearts back right for what the name of Jesus Christ amen the name above all names you know I was studying this I got to thinking of Mary in Elizabeth and I got to thinking how Mary Gabriel told Mary you're going to have a child you know how all that went then he tells her to go see Elizabeth the Bible says she gave salutations unto Elizabeth and took a prophet to come say what those salutations were he said that was the first time the name of Jesus Christ was spoke on human lips I'm going to have a son but Graham says she says are you married oh no no but he says it's not it's of God and Elizabeth catches that and calls her the mother of my Lord oh but the thing that got me the most was the name when she spoke it life coming to a dead baby life it was the message that Mary brought and wasn't me it wasn't the message Mary brought to Elizabeth wasn't about herself she wasn't telling her this is about me this is about Jesus that was the message she conveyed to Elizabeth and Life coming to that dead baby there had to be a life in there for life to come in there when you express your life to someone else for them to receive it they have to have that same life it may lay dormant for years anybody lay dormant for many years and that name was spoken to that seed that's in there they're predestinated ordained oh when when I think of predestination and how long a dormant seed can lay in there I always think of when brother Brandon went to the other side and that young woman came up to him woman comes up to him said brother Brown do you remember me he said no I don't said you baptized me led me to the Lord when I was 90 years old 90. she was predestinated to receive a message she was predestinated for to receive a message of the name that name was said he said she said you led me to Christ to Christ that was the message he gave her nine years old if that seed had never been in there if it had never been there it would have never received that message go listen deep call to the Deep I've said that here 100 times it's a free destination before you can receive brother brother when you come in the message it was something that spoke from here to something that was in there before the foundation of the world and when you took your first breath of life when you took your first breath of life God put it in there and said one day somebody's going to have an influence on that seed there's going to be a messenger come and that messenger might be Larry Elliott look brother Robin Larry tell you that story sometime it's a life and Strikes something if that's seed there's something you think there's something about that person something about him is speaking to me I've got to talk to him why it's kindred it's the same name in here that's in there and you didn't realize it was there were called to be Messengers why it had to be Shepherds the Holy Ghost the angel of the Lord appeared to Mary and told her she was going to have a baby knowing no man told her about Elizabeth's conditions she went up to the hills of Judea to tell Elizabeth and when she met Elizabeth she told her she was going to be a mother she couldn't understand it knowing no man but she said the Holy Spirit overshadowed me and this holy thing that'll be born of me will be called the son of God and I'll call his name Jesus and that the first time the name Jesus was ever spoken on a human lip a little dead baby in his mother's womb leaped for joy and shouted foreign actually said John received the Holy Ghost right then he received the Holy Ghost so if you ever answer your question if anybody could be born with the Holy Ghost and jumped in the womb of a mother and it never had received life yet the name of Jesus Christ spoke life unto a dead baby what it ought to do in a church that claims to be born again the name of Jesus just to name Jesus what it ought to do to a church that says I'm born again I got the honor several years ago and I'm not going to call their names they wouldn't want me to anyway I got the honor of baptizing a young sister in our church she'd been backsliffed her testimony was what her husband had she wanted she said I want one he's got he's not a breacher one of the most godliest men in this church got one of the sweetest spirits what she had for a moment God closed the Satan's book and said it's your time it's your time and what was in her husband's life spoke to her and said I want that what he's got I want what he's got that's how a message in our life is preached he didn't get up every morning and brown beater and say you better get saved he didn't say you're not seeing our kids so you get saved he lived he got up in the morning went to church went to work a Christian came home a Christian went to bed a Christian got up the next morning a Christian it's as simple as that don't complicate it it's as simple as that it's a life that's lived it's a life that you live that people can hear his life spoke the name of Jesus and there was a seed of life in her that responded that that might be the way it happened with many of us the name speaks to us the woman at the well Jesus said I am he that speaks to thee I am he she knew one was coming we've heard we've heard the ones come I'm he it touched her then what did she do she went and told the whole city the whole city turned out because of her testimony so your life might touch one person or many your host school maybe look how this nation was touched recently over an injury on the football field for the first time on ESPN you had a guy bowed his head and prayed and said God's name and nobody said anything about it there's power in that name I don't care whose lips it comes off of you say well they don't belong to the message there's power in that name amen let's Stand Together [Applause] sometimes we need to tell the devil you all heard people say I'm not talking to people I'm not wasting my breath on him well Jesus talked to him you know you you hear you know a lot of the times people get that because they say you know I don't uh you know you shouldn't confess things well I'm not talking about confessing you know if doctor tells you have cancer you say I'm not confessing that I totally agree don't say that don't say it out loud I got cancer you know if you don't want to say it don't say it but when God said you can be healed of cancer why don't you tell him that why don't you tell him you know Satan can put thoughts in your mind but he can't read your thoughts so brother Ram said you get a thought here don't speak it you can't read your thoughts but if you're thinking hey I'm going to be cancer hey God's going to save my kid God's going to save my son going to save my daughter he's going to deliver say it out loud let him hear it tell him about it speak that name to him Jesus said Greater Works than this shall you do let him know don't just keep it to yourself if you don't want to tell nobody else at least for for goodness sake tell the devil let him know what his end is let him know that you've beat cancer amen let him know that you've been saved let him know that you've been delivered delivered of spirits and whatever he's the one who gave them to you so let him know I'm not taking them you know brother Donnie she's referenced so many times about the box of rattlesnakes send it back providing a big note on top of there when you send it back let him know this ain't mine it's yours take it back to hell amen can we sing that song but look you're going to sing or somebody else going to sing what a wonderful name

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mWDQEXQiWg\n========================================\n\n[Music] please have your seats we're about ready to begin [Music] sister Khloe Hara has put this skit together for all of you and she has done a wonderful job we hope you enjoy it I have seen pieces of it and I think you will really really be inspired by what you see remember these are uh you know these are not professional actors though might be a few mistakes so we hope that you have Grace for them and uh and really really touched my heart when I saw them practice it has been a long time since we've done anything having to do with a skit with our little assembly and and it's just so nice to see them participate for for your benefit so please go ahead and like I said move your seats so you can get a good chair I don't want you to be obstructed by any of the table candles and we'll be starting shortly this kid is named Just As You Are thank you we find ourselves in Great king Tim's throne room on the seventh day of the great banquet the King has just sent for his Queen vashi so that all may observe how fair she is as you guys know my kingdom Reigns from Ethiopia to India and you know I have to deal with the Phoenicians the Egyptians and everything it's kind of crazy but these new AG westerners these benites these Spencer ites and don't even get me started on these raganit that I have to deal with okay oh look here comes one now your majesty what's going on what's up I come from the queen vashi my king the queen has refused to attend your Royal Bank banquet tonight what her exact words were tell the king that I am much too busy and have much better things to do with my precious time than to attend his stupid banquet yikes that's rough are you just going to take that that is so disrespectful that woman needs to be put in her place man if the queen can treat the king like this my wife's going to stop doing the dishes and start to think she can boss me around this is outrageous who does she think she is all I want for her to do is spend time with me but she can't even do that your majesty it sounds to me like you got yourself a queen who has a feminine Spirit on her that is not going to go over well in your kingdom it's going to spread like wildfire I agree Tim you need to find yourself a new wife one that is worthy to be called your bride not someone who thinks she is higher than you but someone who will rule by your side you know what you make a good point let's have a meeting with her tomorrow tomorrow so we can send her away and then ha guy we'll get all the young eligible maintenance in the land and find one among them to replace [Applause] her okay look don't look too intimidating I know that's really easy for you John Michael but Josiah let's just come it down let's make this as easy as possible for her oh my goodness here here comes the Moose now yeah go ahead I don't understand so what if I didn't come I do so much for you I've redecorated the entire Palace I've gotten you a whole new wardrobe so you can be a stylish King I even got you this poodle hey bud I did not want that okay anything I could ever want is at my disposal I'm the king I can set my fingers and I can have it and don't even get me started on this Ukrainian looking poodle okay everything that you've bought me has been with my own money so the one thing that you could have given me that you didn't was your love and your time but you're too busy you're too busy being a vain Queen and not setting an example so how about you do this take Mr poodle and get out of my face that is a Miss poodle to you I believe oh my goodness gracious now the king dismissed vashi and sent out letters to all the princes of the land stating that the single ladies were to present themselves as candidates to be the next Queen all right waiting on one more oh There She is welcome ladies I am hay I the messenger from the King and today I'm going to be preparing teaching you to prepare yourself for the king so one of the things that you need to know about King Tim is he loves Simplicity it's his favorite thing in the world he also loves music and his favorite color is blue have y'all heard a word I've said this whole time oh are you talking okay so I can tell there's only one person listening to me and that's Esther over there she's already even got the color blue on even before I even said anything she's taking down notes heeding my words and she's going to do very well for the king he's very particular and he is not going to take another vashy are you kidding me with this guy he acts like he knows it all like he's some important Angel Sent From Heaven I mean really does he think I need help pleasing the king look at me I'm literally perfect I know right who doesn't want to be like our girl vashy she be out there living her life not listen into nobody honestly I think the king just wanted someone younger and like with better hair what if her bow talk stopped working bless her heart I feel so bad for her but honestly it's great for us right I mean it just feels right it's almost like I was created for such a time as this I know I have spent my entire life training for this moment right here ever since I was a little girl my mother always knew something like this was going to happen for me I think I know what I'm doing more than hey gu does but I cannot say the same thing about Esther though look at her she's literally taking notes what a nerd she's so quiet and compliant I'm sorry is this a safe space okay good because I just can't see how her and those horrible split ends that I can see all the way from here are not GNA please the king I just someone had to say it okay I think someone needs to say this about you four talking this badly about Esther so like you said this is a safe space you for put the fool in foolish virgin that's all I'm saying so I will give you one more opportunity to have a chance with the King and if you don't heed my words the rest is in your hands so you're going to each need to come up with a talent or a gift to theing gifts a talent or a king or oh my word if you were like Esther you would have known that I said you'd like to do something involving music because that's what the king loves that's all I'm saying I am the most fit girl there is I just hit my PR with 500 plates yeah I know and I am going to beat his strongest man in arm wrestling like easy peasy lemon squeezy well I am an artist at heart and I'm going to paint the king the most beautiful painting he has ever seen and guess what the painting is going to be me because there's truly no one more beautiful than I well I need to spill some tea on her Queen bashy I mean I love her but I heard she didn't want to entertain for the king he needs to look no further because I'm basically viral on the gram for my acting skills I have like a thousand followers I know I'm waiting for that blue sh any day now I am so going to follow you well I think I'm just going to bake the king a cake way to a man's heart for sure like not to brag or anything but not only am I the best baker in the land I'm also the most beautiful the most kind the most thoughtful the most humble Baker in all of the land girls did you not hear what hey guys said no what did you he said King wanted Simplicity that he enjoyed music I'm telling you that guy hey guy guy whatever does not know what he's talking about hagy was appointed by the king to instruct us to make us look and act like a bride that the king desires he has been in the presence of the king and he knows what the king likes because the king told him how could you know better than the appointed one of the king Esther you are thinking like so deep into this we clearly know what we're doing you do you though and good luck with that you'll need it for the next months the girls perfected their many talents and gifts and spent many many many hours PR pampering themselves making sure that they would look good for the king each one thought that they knew best how to please the king Esther however listened to hegi and did only what he told her to do soon enough the day to meet the king would arrive I just love mirrors don't you they just make them so beautiful these days I bet it's because we're all standing in front of them I'm just not sure how the king is going to pick one of us I'm kind of hoping he's like King Solomon and he wants a thousand wives we can be like sisters well this dress 10,000 shekels this necklace I'm not going to tell you

wanted to go in through the king just like she was she adorned herself like the Pentecostal women ought to with a Meek humble spirit and when all these fancy first ladies come by with all their new Fang dangle things the looked at him and put him in the chamber with the concubines but when this Esther come into His sight and he got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's her go get the crown and put it on her head that's it let them Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit not only the women but the man too Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit then you're becoming ready for the the the bright sweet Reverend Esther made her heart clean [Music] thank you all for your attentiveness as our young couples performed just as you are that encapsulates the crowning of Queen Queen Esther Our Hope for this skit this play was that you bring it brings to remembrance that when he chose you you know we we watched the actors portray those that would be Queen they brought all their abilities all their works the things that they felt like they could do themselves that they would give God and they would give to the king and their abilities would make make the king a better King remember he gave them a year to prepare and in the preparation they were supposed to prepare for this day when they was to meet the king and bring themselves before the king but during that whole time they were supposed to be listening to what Hagi was telling them this is what the king designed IR s this is what the king wants and we know what the king wanted was Esther brought nothing that's what the king wanted from Esther nothing as we heard Hagi speak to us this week when he said what you can bring to God is nothing tonight hay will speak to you again hay will tell tell you what you need to bring to the king and he I will again tell you tonight come as you are don't bring anything you've got nothing in your life that would make him a better God you have nothing to offer him that would make you a better Esther so tonight if we would heed what Hagi told him understand what God's desires are for you God's desires for you is fellowship God's desire for you is to Crown you God God wants you to bring nothing and God wants to give you everything because he already has everything so we hope that the skit that you heard tonight will bring to remembrance God wants you just as you are it ain't your abilities it's not how good a Christian you could try to be you let God live through you you let the King live through you that's what he wants so we hope you were

so without further Ado I would ask brother Donnie if he would please come up and introduce our speaker and uh and just know that that we love you with all of our hearts and I pray that the atmosphere so fills your heart tonight that you uh leave this place being blessed it's certainly been our privilege to be able to host this time um we're so grateful for those of you that have come and be sure when you go back home to express our appreciation to your pastor and church family for um being able to allow you to come we're so grateful for that as a pastor you kind of guard your sheep and watch them as far as where they go and all that so we count it an honor that your pastors would feel like that you could come and spend this time with us and feel like you wouldn't be hurt or you know anything like that my mind as I look at this occasion tonight and I hope with all of my heart that there will be none of us missing at the great King's banquet but that's the most important thing in our life every young person here tonight that was allowed to be here and participate in this had to be registered your name had to be there your pastor's name and all the different information that you gave even so for the marriage supper of the Lamb people can't just come because they want to but you have to be invited and then you respond to that invitation we're grateful for all the preparation thank the Lord for all those that waited on you tonight and um many of the sisters have been working working all this decoration and all the things that they've done we so appreciate them for doing that we're really privileged to have brother Andrew Spencer going to come and speak for us now I want to just open our hearts and see what the Lord has I'm sure you have needs in your life life you have a need you just want to raise your hand to the Lord that he'll just take our brother and remember that a gift in a man's life is there to help him get out of the way but you can pull on that gift and God can be able to minister to you through that gift a banquet is a different type setting than church but we know that it can also be a place by which great wonderful things can happen and I find it amazing that when we go we find fin make the Rapture and we go into the presence of God and we are there and that table is set thousands of miles long and the great king will come out and he'll walk by each of your chairs and you will finally have your opportunity to look at Jesus in the face most of us probably is going to be crying he will reach down and grab a hold of His Garment and pull it up and rub the tears from your eyes we're here tonight that we might have a little more preparation for that moment I've served him since I was a 12 year old boy I'll be 68 in a month in a few months been preaching since I was 18 and sometimes I don't feel like I know much of anything about him because he's so great and so wonderful we certainly don't want to be like the skit portrayed it that we don't think we need the advice of those men that God has called do we we want to take heed and we want to listen to it so we'll invite brother Andrew if you'll just come and you open your heart to the Lord and we just so appreciate you coming so very much man God bless you this evening I trust you all have enjoyed yourself here amen this has certainly been one of the grandest times of of our life sitting here around this table it it reminds us that this is this is just a preview of what we're getting ready to we're getting ready to see this is just maybe a little foretaste of of what heaven has in store for each and every one of us and I tell you we're just a we're a blessed people and uh we want to thank Word of Life Church here for allowing all of these young people to come and be a part of these this moment and time and y'all don't tell any anybody but I tell you don't tell anybody else I said this but this is the nicest banquet I've ever been to and uh it's uh it's quite well done and I I I know that you understand that so before we just kind of get to our thought here tonight and look over some things that the Lord has placed on our heart for this evening I wonder how many would have a need tonight that you'd like to just maybe lift up your hand and amen our Lord can come in every single setting many times you've met him in your car many times you've met him at at church and different places this might be just a little bit different setting here tonight but our Lord is wanting to come and speak to you because he's placed it on these brothers hearts and then he put a man here behind the pulpit to say something to you so we recognize that your need can already be met here just now so let's just take one another by the hand if it doesn't make you feel awkward anden may we just talk to the Lord just now Heavenly Father we come before you Lord in this time lord it's our privilege Lord Jesus Lord to sit around this table with brothers and sisters Lord that we believe that we're going to spend the rest of our life with Lord eternity will only tell father who is sitting right beside us what it meant for us to go through a journey with them knowing father Lord Jesus that you set up these things in our mind Lord you set up these things Lord that we're just thinking about how we're going to do our hair and how what kind of dress that we're going to wear but father before time you saw each and every one of us sitting at our table Lord but God I'm so thankful to know that there has been a reservation father for every one of your children Lord to sit around the banqueting table father and I pray Lord tonight that you would just begin to speak to your children Lord you see their needs you see their hearts and I pray that this service tonight will be a blessing to them in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and now I know that many of you don't have your Bibles but I I would like for you to stand with me just to honor the word of the Lord as we just take a little thought here this evening the Bible says here in Esther chapter 2 after these things when the wrath of King aerus was appeased he remember vasy and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the king's servant that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins under the Shuan and the palace under the house of the women under the custody of hegi the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things of purif ification be given them let the hidden or let the maiden which pleaseth the king be Queen instead of aasta and the king and the thing pleased the king and he did so also the Bible says here in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into this world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou Hast prepared me you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord I would like to take a thought here this evening on something that the Lord's been dealing with me on for quite some time about these meetings I would like to take a thought here tonight on destined for the crown destined for the crown and brother brandham said in the Ephesian Church age he said the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is liken to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect and what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all her works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one a it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God has spoken it just to kind of place it in view as it's been done so wonderfully here tonight this skit that was put on we recognized just to set a a a basis here for this thought here tonight we recognize that the king had made a feast just like this one the king had showed all of his riches for many many days unto the Kings and the princes of the land and there were special Arrangements that was made and then the king called for a feast of all the people of the land and there all the accommodations that were made and set and all the things were made for the vast crowd that was going to come we're sitting here I understand that it's about 190 to close to 200 young people sitting here but in that time when King aerus was sitting in his condition or in his place of position he was sitting there and it is told in history that Persian kings when they would when they would hold a feast of this matter it would hold anywhere from 15,000 to 18,000 people at one time no and and it would be held in the garden because there would be huge amounts of people and all the accommodations were made and all of the things were made according to the things of how the king liked it exactly to the way the king stated in his decrees and how he wanted things and when the people would come in they would sit there and they would sit around and they would be dazzled by The Columns of marble they would look at the King's favorite colors of blue green and white of tapestries that would hold hold the curtains and things and they would be sitting in a place or a condition and all of it was to match the king's kingship all of it was in place there was anything there was nothing that was lacking kind of like what we see here tonight the couches that were laid out for men to rest upon they were made of gold these these people that were sitting there that were from the different provinces they were taking of the best of the best of the wine that the king had stored up only for himself but the king did not hold any of the stimulation back he gave it to the people according to his will and we recognize that on the seventh day is when he made a call for the queen and then vasty did not come unto the king but we recognize that there was a call for somebody to come and to take the crown somebody to step into the place now the Bible said in Proverbs 31 and10 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband do safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life now I know that many of you sitting here from all the way from 15 years old and upwards but one of the greatest treasures that you can have in life that you'll find is a helpmate and any man that has been married for quite some time he knows the difference between a good wife and the opposite but one of the greatest things that God can give you is a lovely wife or a helpmate or somebody that is faithful somebody that is true somebody that is honest somebody that's that is Honorable that is trustworthy and somebody that that has a love towards you no matter whether it's male or female that their love it it passes Beyond barriers it looks beyond faults that her love knows no distance her love knows no bounds her love is patient her love is kind her love is passionate she is a woman if you if you are really seeking for a woman or a man you are wanting somebody that fears the Lord somebody that's got the kind of love that ask actually has the attributes of almighty God God that has been deposited in that other vessel that you're looking for that other one that that woman that he is looking for will have the kind of words like Ruth would say unto Naomi when orpa would kiss her on the cheeks and turn back to the back to the moabitas gods she Ruth would look onto her Naomi and said andreat me not to turn away as well for where you go I will go where you Lodge I will Lodge your people will be my people where you live I will live where you die I will die where you're buried that's where I'll be buried at and that's the kind of love that God is wanting to find in somebody that is that is fit to wear the crown in his position and in his place that he has set aside and we recognize that all the way back as you look and you look at the drama of God's of God's Great drama that he laid out for us we read it in the word that God had longed for a helpmate God had longed for a counterpart that we see all the way there in the garden of the Eden that God seen Adam that he was in a place where Adam had all the animals he had everything that could accommodate him in the natural but yet there was something on the inside of Adam that was lacking and it was something on Adam that he was he was lonely for a helpmate so God caused a deep sleep to come upon Adam and there out of the sight of Adam God pulled a very part of himself out and he brought forth Eve which Adam would call a woman for she is bone of my bone and she is Flesh of My Flesh and ever since the Garden of Eden when do you watch how that she walked out how that Adam and Eve walked and they broke the trust that God had imparted unto them almighty God has been waiting for centuries he's been building a church that he could have that Holy Union with again somebody that would love him in sickness or in health in Pros in prosperity and in good times and in bad times God has been longing for somebody that he could have fellowship with somebody that would not be deceived by the things of the world somebody that would would fully give over to his complete power brother Brandon would say it like this in a church age book he said now Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride he said just as the saint as men choose their Brides today he said the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband no sir he said it's the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride for we know that the Bible said that you didn't choose me you've not chosen me but I have chosen you and brother Ram goes on to say he said the heart purpose of God the heart purpose and the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing he did not Choose You because of who you are or your last name he did not Choose You Because of You Came because of a out of a certain church or out of a certain group he chose you because you were in his mind before the foundation of the world and that is exactly what the message of the hour has done for you in this hour it has taken you and it has placed you in a position that God has been longing for for 6,000 years that we know of in time that God has been longing for a place that there is a place beside our King that is want that he's wanting to be filled and that's exactly what the message of the hour has done for you it has bled you back into a spot that we recognize that we are not a broken bride but we are a restored bride a woman that has knows Fellowship by relationship by predestination a woman that understands the assembling of herself together by The Fellowship of the word of God this God that chose you thought of you before you were ever born here and before you ever fail and before you ever had mistakes this God chose you he elected you you had certain places that you were destined to set here tonight and maybe you didn't get to choose exactly where you or who you wanted to set beside but there was somebody that picked out a spot for you aren't you thankful that you didn't have to pick out your own spot in God's mind that almighty God already picked out a spot for you because if you would have picked your own spot you'd have been out in misery already you'd have already been in TMO but almighty God picked a spot for you and to know this tonight that your circumstances of Life do not change your calling no matter where you are no matter where you came from it does not change your calling remember before Esther was ever to be putting on the crown she was an orphan but when by the end of Esther's story she is not going to be known as an orphan no longer she's going to be known as a queen and when God gets done with you you might have mistakes upon your life you might have troubles upon your life but your story is not going to be troubles your story is not going to be the stories that were written in Le osia but your story is going to be known as the title as Miss Jesus Christ a lady that was so destined to look the part to dress apart somebody that would be fitting to the kingdom when you go to studying out Esther's name her name means star somebody that would rise somebody that that's what we see is a star that would rise and that's what we watched in this generation when God would take a star in this generation and hold it in his hands he was waiting for a certain time to release the seventh star in this generation because he has a certain time that he's going to release release a star because he knows he knows that that star is going to call and it's going to attract a certain people and when he allowed Esther to rise in her position it was only for King Xerxes or aerus that he was going she was fit for him she was destined to match up with his kingship and when God allowed William Bram the Seven Star to be released in this generation he recognized he recognized that it was going to attract a certain people that way have the characteristics that would be called and chosen in this generation that would match him for this hour because he he could not release Luther star in this generation because it wouldn't match your testimony he couldn't lose Wesley star in this generation because it wouldn't match your testimony but the morning star and the evening star are only reflecting of a greater light and we recognize by the message that the same star that rises in the morning is the same star that we see in the evening it's just rolled itself around so it's a sign unto us that there is going to be an alpha bride and there is an Omega bride that will stand in this generation and we recognize that you didn't get here on your own course you didn't choose your own way there was somebody that led you there was somebody that called you there was somebody that destined before you something there's a course that is set before you you may have picked out your career you may have picked out certain things of your life but we know that the Bible tells us or Jesus tells us that the that God that he would be a God he would be he would be the spirit of Truth and he would be our comforter and he would lead us he would guide us so no matter what or where you come from your circumstances of Life he's always been there all the days of your life watching over you one of my favorite quotes that William Brandon makes a statement t i I believe that I believe that it's probably even some of yours that if you've studied the message he says in the God who is rich in Mercy he said now many of you can fellowship with me on this thought he said because he said when you was a child he said there was something he said he said there was something there he said it didn't he said maybe it didn't bother maybe this one or that one he said but something on the inside of you it cried out he said it was that little germ of life right there and then it was something on the inside of you that maybe maybe you didn't know maybe you didn't know what was calling you maybe you didn't know why you didn't go and try to build up certain characteristics of working out your arm so that you could arm wrestler The King's chamber it maybe it wasn't certain things that maybe you built up in your life but there was something there that the rest of the world didn't know but there was something there that was keeping you all the days of your life when the rest of the world could go out and be a part of the enticement and spirits of the generation you couldn't go after them things because there was a greater calling on your life and when other people would pick it up you would put it down and the reason of this is because you're not a vasy I want to say this to you tonight vasy will never be an Esther but Esther will never be a vasty there will be a lot of people that think they're called to this wedding supper but there's only only one generation there's only one person that is set there that is set for that por that portion of scripture that is laying there the Bible said in Proverbs 12:4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh the shamed is his rottenness in his bones so I know which one you would choose is that right I know that probably none of y'all have this on your mind you're probably not here to think about you're probably only here for the word you probably didn't come here to meet a significant other I'm not as dumb as I think as I look I but there's something I know but there's something on the inside of you that that maybe when you when you found that want that it begin to it begin to Sparkle a little something in your eye brother brandom would talk about Esther how that how that she'd walked out how that her beautiful hair and he said her eyes he would talk about Eve and he would talk about how that her how that her eyes were as beautiful as the sky and any of you that have found that significant one you know what it it's a good pickup line if you don't know it your daddy must be a thief cuz he stole the stars from the sky and put them in your eyes but the first thing let me move let me move I didn't come here for pickup lines but see me after church you're the only 10 I see so but if you're going but if you found that one the first one the first thing brother Brandon would tell us the first thing that comes is a decision the next is the engagement then the promise and then the ceremony he goes he says this he says she takes the bridegroom's name and when the church has the ceremony and makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom's name that she's no longer a church of the world she is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ he said not by name he said but by birth by Nature power of God revealed to the church in her in the heart she becomes a a Christian church and we recognize that there has been a preview in the bride when all the other maidens would come before him but when it became Esther's turn she didn't want the things of the world she wanted only what the king desired and I believe that that's every call and every Christian's heart that's only the thing that we want we don't want the things of Le osia we only want what pleases him if it doesn't please him I don't want it if it doesn't please him I don't want to be a part of it if it doesn't if it doesn't attract his attention we shouldn't be a part of it because God does not count how beautiful we are in the natural God counts something way deeper than things on the outside of the appearance God sits and looks for something that of character he don't count how many people are here he is looking for character something that will last when the rest of the world has passed away it's something that he saw in you before the foundation of the world and everything that you touch seems as Esther would make her way into the kingdom everything that she touched was blessed and when the king's keeper saw her he knew that there was something different about her she didn't look like vasty she didn't act like vasty and when hegy ey saw her how that she handled herself according to Malachi for's word he be to watch her and he was in intent on her success he was going to make sure he was going to make sure that the methodists in the Church of Christ did not get in front of her he was intent on her success to make sure that he whispered every secret that he knew about the king everything that elaser knew about Isaac he was beginning to tell to Rebecca and tell her this is what the king likes he likes it just like this he wants you dress like this he wants you to be robed exactly like this let me say this to you Esther submitted herself to Malachi 4's teaching she didn't pay attention to what the world said but she paid attention to what the king's Chamberlain had in mind and I believe that is a testament to who you are tonight the way that you showed up here brothers and the way that you showed up here sisters it shows in your character that you have been paying attention to HEI that there's something about you that maybe you don't even recognize about yourself just now but there's something about you that you wanted to look the part even when you didn't feel the part Hallelujah you're not just another one of the girls because you're not just destined to walk past him one time you're destined to spend eternity with him you're not just destined to come and entertain him and please him every once in a while but you're destined for the crown because he trusts your judgment because there are certain things that he did not accomplish here while he was here on Earth so he said greater things than this shall you do because I go unto my father and I will receive you unto myself so there is a work for you so he trust you and I think it's very powerful that our Lord Jesus Christ has entrusted some of the greatest youth there is on the face of the Earth he's entrusted you with his very own life he's entrusted you with his word he's entrusted you so that you'll not just display himself just at church services but you'll display him when you walk through the mall you'll display him when you go to school he has saw something about you that maybe your parents have haven't even seen in you yet but he has entrusted you with the message of the hour so that you'll carry it out according to his Commission because we know that the modern Church in its condition can never carry out its commission but it's going to be an elected lady somebody that's chosen for it somebody that's called for it you didn't put yourself here it was just a call that went out you didn't put yourself in the picture but because you were a Virgin by the blood of Jesus Christ he drawed You by his power he draw you into the kingdom to match his kingship she was a woman of character that would do only as the king pleases as you seen the other girls they wanted to dress himself the other girls wanted to paint themselves up but this lady wanted to dress herself under the Robes of Ephesian 4 she wanted to dress herself under Apostles and Prophets and teachers and pastors she wanted to dress herself according to the scripture because she had heard that she was a king that had liked certain things and when she went in before the king don't dress me the way I want to dress don't let me D be dressed with my attitude don't let me be dressed in my own righteousness don't let me be dressed with what I think the message is but let me be dressed according to the message the way he wants it to be mess how he wants it to be fitted in this hour don't let me cut off certain parts of the Gown don't let me cut off certain parts of I don't need a part of Revelations 3 and14 I don't need this over here in John 3:16 but let me be dressed according to the way that he wants me to be dressed and when you get there on Rapture morning you'll take a spin around and you'll say the dress fits me just perfect it's a beautiful thing when you begin to watch a wedding and I know there's several that's getting ready to take place but when the when the bride to be begins to try on her dress it shows her character when she picks out a dress according to the message and when she goes all the emotions are involved in it she's waited for this day ever since she was a little bitty girl she's dreamed about this she's had little Barbie dolls set out and she's had all of them at her wedding time and time again she's got poster boards on Pinterest and different things lined out this is how I'm going to to do it she's dreamed about it but when she puts the dress on she knows I'm in the final moments I'm in the spot where prophecy is becoming reality and when you come under the preaching of the word young people you're coming under it you're seeing yourself and I if I could maybe just change your view from what you see in the world just to see his you're beginning to look the part now you've dreamed about it for a long time but maybe I'll change your view because whenever I'm at a wedding a lot of people turn to see the bride but I always turn to see the groom because it's his first time seeing her dressed this way maybe I'll just change maybe your view just for a moment from the King's Point of View you're looking the part you're everything that he's wanting all you have to do is keep feeding on this message keep listening to this word don't matter don't pay no attention to the rest of the people that are sitting up there on the porch while they're criticizing making fun and thinking that he'll never come back for you don't you pay no attention to them because he made you a little he give a little no love note and he put on the he put on you a seal a kiss a seal of the Holy Ghost that it was a promise to you that I'm coming back for you with one year and the rest of the world may life at you and they might criticize you but he's promised you when the rest of the world don't understand why you're dressing yourself the way that you're dressing yourself you simply say he promised me that he was coming back for me and if he promised me that he was coming back for me I'm going to keep myself according to his word not what the rest of the world thinks but I'm going to dress myself according to the way that he wants when you begin to study out Esther and you begin to study it through the message one of the most amazing things to me is when brother Brandon begins to identify and study out Esther he identifies her with the woman with the alabaster box I look long and hard at and I thought how in the world could brother brandham identify her with this woman of disgrace a woman that had spent her life doing evil Deeds but he did not compare her to her mistakes he did not compare her to her last name he did not compare her according to her Deeds that she' done he compared her to her spirit because when this woman when she saw Jesus sitting in a seat unwelcomed she came before him with all that she had William brandom identified her that she came before him in a quiet pure Meek Spirit exactly how Esther came before The King he doesn't see your mistakes he doesn't see where you came from when the rest of the world wouldn't entertain him this woman made a choice I can't come on my own Deeds I can't come upon my own righteousness I can't came I can't come upon my own name because all those are filthy racks but I've got to come before him and when she came before him him and the scripture tells us that she came in behind him and she be to wash his feet with her tears and she begin to break the alabaster box and anoint him Simon was sitting there Judas was sitting there Peter was sitting there if he really was a prophet he wouldn't let this be done he would know what type of woman she is but with Jesus to his back to her begin to tell her story where she came from why she's here you didn't welcome me I'd say that maybe it was kind of a setup like this it was a great feast and people were talking about the politics of the day they were talking about the things of world that were going on and they missed that Jesus was setting over in a corner with 30 feet and all she cared about was coming to worship him let me say when you get done washing Jesus's feet there's something going to be said about it because this woman is not going to go down like the rest of women she is going to be down she's going to go down in history as Jesus would say that wherever the gospel is preached there will be a memorial of this woman I had it in my notes who would set out a chair for the king here we have our lord Jesus sitting here we know his decision about you because he already told us I do but what's your decision today in sickness and in health will you love him will you keep him will you be a wife to him when nobody else wants to be a wife to him will you love him and cherish him would you allow him to come and sit down at your table and be the Unseen guest if you allow him and set out a seat for him you won't be remembered as an orphan no more you'll be remembered as a queen and if you can ever learn this that when Jesus came to meet this woman when he had his back turned to her and she he began to preach to Simon said Simon I left a healing campaign out there I left lepers out there I left blind people out there but because you invited me I came but you didn't wash my feet you didn't anoint me but this woman ever since I got into the room she's had something on her heart that she would worship me all the days of her life when others people wouldn't worship me if you can ever figure out young people that the reason why Jesus is in the room is because of you you'll start living a whole completely different life that the reason why he showed up in these meetings is because of you he didn't show up here because of Andrew Spencer or brother Josh Bennett he did not show up here just because of brother brother Reagan and all of these other brothers he showed up here for you and I believe it ought to be a testament to you of where you're sitting at in your condition right now that he cared so much about you to come all the way from the portals of glory and to come and spend the evening with you that to tell you you're not destined to be in the background he might have found you in the background and you might be back there washing the dishes and you might be back there on the scene when when the rest of the world is in the front of the view but there on the backside when you're throwing out the dishwater that's when he sees your true character and when you're trying to hide that you don't have the nicest of things it's exactly what he's looking for IID say that the Bride of Jesus Christ has everything that our King is looking for and when you get to your position you'll m his kingship and his queenship I believe I believe that we have great anticipation I believe we have great anticipation one of I'm not a very I'm not a very old man I'm getting that way don't stand too close to me because my red hair is looking more like a cinnamon bun than than red hair I'm not too old of a man but I I do wake up with stupid ball injuries every once in a while I wish I wouldn't have done acted like a Superman all those times so I'm giving you a word don't don't act too crazy tomorrow but enjoy yourself I'll be watching you I'm not too old of a man just yet but there's something on the inside of me that longs for a change everything within me I enjoy all these moments I enjoy all these meetings and I enjoy the presence of the Lord more than anything else in this world when you get into that place in that position where you're spending spending that much time with him that you can feel him in the room and you don't want him to leave you're in a position that a queen has been elevated to that the rest of the world don't know what it's like and I hate leaving his presence but I am anticipating more than anything else is coming but can you imagine his anticipation as he looks out upon your life and he sees you matching his promise he say I'm coming soon I promised you I was coming I told you I was coming mother brandham said he could hear that buck wagon coming down the street as the sand was rolling underneath the wheels and it was the last day and she began to dress herself she put on her garments brother brandham said that here she was the bride to be was holding her flower of bouquet in her hand he said without a bit of nervousness because she knew he was coming I love what brother random said he said when she saw that buck wagon turn the corner she jumped off the porch and he jumped off the Chariot and stepped in and swooped her up and told her and said honey it's all over you're destined for a crown so Carrie yourself like he sees you as a queen may God bless his word maybe we'll just have a word of prayer turn it back over to our brother Donnie tonight father oh how we long to live a life that so pleases you a testimony that would match your kingship oh God something that you set up before time before molecules and atoms took their position Lord we invite you father to our hearts like never before Lord every person here sitting under the sound of our voice just now father I'm believing with all of my heart that they're going to be setting there across a table from me and we won't have to we won't have to play games and so who wins the prize because we'll all be winners there father so under that word under that belief father that we'll all be sitting there we won't miss it your Prophet would say in this generation that the bride has the material on Earth to make themselves ready father I pray that they would take this message that I love with all of my heart that changed my my life that saved an old Preacher's Son that that was wward May the message which is Christ come find them lift them up into a position that they'll recognize they were destined for greatness they were destined for the crown I pray God that your blessings be upon your people father I so love them with all of my heart and I trust that they'll be there in Jesus name amen where would I be God only knows I'm glad you see through Eyes Of Love a hopeless case and in [Music] can we stand [Music] together thank you brother Andre so appreciate the word tonight I saw yesterday that in the state of Utah several parents had come to a a middle school because the some of the students in that school consider thems furries so some of them think they are dogs cats raccoons all kinds of animals so they're biting other students in school licking them with their tongue and I read that and I thought what a sad time to be living to we kids think that they're animals a school teacher in the message a while back told me in State North Carolina that they're actually putting out litter boxes for students in the schools because they think they're animals and yet you you've come tonight to be in the presence of God I pray that God will help us to realize how blessed we are what a terrible time men don't know if they're men anymore women don't know if they're women anymore while the world is groping in insanity but God has a bride that recognizes who she is and what she's here for and it's to serve his purpose we've been so honored that you would spend this evening with us we have service tomorrow at 11:00 and then again Sunday for those of you that would like to remain and and be with us in the Sunday service brother Andrew be speaking both there brother Josh did two tremendous services for us and just so blessed to have these brothers that would come and be with us so as you go May the blessing of the Lord just be upon you and just as we sing this song Together think about where would you be if it wasn't for his grace maybe you would think he was a dog or a cat or an animal but God by his grace has opened your eyes to help you to see you're not here just to be an electrician a plumber a housewife a farmer but you're here to serve God's Eternal purpose let me sing it together thank you Lord where would I be you only know Lord [Music] thank you Lord Jesus Through Eyes Of Love hopess case why if not for Grace again can we sing it can we just raise our hands as we sing it together where would I be Lord you want me know thank you Lord Jesus Eyes Of Love a hopess [Music] case if not for grace we'll ask brother Josh if you'll come and and uh dismiss us in prayer thank you so much we want to say again how we appreciate all the preparation of the Lord local church here sisters did all the decoration they spent days and days and doing that getting the food and all that ready the tables and so on could we give them a nice nice hand for that amen let's just bow our hearts together Lord Jesus Lord what a privilege and an honor it is to be ga gaed here this evening Lord to look across this audience of young people and just to think of all the places they could be but yet they're here and they have a desire to serve you and Lord there's something Lord that's that's draw them I believe it's more than just acquaintances and friendships but Lord they they love you and we know God that as it's been said tonight you love them Lord I I just think about as hearing our brother Minister tonight Lord that the scripture says that the bride has made herself ready and then your Prophet said the material that we needed to make oursel ready is now here Lord you provided that through the message of the hour I pray oh God that You' just help us to take take that material now let's just put on the garments and Lord as your Prophet said he he desired that the crowning of his ministry would be that he could dress the bride in the clothes of the word that he could present a bride to you oh God I I pray Lord that I'd be a part of that Lord I pray that every one of these young people will be a part of that Lord may we just stand Lord as a part of that that great bride of all the ages dressed in the clothes of the word wrapped in the Robes of your righteousness Lord I pray that you'll just bless all that has put forth an effort to make this possible I pray God that you would just bless them abundantly and Lord we just give you all the glory and all the honor all the worship and all the praise for you alone are worthy and we ask these things in Jesus name amen brother Rob brother Joe any more announcements that's good to go all right we're finished okay God bless youall

be married to God Amen the right to be married to God Romans chapter 7 remember Lord will in June the 1st be having um Saturday night service communion service be starting about 6 o' brother darl be speaking for us of course everyone is welcome and looking forward to a great time in the Lord June the 1st Saturday night 6: p.m. Romans chapter 7 verse one know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth I watch you changes from verse one to verse Two for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband now we're not talking about the Mosaic law but the law of her husband the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are be come dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead so by the body of Christ we are married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God how many you'd like to be we remember today as we as we pray got some prayer claws here today and also a tie that a brother wants me to pray over and um if you have a need you just hold it there in your heart as we approach the lord lord Jesus our beloved husband how we love you today we are so thankful that you took drunks Liars whoremongers some were religious some were filled with all kinds of unbelief and sin and because of what you did for us we were loosed from the law of our first husband and because of you we have been remarried we are grateful today Lord Jesus we're asking you that you'd be mindful of us as we look into your word help me today father that I can get out of the way take my human instrumentality father and move it aside and use that portion of yourself which is a gift in a man's life anoint that Lord you saw the needs of the people signified by the uplifting of a hand these prayer re calls Lord Jesus that I have here these requests pray that you'd be mindful of them Lord help me father that I I can be able to submit myself to you shut my mouth to anything that would be displeasing to you may we hear from heaven today as we've gathered together here in the house of God in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated truly what a wonderful thing that Mary is if it's carried out according to God's provision and his word the oldest institution in the world God himself was the first one to perform it of course in the Garden of Eden a me for it to be sacred and to Believers it still is Satan has certainly made a sham out of a lot of it and all that people are doing with marriage today but it doesn't take away the sacredness from us as children of God whenever brother brandham was here and he was supposed to been on a hunting trip in 1965 November brother Jack Moore called him and wanted him to come and hold some series of meetings for him in spport Louisiana so when brother brandham preaches is the first night of that service he that series of services he preaches this sermon called The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ and he reads the scripture that we just read here in Romans 7 verse 1 now he says that this scripture is very seldom preached on he said because it uh pertained to marriage and divorce and that a lot of people basically just stayed away from it because marriage and divorce is such a controversial subject but unlike myself and unlike other ministers in the five-fold ministry a prophet has an Insight that someone like me just does not have I'm not called to have it nor is any other aspect of the ministry because a prophet is a sear so when he reads this and he made this statement in paragraph 35 Paul here is giving an illustration in our scripture about the law and Grace an illustrating it like marriage and divorce this passage is very seldom preached on because it's more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce but this is what stuck out to me whenever I heard this but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce so it doesn't just pertain then to a man and a woman but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce how that he's trying to set in order that we as a church now I believe also it's to my belief that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy so there's a greater portion of marriage and divorce in Romans 7 and then also in Romans 7 there is a great mystery of Prophecy again a prophet having the ability to look into the word u unlike myself and other ministers that love God with all of our hearts but we're just not given that ability to do it so Prophet would be able to look at it and see things in there and rightly divide that word and to be able to place it in such a way that be more enlightening for us to see so he saw in this now I find this amazing because as many times as brother brandham dealt with marriage and divorce down through the years this sermon right here things that he says inside of this sermon was never said before or after this sermon and yet he was supposed to have been on a hunting trip boy am I so glad he didn't go now it shows you how God orchestrates things now he said he was standing with a pair of white trousers on in Indian moccasins whenever brother Jack Moore calls him and he schedules this meeting and it must have been so profound in Heaven's Divine orchestration that these things be said because if you haven't listened to it in a while do you good to listen to it but there's so many things that are made clear that the message thus far up to this time now remember this is 11 2565 and he's going to be gone a little over a month from that time so it would have never been said but God divinely orchestrated this because it had to be uttered as a prophetic utterance so what I want to do by the help of the Lord today let us start out by looking at our first Union so if it pertains seem to a greater portion of marriage and divorce now I'm not here today to preach about your marriages and you you should have done this and shouldn't have done that but what I am here today to preach about is the marriage that each one of us had which was wrong that is the marriage to our natural nature and your first husband that had the rule over you was your nature amen so you were were joined into that nature by an act between a man and a woman your mother and father and that set you in line then for this shotgun wedding if you wish to call it that so then we were forced into this Union which was a perverted union now watch he said our natural life here that we have is just a perversion it really should have been the right life to begin with but it's per converted how by the natural birth the first life or your first Union you were joined at Birth by Nature a natural act you were joined to it by Nature at your birth by a natural act a natural human being associated man and woman together Associated together in sexual Affair which brought your first life here that's associated with sin and death how can you miss seeing the serpent see now watch it goes on to say in paragraph 212 now it was nature associated with death your first husband that had the rule over you was your Nature by natural birth so then when we were born we did not express it probably most of us what was going to be there for maybe many years some of you might have start expressing a little bit of it when you were smaller if you had a strong dominating nature about you but maybe for a lot of us it might have been several years before we started displaying that deceitful conniving type of nature or lying or temper or whatever it was but it began to come out the older that we got and our mother and father might watch us and look at us and think where did they get that at they didn't get that from me they didn't get that from you where did they get that at now they're trying to understand it and you yourself of course didn't know because it was natural for you to act that way so if you were shy timid and quiet you don't have to put that on that's your natural nature so if you were buoyant you were loud you were the life of the party so to speak that was natural to you as well so if you was high-tempered high strung whatever it was and that was the husband that you were actually married to so your husband was your first nature and it ruled you as the man is the head of the home as Christ is the head of the body right that's the way God has the order of protocol and headship so then the natural nature that every one of us were born with that was our first husband which had the rule over us so it wasn't that he sat down and talked with us and said now look I'm stubborn I'm hard-headed I'm dominating I'm this this and this and I want your hands I want your eyes I want your nose I want your mouth I want your temperament so that I can be able to display myself and then you said no no no I don't like that I don't want to be that way no you did actually because that was your husband so you were married to that Husband by conception of your mother conceiving from your father then you receive this natural makeup now can't you see why the new births must replace that it must change it this is why it's not enough to just become a church member now that's sad to say but that's where much of Christianity is left today that they actually do get saved but they never go any farther now you can be saved and your first husband still dominating your life let me say it again you can be saved and your first husband dominating your life because you're saved individual but you're not remarried yet now what you said your Nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world and you're part of the world that's right and he said your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of you're a part of nature so that's not odd that's not unusual for the people that are without the Holy Ghost to love the world it's not it's not you know something really strange and odd because that was the nature we all receive we were born of that is it unusual for a bear to act like a bear wouldn't it be really odd if you pull up in the parking lot today and and sitting over beside you in a car was sitting a black bear sitting behind the steering wheel and that black bear drove the car to church and the black bear gets out and it's got on a three-piece suit like mine and got on black shoes like mine with a tie on and you're saying my lord I can't believe this that that bear drove that car to church that bear is dressed up my that that bear surely that bears not going to church wouldn't that really be odd wouldn't that really be strange why it's against its nature but what would it be you saw that bear killing you know a baby calf eating on that calf that's not really odd that's what they do so that bear would smell you and be gone and you you'd see by Nature it's only acting out what it is so when we see Sinners really we should not in that sense really condemn them for what they are doing like nature they're Hogs they live like Hogs they wallow in the marrow like Hogs is that right because it's their nature but what we ought to be ashamed of is people who claim to be Christians and claim to be born again and they're wallowing out there like a pig and acting like a pig and eating what pigs eat and then they claim to have the Holy Ghost no there's something wrong somewhere it's like a bear sitting and driving a car and putting a suit on that's not the way that it works so whenever we're born into this and then we are married to that it's not that God actually condemns The Sinner because the sinner smokes and The Sinner drinks and The Sinner lies and The Sinner cheats God don't condemn the Sinners because they do that he does he condemns them because they refuse to be changed and make them where they don't have to do that anymore right so it's not even the sinner that sins now listen Sinners don't sin Christians do right Sinners are Sinners by Nature so when God looks at them it's not like oh I condemn you because you smoke I condemn you because you drink I condemn you because you look at pornography no no God condemns them because they're a sinner but if Christians socalled do those very things same things then God condemns us and that's why he has Ministry that will come and preach the gospel and say it's wrong for you to do that it's wrong for you to do that and you see with Sinners they're condemned because categorically they're place in that state of being a sinner but God will have men of God to preach individually to Christians and name their individual sins you understand now once you by desire was by nature to love the world with you're a part of you are a part of nature you believe that the people say amen there and that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate now notice what has to happen to you you have to die to that first husband now remember that first husband is not the devil per se it's not Satan or demons per se it is the act between a that took place in the beginning before Adam ever got to his wife in between Satan and Eve and then this has every human being with this type of Fallen nature now remember Satan don't have to do it again and again and again and again all he had to do was do it one time then when the seed Li Minds become mixed in Genesis chapter 6 then every person born is going to have this type of nature now watch he says then we're married to this first nature you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you can't say well I'll divorce him you can't divorce the first nature I'll divorce him and hang him up till the occasion no sir no writing of divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every Speck of him has to die and you have to be reunited again with another nature now notice then so your first husband was your first nature so in order to truly be born again your first nature SL husband has to die but you can't remain without a nature natur so you've got to have a new nature and that new nature will actually be your new husband so that new nature is not what I quit drinking and I quit smoking and I quit no no no no you're do you're doing wrong you're looking at it wrong you're looking well i' done this and I'd done that your new nature is not what you do it's him it's him then he comes in you with his own life he is actually reborn in you every time a person gets the Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus is born in another life praise God every spec of him has to die and you have to be reunited again now remember you are a trinity a tri you being in that you have a soul you have a spirit and you have a body so God cannot kill this sinful nature and leave you without a husband it's mandatory you've got to be married again because without a husband slash nature you would not be the full manifestation of a human being but he will not divorce that one and say well I'll tell you what we'll give him a writing of divorcement and we'll just move him out of the house and then the Lord Jesus say I I I'll move in I'll just move in the house and and mean you have a a wedding ceremony and and this old nature he'll be he'll be down the street you know he'll be down the street you you'll pass by and see him every now and then and he'll pass by and see you every now and then well we know how through social media that many people have met Old Flames and old boyfriends and old girlfriends and they connect on Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and flipflop a lot of other stuff like that well come on don't sit there and look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about and they go to getting reunited with that old flame they call it God don't want you and I reunited with that old flame so God's going to take care of that God said that old boy has got to be dead and there's only one way he can die you have to submit your nature and say God kill him kill him every Speck of him I don't want moving down the street and I'll pass by and going to work I'll pass by and going to church I'll pass by and going to Walmart and no the first thing you know it be S out there waving at you go as you go by and then you'll get your email address as we say then he'll get your text and then he'll get this and that and the other and that old nature would go to contacting you and then before you know it all the churches backslid again because their Old Flame has finally got their attention one more time but God says I am going to make this so secure that once they come into my way of a new birst they will never again Fall Away now listen to me you can be saved and later lose your salvation the disciples were saved before Pentecost and every one of them denied the Lord Jesus Judas was saved but went to hell so you can lose salvation but you can't lose the Holy Ghost praise be to God now what you had to be reunited again with another nature which is the husband your name of your first nature was born now listen what the name of your husband was your name of your first nature was born and put in a Book of Life all your Deeds were wrote in it too everything you done under that nature so whenever you were born then Mom and Daddy gave that nature a name so in my case July the 9th 1956 8 or 9:00 something like that in the morning whenever I was born my nature was given the name Donald Lee Reagan Jr that was my nature's name then God recorded that name in a book called The Book of Life then when I got old enough and I started doing wrong it started being recorded under what that name now I was joined to that I wasn't too awful Wicked but I was lost I've done a few mean things in my life but that nature dominated me and even some of the things I do I would think how come me to do that I don't understand why I did and y'all ever do that you ever wonder why in the world did I do that I mean you know some things that people do even their conscience if they have one would tell them that it's not right for them to do but why do we do it it's our husband he rules over us with such a domain that we just submit to him praise be to God now notice and so your name of your first nature was born and put in the book of life and all your Deeds was wrote in that too everything you done under that nature was put in a book called The Book of Life now but when you were separated from that Union notice how he's typing it now with marriage with your husband and your nature when you were separated from that Union by spiritual deaths your natural desire to cut your hair your natural desire to wear shorts paint your face your natural desire to be intellectual smart men to know something better than the other that's what Eve wanted that's the very thing she wanted so it was it was natural for us to do whatever our husband said I want to drink and that's what some of you all did because your natural nature thirsted for alcohol a stimulus of something that would help you maybe you've got a a nature that kind of leans toward depression and you don't have a lot of interior happiness or exterior happiness and you find a stimulant maybe when you're young and you begin to become addicted to that and it releases of course the endorphins in your brain and gives you that Feelgood feeling and once you ever do then it's so much easier to go back to a needle or a pill or a bottle to be able to help you feel good again so what was that that was that husband that you were married to and even though you might hear teaching now don't do that that's wrong that's wrong yes yes I know that's wrong I've got to quit doing this and you want to with all of your heart and you make up your mind you might even go to church and you might get saved but you can be saved sitting in a church Pew you could be baptized in water and start doing all types of good religious deeds and that old husband of yours still alive and well inside of your soul and he'll leave you alone for a while but it's only for a while because he's got to be in control he's got to be in charge now God's way then is to bring us if it was the natural birth that married us to the Natural Union and there was a name a book a nature a name a book a nature and that name and that book and that nature was our former identification then God also must give a new name a new book and a new nature now notice so there has to be a new name and there has to be a new book now this is where your name once you're truly born again there is a transfer a transfer now it's not actually that your name is you know literally written over here and then God blots it out and he transfers it over here but it's in a symbolism of you to be able to see but the prophet says you say my old name is actually my name has been transferred what he said it's no longer identified in the old book but you're identified living under a new nature in the new book which what is this book called the Lamb's Book of Life and then he goes on to call this Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate now I perform many weddings as you folks know and once I do that then the license given to me in two types of papers they are given to me and it is my responsibility to take them to the courthouse I performed a wedding last night and Lord willing tomorrow I will will take that marriage certificate to the courthouse I had to fill it out I had to date it I had to verify was it religious or civil what the time was so on and so on brother JD was a witness of it and then it is my responsibility within three days to return this to the courthouse whenever I go to the courthouse I will go in and I will hand it to them did you perform this yes I did your name Donnie Reagan yes okay do you want to take their copy yes I do sometimes I'll take their copy and give it to them it cannot be carried in by the witness it cannot be carried in by some of you that were there it is my responsibility I'm actually hell liable if I do not return it you see there's something about the man performing the ceremony that has a responsibility well the Lord God was not going to give give this up to anybody else he's going to have to have men that are responsible that will be able to stand on the earth and join him and his bride together so it ain't everybody that goes to Seminary and ain't ever preacher that goes to Bible school it's God called God ordained Holy Ghost filled men that God will use to bring him and his bride together under the administration of the son of man now listen to this so your name then is in under that category when you're first born notice the prophet goes on to saying now when you were separated from that Union by spiritual debt your natural desire will die so what happens to that look with me if you would in 1 Peter chap 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to His abundant Mercy has begot gotten us again now remember the Lord Jesus was the first one in John 3:16 that begin to say these words you know that God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son now at the time that the Lord Jesus says this he is the only begotten Son of God but he's not today because there's other Sons and Daughters of God that are begotten by the Holy Ghost amen well that's what your Bible ible says to the Abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead now watch how Peter takes what what Paul said in Romans 7 so we then have begotten and given a lively hope how by joining the church shaking the preacher's hand though but by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus in verse four to an inheritance Incorruptible and unde defiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you now Peter goes a little bit further in verse 23 being born again notice born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever now notice what God does by truth God communicates a living principle to the soul that receives his seed word which is the Sperma that's the Greek word he Sperma now I'm not talking about now people getting just saved here's the issue friends a lot of folks get saved and they think they're born again they think they got everything they need when they got saved but remember as I told you before the disciples were saved but they were not converted read with me in Matthew 18:2 Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily I say unto you except ye be converted so the Lord Jesus is talking to the 12 preachers now they were arguing about who's going to be the greatest and the kingdom and that's what a lot of the preacher problem is around the message a lot of the preachers ain't got the Holy Ghost yet they ever get it ain't no time what in the world they'll do but and oh my we're waiting on them to get it because they're still arguing who's got the biggest Ministry and who's got the biggest church and who's got more Revelation about this so Jesus Took a child and he said look boys unless you guys become converted it what an embarrassing thing to say to your 12 men that you personally called yourself and you wind up telling them 12 men that you have called you boys ain't converted yet now they had accepted Jesus as their savior they had been baptized in Water by Jesus himself amen but they had not been baptized in the spirit by Jesus himself now watch what he goes on to tell him in verse three and he said surely I say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children so they were disciples but they were not converted they were disciples and preachers casting out Devils Healing The Sick raising the Dead doing the same signs the Lord Jesus did but they had not yet been quickened to a new husband to have this humble nature that children have so they were doing signs wers Miracles and it made them proud and arrogant why first husman was alive and well notice whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven so his disciples had not yet entered into the kingdom of heaven but they were saved working signs wonders Miracles when they returned back after Jesus sent them out 2 by two in Matthew 10 Jesus said I saw Satan as Lightning cast down out of Heaven they were rejoicing God we saw the lame W walk we saw this we saw that he said don't Rejoice because that happens to you but but rather Rejoice that your names are written now watch the Lord Jesus Luke 22:32 speaks person now to Peter I have prayed for thee that thy face fail not when thou art read ited so you mean Peter is not yet converted either yet he had the keys to the kingdom Healing The Sick casting out Devils so on and so on and Peter turned out to be a cussing preacher well praise the Lord but Peter was saved but he didn't have the Holy Ghost so Peter was still married to his first husband which had the rule over him well y'all are Qui today notice in Mark 16:16 he that belith and is baptized shall be saved but notice Jesus does not say now that when you're saved saved and getting the Holy Ghost is the same thing that's the church that read that into the Bible not the original Apostles it is not Apostolic doctrine that when you get saved you get the Holy Ghost at the same time well come on somebody say Amen if you can't say Amen say ouch or ow me or something so I know you're here with me now remember these are the words of the Lord Jesus not me not some other preacher he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved look at what the word saved means Soo the Greek word Soo so it's the exact same word that is whenever Jesus would tell many of them that uh you are healed by your faith so it means Soo means that you are saved spiritually or saved physically from your sickness so people can be saved from cancer and come back again and die with it later people people could be saved look at what the word saved means to rescue from danger or destruction to save or rescue and this is where friends many people think because they get saved they have eternal life don't you see what preachers have done they have taken scriptures which apply only to those who are truly born again and they apply them straight across the board to anybody then that is saved has eternal life and eternal security that is damnable Doctrine praise the lord it's warm in here this morning it is just me watch Acts chapter 2 verse 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be rescued from danger but just because you're rescued does not mean you're rescued to a place of Eternity as a matter of fact you can turn right back around and go to the very same spot that you were in and lose your rescue or your salvation acts 16:30 and brought them out and said sir now remember this is the Philippian Jailer so whenever Paul and Silas are beaten of course and then taken to Jail the Lord shook the jail house down then the Jailer comes and asks them what must I do to be saved and they said Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be filled with the Holy Ghost read your Bible the way it says it Thou shalt be saved and thy house not filled with the Holy Ghost now remember Judas es scariot was saved he was a preacher had great anointing is that right lived a Godly life Judas was the treasure of Jesus ministry so anybody that give tithes and offerings to the Lord Jesus Judas packed it around in his pocket so he must have been a trustworthy sort of a character so he was saved but later lost his salvation second Peter 2 ver 20 for if after they have escaped or been saved the pollut s of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again in Tangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning so people then can be delivered from sin and delivered from so many things and turn right back around and go right back into it is that what the Bible says and the latter end of those people was actually worse than what it was before how was that even possible that a person could be delivered and turn and go back and become worse their husband never died you see if that nature ever dies once there is no Resurrection for that nature this is why God so designed the new birth it is absolute eternal security there's nothing else for you to go back to there is no old husband you did not divorce him but if people come out of darkness and out of sin and whatever more and then they turn and go right back to you know as well as I do we've seen many of them and they become worse than they were before they ever even come to the Lord is that right why because that husband of theirs he comes out with a rage you will not do me that way again don't you ever think about doing me that way oh my here he come I'm telling you what woman you're going to do what I tell you to do I am your rid do you understand you drunk beer before next time you're drinking vodka you you smoke marijuana the next time you're smok and cry and they get worse and worse and how many have we seen because that husband raises with such a Vengeance amen notice Peter in verse 21 says I want you to listen friends what this man is saying it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness then after they have known it to turn turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them I don't mind telling you this morning some of the folks that's been around our ranks that' been better off to stay in their denominational chicken house then to have come under the truth and set under the ministry of the word of this hour and then turn and go back to that listen what the Bible says about it it has happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog the dog not a sheep but the dog has turned to his own vomit again so you mean they were saved they were delivered they were helped they were ministered to and the whole time they were still a dog oh Lord God help us and the style that was washed to her wallowing in the m so when she was sitting in the Pew she was still a s when she got saved brother John she was still how brother Donnie how is that possible that old husband was still alive Jew says it this way in verse 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how the Lord Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not so you mean God saved them and give them a Salvation in the Old Testament and later destroyed some of the same ones he he sa because they refused to go on a so-called message preacher made this statement sometime back there are going to be people inside the Catholic Church who've given their heart to God who love the Lord who read the scripture who follow Jesus Christ who will be saved who will be in the bride who will go in the Rapture how is that possible when you're praying to Joseph and praying to Mary and praying to St Cecilia if that is true why do we even need the Holy Ghost why do we even need a message come on don't get quiet on me now his statement goes on to say because they may be in the Catholic church but the Catholic Church isn't in them who ever heard of such nonsense now does that line up with the scripture and the message you ought to have enough sense to know this is what the spirit of God said in the Book of Revelation 18:4 I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues come out of her my [Applause] people and this same message invisible union now he said so do every one of us know the whole rank of denomination Pentecostal and all are dead that is to the born again Christian of the message you see many people even around our ranks do not even understand the terminology of a word Birth by Malachi 4 turn with me to Acts chapter 19 verse1 let's look at some real Christians real disciples and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed to the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples now notice what Luke calls these group of people disciples and he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed oh my goodness you mean the Holy Ghost is different from believing now I want you to notice here have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I want you to look at this word believed you're talking about powerful it's from a Greek root word which is used in many different forms in the New Testament of pistus p i s t i s this is pisu pistu and it means to commit one's trust to to think to be true so notice what Paul's asking them have you all received the Holy Ghost since you committed your trust to Jesus Christ you gave him your heart as would say you're trusting him for salvation you are a disciple look at the meaning of the words that goes on you is in the New Testament of the conviction and Trust to which a man is impelled by a certain inner and higher prerogative of the law of the soul to trust in Jesus as able to Aid either in obtaining or in doing something Saving Face wow I just described to you the majority of modern Christendom you mean to tell me that Paul would ask them have you all got the Holy Ghost after they've done reach this well isn't the cross enough well apparently Paul did not feel like them accepting his death on the cross and them accepting him as their savior was enough that's Apostolic Doctrine that's the doctrine of the Bible your Bible amen now Paul been some of the modern preachers and said I understand you folks are believers yes we've accepted Jesus Christ we've committed our soul to him we love him with all of our hearts we are completely trusting him and him alone we're not looking to anything we do we're not no works this this is Paul said glory to God Brothers hallelujah amen boy you all have got her but Paul was saying uh y'all just got started y'all just got started have y'all got the holy ghost wonder where we need the Holy Ghost for we've done committed to Christ but you know what they were christless Christians now listen at these people and they said unto him we've not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost wow and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said un John's baptism there several dispensations behind then Paul said John verily baptized with a baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep which is the only way that you'll find in the scripture that was ever recorded ain't one person in the Bible that was ever baptized in titles you show me and I'll eat the whole book you show me in history for the first 300 years I can take it from one to another to another of historian but what did the devil want to do he wanted to blot out the name of the bridegroom so that when you come to Christianity you'd be married up to titles instead of the name oh Hallelujah which one of you women here today when you would get married would want to be married to your husband hband and just call him son or brother or uncle or nephew and he may be all of them but what did you take on is I performed the wedding yesterday and I introduced that couple as who not Mr and Miss John Doe Mr and Miss son of the father of the grandfather of the great grandfather but I introduce that couple in the name of the bridegroom remember there must be a new name and a new book and a new nature Hallelujah in order to go in the [Applause] Rapture and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus now for those false preachers that have taught that the Holy Ghost is only for the 12 apostles this is several years after Acts 2 and these people here wasn't even preachers now I want you to listen what happened to them after they finally got baptized right well glory to God when Paul laid his hands upon them and the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesy amen well praise the Lord that sounds like an oh ho Holy Ghost oldfashioned Sanctified by my Dynamic power of God Revival movement they were already saved they were already trusting the Lord Jesus they had already earned the title of disciples but they did not have Christ Jesus living in their soul they were not married yet and reunited to another nature so they went down and baptism him in his name what's going on the marriage ceremony do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife do you promise to love to cherish to care for her as long as you both shall live I do do you bride of Christ take him to be your husband will you love him will you obey him will you cherish him will you forsake all others as long as you both shall live I do and then by the power invested in me I pronounce you are man and wife in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you may kiss your bride hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah Romans 10:1 Brethren my heart desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they a might be saved you see that's the way salvation is you might or you might not but election has no mights on W oh I tell you the Lord give me that ear this morning I about had a holy ghost fit that's all right salvation whosoever will y that might and might not but brother when it comes down to election there in't one of them children of God whose names is on that Lamb's Book of Life there ain't enough powers in Hell there ain't enough Darkness to keep them away from him not mik and might not they shall they will Hallelujah because they are part of him the [Applause] husband Romans 10:9 that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Shall Believe in thine heart that God ha raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved with a heart man believeth into righteousness with a mouse confession is made unto salvation how easy it is to quote this and leave out Acts 19 you see well a lot of preachers and a lot of churches are leading the modern-day Christians do you understand where they're going to take them the tribulation period God help me God help us preachers here at this church so people today can be saved and lose their salvation John 3:17 for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him ah Here We Go Again might might might but let's read Ephesians 1:12 that we should be to the pra of his glory who first trusted in Christ Paul's talking about himself now watch he it brings on down to this is the church that he's birthed through the word and whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and the church said amen but let's not stop there so notice what it happened they had trusted after they heard and the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed so they trusted they heard and they believed and they still wouldn't sealed well and after that Ye beli Ye were Oh you mean they wouldn't see when they believed they except that Christ as their personal savior they trust in him yes that's what he said but he didn't stop he went on they actually were not sealed when they trusted they were not sealed when they believed they were sealed when they received the Holy Ghost according to the Bible how many believes the Bible and whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed all right let's see what the meaning of this word is Mark with a seal for security from Satan Oh Glory to God amen Mark with a seal for security from Satan not when you believe you are sealed not when you heard you are sealed not when you join the church you are sealed but once you receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you are sealed with a mark from God for a sign of security from the devil and the Devil comes back and say whoa I can only get so close to her I can only get so close to him how do you know he's done married again she got married Oh Glory they have the Seal of authenticity upon their [Applause] soul now friends how many preachers in our modern pull pits preach this from their Bible not ours how many of them is going to stand before God and be held accountable because they never preached this come on Saints watch what the meaning of the word goes on to say Mark with the seal for security from Satan hence to confirm authenticate Place Beyond doubt to prove one's testimony to a person that he is what he professes to be to prove one's testimony to a person that he is what he professes to be thank God for the Holy Ghost thank God for believing thank God for the cross thank God for the blood but it is not the cross that seals you it is not salvation that seals you it is a new nature don't you understand what the Holy Ghost say it's the Lord Jesus in the form of the Holy Spirit coming inside of you reincarnating himself in your [Applause] body verse 14 which is the of our inheritance unto the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory 1 Timothy 2:3 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior who will have all men to be saved God don't want nobody to be lost but notice it didn't say have all men to receive the Holy Ghost Titus 35 not by works of righteousness which we have done but ACC according to his Mercy he saved us aren't you glad he saved you by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost 2 Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slight concerning his promise as some men count slightness but his longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance God don't want nobody to be lost even though they're not elect right God loved Cain and went after him Revelation 21:22 and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb of the temple thereof and the city had no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine in it notice it doesn't say the Earth outside the city the light in the city will be sun generated s o n not Su n now I want you to notice it doesn't say on the earth cuz the Earth is going to be inhabited there'll be Kings and Nations and rulers and so on outside the city but I he said I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty in the lamb or the temple not temples plurals if there's two of them and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are ah shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the not the kings of the city the kings of the earth to bring their Glory and Honor so the saved look friends it's all brother Donnie but I work some really good people and they're really nice people sure there's millions of people that are saved people yes John said he saw a multitude who are these John didn't know who they were they were Gentiles John looked and he didn't recognize them brother Jim he said who are these here he said these are they that come out of Great Tribulation yes sir watchh the robes and made them white of the blood of the lamb but notice he don't said they had the Holy Ghost so they were saved people oh come on some don't sit there and look at me but notice when it comes to the elect of God in James 1:18 of his own will begat he Us boy the Free Will Baptist have a hard time with this scripture don't they this is their main split from whatever happened years ago you know pre preil war time whenever they got into that spot one of the things when the main Baptist convention was Free Will Baptist because some of them started to believe in predestination and I said oh no glory to God I'll tell you one thing I made up my mind Hallelujah I'm holding on to my free will my free will is what's got me in so much trouble you might as well say Amen to your old stubborn Free Will is what's got you in so much trouble it' been a whole lot easier on all the rest of us if we have died d our will a long time ago I did not choose to be born again are you going to sit there and tell me that you decided to be born you decided to tell your Earthly father father I want to be born is that okay with you and then you told your mother mother I want you to carry me N9 months will you do you mind doing that come on don't be an idiot it was not you that chose to be born naturally it was not you well I glory to God I done this and that and the other the Bible says of his own will begat he us with the word of Truth why because we were his children before the foundation of the world and he said I will I will that my children be saved I will and then he comes and says because I have so much Mercy in so much love I'm going to open it up for everybody so whosoever will let him come and take of the Water of Life freely can I have a few more minutes before we close John 1:1 he came into his own and his own received him not but to as many as received him them gave he exusia power to become the sons of God become be made come to pass be fulfilled don't you understand you are a prophecy your new birth brought you to pass you came oh children to become you came to pass when you were born of the spirit of God because you're a word a thought that come from God's presence and you staggered right in the darkness and the things of the world and didn't know what no world to look for but just like a promise say of Isaiah 7:14 you believe that's a promise of God a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son we we know the scripture very familiar with it and it laid there for hundreds and hundreds of years but one day that word come to pass all your name was wrote there not the name of your first husband he knew what that name would be but he also o wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world your first book The Book of Life was not wrote before the foundation of the world it's only temporary and it only needs a slot of time do you understand every one of you today that are truly Born Again of the spirit of God you have no more Book of Life you do not have a book of life you are living under the new husband the new nature the Lamb's Book [Applause] but as many as received and to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of Galatians 4:19 and I'll close my little children of whom I travail in birth until Christ be formed in you just as the formless embryo by degrees starts changing and taking on a form when it's first in the conception the few moments formless for days however long before it starts looking like a human being Paul catches this and he says my little children of whom I travail in burst look at the responsibility on a servant of God until I travail and burst until Christ be formed in you now he's calling them already his children so they Children of the gospel and he's warning them he's wanting them to mature but remember legalism had attacked the church it had delayed the stage of their growth and every time you and I get a setback you may Wonder sometime why is brother Donnie going back and preaching this and this and why why is brother Daryl preaching on that if you only had a little bit of spiritual Insight you'd know that the spirit of God is looking at the embryonic stage of some of those that's under the ministry and seeing that they went back under this sort of legalism or they've leaned too much toward Grace and they're leaning here and Paul said I travail again oh children how many times have you sent me in travail again I'm not here to preach for a living I'm not here to preach for a reputation I'm sent here to try to preach you into a body change I'm sent here to try to preach if you go by the way of the Grave that you will leave this Mortal body and in less than a second you'll step into the sixth dimension in another body I'm not here to preach for my health I'm not here to preach to pry to please you I want to preach unto Christ is formed [Applause] so the Christian by degrees takes on the likeness of Christ Jesus this is why Satan sends things your way and my way to try to stop the image from becoming more clear as our mother packed us many of you in this modern day of course when they've got it to where they can do the scans and so on on the mother I saw one just the other day of somebody here in the church at Carol had showed it to me little T9 and her mama packing it around and his little bitty thumb stuck in its mouth oh Hallelujah it had moved from that embryonic stage where there was no image don't you understand even when we receive the Holy Ghost and the presence of God comes upon us where there in that embryonic stage but who was it Christ Jesus you understand whenever a real child of God receives the Holy Ghost even though they may be so weak and so immature they've already got the potential of the Christ man they've already got the potential of the Christ man being formed inside of them this is wild fridge we pick up we go on we lay aside our mistakes we lay aside our shortcomings Lord men of God don't give up on me men of God don't give up on me keep travailing keep laboring I'm coming I'm on my way I may be behind some of you here today you may be ahead of me don't give up on me don't give up on me keep travailing until the image becomes more defined and more defined till at last the Christian reaches the stature of a perfect man Paul long for these Believers to be transformed in the into the Greek word that he called Moro in Philippians 2:6 it's morphe but here it's a different form of that he wanted them to be formed that Christ would be formed in them oh Hallelujah let's Stand Together can I share another quote with you here before we close the resurrection in 1953 I believe this great commotion that's going across the world now that's called heresy says the people has lost their mind this bunch of people that sold out to the world burned every bridge behind them serving God believing in signs and wonders and miracles and the big formal church is saying they're crazy I believe it's Jesus Christ reincarnated in the human church here on Earth doing signs and wonders every new birth not just accepting salvation but every new birth is a death to that old husband and Christ starts being formed in the soul of that individual their name is transferred they're no longer identified in living under the old book I hope you understand tonight my old book as a sinner is no longer in existence when I make mistakes and fall short of the glory of God that is not going under my old nature of Donald Lee Reagan Jr that book no longer exist he knows I'm a son and when I make a mistake there ain't no need writing it down cuz I'm going to fix it amen why you need to keep a record when it comes to a son or daughter of God you know what I'm saying don't every one of you feel that way as Sons and Daughters of God when you the Lord Smite your heart to convict you you're going to fix it it's inevitable you are going to fix it there ain't no need rid it down again he says if Jesus is risen from the dead living among us tonight then he's reincarnating himself again in his church then he will produce the same thing that he did back there so the fact is God the new birth will be the Lord Jesus reincarnated again in Africa in China Japan huras I don't know about you I want to put out the atmosphere don't you an air as a child of God yes sir Carol and I was in Sams on Friday or Thursday Carol need to go to the bathroom there so we pushed the buggy back there and there's an old lady standing back there and she come to me and she said sir would you please help me I said sure ma' what what's the problem she said I'm wearing a heart monster she said I feel like I'm about to pass out I said all right ma' what you want me to do so she said help help me to sit down there's a little bench of a thing over there and Sams and I help her get seated there and she said would you get my buggy so there was your buggy with a purse and all that so I got her over there got her sit down and said you okay man pat on the shoulder she said no I don't fear either don't fear right she said would you pray for [Music] me how did she even know I believed in prayer you know me I laid hands on her right there in Sams and pray for her I said you all right she said why I'm feeling with better she said my husbands are in resting will you go get him I said yes ma'am I'll go get him so I'm and found him and told him then I come out a few minutes later and Carol was over patting her on the shoulder you know him oh thank you thank you thank you thank you for coming to get me Carol said they're waiting on the wheelchair to come and get her and they're going to have to scir her out and take her to her car so we stayed there a few minutes I said y'all okay and said yeah that old man he said have a good day but I know you will and a few minutes later man Carol was checking out here they come pushing the buggy him and her both walking out no wheelchair needed that's what I'm talking about the Lord Jesus not me not you not you the Lord Jesus Hallelujah don't we want to be that type of Christian where people just know there's something about us and it ain't really us it's our husband we got married we got a new name new book new nature thank you Lord God let's B it together thank you Lord God all friend the prophet says it wasn't so from the beginning every man that's has got to be born again and the sinful nature killed in him and a new man born in him which is Christ Jesus the son of God about your old man patched up somehow the new man is not you fixed it's not you and I repaired it's the son of God Lord Jesus we humbly bow our heads in your presence today we are so blessed to hear such things much less to have it in our possession help us father we don't want to just be church members Lord and we believe that we ought to have a church that we attend yes we believe that Lord we don't want to just do good deeds we believe we should do that too Lord Jesus we want that old man dead Hallelujah not hung up for the occasion we've seen it down Through the Ages that's what's happened to so many people they hung that old man up for the occasion and they run across something they couldn't believe something they couldn't understand and they go right back to that same old husband and they lose their salvation the prophet tells the Salvation is like healing it will hold as long as your faith holds but he sure don't teach us that when it comes to the Seal of God the Seal of God keeps us even when we may feel our flesh wavering and teetering Hallelujah the Seal of god holds us we don't hold it amen oh Jesus come by this way today Lord would you would you pass by this way like you did in the upper coast of Ephesus that day Lord Jesus maybe there's some good disciples here in the building today maybe some stream in the service and they love you they're Christians they love you maybe they've never yet received that new husband that new nature they struggle with this and that and the other and they try and they fall short and they get up and they struggle and they go back and forth back and forth May today be the day Lord God that the Holy Ghost will sweep in this building we know when it happened there in the upper coast of Ephesus there wasn't hundreds of people sitting there like there are here today but there was 12 12 people and the apostolic way of receiving the Holy Ghost was for Paul to lay hands on them and they got their new marriage certificate oh Jesus would you pass this way maybe began on this Pulpit if you would Lord if there's any brother here maybe start here with us and then move toward the back Lord don't leave the sisters out in the nurseries or any brothers that would have their children back there father don't leave anybody out Lord God that would be streaming in France or Switzerland or Norway their service is already gone and they clicked in to be in church with us today may Jesus pass through the upper coast of Norway may Jesus pass to the southern coast of France may Jesus hallelujah hallelujah may you call Lord for that last name Lord oh Jesus so every one of us can be filled so filled that every fiber of our being can be filled with the presence of God oh Jesus we adore you we magnify you mighty God Hallelujah we love you Lord we worship you we adore you blessed God don't you love him children yes maybe if there's anybody here today that's uncertain with no one looking around you just say Brother D I'm just not sure I I want to be sure but I'm just not sure sometimes I think that that old man is dead and then other times I think I don't know just raise your hand to the Lord not so much to me just Lord be mindful of me today friends the seal is what gives you the Assurance your faith your human faith will waver failures will test it falling short of the glory of God will make you question but that seal of the Living God it gives you that trust and that confidence and that assurance that if there ain't but one leaving out a Word of Life Church you'd look me in the face and say brother Donnie you better move somewhere else cuz that one is me that's when we know we've passed from Death unto life Hallelujah we love our brothers oh yes we love them we make differ as far as human makeup and this and that but we love them with a God love and we have an assurance Lord we worship you Jesus sing up here can we just worship him now a little bit won't you just open your heart now maybe some of you need healing maybe some of you need Deliverance of whatever it is we believe remember the same word that applies to Salvation also applies to Healing Soo so it's Deliverance Deliverance of sin rescuing of high blood pressure rescuing you from a temper rescuing you from some type of mental thing that you're dealing with whatever it is praise the Lord oh I'm so glad the old man is dead I'm living under a new name you all know me by Donnie my legal name of course is Donal I really don't like to be called Donald I I prefer to be called Donnie but but that's not even the way the Lord reckons my first and true name I want my nature and my soul to be living under whatever my new name is one day I'll I'll know what it is but I believe I'm living under the influence of that new name that new book and that new nature Right Now Praise the Lord don't you love him children let's worship him together you see before you let's just

[Music] foreign [Music] amen is that your testimony this morning amen Sage tried to stop us turn us aside we're going to keep pressing on this morning amen failure is not in our vocabulary this morning aren't you so glad to be in the house of the Lord once again you can be seated this morning a couple of announcements uh first wanted the library wanted to announce for the uh assisted hearing if you needed the assisted hearing they now have these available just kind of like the old church they're a little bit different this is a lanyard that hangs around your neck has a well a little bit difficult has a power button on the very buttons on the side if you have a hearing aid with a t-coil technology this will transfer into your hearing aid so you don't have to wear an earpiece if you have a hearing aid with a t-coil technology now brother Michael Bailey said if you didn't have one he could sell you one for a little bit of a a profit for him there but so if you have that if you don't have the T cool hearing aid you can plug this earpiece into the top of the lanyard and then put the earpiece over your ear and it just covers one of your ears if you'd like both ears they said that you can purchase that separately and it'll come inside both ears but these will be back here in the first vestibule when you go out they're on a charging dock if you need one pick one up after you're done with it take it back set it back on the charging station for the next service when someone picks that up so if you would remember that if you need to you can see where the Michael Bailey after service about that if you need any more instructions on that or one of the deacons would be happy to help you with that this morning all right also I want to remember Bible study is tomorrow night for 13 and up six to eight supper is provided in the fellowship hall so remember that amen Bible study tomorrow evening a couple of testimonies turned in this morning want to give God thanks sister Judy Dyer said she wants to thank God for a miracle Thursday morning depressed and very emotional says brother Dan call brother Donnie I put the phone to her ear he prayed she very quickly started to feel normal she just wants to thank God for that this morning amen so no we certainly are thankful for the miracle there I want to just remember them in their and our prayers amen no longer living in the area and I know their hearts desires to be here this morning also Sister Janet Payne has a testimony uh along with a prayer request she just wanted to give God praise brought her through a severe attack early Saturday morning I asked yesterday morning uh the name of Jesus is still more powerful than anything or anybody there is no one greater amen so thank the lord for keeping Sister Janet safe yesterday amen so we have a few prayer requests turned in this morning want to remember Mary Beth Holloway not feeling well today but John if you would prepare to come take these requests please remember uh brother Isaiah sister Shea and their boys they're all sick unable to be in service this morning so we want to remember their whole family this morning uh sister Heather Potter home sick has a fever and sore throat so we want to lift her up in our prayers also with Richard Baker severe back pain uh just hard to walk so we certainly want to lift brother Baker up before the Lord this morning I think that sister Baker is having severe back pain but the baker turns that in and it's hard for her to walk this morning so we want to remember her in prayer this morning also please remember uh Sister Janet Kennedy turned in at Greg Kennedy uh brother Eugene's uncle in need of a liver transplant this morning so we certainly want to take that need before the Lord and be in prayer

still breathing I'm holding on I'm the most importantly of all you love him more and love him greater this turns today is the Book of Numbers if you will Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 31 we greet you today in the name of the Lord it's a privilege for us to be together in the house of God and in the presence of God Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 31 will read down through verses 33. I'd like to speak to you today on whose report will you believe whose report will you believe but the men that went up was him said we be not able to go against the people of course this is the children of Israel that are at the brink of the land and God has promised them what he's going to do and Moses has sent some spies over some had one report some have another report listen at these men's report but the men that went up with him said we be not Abel to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and what does that have to do with it actually nothing does it if you look by faith for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had surged unto the children of Israel saying the lamb through which we have gone to search it is a land that eat us up the inhabitants thereof and all the men that we saw in it are men of great stature now this is not the truth this is not true it is lies God said this lamb is a landform of milk and honey but the way they saw it it looked like the lamb was devouring the people how foolish isn't it amazing how we look at things it's not even true and they said all the people they saw were giants that's not true either there was only a few Giants in this land I wonder how many of us have believed lies of the devil just like this and confessed it to it is a land that eat itself the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anak which come of the Giants we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight another lie so what did they do go up and ask them so how do I look in your sight like a grasshopper right so they're speaking on behalf of the sons of anak and these big cowards for the most part probably never even spoke to one of them so here they are telling lies to the people of God about their inheritance oh my goodness how many lots of be remembered today as we pray God bless you Mrs power hits together and only father it's such a wonderful privilege to be together today in your presence knowing father that as a one-time we as Gentiles were not even allowed into your presence only the outer Court was as far as we could go but today by your grace and mercy we stand here and knowing the Living God inhabits our bodies and for that we are so thankful I pray you would help us today catch our attention catch our thoughts our spirit our soul Lord God speak to us from your word may we see today each of us must believe a report and whose report will it be I want to say before I preach this today I want to believe yours speak to his father as only you can do in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated turn with me there if you'd like to read from your Bible or you can read it from the screen of life if you'd like to as well Numbers Chapter 14 verse 1. now let's look at the effect of this evil report so these men come back 10 of them and they have all these things to say and the people hear it and this is the effect of what these men had to say on the people and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night after what after what I just read to you and all the children of Israel all the children of Israel all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God we had died in the land of Egypt mama or would God we have died in this Wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return to Egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain they were tired of a prophet so now they wanted a captain because they felt like a prophet had deceived them they felt like a prophet had led them into a place to where they're all going to lose their lives so they want what they want a captain well now they're going after the military might and said of the power of God and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt is this not the same land that they were beaten is this not the same land that they had no freedoms they had no rights and they're wanting to go back to that Land Based on what the evil report of ten Liars well praise the Lord ten Liars well I I'm out to get them today I've got an indictment for every liar that is lying to you about your family lying to you about your healing lying to you about your salvation lying to you about your marriage lying to you that you're not going in the Rapture I've got an indictment for him today and I'm going to expose their hide to you to let you know they are liars and there is no true Center now notice in verse 6 and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jeff funny now I preached this to you years ago that the word Caleb actually means dog and Jeff funny was a killazite which was not even a Jew but God did not have a special tribe by which he would allow Gentiles a 13th tribe to join into but we find like this Caleb the son of jafani and Ruth the moibitis and difference of the Gentiles most of them wound up in the tribe of Judah Judah means praise that's a good tribe for a gentile to be into I want you to notice now Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of jafani which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto the company to the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good Land wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute now these other guys said that it was a land that ate up the inhabitants thereof in other words the people that were there were barely surviving they were barely hanging on they was just making it from one church service to another and just raking and scraping a little bite to eat that ain't what God Said God said it's a land flowing of milk and honey God said I'll give you the rain and due season God said I'll give you the Dew but the way they projected it well how is the difference these guys were seeing some of the exact same land it depends on which eyes you look at it with if you look at it through the eyes of the flesh you'll see a land that in that the inhabitants barely hang on but if you look at it through eyes of faith you'll see it's a land that flows with milk and honey every good thing that we have need of will be in this land so I ask you today how do you sit some of You original people that were here when I came here 35 years ago some of y'all might remember this sermon title because I took this same text over 35 years ago and I asked at that time Happy Valley Church able or not able or not well I want to ask you the same question today are we able to take this land or should we just reside and say well we're not powerful enough we can't do it we fought so many devils and we've lost strength and we've lost courage and we can't do it no more and we're about ready to get up we are about ready when you say we don't include me in your affirmation because I've got a greater desire this morning than I've ever had in my life anybody with me today I've got more determination I've got more Zeal I've got more spunk if you want to put it that way I've got more Revelation that I had 35 years ago I'm better equipped to meet every devil Out of Hell better than I was 35 years ago but brother Donnie you're 66 I don't make a bitter difference my wisdom my strength my anointing will make up for from a lack of strength because I believe that we are not on the verge of giving up I believe we're on the verge of going in we're on the verge of Donnie why is the devil fighting us so hard it's because he knows we're right on the verge of complete Victory will ride on the verge of getting everything that God has promised for us in his word anybody believe it today but it's up to you you see whose report are you going to believe now notice when they speak unto them they speak unto all the company their children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it it's an exceeding good land if the Lord Delight in us and I love the way that he says this because when you look at it in the Hebrew he says if the Lord continue to Delight in us the way he has already amen it's not like they're wondering well really or wanting but he said it's more than likely he's going to continue to the way that he has if the Lord continue to Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us a land which flowest with milk and honey only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us they are how is it that these people on the same Commission on the same Journey can cease things that are exact opposite it would make you think they are describing two different lands it's like they are describing two different locations but it wasn't exactly two different lands it was one land from two perspectives one land from two different sets of eyes well I want to lay the land before you today your promised land is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in the message of the hour that's why Satan in the last few years has had a bunch of spies that come in Among Us and they found out this land made them sick to their stomach so what did they do they left and started making YouTube videos and all kinds of Articles of this and that and the other why because it was too rich for them it was too good for them it was two powerful form they couldn't take it so it made them sick to their stomach I ain't going back no more because it made me sick they preached Holiness they preach one God they preach water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus they preached an Apostolic Faith that's right that's the only kind I know I don't want a church entity I don't want churchism I want an Apostolic Faith that'll heal our sin that'll save our lost children that'll fill us with the Holy Ghost and will change our bodies when we need him oh how they must have felt that day their defense is departed from them you imagine their defense is departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fears them not so if you would have been there now thousands of years ago and you were sitting there well change the scenario it's not Donnie Reagan preaching to you this morning but it's the 10 spies on one side and Joshua and Caleb on the other side and they're putting to you the land so which report will you believe will you believe that it's laodicea it's so dark and so wretched nobody can live right in this day it is so dreary and we are so sad we're fighting more battles than we've ever fallen alive I can barely hold my hands up I can barely pray I can barely read my Bible I can barely have an affection when the song leader stands up to be able to clap my head I don't feel like going to church I don't feel like prayer I don't feel like reading my Bible I don't feel like saying amen it's all I can do to just get there or will you believe an another report we are closer to the resurrection than any generation that's ever walked on the face of the Earth as long as there's breaths in your son's body There's Hope as long as there's breasts in your wife's body There's Hope as long as there's breaths in your body There's Hope and let me say it this way even if they're laying dead there's still hope and if you don't believe me all you got to do is ask Lazarus he was a man that was dead and his nose had already fallen in and rigor mortis had start to set into his body but that didn't make no difference to Jesus because Jesus has power beyond death hell and the grave he has power beyond your doctor's diagnosis he has power beyond your MRI he has power beyond your CT scan and every other scam that you'll ever get I don't care what the doctor says there is no hope there is no way out that's his report that I want to tell you there's another report that my Bible tells me by his stripes ye are already healed my Bible tells me you are more than a conqueror Hallelujah my Bible tells me greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world who's reports will you believe now naturally I want you to believe this one but our enemy wants you to believe his I can't make you believe this report and this is the truth of the other side every devil in hell cannot make you believe theirs you choose to so the fault really ain't in the devil it's in US notice in verse 36 and the man which Moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander notice this word a slander upon the land look at this word slander it means Whispering defamation evil report unfavorable saying so they brought up a slander against this lamb even those men that did bring up an evil report upon the land died by the plague before the Lord but Joshua the son of none and Caleb the son of jafani which were of the men that went to search the land lived still well look around it spiritually friends those who have brought an evil report slander against the message slander against God's Prophet slander against the men of God standing for the truth they have died spiritually but you are still alive Hallelujah I'm not talking about just in your natural body the worst death that can ever be is the death of the soul to be annihilated from God's presence but let me just say this to you today I still believe the land is a land Floyd with milk and of it I believe I promised lamb the message of the our young people Satan will do everything he can to pull you out of your promised land to tell you what it's not for you it's too hard you can't live it that's just for old people no it ain't just for old people it's for teenagers it's for eight-year-olds it's for 10 year olds it's for everyone that come wants to come this way well I'm 80. well good that's the age Caleb was whenever he went back to obtain his promise so if you're good from 8 to 80 and maybe even 100 or better if you want to believe and trust the Lord God who promised this land you can have the benefits of it brother you can pack grapes submit they're that big around my don't take a whole bushel of them to make you enough wine to get stimulated all it takes is one of them good old Holy Ghost old-fashioned grapes and you go to squeezing that thing out real good and the stimulation of Revelation arises in your heart and you speak to that disease in your body and say leave me in the name of Jesus you speak to that addiction you speak to that habit and you say I do not belong to you I belong to the Lord God and this is my inheritance yeah whose report will you believe read what's me in first Samuel 17 42. and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him to despise holding contempt to be vile and worthless for he was but of use remember David was a teenager you mean giant Killers Don't Have To Be 50. giant Killers don't have to be 80 by them Jack they can be teenagers how many of you teenagers want to be giant Slayers amen you don't hide away well brother Donnie I'm gonna wait till I'm 40. why waste all them Years start swaying them now at 10. start slaying them now at 12 and 13. Oh my he was about to use and ready and the word ready means red it's the same word that Adam comes from the word Adam means red so out of the Red Dirt God made the man so he was a ready looking guy and he was of a fair count in this word fair means handsome and beautiful so some of you sisters would have thought David was the cutest of those things you ever saw and you imagine no one ever Goliath saw him he was not looking for someone cute he wasn't looking for someone that was handsome but it looked even less inferior because he had no Battle Scars he had nothing on his hands nothing on his arms nothing anywhere else because he'd never quite fought a man of this size before now notice I'm the Philistine this is his affirmation this is the Philistines report and the Philistine said unto David and eye a dog which is the same word Caleb am I a Caleb that thou comest to me were staves and the Philistine curse David by his Gods poor fellow I was a trinitarian wasn't him so he cursed David by his gods and the Philistines said to David notice the report and he believes this brother die with everything that's in him the Philistine said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh um to the fowls of the air and to the Beast of the field this was Goliath's confession now David hears this confession and in reality it looks like it could very well happen this man stands according to the proportion of size they say around nine foot nine inches tall without one piece of armor on he would have weighed approximately 765 pounds with his mail on which was his mental part up here and his Grieves on it would have weighed on an average of another 120 pounds with his spear with his helmet with his shield with his sword he would have reigned around 900 pounds and David Wade won 10. but it's still not fair odds a 110 pound teenager against almost a thousand pound champion now this is what the Bible calls him a champion well I don't mind telling you today demons are champions but we're more than champions they've been fighting this battle my hell in the world can you and I uh 20 30 40 50 60 70 years old ever meet demons that have been doing this for thousands of years they have been fighting against humanity since the first human being come on the earth they are professional Liars professional deceivers they are professional wrestlers professional boxers the professional and everything they do and I'm certainly not a professional except I am a professional devil whipper Hallelujah that's exactly right all you say how can you do it you ain't old enough that's exactly right I'm not old enough but I have the great I deny living inside of me amen I have the Mighty God who is from eternity to Eternity and I'm not going to fight on my strength I'm not going to rely upon my reason I'm going to rely upon the strength of the Lord because David said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh need to lie down in green pasture he lead us me beside the Still Water it is him disguiding us today we are not on our own church we are not under the leadership of some carnal fellow that come from Kentucky 35 years ago we are under the leadership and the headship of the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that baptized the church and Acts 2. together foreign then said David to the philistine thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spirit with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied I love this word hear of the name besham and it means the ineffable the ineffable name that it was so great it could not be pronounced I come to you in the name of besham the ineffable name so your trust is in your seal your trust is in your weapons and your armor but my trust is in the name and he had such confidence in that name that he couldn't even pronounce it it was so sacred what about you today that can say the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not only do you say it but you have that same name because you're part of him you are his wife and now your miserous Jesus watch this in the Paradox the prophet says because they seem the opposition so great they was afraid to meet the challenge of the boasting Goliath of the Philistines afraid to many another something about the way that he phrases this I love it because it reminds me of tests and trials and diseases and things sometimes that we go through and Yuri stands out there and he boasts and he brags and he boasts and he brag of what he's done and how big he is and how puny you are and how small you are have you ever noticed the devil when you go to messing up and you make a mistake and then you come back to God and that boasts and Philistine will stand right there against you again you messed up again didn't you yeah there ain't no mercy for you are there yeah how come on do you think God will put up with you well you might as well just turn your back what is that that's a boasting for listening trying to talk you out of repentance Roofing God wants us to walk right before him but even when we fall flat on our face it's up to you whose report you're going to believe the devil when you're falling fire on your face the devil will try to come and bring you a report there's no way there's no help there's no mercy but I hear my God say little children I write unto you that you're saying not but if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father which is Jesus Christ the righteous which is a perpetuation for our sins and not ours only but for the sins of the whole world there's Mercy for you when you fall there's Grace for you when you mess up there's Mercy for you to come back to God whose report will you believe will you stay on your face where you turn and go back to the slop of the world or will you come crawling back to the cross and say Lord God I'm sorry forgive me Lord help me to rise up and try one more time I will believe that report [Applause] notice this the prophet said there come a little stoop shouldered Ruddy looking fella his mama had baked some raisin pies and it brought him to give to his brothers and while he was Milling around now he wasn't over practicing swordsmanship he wasn't over by practice and how to polish armor he was just kind of Milling around minded his own business just delivering raisin pies the prophet said he was so small he was too little to even fight in the army oh yeah oh my hunting these brothers in the camp the Philistine walked out and made his boat said choose you a man and come over here and fight me we won't have any Bloodshed between the nation of course that's the way the enemy likes to break when he thinks he's got the edge on you how many has ever been there when he had the edge on you oh yeah bring him over here then we'll choose we'll fight and then if I'll kill him you serve us if he kills me we'll serve you notice this and watch his faith expressed that was Goliath on the other side and he stood out there and made his boasts many times bigger than David he had fingers 14 inches long my goodness he was a malmless big fella Philistine Giant and you almost David he was even too little to be in the army too much of a runt they couldn't even use him is there anything I could do uh maybe pack raisin cakes uh you couldn't even pack a five gallon bucket of water maybe you could bring us a quart at a time you're too little to do this and too little to that I guarantee one thing many of God's Mighty people have been looked down on others and called runs but yet God took that little run and done a great big thing with it amen I hope and pray to God there's some little runs sitting here today that the world say even some of the message folks were out here ain't been around long enough Hallelujah he can't do this on that and the other praise the Lord he's just a little bit of a run well I'd rather have her be a rent and have a great giant face than to be a giant in size and have a run face well praise the Lord if I've got to be a run I've always been run pretty much all my life but I'll tell you one thing when it comes to Faith I don't want to have run faith I'm going to have grunt Faith so whenever I start toward the devil he starts growing because he says oh no here he comes again here he comes again that's the kind of child of God that we want to produce share a Word of Life Church not people that are barely hanging on from Sunday to Wednesday and Wednesday to Sunday but people that love the Lord they pray when they don't feel like it they read their Bible when they don't feel like it they come to church when they don't feel like it why because they may look like a run but they've got grunt faith and when they speak Satan backs up all right but David now remember it was revealed to David hey so here's the armies of the Living God standing in their own land and there's a boast in uncircumcised Philistine out there we'll call him cancer we'll call him paralytic oh come on children how them boasting Philistines today in the form of disease and weakness sickness yeah and they like to brag aha your great face huh look at what the doctor said look at this look at that look at the other you're going to look at something but which are you going to believe what David was no kind of a match for him not with any kind of a weapon he was no match that man's shoulders probably 10 12 feet across whoa his shoulders 10 to 12 feet across he was probably saying a 14 15 feet high spear like a Weaver's needle probably 20 foot long he could stand right here and just behead you all just the blade on it may be four foot across like a sheet of plywood and up comes a little curly headed ready which means he had red spots a little Mama's looking boy and he said let me out of him let me at it whoa whoa whoa boy Whoa whoa what in the world is the matter with you broadhead for a deer brothers wouldn't we like to have a broad head like out on our Arabs we take out a whole herd of deer with me you should want action decapitate the whole herd and here he comes and that little girl said oh let me out of what in the world let me ask that God and say Lord have mercy I had a Holy Roller I'll tell you one thing friends I need what I believe sometimes we need a few holy wrote or sitting Among Us foreign the god that took me out of the paws of the bear took me out of the paws of the light how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised for listing in my hand notice when it was revealed David become Fearless Fearless a human being he didn't even have the Holy Ghost he's a teenage boy he don't even have the Holy Ghost and he become Fearless he said today I'll cut your head off amen quick Our God by grace in that crucial moment when the decision had to be made the same God that produced The Grace on that day God the seed of faith and that little hunchback looking boy you imagine him going around little hunts about fella Hallelujah the Lord is my shepherd glory to God hallelujah a poor little guy he didn't hardly know nothing but he might not have known nothing but he knew the right person to know a little Hunchback of a fella he said notice the Giant on the other side he didn't believe it neither will the come just remember you're not trying to convince your lymphoma you're not trying to convince your concept you want to convince you and then whenever you stand on God's word and speak with the authority of the word of God that thing will obey your voice whether he believes you or not he laughed and said to my dog you sent a kid out here to fight me he said I'll pick you up on the end of my spirit and let the birds eat your flesh but you see that didn't shape David at all now you may not understanding looking at him that dude's head will be about this big around have eyeballs about like that oh my God you imagine it bad his eyes had his own personal ceiling fan he just cooled himself down just batting them eyelashes stand right up there with that big broad head on the end of that thing four foot long and he stood right there he was as confident as he could be he done said his affirmation I'll feed your body to the fowls of the air I'll destroy you but David didn't believe what goliath said David believed what David said I want you to notice it was not the Lord God that thundered this out of heaven and David is repeating it the Lord God gave David a revelation but it wasn't enough for the Lord to say it David had to say it and David needed to hear David say it Oh Glory so this is David's confession first Samuel 17 46. this day will the Lord deliver thee unto my hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give watch it David watch it and I don't get in the flesh I'll give the carcasses of the host Lord have mercy he's got beside himself now now it's not just challenging Goliath but he goes to stepfather and said not only you not only you I'll give the whole bunch of you wow all right you imagine I'm saying Mercy fat poor little guy man what it's it's child cruelty it's child cruelty for them to send that little fat out there look at him the poor little fellow look at him he is so he's caught up you imagine David but now he's glory to God hallelujah he's a probably a worshiping or jerking around there and wiping the sweating hallelujah thank you Lord God thank you Lord God I don't know I believe in words Lord I've slayed a whole bunch of them I'll say the whole bunch of them of course his brothers are oh dear God anybody know who's this guy is I've never seen the boy in my life I don't have a clue no doubt from some Holy Roller family some bunch of Pentecostals come into the message and won't believe nothing another oh my so disobedient don't even obey what we tell them to do who in the world would think this little fellow could stand out there but you imagine the Heavenly Host as a host of God's angels to standing there right on the edge of Eternity and they was looking down in the valley of elah and there they were this gigantic man and a little bitty shrimp of a fella scrawny little Hunchback bent over God but he was saying God's word he was saying what God had anointed him to say that was no Pastor there to encourage him there was no mama to encourage you there was no Deacon there was no use leader to encourage David but David had a revelation from God foreign are you gonna believe David I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air yeah right and to the wild beast of the earth that all the ice may know not that I'm a great fella I'm a mighty warrior I'm this I'm that but that they may know there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with a sword of spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands speak that to your disease speak that to your blood pressure speak that to your your eyesight Hallelujah and it came to pass on the Philistine of rose came and Drew near do now to meet David that David hasted and ran you've got to be kidding me I mean here's this gigantic man that wasted nearly a ton a half a ton and he's got all this this equipment for him and David ain't just wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute let me have a little wisdom let me use a little wisdom I'll come back in about 13 years after I've learned a little more on how to handle the word I'll come back I need to fast and pray over this I'm sorry I I got ahead of myself I need a fast in prayer but instead of doing that David kind of girded up himself and said come on big boy you ready for it come on come on I can't wait to tear into you you imagine his brothers and all the rest of them said Lord God have mercy how could you ever take down a man like that and David said Lord God how could you ever miss a Target that big hallelujah how in the world can you not do it when you're anointed you imagine the host of eight were gathered around that teenager the prophet said that little old boy weighed about 110 pounds scrawny draw it in little fella maybe didn't get too much to eat on the back side of the desert but he stayed with God that's the main thing Here Come Little David just a bouncing in the spirit hahaha what a Holy Roller Victory already Hallelujah why place the name of the Lord God of Israel before him all devils in hell my friends he wasn't just facing the Army the first thing all the devils in hell against one teenager [Music] all the devils in hell couldn't wait across that little David dancing in the spirit you mean dancing before the battles won my goodness dancing and worshiping he had even won the battle yet but faith says it's dead go ahead and dance a little bit oh David just a dancing in the spirit brother man gets pretty excited on this you haven't heard it all Glory Hallelujah David put his hand in his bag in this case you see this little Stone right here just happens to come from the same Valley that David was in the valley of elah I stood there a few years ago so I loaded up my little bag full just a smooth Stone washed coming from the rivers and the creeks and all you stand down in that place that's just a little dried up a branch of a thing where water comes whenever the water rains and comes off the mountains so David reaches down and he picks up f a i t h j e s u s g r a c e and he picks them up and puts him in his pocket and said just in case I Ever Need a Little Faith in Jesus to provide the grace I need to take the head off of a big giant I've got five right here but remember he was prophesying because Goliath had four more Brothers hallelujah hallelujah David wasn't just getting one for old Goliath but he's getting the rest of his brothers too you boys have crossed the wrong one now can you imagine this giant had stood down their day after day after day and made his boasts and they believed his report and they shook every time he got up but this time that brag fell on the ears of the right guy the wrong guy for Goliath but the right guy for Israel is there anybody in this place this morning that this message is going to fall on the right ears yes I claim my healing yes I claim my Deliverance [Applause] David put his hand don't get nervous now I ain't gonna hit nobody but this and took fence a stone and slightly and smote the Philistine and the forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face now wait a minute a stone moving a thousand miles per second there's no way he should fall forward your brother said huh no whenever you hit a hit an animal and you hit it good enough and it'll jump and sometimes it'll do this why it's a velocity coming out of that gun and whenever it releases that bullet according to the foot pounds that it has inside of that and the force of that just knocks that thing backwards that way how is it that a force like this hit him in the forehead and instead of him going like this what you would normally think instead of him going that way he goes this way huh why God wanted to make him bow God wanted to make all glory to God I can't wait for the time when gas vows to the bride I can't wait for the time when cancer and sickness and disease of people that we are praying for will bow and say there is a mighty God among them people there is a savior among them people God didn't want him to fall backwards but Face Forward foreign [Applause] the prophet sat there he went up there just dancing in the spirit as hard as he could Why by faith he saw the victory he saw the victory he took his little sling and one of these stones and give a dance so he dances a little bit foreign yes I'm in the spirit I'm anointed to preach he said Lord have mercy I'm scared I'll get in the flesh if I do that you're in the flesh when you get up of a morning you're in the flesh when you drink your coffee you're on the flesh when you eat your bacon and eggs what are you scared the desert I'm more concerned about getting out of the Flesh and I am in it some of y'all ain't moves about your spiritual joints and crack and pop up snap crackle pop it's been so long since you've worshiped much [Applause] he took this little old sling in there one of these Stones he'd give a dance and here he comes coming around oh I see Goliath saying ho ho ho but if goliathan knew what coming he'd been saying no no no no no no not ho ho ho ho but you see it depends on which report that you believe will it be no or will it be whole You've Got to Believe setting here this day whose report will you believe are we able to take this lamb are we able on God's word to stand are we able to say Victory by the mystery of God ordained in you and me Hallelujah are we able [Applause] left-handed Donnie he had five stones f-a-i-t-h in five fingers wrapped this string around j-e-s-u-s here he comes oh brother look out Goliath you got to fall and when he set that loose the Holy Ghost got a hold to that little Stone and picked up a speed of about a thousand miles my brother died surely you don't I do but there's no way scientifically possible that the velocity of it I'm interested in science I ain't interested in velocity when it comes to Faith if my God wants to take this one right here this morning and make it do the same thing he can do so don't you understand you quote the quotes you quote the scripture and you think they're so little they're in so insignificant all you need is the same power right here to get behind that scripture get behind that quote and look how devil here we come you ready it struck that giant right between the face and he fell forward hallelujah oh my look it goes on to say talking about David he danced up there jumped up on him I remember David didn't have a sword but David Yuri is still dancing whoa I believe the report of the Lord I believe the reporter of the Lord and he just gets right and I said it just so happened I ain't got no sword but Goliath's got a good so he reaches down in the name you cancer I cut your head off foreign [Applause] for the day when the Lord God will drop that sword and beheading into the hands of our brother Ron Spencer and he'll be able to climb up on the heads of that devil that devil that is tormented him and made him sit day in day out that Devil he's battled and be able to stand right up and say this day I will remove your head how long for the day when God will drop it in my little daughter's heart and she'll be able to climb upon that body of that cancer Hallelujah come upon the body of that concern say in the name of that Sim I beheads hell I'd be held excited Hallelujah [Applause] so David prevailed over the listing for The Sewing and with a stone and smoked the Philistine and slew him and everybody said and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David therefore David ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and Drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him oh I thought he already slew it some devils need double slayed Hallelujah took his sword his sword he said brother Tony why don't God always just heal people by Divine Healing and miracles and totally bypass all the scans and all the doctors and all the treatments and all that because there's some of these Devils God wants scientific pictures to prove it was there but it ain't there no more so he wants to kill the devil and then have a scientific record praise be to God well there ain't never been nothing like it before why he wants to double slam before cut his head off there with him when the Philistines Saul that their champion was dead they fled David believed the report of the Lord brother Josh whose report whose report Brother John Brother JD who's it for it Hallelujah Hallelujah but the doctor says and the doctor said brother Donnie are you going to believe that report are you going to believe the report by his stripes I am healed my brother Donna I've been dealing with the sadness of a departed loved one I'll never get over it I'll never get over to you you're going to believe that report or are you going to believe the report according to the book of Corinthians The God Who comforteth us and all of our troubles yes I know some of you are still dealing with sorrow and all because of loved ones has passed in the last couple of years but God don't want you to live in this life all down God don't want you being depressed young people God don't want you being sad God wants young people that's got joy unspeakable and full of Glory God wants teenagers God wants young men God wants young women that are so full of the power of God that when you work on your job the people say I don't know what they believe I know they're dressed funny but I ain't never been around a young girl like that in my life why God's looking for another David God's looking for somebody that'll believe his report [Applause] thank you can use another example read with me in Nehemiah chapter 4 verse 1. but it came to pass when sent belet heard that we builded the wall he was Ross and took great indignation and mocked the Jews spake before his brethren in the army of Samaria and said now here's a report what do these feeble Word of Life people do will they fortify themselves well they sacrifice will they make an end in a day yeah exactly we will one of these days we're going to get up and it may look like the same old same old regular day just my own opinion probably the rap shall happen on money one of the worst days of the week and in that day we'll make a change forever well they revived the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish and tobiah the ammonite now watch another doctor join in with his diagnosis now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they built if a fox go up he shall break down their stone wall oh no that's their report Nehemiah what do you got to say Nehemiah 4 14 I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses now whose report are we going to believe we're carried back in time now or standing around the wall the wall is Rubble it's a mess absolute tore all two pieces and we've got these people over here which have great governmental power they have ranked and Authority back in Persia are they going to believe them are they going to believe this one man which was a cup Bearer he did not have any royalty he did not have any great position but he brought the king a drink of water when he wanted it and brought himself up and RC as we'd say and yet he's the one standing up I'm telling you fight for your family fight for your children fight for your daughters yes brother sister I don't have a PhD I don't have an lld I don't I did not graduate from some Bible School somewhere but I do have in my resume that I laid hands on cancer-ridden people and seen God miraculously touch them I've seen God stop heart attacks right in the middle of them at the Johnson and City Medical Center I've seen people around the world get saved get filled with the Holy Ghost get resurrected by the power of God if you're looking for a degree I don't have it if you're looking for a supernatural I do if you're looking for the power of God we do that's our identification [Applause] Nehemiah 4 20 in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet Resort you thither unto us our God shall fight for us Nehemiah 6 3 and I sent Messengers unto them saying I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down why should the work cease whilst I'll leave it and come down to you this is nehemiah's report what's yours

to to spend a lot of time groaning and complaining and say why me why me why not us why not us you're looking for someone who will stand with you in the midst of hell oh if we were looking for preachers today in the message it could go into the hospitals preachers would be standing in line we could look for preachers today that could stand and discern and stand and have people to follow them and do all this oh yes they'd be standing up everywhere and how many preachers wants to be run down hated talked about ridiculed fight hell every day they live the lion would get shorter and

ahead and sing with me tonight after I find it pulled towards the rising up New Testament Church [Music] well as I look at across the land and I see God's Mighty hell the bride of Christ adorned in a wedding gown oh just like in the days of old they stood in Courage bowl and they turn that old pin rising up but there's a New Testament Church rise enough rising up there's a New Testament Church Rising enough now the Bible mainly tells and how the whole Eagles fell signs and wonders were done by the apostles hands demon Spirits were cast out you know they sing and shout while surrounded by God's holy angel bad for rising up rising up we're a New Testament Church [Music] rise and love and I like this it's all on God and the Miracles are done well I have some good news to bring to you oh and the last days Mighty Eagle your strength here it is is enough oh rising up oh we're a New Testament Church oh and we're rising up we're rising up yeah I said we're a New Testament Church rising up yes I'm rising up oh I'm rising up oh and I'm a New Testament Church rising up surprising enough we're a New Testament Church rising up oh and if you think it's all on gone and the Miracles are done will I have some good news to bring it to you oh and in the last days he will abort of his Spirit more and more like a mighty eagle your strength here it is [Music] [Music] Church Rising us praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord God honors our sacrifice and he's not looking for perfect worship he's looking for you he had Angels worshiping him perfectly and he wanted you because it's a sacrifice do your best today pull on the gift of God today build on the service that we had last night okay build your experience right get something from the Lord today he wants that expectation let's welcome brother Aaron brother if you continue singing that song all right what a beautiful song about us please well as I look out across the land and I see God's Mighty head oh the bride of Christ adorning her wedding girl yeah just like in the days of old days [Music] enough and I do a Testament Church we're rising up [Music] we're a New Testament Church right Hallelujah [Music] I believe that I'm looking at a part of that new testament church tonight that's rising up hey man is that your testimony is that who you are you know we look around and so many people want to put things off in the past and the Miracles off in the past and the testimonies off in the past but as we've said those testimonies are just to let us know what he wants to do today those testimonies are what he can do in your life tonight and I believe that with with my whole heart and I'm so thankful to be a part of that new testament church amen amen I love the worship unto the Lord I love what our brother said you know he he had angels that could worship Him perfectly but he loves that when his redeemed worship him when when you come together and make a sacrifice of praise amen and we're thankful for the to the Lord for what he did last night and how he spoke but but we're looking for him to speak once again tonight amen how many can be honest before God and say Lord I have a need Lord in my life I know I need more of you tonight and I believe that each and every one of us can say that so before we go to the word and let's just go ahead and bow our heads and speak to the author of it tonight Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord and how how grateful how thankful we are Lord as we sit here and look at this Gathering of young people Lord most of them from right here but many visitors in our midst as well and Lord we're just reminded once again how little we are Lord as we stand before this group of people recognizing that there's nothing that we could say Lord Lord that would help them but Lord in this dark eye where it takes you and we're just asking you to come and speak and you to come and encourage and and you Lord God to issue forth the Lord the challenge that we need to meet another day and give us the strength we need to meet that challenge father Lord I ask you to come and take over this vessel now and Speak Lord that you would have freedom Lord in my life right now to to move me out the way Lord and allow you to take control and speak to each and every need as Lord as our brother said last night only you can take one sermon and speak to a hundred needs in a hundred different ways and Lord I pray you'll do that tonight Lord as we set ourselves aside and our thinking aside now and just Lord let you take control I pray you'll bless the word as we read it and all the words that are spoken Lord that you'll shut my mouth in any place you don't want me to speak Lord and just allow me the freedom to speak plainly where you'd have me to speak Lord just take control now bless every heart that's gathered in Jesus name we pray amen amen thank you musicians wonderful singing tonight if you have your Bibles with you when we want to get straight into the word and look to the book of Jude the first chapter Jude the first chapter in the third verse and pray tonight our desire tonight is just to encourage you and strengthen you and the Lord that something would be said that would help us depress the battle for another day and and recognize our position and what we're called to be in this hour amen Jude 1 and verse 3. we're going to read one verse there and it says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints and then also I want to read one verse out of Psalms the 60th chapter Psalm 60 and verse 4. and it says thou has given a banner to them that feare thee that it may be displayed because of the truth Selah amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings to the reading of this word as you have your seats I'd like to speak to you tonight for for a little for a little while on the topic of raising the standard raising the standard brother Branham says and and as we read this quote I want you to just take each and every portion of it and apply it to yourself and and think about yourself and think about this these young people and how that we can take this there's so much he says here he says God grant it tonight everything has went by May that still Small Voice attract the people tonight to a real Sanctified life a life that will stand by their God that'll stand by their Church that'll stand by their Pastor that'll stand by the cause of Christ that will hold up a banner that'll live act dress go and Associate and live in the environment that'll be so salty that it'll cause others to thirst to be like them amen early on we see there in the in the book of Jude early on that that Jude is having to write and to encourage the Believers to contend for the faith which was once delivered and if you look into the dates this is literally only a few years removed from the original outpouring there of the baptism of the Holy Ghost there there in the upper room at Pentecost and already what they had been given is already under attack and I want you to know that there has been a word revealed in this day and restored back to the original and yet I want you to know that it's under attack and the devil would love nothing more than to take from you what God has given you what is rightfully yours but tonight somebody is called to raise the standard there is a group of people called to stand and defend what has been returned to you and make sure that no man takes that away from you you understand it is yours you can have it you can have exactly what they had in the book of Acts you can have exactly what your parents parents got what your grandparents got brother Branham taught us that every generation has an opportunity at Revival so let no man steal your Revival it is for you to have but you're going to have to be willing to fight for it you're going to have to be willing to go to battle and what Jude is talking about here is that men had already crept in and began changing ideas and saying what they needed and didn't need and how they could act and how they couldn't worship and that's always the problem once man gets involved once man gets his ideas in it but we have something we have a we can look to it's a standard and this is our standard that we look to we know what the Holy Ghost does we know how the Holy Ghost acts we know the life that the Holy Ghost will cause you to live and we can look to that tonight as our standard and man began to come in and change things and begin to Rob what it was that belonged to the people and Jude is calling on people here in this moment he's calling them to contend he's saying you're going to have to fight for what was once given in other words it's already changing but if you want it the way it was originally you're gonna have to contend for it you're going to have to fight for it and he's saying it's up to you he says Brothers earnestly contend this isn't going to be an easy battle this isn't going to be something like well that's my he's saying it you're gonna have to be Earnest about it you're going to have to take hold of it you're going to have to be willing to stand and today there is another call that has gone out and saying was there someone in this day that will stand for the truth yes a messenger came yes the seals were broken off yes the word is available to you but are you willing to contend for it are you willing to stand for it are you willing to be one that's not ashamed to say I've had my heart turned back to the original I'm going to stand on it because I know this is what's going to take us in a Rapture and I will let no man rob it from me I will let no cold formal worship come in and take over our services but we're going to be on fire for God this bride will by no means be a lukewarm broad she'll be on fire she'll be going forward as Onward Christian Soldier but somebody's got to stand and contend for it in this day okay Hallelujah someone who will fight for the truth that has been restored back and not only defend but to take steps to take more not only defend what you've already taken but to take steps to take all that God has given us in this day and as I think about the ranks of the people that we might would refer to as message Believers and I think of our youth and I I think of each and every one of us we have an obligation an obligation to fight and to defend what God has to fight for and defend what God has done in this day and not just in the sense of defending the message the message does a good job of Defending itself because it's truth but also but defending what God has done for us personally defending our experience defending our rights what it is that God has done for us and not allow the devil to come in and Rob what God has given you because young people God has given you more than we could ever stand here and say here he has delivered as he has healed us he has given us the Salvation he has given us the Holy Ghost he has brought us from place to Victory to Victory to Victory and yet if you allow the devil will come in and and give you a woe as me and I'm a failure and I haven't done much but you've got to look back to each and every Victory and every time you have a victory young people drive down a stake right there drive down a stake right there and don't ever go behind that stake ever again you may struggle to go forward but after that step put down another state and then after that step put down another state and never go beyond that last state never back off your testimony never begin to speak what the devil says but I am a Son of God I am Blood Bought I am Blood Washed I do have the Holy Ghost I am an overcomer let that be your testimony from this day forward [Applause] and defend what God has given you as individuals we have to be fortified and make sure we stay behind and stay clothed in the whole armor of the word tucked away behind his word and we have to not just for us but even as we spoke last night rebuild the walls around our families rebuild the walls around our loved ones and and push back to the landmarks that many have been driven away from things that are promised there in the word that that people haven't haven't reached to in so long we've got to begin to push back and take back the land that belongs to us in this day use the word to rebuild areas in our life that may be there they're weaker than other areas we all have strengths and weaknesses fortify your weaknesses in the word focus on those things and fortify them and build up areas that maybe you have neglected many times we have neglected areas in our life and we need to find those areas and cover them with the Holy Ghost keep them covered in the word don't allow yourself in your weaknesses to be exposed to the enemy build those areas back up and we must take time to nurture our experience into true relationship think about that we believe and we teach and experience you must have the experience of meeting God for yourself but then we have to nurture that experience into relationship because if it's a one-time experience then you don't have relationship if I meet you one time and then I never speak to you again I never commune you with you again I never talk to you we don't call we don't text we don't visit we don't have a relationship even though we had an encounter but I will tell you once you encounter this Pillar of Fire you will want to have a relationship with it it is something that you will want more of and more of and more of listen if you don't have a desire for more I question whether you ever encountered it to begin with because once you come into the presence of this Pillar of Fire your heart will yearn for more amen Hallelujah our experience isn't to be a a one and done thing but we are to walk with him daily going from experience to experience ever growing Ever Changing ever contending ever being willing to be molded continually putting this Stone upon this Stone and this Stone upon this Stone and allow Allowing God to mold out this weakness Allowing God to strengthen Us in this area and allowing him to change Us in that area never getting to the place to where we feel like we've arrived I'm there I'm a message believer I met God I'm good that's not a place you want to get into young people but praying Lord shake me again tonight Lord shake me to my very core once again tonight Lord show me where I need you tonight because every one of us have need of him but Lord show me where it is show me where I need to grow show me what you're trying to tell pour out yourself more into my life Lord Jesus prophet of God would say it like this he says God we're not so anxious tonight to see the building shook now listen I love it when the power of God sweeps sweeps through a place and it almost feels like you can feel the building breathing it's just so alive with the power of God but listen we're not so interested or anxious tonight to see the building shook but we would like for you to shake us Lord Shake our understanding Shake our being our emotion our hearts of understanding that we might leave here tonight more determined than ever to serve you that we might feel the presence of a new Fresh Pentecost of a holy spirit pouring out upon us afreshing a new like down in these woods and hills in Arkansas 50 years ago when the forefathers come through here in horses and wagons preaching this gospel dear Lord may we the bearers of this great worthy cause that you sent through here may we not be ashamed of this great thing but may we walk in the footsteps of those who went before us Lord packing the banner of the Lord Jesus raising the standard packing the banner of the Lord Jesus we've got to come to the place young people to where we are solid yet seeking to where we're solid yet seeking to where we are examples and yet teachable to where we are leaders and yet we're willing to be changed to the to the place to where listen these two things are not exclusive you can be a solid Christian who recognizes I need more of God you can be a leader who recognizes I need to be molded you can be a Godly overcoming Christian and need more from God as a matter of fact that's exactly where you should be at tonight Lord I'm saved I'm sealed I'm filled with the Holy Ghost but Lord I need more of you tonight pour out more of yourself in my life tonight I can't go another day without more of you yes I'm overcoming yes I'm walking in Victory and yet I need more of you tonight Lord good but see this is where the Devil comes in and he begins to try to rob you when we acknowledge our need of more of God than he says yep see you didn't have it yep see you didn't have what you thought you had but that's not the truth there isn't there has to be an acknowledgment when he comes in and points to your weaknesses listen don't ever let him Rob your praise because of your failures don't let him Rob your praise because of your failures he points to your weaknesses he points to your failures he accuses you day and night that's what he does he's the accuser of the Brethren he accuses you and he points out your flaws brother Aaron you don't know the the what he says about me listen I do because he says the same things about me he tells me the same lies he's telling you he comes and he tells you you're not good enough you're not going to make it you listen he wouldn't be telling you those things if he had you but he's telling you those things because he don't have you and he's trying to get you to stop you are an overcomer you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that's who you are tonight to quit listening to the devil when he speaks and definitely don't give voice to the devil's thoughts amen he comes in and he accuses you and that's not the time young people to back off the promise that's not the time to say well you know what you're right yeah I've been having these struggles I've been having these issues I've been having those battles but those are the times that I like to point him to the victories in my life those those that I like to point him to Calvary that's what I point to him to a changed life to a changed attitude to my victories I point him to where I defeated you here I defeated you there I defeated you on this point I'm overcoming in this area I'm overcoming in this area so you just keep running your mouth but I'm overcoming I'm gaining ground I'm attaining victories Hallelujah pointing to the victories in your life pointing to the overcoming in your life and quit focusing on what he points you to point him to a changed life you know there's been changes in your heart you know there's new desires pointing to that point the enemy there and yet that doesn't mean that I don't need more that doesn't mean that I don't recognize that that the Lord's still working on me that I have walls that I need to build up that there is areas in my life that I need to mature in it's okay to recognize those things and hold to your testimony hold to where you're where you're standing what I know young people is that I'm not finished I'm not perfect but I know that he is the author and the finisher I know that the one that started the work in your life is going to finish the work in your life the Devil comes and he says oh you're not going to progress you're not going to make it I would like to remind him devil I didn't start this work I'm not the one that did this but something drew me something called me something pulled me there's a sea Gene of God down on the inside and he that has started this work is going to finish it listen it wasn't just about coming out of Egypt there was a coming out but there was also a going in and I'm telling you we hadn't just come out to wonder and die in the desert but we've been called out to go through and go in wherever you're at tonight keep walking the promised land is just in sight oh but there's trials there's hunger there's tribulations there's serpents keep walking the promised land is just in sight don't give up your call to it you're called for it you're chosen you are the people that's going to see The Rapture in this day Hallelujah I need more God I need a greater experience God but I'm praising you for what you've already done for me God Hallelujah amen why does he want to put it off why does he want to put you down why does he want to put you to these things because who is it that's going to be the final serpent bruisers who is it that's going to be the last ones the final voice to the final age to stomp this serpent underneath their feet who is going to be the last one standing here in Satan's Eden ruining his perfect Eden it's you you're who it is and he's trying to keep you from from coming to that so do not allow your eyes to get caught on your shortcomings because church we have them I have them how many of you have shortcomings yes sir and it does us no good to stand here and point them out and focus on them and let that be but tonight I want to point you back to the blood I want to point you back to what the word says you are we spend so much time on what the devil says we are but the word has spoken about what we are he says I will have a church without spot or wrinkle listen I don't know how he's going to do it I look at my own life and I go I feel like I alone mess that scripture up I feel like I alone mess that up but I'm not the one who made the promise I'm not the one who's got to get us out of here I'm not the one who says I'm going to have it without spotter wrinkle he said it so if he said it it's up to him to fulfill it so just turn your eyes on him turn your eyes on his promise tonight raise the standard say this is what I'm looking to this is what I'm holding to these are my promises tonight Hallelujah you are called in this day to be Defenders of the landmarks you are called to be standard bearers in this battle listen I looked great admiration yes you the young people of this message in this dark day look I face many things in my day brother Daryl faced a lot of things brother Joe brother Robert we ain't face the things you had to face not in the way that you've had to face them I Look to You with great admiration you are a people of Courage you are people worthy of being looked up to you don't understand my struggles you don't understand what I'm going through sure you know why you're going through those things well it's because I'm not a Christian no it's because you're in a battle and you're fighting but you're still standing you're still here you're a standard Bearer

the devil you put it right back on him it ain't your pet quit petting it kill the thing cut its head off get it away from you it's not mine it came from hell it can go right back to hell I will not claim those things what am I I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I vote with a prize I'm an overcomer I'm called in this day to raise the standard that's who I am that's what I will be that's what I'm marching towards today Hallelujah that is the testimony of this church defend your experience defend who you are contend for what God has done for you you're still here many of you the devil's told you're not going to make it you're going to quit you're going to give up and he's been telling you that forever and ever and ever and I'd like to just look at him and say devil I'm still here I'm still standing I'm still in the battle I haven't quit yet I'm not going to quit tomorrow but when I wake up in the morning I'm gonna fight you and when I wake up the next day I'm gonna fight you and I'm Gonna Stand and I'm not gonna back up one inch off of One Promise off of one thing I'm called I'm chosen oh Hallelujah I'm talking to you tonight it's your message it's your testimony contend for it it's who you are Hallelujah in the greatest fight ever fought you're still standing how dare the devil come and try to belittle what you've done belittle your testimony your people to be commended and admire and look to you're still standing in the championship rounds think about it a lot of people can get in the ring and fight for a round a lot of people can stay through the first few rounds but there's something called the championship rounds it's where you're still standing at the very end you're still standing in the devil's Throne every punch he can throw he's hit you with everything he's got surely they're about to go down surely they're about to go down but our trainer says you got another round in you you got another round Indian the devil's looking oh they're going to quit they're going to quit and the bell rings ding ding and somebody stands up out the corner says I'm answering the Bell I'm here for another round I'm here to stand Toe to Toe with the Enemy that's you tonight you were in the championship rounds and I believe that the enemy I believe with all my heart is on the verge of going down we're about to deliver the knockout Blow The Rapture of the church is just at hand you can feel Time and Eternity beginning to blend you see it all around us as listen you can see the evil blending in from that from that other dimension brother Branham says we talk so much about how bad the world's getting them how evil the world's getting he says yet we fail to see how strong the church is getting all the time I'm telling you you're stronger than the devil's been telling you you're stronger than he's been saying but if you look to the word if you'll feed him the word you'll find that you're a mighty Army you're an invincible Army that you're Overcomers that you are the victors in this day it's time to look back to the standard Hallelujah foreign what did the chief Captain think of you he thought so much of you that he's called you to be a standard Bearer in this day someone who would carry the standard someone who would see this thing through to the end someone who would lift up the word of God in the most evil day that's ever been he chose you Prophet says like this he says but in every generation God has always had his agents it's got down sometimes to merely one but God always had somebody in every generation that he could lay his finger on some people that he could put his finger on and say this is my people and they'll do as I tell them to do he looks around he says I need a young people who won't bow down to the pressures of the age I need believers who will proclaim the truths of the word I need somebody in the worst conditions that's ever been that would be willing to stand and willing to fight when they're completely surrounded when there's absolutely no hope when there's absolutely total darkness when others are caving to the pressures of the age when others are turning and walking away when others is going to quit who's he going to pick they all know when God looks down through time and could have picked anyone could have placed anybody here knowing all things knowing who could take it he said who are my very best who can I trust who am I going to let run the last leg maybe in in carnal terms who are my Navy Seals who are my Army Rangers who's the ones that I can send in for the final battle and he looks all down through Eternal eternity and he says I Choose You I Choose You that's a little different from what the devil's been telling you God looked at you and you said you're the very best of God you're the ones I'm going to hand the Baton to for the close of the race you're the ones I've got faith that I know will stand that I know will contend and he looks down Through the Ages and the devil says you're no good you're nobody you're worthless and God says I Choose You I Choose You Tonight it's time that we begin to Echo the testimony of our God and say he chose me he chose me he chose me for this age and I'm not going to let the standard fall it's not going to go to the ground in my day but I'm going to raise it up he chose me Hallelujah who can I give the colors to for the final charge into eternity think about that responsibility but think about the confidence that he has in you Hallelujah sure there's people falling away there's people letting down the standards people are allowing ancient landmarks to be moved allowing ancient landmarks to be overrun people sit by with breeches in the wall they don't rebuild the wall they don't repair it they see breeches in the holes in the wall and they just they just leave them uncared for and the gaps in the walls through the years have allowed the standards to go out and then be replaced by the ideas of man you see not only to do broken down walls allow the enemy in but allow things out notice it's hard for the evil to get in if the standard is there the evil can't get in if it's filled with the standard but when standards go out evils come in who's going to build the wall who's going to get back on the wall what that's our first instinct somebody somebody probably Brother Joseph that's trained probably some preachers sure we have our part well probably the great singers and the deacons man that who's going to rebuild the wall you're gonna do it but you don't understand brother and I'm just a young person what can I do I'm just a young person let's look at Nehemiah 3 28 I love this he says from above the horse gate repaired the priest everyone over against his house after them repaired zadok the son of Amber over against his house after him repaired also shamaya the son of Shekinah The Keeper of the East Gate in verse 30 after him repaired hananiah the son of shalimaya and Hanan the sixth son of zelath another piece after him repaired mashulum the son of barakaya sorry over against his chamber now notice down through every one of these verses it said the son of the son of the son of and then it gets to verse 30 and it says the sixth son it's very specific here it didn't matter that the five Elder Brothers didn't want to put their hand to the word it didn't matter that the five older ones didn't want to do it it didn't matter that they were okay with gaps in the wall it didn't matter that the five older ones were okay with cold formal Worship in the church it didn't matter if the old head sat on their hands when the worship went forth oh come on it's okay it didn't matter the young one the young person said hey it's okay I see something that needs to be done I'll step up I'll build I'll fill it in I'll worship God when the service is going on I'll create an atmosphere I don't care if you do I don't care if you do I don't care if you do but I'll create an atmosphere I'll worship my king I'll worship my God I got a part to play I may be the sixth son I may be 12 13 14. but I can do my part to rebuild the wall to create an atmosphere where others receive the Holy Ghost where others get blessed I'm gonna hold up a standard you have a part to play I'll uphold the standards it doesn't matter how young I am I'll do it others may not put their hands to the work listen let no man despise thy youth don't worry about if you're 12 15 16. you have just as much apart to play in the services here as anyone as a matter of fact I can only speak for my church but I'll say when our youth are gone to like a youth camp or something it's sad the worship service is just different you want to be careful you'll be disrespectful to the elders and such I'm just saying when they're gone we know it you have a huge part to play well what can I do I'm not a preacher you are the creator of atmospheres you have the opportunity to welcome the King of Kings into this place as he's moving through this sanctuary and do your part listen I think about Lazarus and then when he was raised from the tune and Jesus told them that the sisters to go roll the stone away he could have easily just rolled it away listen it may not be your service it may not be the day that you're risen from the dead you may be feeling just fine you may be where you need to be but somebody's got to be willing to push on the stone because that dead person sitting next to you it may be their day to be raised it may be their day to be delivered and somebody's got to be willing to go hey I don't care if anybody notices I don't care if I get an award that ain't what it's about but I'm gonna push on this Stone I'm Gonna Worship I'm gonna do my part I'm gonna make sure that if somebody needs something from God today there's no hindrance between them there's no atmosphere of cold formalness but in here our God can move he can deliver I'm Gonna Roll the stones away from my brother and sister there's a part you can play this quote says his five Elder Brothers it seems laid not their hand to the work but he did in doing that which is good we don't have to wait to see our elders go before us you don't got to wait to see if Mama worships if mama won't leave him daddy don't have family altar you can have family altered you can do what is good it says if they decline it it doesn't mean we have to thus the younger brother if he be the better man and does God and His generation better service is indeed the better gentleman you can tell this was written in the 1800s those are most honorable that are most useful listen they can turn things down they don't have to take it all but there is a generation of people who's going to take everything that's going to claim everything that God has given them listen the older ones wouldn't kill Goliath brother Joe the older ones hit in their tent the older ones just said you know be careful the old ones sat there all day in their tent comparing quotes I decided not to be careful just all day comparing quotes and and comparing this and there was a giant out there taking their property there was a giant out there robbing their Joy there was a giant out there saying you can't have your kids back you can't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't have the gifts moving in the service you can't have freedom of worship well this quote says is he still out there yep let's look up some more but there was a young person brother Brown said I love the way he said it he said his boast fell on the wrong set of ears and I'm telling you there may be others that want to go around and around the mountain there may be others I just want to read quotes and read quotes and I love quotes as much as everybody else but there's a generation of people that says I'm gonna take that quote and I'm gonna put it in action and I'm gonna put it in my slingshot and I'm gonna go out there to this giant that's been robbing my joy robbing my peace robbing my freedom and I'm going out there to take his head off I'm taking the land I'm taking the Rapture that's my Valley that's my property and I will no longer sit by in the tent and let him March around on the Promises of God but there is a young people today saying that's mine get off my land get off my property oh come on there's a lot of people got the got the rock in the sling and they've done this too long it's time to turn and lose today let the rock go to its Target let it take the Giant in your life down Hallelujah brother Brown says no wonder Christianity can't even lift up a standard he said it's not because Christ is not able but because people won't do it he said the message is ready the power of God is sufficient men and women are scared to break out yonder into those spheres before God and dare to trust him and take his word there's a people called to trust him to take his word and to hold up the standard of the word listen you can't give an inch you cannot be willing to give an inch we're not called to be compromisers we're not called to be blenders we're called to be separators we're called to be Defenders we can't expect to be Victorious and continue to be wishy-washy about things every little bit of it matters every little bit of your property matters I mean think about it your dad gets up and the alarm goes off and he looks out in the backyard and there's an intruder out there sneaking around with a ski mask on and he said I don't worry about it he's just in the yard he's not even at the door he's daddy's getting closer yeah I'm not even sure his gun's loaded all right y'all just rest don't worry about it that would be insanity why we want to wait till he's inside the house why you want to wait till he's taking taking everything from you listen you see him stick a foot on your property it's time to deal with it right then sir you have no right to be here you have no rights on in my life every right you ever had was stripped from you that day on Calvary you've got to go and if you don't go I'm going to call the authority on you you've got to get out of my life take your depression take your anxiety take your lies and your fears and get out of my life this is my property it's vote it's paid for the deed has been searched it belongs to me he has no rights deal with it right now because if you give an edge you open yourself up to the bottomless pit it is a bottomless pit and when you give in to that the world presents us a very dangerous situation it's a very dangerous attitude of just be willing to compromise a little just be willing to say things a little softer just be willing to baby things a little bit for the sake of getting along and once you give an inch once you compromise a little bit before you know it you're completely overtaken listen you should thank God that you have the opportunity to come to a place we're a pastor is not afraid to speak the truth who isn't afraid of offending someone for the sake of for the sake of Truth a place where truth is spoken and held up where the standard is held high and we're not going to back up we're not going to Cave to the pressures we're not going to Cave to to the thought that we have to you know not offend anyone listen we're going to speak the truth we are going to say the truth I I can't help if it hurts your feelings there's the saying that that the truth don't care about your feelings the truth is just the truth and I'm thankful for men of God that are still willing to stand and isn't afraid to say how it is and call right right and wrong wrong 1996 I'm fixing to date myself again we had a president by the name of Bill Clinton at the time and he was considered the liberal of liberals he would almost be a conservative today but he was considered the liberal of liberals like man this wasn't good Bill Clinton is the president let me tell you how much things have changed if you keep up with politics at all I know you probably don't but here's a quick lesson Bill Clinton signed the defense Marriage Act brother Joe saying that marriage was between a man and a woman this was what the Liberals were passing when I was your age marriage has to be between a man and a woman and for years they cried oh we just we treated the same we just want to be we just want to love each other like everybody else we don't want to bother nobody you know the liberal rallying cry love love love we just want to get married like everybody else and you won't hear from us anymore see what it was is there was a standard in their way that kept them from being able to fully manifest the full extent of wickedness that was to come it was the standard of marriage they always want to move the standard they want to overrun the landmarks they want to make a mockery of anything that is an institution of God so in 2015 more up to your speed the Supreme Court overruled the marriage protection act giving these people the right to marry and from that time on has that been all they wanted no it's been a constant flood from the pits of Hell a flood an absolute unraveling of the standards of society that was once one nation under God how far I don't mean to gross you out but I'm just gonna I'm gonna give you some honesty right here here's where we're at as a society there is now a movement to no longer use the term pedophile to describe those people who want sexual activity with children brother Joe because in using that term you may offend them I'm not making this up in the academic world especially in the liberal universities there's a very big push to no longer use the word pedophile because it creates a negative stigma around them we now are supposed to call them map that's capital m capital a capital P which stands for minor attracted persons um I want you to let that set settle for just a minute brother Aaron why are y'all so hard on this why you preach so hard against these things why do you preach against the the worldly entertainment why do you preach why are you so hard why can't you just give a little bit why can't you just budge a little why is everything I be so cut and dry because when you give a little bit it opens you up to a bottomless pit toward the smoke of Hell's coming out and get listen young people you don't want to give a little bit you don't want to back up even a little but raise the standards that won't move I won't bow I won't break that's not coming in my home that's not coming for my children no sir but we stand on the standard of the word of God whoever it may offend whoever it may upset there's a standard and I will raise it huh Hallelujah you can't give even a little bit [Applause] changing standards leads to no standards we look to this one and that one we think this is cool and that's cool or this movie star and this athlete everybody wants to match up with somebody or copy somebody brother Branham said I don't care if my coat matches my trousers or my tie matches anything as long as my experience matches this word you want to blend with something you want to match something you want to be like somebody find it right here make sure you match this make sure you line up to this this is what matters young people this is what we must emulate this is the standard that we must look to we must begin to we have to allow it to manifest in our lives to where that word begins to take on flesh to where you become that standard Taurus no longer just on paper it's no longer Just Books and tapes it has to begin to take on a living form a breathing form a bride walking not a bride in books but the standard begins to take on flesh because we're called to uphold the standard a standard against sin and if things need to be addressed they get addressed if things need to be preached on they get preached on come on now we're getting soft we're getting to the place to where oh he's going to offend my kitty he's going to hurt my little boy he was preaching right to my family thank God thank you Jesus quit letting that standard be dropped you can't be a standard Bearer and be afraid of Correction brother Brown says judgment begins at the house of God hears where we are judged and isn't it a pity that when we see that we're wrong and doing wrong thing living wrong kind of Life Associated wrong and everything that we're not big enough to walk up and say God I'm sorry I'm the one that's wrong you're right and I'm wrong and you forgive me and help me to do better next time if we just be real about ourselves but we don't no I'll tell you what we do is we decided Well there's a church within driving distance I get my feelings hurt here I'm gonna go over there and then I get my feelings hurt there and it's been long it's been about a year since I got my feelings heard over there so I'm coming back where I used to be and we turn into a bunch of church hoppers I don't know why we're here but here we are and then we never learned to deal with adversity we never learned to deal with correction we never sit in a place long enough to change and everybody's against us and everybody's hurting our feelings and we run here and run there listen to me the standard is that the house of God is the beginning of instruction it is the place of Correction when he comes I say Lord if you got to step on my toes step on them if you got to hurt my feelings hurt my feelings judge me here lord judge me now but whatever it takes I just want to be ready I just want to be corrected I don't want to stand before judgment there Lord if you got to preach a whole sermon on me if you got to call my name if you gotta offend me whatever you got to do Lord I just want to be ready get our attitude where we come and we don't always got to be preached happy we don't always got to be able to hear things that make us excited sometimes we hear things that hurt sometimes there's things in our lives that ain't even sinful but they need to be hit so you'll bring them back in balance it's hard sometimes but whatever Lord I want to receive my judgment here being a standard barrier on people comes with great responsibility it also comes with great Danger because the standard Bearer in a battle the one who carries the flag that was sometimes caught carrying the colors they're the ones that lead the charge they have the colors of the flag and in an ancient times it was called the standard or the banner and and it shows the other soldiers Where We Are it shows the other soldiers what ground we have taken it shows the other soldiers where we're standing at where we are fighting at some may have got hurt some may have got wounded some may have got disillusioned in the battle they're still our brothers and they have to be able to look around through the smoke and the fog and the hurt and the wounds and they gotta be able to find where's the standard where's the banner where's the battle raging and I began to look for the flag of their unit says if in the course of a fight you were separated from your unit one looked around until you saw the standard and then you tried to get back as close to it as possible the standard bear hint of battle is in the center of the front lines so the following troops know where to go but it also shows the enemy where to shoot every gun in hell is trained on you but the Lord said I've Got Confidence every gun in hell is trained in you listen this isn't for the faint-hearted young people this ain't for those that are going to turn and run when the bullets start flying this ain't for the weak that's why I called you that's what I'm trying to get you to understand is that you're more courageous than you will ever realize you know most people will never realize how courageous they are until they have to be and I'm telling you we're at the point where there's no turning back there's no running you have to be it is time that you have to stand that's why he called you when the bullets start flying days of Miracles has passed you don't have to get the Holy Ghost like that anymore who are you going to turn and run it don't matter what kind of clothes we wear sure don't matter what stuff you're watching and feeding on it don't matter what kind of Clips you're sending to your friends we don't need all that emotion in the house of God anymore we don't need all that worshiping and dancing and all that fanaticism somebody says I ain't moving I ain't backing up off what God has given me as a matter of fact I'm going to take more matter of fact I'm gonna take another step I know I can have it just like that I know it matters it's in the word I know I can have an upper room experience I know I can have that backside of the dancer burning bush experience just like Moses had I know I can have those things I know I can have freedom to worship I'm not backing up off of what God has given me if it cost me friends if it cost me popularity I don't care it matters and I'm called to raise the standard and say I'll stand right here no matter what I'm going to raise the standard of the whole gospel I'm going to display the truth of the whole gospel and as ministers we need to preach the whole gospel because the message preached exactly the way it was delivered will produce exactly what it promised to produce think about it so many times we water it down leave off parts and then act like it's the fault of the message that things didn't come out the way it said it would you got to preach it the whole way brother Bram says I believe there's got to be some kind of a standard that God will judge the church by or the world there's got to be some standard it cannot be the church organization because they differ Who would know what to do but there is a standard and that's his word I believe that God watches over his word I believe that the word is punctuated exactly the way God wants it the Bible it's God's word to the people there's where reason I believe in that word and I believe the word is a seed and if that seed is sowed in the right ground and watered by the Holy Spirit it'll bring forth of its kind any promise that God made God will do it but not if we're only standing on half of it he's going to bring forth what it is you're willing to stand for and I want to encourage you once again that we have to stand for the whole thing the entire thing back to our opening scripture Psalm 16 4 thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth sayla it's got to be displayed so that you can rally to the colors rally to the truth when you've been wounded rally to the standard when you get separated what is the standard brother Aaron the standard is this word and the word preached in its entirety will produce what it said it will produce there will be Acts 2 experiences come on now there will be dancing and shouting in the house of God there will be the gift that manifest there will be healings in the house of God and let's bring it on down there will be overcoming lives to go along with that matter of fact that's the most important thing there will be those things if we preach it if we hold it if we stand on it there will be Overcomers in this day saying it works the anchor holds the token works but you gotta stand and say it's the truth and stand on that in this day quit changing the standards well maybe we can let our young people do a little bit of this maybe a little bit of that maybe we shouldn't be so hard I don't know I'll let you tell me but I believe I'm looking at a group of young people that like it preach just the way it is they want the truth give to them because they say I want to leave this world I don't want to be crushed under the rubble I want to take a Rapture preach it to us truth preach it to us straight tell us all of it don't leave off even a little bit Hallelujah I'm thankful to be associated with people that like it that way there was a standard Bearer in the Civil War in the time of battle when his company was charging up a hill against an enemy position and he was going ahead of the troops charging up this hill that was going to be difficult to take listen young people in this last day these last strongholds they're going to be difficult to take we're gonna face some tough battles you might as well just buckle down and prepare and get ready to go into battle because it's coming if you ain't in it now it's coming and he's leading this charge up this hill towards a fortified position and he's carrying the flag and the enemy fire is strong and the company is basically being shot to pieces they're being Torn to Pieces but the standard bear is gaining ground he's getting closer and he's separating himself further and further and he's taken every little step and the officer in charge he deems the battle a lost cause and he decides that the this battle is too difficult and he wants to call his men back there's too many of them officers in the pulpit he says this was a little bit too hard maybe we need to back off this battle so he calls the standard Bearer and he orders him to bring back the flag he says come back the standard Bearer turns and looks at him he says I will not give up ground that I have gained I will not return the standard how about you and the men come up I say we're not giving up any ground tonight how about you bring the men up how about you bring the men up to the standard of the word we don't got to drop the standards to make people feel better we don't got to give up what's been given to us I say bring up the men bring up the truth we can take the Fortress we can take the Rapture oh it's difficult the battle's hard but I'm not giving up ground I'm not going back where I came from I've come this far come on up come on up further take more ground tonight bring up the men rally to The Standard hallelujah what is the standard well just accept God sent a prophet I just make sure you're at church be a good boy be a good girl no the standard is you must be born again the standard is you must be born again you must have the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the real deal fire of God that fell on the day of Pentecost that fell in the upper room it will fall again it will fall for you it said the promise is unto them and as many as them that are far off hey it's been a long time since then but here we are far off and I'm saying Lord Fall Again fall in my life follow my children fall in my home I believe for that is the standard you must be born again we can't lower that standard just so we can say our little boy's doing good we must be born again and the results of that will be the same standard it will be a Victorious Life Hallelujah too much moving of the landmarks too much lowering of the standards instead of rising up to what the word declares brother Branham would say we got too many people preaching the gospel that ought to be cutting corn he said preaching a watered down head knowledge of a gospel he says what we need it's not juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency it's because that the parents has neglected and then he takes it a step further and a whole lot of it is the way the church never preached it what's the matter Brethren get back to the gospel preach old time Holiness and get it into the church again we must have a standard young people calling on you to raise the standard I'm calling on you to raise listen there is a standard of modesty I say wave it proudly there is a standard of Bible Holiness I say wave it proudly we have standards of conversation that we are to have rise to that standards there are standards of conduct and I'll tell you one there is a standard of worship as a matter of fact the standard is that it is to be in spirit and in truth I say raise the standard for all of them to see they may not want to worship with you in spirit and truth but I say hey here's the standard here's how you do it here's how you praise the Lord when he begins to move through the house of God Hey listen y'all about to show up to Louisiana you can't I'm gonna challenge y'all a little bit y'all about to show up to Louisiana you came and I love my young people so I'm gonna brag on them for a little bit they love to worship they love to create an atmosphere as a matter of fact the first year they rolled up to the Ohio camp on the bus the some of the people checking on me and said uh oh the Holy Roller showed up they love to worship I'm telling when you get down to Louisiana Youth Camp I want you to raise a stand and say hey here at Word of Life we ain't gonna be out worships we know how to worship we know how to pull on the word of God we know how to raise the standard we've been set free we've been delivered we know what we've got to thank you for I'm not ashamed to praise him you ain't gonna shout us under a Pew we're going to raise the standard this is how we worship this is how we fight our battles we know what to do when that King comes in there's a shout of the king and the camp we have a standard of worship somebody's gonna raise that standard we know how to enter in we know what's to be done it's not just a Louisiana thing it's not just a grown-up thing there's a standard of worship we're not afraid to raise that standard High never take for granted the freedom you have to worship Freedom's just like territory that which is not defended is lost that which is not defended is lost I say worship with all you got you worship with everything that's within you listen others may not understand Others May sit there quiet and as the master passes by it may not make much sense to them if I say raise the standard for them to see raise the standard I say praise him till the walls fall down you know they tried to tell Bartimaeus to be quiet they would have rather him set in church and stay blind and quiet they may not understand why you shout they may not understand why you dance but they didn't also they also didn't go through the battles you went through they hadn't gone through the wars you've gone through maybe if they saw the tears on your pill at night maybe if they saw the chains of anxiety maybe if they saw the way you've been Afflicted they'd understand when you cried out thank you Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord I'm free I'm the leopard they may not understand but let them know I've got something to thank him for oh Hallelujah if you've been set free or something you got something to praise him for tonight you've been delivered you got a reason to praise him tonight there's nobody that can praise the Lord like a young person who's walked out of the jail cell who's been set free who's been loose who knows I was bound for hell but now I'm saved now I'm delivered now I've got the Holy Ghost that's nobody that can praise him like you can Praise Him raise the standard of Praise In The House of God hallelujah Hallelujah people want to sit back and criticize whoo get out of the seat of the scornful had a young person tell me one time and prayer said this is the only place I don't hurt you want to Rob them of their praise and their Worship in a world that's trying to consume them in a world that's trying to destroy them in a world full of pressure and they step into the presence of almighty God you won't just sit there and be quiet and put their worship back in a denominational box I say be free in the house of God you've got something to praise him about you got something to worship him about like no other people ever before you are the people about to step from time into eternity into a new body where no demon can ever torment you again no fear can ever attack you again you're right on the verge of it and this people knows how to raise a standard of Praise weighs a standard of worship Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah oh my are we about to close we're about to bring this down because I do want to hit this point I don't believe in being hypocritical In Worship yeah if you've got things in your life need to be dealt with and the spirit of God needs to move you need to run to the altar not run the aisles I believe that I do believe we need to deal with sin but also believe that those that struggle the hardest and have the hardest battles in the hardest troubles they worship the freest when they get a taste of victory they let loose so you're sitting there well I know the struggle they've been in and look at that kind of attitude is that it ought to be when you see them get loose it ought to make you so happy that you get right there next to him and show them how it's done oh this Young Person's been fighting this Young Person's been battling they've been drugged through the mud the devil's attacked them the devil's brought all kind of Lies over them but now they're free now they're loose now they're in the presence of almighty God get right there with them and say fill them Lord make an eternal drop down in their hearts forever where they never have to go back because it's not just a temporary shout in a temporary praise but they can go into the holy of holies where it is forever and eternal Hallelujah standard bears you're called to charge towards the fight tonight called to lead the final charge of the ages the final charge of the ages called to say in

shall be stationed in every house shall We Gather strength by inaction sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which god of nature hath placed in our power besides sir we shall not

[Music] Hey. Hey. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] What happened? [Music] When it seemed I stood alone through the heartache and frustration, kept my focus on the throne. So many times I have recalled the Savior's word so true. If you won't be ashamed of me, I won't be of you. So I proudly stand until I see the face of the one who gave everything. And the reason that I'm saying standing from me, every battle that I will make from the ring. I'll bow before his mighty throne. Hallelujah. I can fall down on my knees. Oh, with a reason I'm standing [Music] standing in front of me. [Music] The road has not been easy. I'll sing it to you, church. At times I've lost my way. So often I stumble searching for the light of day. Circumstances all around me. I thought I'd surely fall. When the whispering of doubt and fear told me you would lose it all. Thank you, Lord. But he kept us amazing grace. We're killed. Someday soon I'll have the chance to thank him face to face. And the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me. Every battle that I fought will fade from me. I bow before my Lord and fall down on my knees. Oh, the reason that standing stands in front of me. We will join the millions. Every kind return and raise. Every child of God that day will look upon his face. [Music] The heroes and the marters. We got all the pagans. We all sing together and declare. Jesus is Lord. Hallelujah. When the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me. Oh, what a day. Every battle that I fought it'll fade from memory. [Music] I bow before his mighty throne. down on my knees with the reason I'm standing standing in front of me. [Music] I'll bow before his mighty throne. Yes, we will. fall down on my knees. The reason that I stand in front of me when he stands in front. Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Give him a good hand of praise if you love him. Praise the Lord. Amen. Ain't it good to be in church this morning? Haven't we had a meeting so far? Do you appreciate the presence of the Lord? Amen.

We magnify your name today, Lord. Hallelujah. Lord, it's not a name that we just religiously repeat. It is the name of our bridegroom. Hallelujah. Not only your name but our name. We are called after your name, Miss Jesus Christ. We thank you today Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. Isn't it wonderful to be in his presence once again? Amen. Without any further delay, we'll just ask brother David to come and bring to us what's on his heart today. Such an honor for us to be together and such an honor for you to come and be here with us in these days that we've been able to enjoy his presence and fellowship with one another. God bless you, brother David. Just come, brother. Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" Praise the Lord. We just had some church. Amen. What do you call him? I call him encourager. I call him king. I call him father. I call him deliverer. I call him redeemer. He's the lifter of our head. Amen. He's a devil defeater. He defeats your sickness. He answers your true your your needs. Whatever you got need of, that's what he is today. Amen. Praise God. That's the kind of God we serve. Amen. and oh, don't you just love him with all of your heart, the things that he's done for us this weekend and just how that he's spoken to us. He is so mindful of his people. We want to say how honored we are to be here with you today. Uh certainly appreciate the opportunity to be able to come and stand before you and the invitation to be able to be a part of this meeting. Well, it's just the highlight of our life to be here. Amen. While you're standing, let's go to the book of Psalms 102:18. Psalms 102 verse18 some services whenever we hear preaching is for healing, encouragement, faith, deliverance. But then there are some services that it's just correction. Well, unfortunately, that's what the service is going to be today. Can anybody handle that? Amen. Um, I don't make the rules. I just follow them. Um, now I'm not talking about being mean to somebody, but I'm talking about correction, the department of corrections. So, let's just take a little journey today. Amen. Psalms 102:18, this shall be written for the generation to come, the people which shall be created, hallelujah, shall praise the Lord. For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven did the Lord behold the earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner and to loose those that are appointed to death. Amen. Amen. Romans 5:12. Wherefore, as by one man's sin, it entered into the world, and death came by sin. And so death passed upon all men, for that all. A ll for that all have sinned. Go over to Romans chapter 7 verse 23. We'll read verses 23 and verse 24. Paul said, 'I see another law in my members and it's waring against the law of my mind. So Paul sees a law in his flesh. He sees a and it's waring against this law that's in his mind and he said it's bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. Look at this word captivity. It's bringing me into captivity or the state of period of being held. Imprisoned or confined in bondage, severitude, imprisonment, confinement. Look at this last word, incarceration. Paul said that there's a law that has taken place in me that is literally incarcerating me in my flesh. Verse 24, then Paul cries out and he says, watch this exclamation point. Oh wretched man that I am. Paul didn't say, \"Oh wretched man that I was.\" Because when Paul's writing this, he's not writing it in an unconverted state. But Paul actually being born again is saying, \"Oh wretched man that I am.\" Then he asked this question, \"Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" Look at this word deliver. It means emancipate, redeem, rescue. I like this one. Exonerate. Look at this word. Exonerate. Who will exonerate me? To clear from blame and accusation. To free from guilt, to release and discharge, to be free and liberated. I believe that we are a people today that are been exonerated and liberated. I'd like to speak to you today on that idea today. Escaping death row. May the Lord add his blessings to the word. You can be seated. I think this is incredible portion of scripture that Paul being aware that even though that he's come to the new birth and that Paul has actually been regenerated in his soul. We believe that whenever Paul writes the book of Romans and Paul comes down to Romans chapter 7, which is some of the most debated things that Paul wrote and many people whenever they look at that, they try to tell us that Paul was writing about the time when he was unconverted. But we don't believe that tonight because we don't believe that God will allow a man to be able to write the word that's in an unconverted state. But we believe that Paul having been born again knew that there was something that was going on in his flesh that Paul was aware that even though that he has been born again, Paul knew that he was still a prisoner. Paul knew that he was still locked up and has been incarcerated. But you know, if Paul has been locked up, we would want to know what has Paul done to deserve to be incarcerated. What has he done to deserve to be in prison? What did he do to be able to put in this place? What Paul would say in my members, I I'm warning against this law that is taking place. And no doubt Paul knew it every day that he woke up the same way that you do. That there's something in our flesh that is just not right. Now, we know there's people today that wants to tell us that we're already in the millennium and that the rapture's already come and the body change has already happened. But I don't believe that. And I'm sure many of you today don't believe that either. It's because even though we are born again, we're still living in a body of time. And we are trapped into this body and we are actually locked in this body because of time. That's what caused us to be here was the fall. And it actually injected us into time. Now, because Paul is in this place, Paul said that there's something going on in his body. Now whenever you look at incarceration and you look at people that has been put in prison, we know we hear the terminology that somebody committed such an act that it warranted them to be able to be, you know, held guilty to where they're put on death row. And we know the reason why any person would be subjected to such a thing is because there's come an accuser that a crime has been committed. And the prosecutor has told us that there's been a law that has been broken. And the prosecutor believes that there's sufficient amount of evidence to be able to bring against an individual and that accusation can be proved that that person has broke the law. Now we know that what that means is if there is enough evidence of what has been done that he can prove beyond all reasonable doubt that that individual is guilty of breaking the law. And in this case today the law that Paul is talking about is the law that was broken in Genesis chapter 2. For God said it like this in verse 16. And the Lord God commanded man, saying, \"Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, therefore that thou shalt surely die.\" Now, we know that when God says this, this is God's word. It's God's law. Whenever God speaks, he cannot retract or take back that which he says. And whenever one takes and they breaks this this law of God, they break the word of God. God cannot simply overlook what man has done. Well, brother David, Adam was God's son. God cannot overlook sin. God cannot look past sin. He cannot push sin under the carpet somewhere because of favorability. And to be able to overlook it, God can't do that. God must be just in the way that he handles sin. And because man had broke the law of God, notice that now there's going to come a death sentence on man, that man is going to actually live to die. And the Bible said in verse 5, \"And all the days that Adam lived were 930 years and Adam died.\" So God kept his word. God backed up his word. Amen. You may not say amen to that right now, but you're going to be glad that God backs up his word. Because of the fall, God caused man to come under such a judgment that they actually pulled God. Think about this. They actually pulled God to the place where he was loving father that would come down and visit. Oh, I can imagine how great the atmosphere must have been. But now they pull God into a different attribute that God has to come down and bring judgment upon his children. So they actually forced God to come into a place of judgment. And the results of that law being broke, it brought death. The prophet says it like this in 1957. He said God being holy and just, he had to have a prosecution. He had to prosecute the sinner because he had overstepped the boundaries of grace and became a lawbreaking citizen. Then he must be dealt with. And every law, listen now, every law has a penalty for the penalty of transgressing God's law is death. And it had to project death to the human race. And all the human race is under the penalty of the law. So because of the fall of man in the beginning, every woman, every boy, every girl, every person that is born after a man, after a woman, they are actually born with the penalty of death actually inside of their members. And let's just face it, there's no getting around it. The prosecutor had us dead in the right. There's no way that you and I can take and say that we're not born with trouble, that we're not born with problems, that we're not born, remember, you don't have to teach a child how to lie. There's something in bred into that child when he is raised up. You don't have to teach him. It's automatic because he's born under a fallen nature. And because of the way we are born, every one of us was born onto death row. We come to this world born on death row. There wasn't one of us born righteous. There wasn't one of us born holy. There wasn't one born better than the other. We was all born the same way. We was born in sin and shaped in iniquity. Amen. And the reason why we come to this condemnation was because of our representation. Because of our representation, we become condemned from the very being. Well, brother David, I wasn't here and I didn't do it. But you was condemned because of the representation in the beginning. So it's condemnation by representation. Amen. We was all represented by the same attorney. We was all represented by the same man. And when your representation loses the case, you lose your case. Why? God's law has been broken. And there's a penalty that comes with breaking the law of God. There's a judgment that comes against us. And that judgment tells us that a man may live or however long he may live. Remember the Bible tells us Methuselah lived longer than any man in the Bible. But I want to tell you eventually the death sentence caught up with Meth. Amen. It eventually caught up with him and he died 969 years. But finally here come death around that man. And it got all it looked like he was going to make it to the millennium. But eventually the appointment of death got him. And I'll tell you, man, since that day and the fall, man has been put into solitary confinement. We've been locked up. We've been caged up. Somebody say, \"Amen.\" We could not help ourselves. As a matter of fact, there was nothing that could appease the very justice of God. No matter how many good works that we have, no matter how many good deeds we have, it would not appease the justice of God. Works will never appease the justice of God. You can pray and we should. We can read our Bibles and we should, but no matter how much we pray, how many things we do for God, you can never appease the justice of God by works because you're not saved by works. Because God know the way that man was. The moment he started doing something, he'd go bragging about how great he is and how wonderful he is. And God does not want the light to move from him to anybody else. Amen. There will be no time off death row because of good works. Amen. We're not saved by them, but let me say this. If you got right kind of faith, your works will tell of what your faith has done. Paul knows I'm locked up. He knew that according to the word, he knew that he could not come off of this unless God would do something. Paul said it like this in Romans 7. For we know that the law is spiritual. I'll say it for you. But I am carnal. I am carnal. I'll just say it for you. We're carnal. We're human. We get our feelings hurt. We get down. We get discouraged. We got good days. We got bad days. Every one of us are carnal. Notice Paul said, \"I am carnal. Sold under sin.\" Look at this word sold. It means to sell with a price. Sell into slavery. Sold under entirely under the control. Hallelujah. Of something else. the master to whom one is sold as a slave to give himself up completely to another's will. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but if I can be sold by a price, I said if I can be sold by a price, can't I be bought with a price? If I can be condemned by my representation, if I can be condemned by being represented by an attorney, can't Amen. Can't there be another attorney that can take and buy me back to be bought by a price? It being sold and send my master. What happens if I get another master? What happens if I get another king? Amen. Let me say this. We needed a better attorney. We needed better representation. They tell you that individuals should never represent theirelves. You're almost certain to lose your case if you come to represent yourself. So, I'm not coming today by my own representation. I'm not coming to plead my own case. Oh, no. You may get nervous and forget the most valuable evidence you got. But let me tell you, we got an attorney today. He's all remembering. He's all knowing. He never forgets one thing. I'm talking about a king. I'm talking about all remembering God today. Hallelujah. Paul knew even though I got new life on the inside of me, I still I'm still bound. Now, after you've been found guilty and your case has been judged, after you received the judgment from the jury, there's only one thing that was left and that's your sentencing. Now watch, because every person that is sentenced and every person that is judged, they got a right to appeal their case. So Paul knew that. He said, \"Even though that I've been judged and I'm incarcerated and I'm confined into this mortal body, I want a pill.\" I said, \"I want an appeal.\" Hallelujah. And David tells us that God will hear the groaning of his prisoner. And that groaning to me today is, \"Lord, I want my appeal to come through. I want you to I want a righteous judge. I want a holy judge that I can appeal my case to. I can plead my case to. Paul said, \"We're waiting.\" Listen to this. We're waiting. When a man gets locked up, that's all it can do. You're just waiting. They say people that is waiting for their appeal every day. It dominates their minds because they're in their mind. Oh, listen now. Cuz everybody's Everybody's innocent. Everybody's innocent. Everybody claims to be innocent. But I don't want to claim that I'm innocent because of my feelings or my emotions. I want something to speak on my behalf. I want something to stand on my behalf. And I want it to declare my innocence by the word of God. [Music] So we're waiting. Hallelujah. We're waiting. Paul said we're waiting. Romans 8:19. Watch as he comes now for the earnest expectation of the creature. It waiteth. Hallelujah. Watch what he's waiting on. Watch what he's looking forward to. He waitth for the manifestation of the sons of God. Because the creature itself also, yes, sir, shall be delivered from the bondage of corruptional into what, Paul? They're going to be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The glorious liberty of the children of God. And we know that the whole creation grown us and travaleth in pain together until now. Look at verse 23. And not only they, but ourselves also, which has the first fruits of the spirit. He said, notice Paul's telling us it's not only nature growing and botney life and animal life. But I want to tell you, we're groaning from the inside. Paul is saying that because something has changed on the inside, and it doesn't match the outside. But what's on the inside is calling out for something on the outside to release and discharge. Amen. He said even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting. Hallelujah. Waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of your soul. Hallelujah. To wit the redemption of your bodies. Amen. Now the prophet tells us that word means to quicken the redemption of our bodies. So Paul said if you got the first fruits of the spirit you become eligible come on to be quickened until then we're groaning. Nature's groaning. Everything's groaning. Oh, you can't hear maybe with your natural ear, but if you can look into the supernatural realms, the trees are crying out. Animal life is crying out. Everything is waiting for the manifestation of the suns. Oh my, think about it. They're waiting for something to happen. Hallelujah. Nature's groaning. Everything's groaning. Waiting for the manifestation of the suns. Because when sons get back in their position, Whatever man fell from, if he can get back to the place where he fell from, everything that was put under man will automatically be, hallelujah, will be pulled back into their position. When you get sons of God back, the trees will come back. Animal life will come back. The lion will come back. When you get the sons in their place, everything under man will come back to his place. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. It literally will force everything back into its original position when you get sons back. So, everything hinges on sons of God. Everything is hinging upon the deliverance and the exoneration of sons. The prophet says it like this. He comes in 1963. He's going to preach the message of the breach. Notice just before the opening of the seals. And the prophet says, \"We've been waiting for this hour. Paul's been waiting on it. Nature's been waiting on it. Animal life's been waiting on it. And the prophet says, \"We've been waiting on it. We've been waiting for this hour. We understand this will take place at the first resurrection. Nature is groaning. We are groaning. Everything is groaning because we realize there's something that's not right.\" Amen. And the only way that you can groan and wait for it is because there's been new life come in here that speaks of a new world to come. Hallelujah. So your flesh is represented by the old order, but your soul is represented by the new order. And one is going to dominate. It's either going to be sin or it's going to be immortal life. Something is going to dominate. And let me say this, we've been waiting for this hour. The sons of God will come back to their position. [Applause] You realize why you grown? If you've been born again, that's what the Holy Ghost. You realize if you've been born again and you got the Holy Ghost, that has given you new life. Amen. Not a life under the destinence. Not a life of incarceration. That new life speaks of a new world where there ain't no bondage. Where there ain't no jails, where there ain't no sickness. Somebody help me now. There ain't no trouble. There ain't no devil. There ain't no demons. There ain't nothing. That's a world we're talking about. We're going to a new world. Well, brother David, I know I'm a son of God. Amen. God gave me the Holy Ghost to make me a son of God. No, he never. I said, \"No, he never.\" God don't give you the Holy Ghost to make you anything. [Applause] Because getting the Holy Ghost don't make you a son of God. But because God give you the Holy Ghost, it proves that you always was a son of God. It ain't God making you something you never was. God's not changing you from what you was. He's letting you know this is something you always was. But because of your condemnation by representation, you become a part of the fall. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And there's a spirit of God on the inside that's telling you just wait. Just wait. There's a heavens coming. There's a new earth that's coming. There's a new Jerusalem that's coming. There's a new earth that's coming. Oh, let me tell you, if you're weary today, I'd get my faith wrapped around that. Let me encourage you. There's a new body that's coming. If you're discouraged today, let me tell you that there is a new body that is coming. If you're down today, if you're sick today, let me tell you, a new body's coming. And that body can't get weary. That body can't get depressed. That body will never get down. Because the one who gets it down won't be there. Hallelujah. Job knew. Job. He knew. He knew he was locked up. He knew he was bound up. In the book of Job 14, it says something like this. All the days of my appointed time, I'm going to sit on this cell block. I'm going to sit in this prison and all the days of my appointed time will I will I all my appointed days will I until until till what Job until my change comes. You see Job caught the revelation. Even though that Job knew he would get down, he knew he would not stay down. Anybody hear me today? He knew even though I may go like the flower, I may go like the leaf, I may go back to the dust of the earth, and I may wait there until my appointed time, but there's going to come a day, amen, that the king's going to come down on top of me and deliver me from the bondage of corruption. My change is going to come. Job knew there's a resurrection coming. Do you know why Job had the resurrection revelation? I've been preaching on that at home. The resurrection revelation. Ain't it amazing how many people got it and how many people didn't. Not one Pharisee got that revelation. Not one Sadducee got that revelation. Even though Jesus told them over and over again, they never did get it. They wasn't waiting on it. But Job caught it. But Job went by the ground. So God wanted to inject something into the oat to let us know we're not all going to sleep. Amen. So God allowed a man by the name of Enoch. Amen. And let me say this, Enoch is not Pentecost's type. It's not Luther's type. It's not all. Listen, it's not the Tyra. It's not SRA. But Enoch types the last day. Now, every other age, the prophet tells us this is every other age would go to sleep. But he's letting us know there's coming a people that shall be created. Hallelujah. That is going to fulfill exactly what Enoch did. Amen. If we want the results that Enoch got. Amen. We better find out what Enoch did. And the Bible said he got to fellowshipping with God. Brother, when you go to fellowshipping with your attorney and you go to letting him know, oh my, you go to worshiping because he's God and you go to praising because he's God, it proves that there's something in you that it's not just time. The prophet said he got to walking with God until he was not. Enoch never did die. Enoch escaped. Amen. death row. And the prophet tells us Enoch was the seventh from Adam. And we're living in the seventh church age from the second Adam. I said from the first Adam, it brought a man who did not go by the way of the grave. And may I say in this day, in this last age, there is again another people in the land that is welcome with God, fellowshipping with God. Hallelujah. a people that's got a revelation of what the pyramid is. Can you imagine what the devil thought when Enoch come up missing? Probably like some of these prophylars around the message. Oh yeah. They're good about building cases. Come on. I said they're good at comparing human nature by human nature, human comments by human comments because that's all they see. They don't have the resurrection revelation. But to you that's got an ear to hear what the spirit is saying to the church. Amen. I imagine Satan thought, \"Oh, he probably ran off in some culture.\" I know what he did. He probably got himself locked in that pyramid over there. You would probably be right. I don't know about you, I want locked into this pyramid. Faith, virtue, temperance, godliness. I want to be locked into it. [Applause] No. As the prophet said in the breach, I'll start my timer now. Is it okay? Sorry. When a person is struck with diseases, aches, pain, one time they wasn't that way, sir. But they're groaning. Why? They're not right. There's something wrong. And they're groaning trying to get back where they was when they had health. And when nature and peoples, the Bible said, he said, are groaning, it shows that there's something that they're not in their ought to be condition. They're not in their ought to be condition. They have fallen from somewhere. In other words, if I fell from somewhere, my identity is not just a part of time. Amen. Now, if my identity came from the eternal part of God, somebody has to come to get me off of this death sentence. I said, \"Somebody had to get us out of this mess.\" And I want to tell you, there was no preacher can do it. There ain't no bishop can do it. There was no pope that can do it. Hallelujah. There was no man. Amen. There was no man born of a woman that was able to do it. So in order to get man off the death sentence, God had to put somebody on the earth that was not born under the penalty of the law. That way the judgment of the law cannot be held against him. And since listen now, and since the since the fall came by woman breaking the word in order to redeem and restore man back, look what God's going to do. It was a woman that caused the fall. And God's going to send through the woman, the church. Come on, somebody. Something that can redeem man back from what they fell from. Amen. God is going to use a woman to birth the word of God. What's God going to do? Brother tells us and spoken words originally received. Brother says, \"Mary did what Eve failed to do.\" Amen. Which proves to us that Eve should have all listen Eve should have gi birth by the spoken word. The same as Mary did, that's what Eve should have done. But let me tell you, whenever she listened to the lie of the enemy, she interrupted God's program. And when she took this serpent seed, she produced upon the earth the wrong nature. Amen. I said she took the word instead of heeding to what God has said. Amen. Isn't that what every age has done? I said isn't that what every church age has done? They took the word of a man and the idea of a man. They took Constantine's idea. They took the ages idea. But I want to tell you, we don't want to feed just from the words of a man. Those words will fail you. My words may fail you. But God's word will never never never fail you. the people which shall be created. So God was going to create his own bride. And then when he comes to her, he's going to seal her womb where she'll never give birth to anything outside the word. Hallelujah. Now the prophet tells us before Adam fell, the prophet said that Adam had the book of redemption. Right? But said, \"Adam had the ability to be able to control the elements. He could speak to the wind.\" Come on, somebody. He could speak the word. He could speak to the tree and it'd be moved. He could speak to the wind and it would cease. And the reason why is because Adam had the spoken word because Adam had the book. But whenever Adam lost the book, and the book, listen, and the book did not go into the hands of Satan, the book did not go into the hands of Satan. It went back into the hands of the original owner, which is Almighty God. Every person born after the book went from an open book to a closed book was born under death. Amen. Amen. From Adam until now, every person born bound, every person born incarcerated. Notice the program says in the sixth seal, that's the reason John wept. Yes, sir. Because if no man could get that book, all creation and everything was gone. She just, this always amazed me. She would simply turn back to atoms, molecules, cosmic light, and there would not even be a creation, a person, or nothing else cuz Adam lost the rights of that book. How many knows the book's important? Every man is born of sex, born after sexual desire. He was in the original sin between Satan and Eve, so he could not do it. There's, listen to this, there's nothing in him. There's nothing in him. No holy pope, right? No priest, no doctor, divinity, whoever it might be. Listen to this. Nobody was worthy. He couldn't be an angel because it had to be a kinsman. Hallelujah. It had to be a kinsman. It had to be a man. It had to be a man. Then God himself, Amen. become a kinsman by taking on human flesh through the virgin birth. And he shed his blood. Amen. He said that wasn't the blood of a Jew. Remember I read this morning said, \"Remember at one time I thought Jesus had Jewish blood, but I found out that wasn't the blood of a Jew. It wasn't the blood of a Gentile.\" Can you handle this? It was the blood of God. I said it was the blood of God. The Bible says we're saved through the blood of God and the child takes the father's blood. So, brother said every one of us are saved by the blood of almighty God. That's the reason, listen, that's the reason when you're born here, you was born with a tainted blood. But the blood of the father did not come the way my blood did. It did not come the way your blood did. Our blood is tainted. But his blood was not tainted. His blood came by the spoken word. Hallelujah. I'm telling you, God created a blood. The prophet says God created a blood cell. Yes, sir. Singular. Not blood cells. many he created a blood cell and then from that one blood cell it multiplied I said it multiplied so for one cell it became two cell from two cell to four cell and it starts splitting and splitting and multiply and multiply and when God's blood cell become multiply it created a body are you hearing me today and as his blood cell multiplied when The word comes back over you and I. It may have started on one day in the upper room, but since that day, that blood cell's been multiplying. One son after another, one child of God after another, one daughter of God after the other, the blood cell has multiplied. Until it's formed a body. Hallelujah. So when you get born again, you take a different blood. You take a different cell. You take a different gene. Come on. Now remember, that's what the enemy got us by was blood evidence. That's the reason I was found guilty. It's because of the blood. Matter of fact, Isaiah picks it up in Isaiah 59 and he says, \"Your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins, have hid his face.\" So when God looks upon fallen man, it's as though God can't look at him. So he he hides his face. Well, if the wrong blood made him hide his face, I said if the wrong blood made him hide his face, what will the right word do? Notice Isaiah goes on to say, watch how guilty he was. Watch this crime scene. For your hands are defiled with blood, your fingers with iniquity, your lips have spoken, and your tongue has mutter perversed us. That's what tainted blood caused. That's what your tainted blood caused. Because of our iniquities, it caused us, listen, to be in this state that we are in now. And when it did, it caused God to hide his face because it separated us. In other words, because of because of tainted blood, it divided us and God to where we become incarcerated and separated from the rep from God. So your iniquities, your perversess, your lies cause you to put on death row. And when you're on death row, you're locked up, chained up. Amen. It caused this divide, this separation between you and God. In other words, the law found us guilty. And because we was guilty, the law has locked us up and put us in this incarceration. But wait, he said we're not saved by the blood of a Jew. And we're not saved by the blood of a gentile, but we are saved by the blood. So when my appeal comes up, come on. I don't want to take what Isaiah saw. I don't want to take the evidence that Isaiah was looking at the hands, the fingers, the lies, the tongue. We don't want to look at that evidence because that wasn't me anyway. I want to look at something else in my appeal. I want to present a better blood. Hallelujah. Amen. Notice that Paul tells us in Ephesians, \"And now in Christ Jesus, ye who were sometimes far off. We are made nigh by the,\" In other words, you are drawn close. You are brought near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace and he has broken down. Listen, he had made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of petition. Look at this word broken down. He has loosed. He has loose anything that's tied or fastened. To loose one that's bound to unbind to release from bonds. To set free. To set free one that's bound up with chains. A prisoner. To discharge from let go. Look at this last part. It means to dismiss or break up laws having a binding force. So he's telling us there's a higher law that's going to supersede the law that found you guilty. And it's literally Hallelujah. It's going to break up the law having a binding force. It literally comes from the word anol. Hallelujah. Now watch because something happened and there's a blood that we want to present. It's a evidence that is absolutely it's imperative to our case. As a matter of fact, we're going to need the right kind of attorney. And anybody that wants an attorney, they want a high profile attorney. Well, let me just tell you, you can't get no higher than ours. I said you can't get no higher than ours. Our attorney goes beyond time. It goes beyond sin. As a matter of fact, the earth is his full. You talk about a high profile attorney. You got one, brother. So, we've been under this appeal for the last Oh, it's been a long time. You know, about seven church ages. And we've been waiting. We've been waiting. In the last 40 to 50 years, do you realize there's been hundreds on top of hundreds of people that has been released from death row and actually released from prison. And the reason why is because of new evidence. It's called DNA evidence. Amen. And the crime scene had blood on it, sir. And you have the ability to test the blood for DNA. Amen. Now, because of the advancements of science and technology and all that, they have discovered, listen, they discovered that there's a mystery about blood. They know that there's something that lays in the blood. And they actually discovered a way to test the blood for DNA. Now, DNA is found in a person's gene. It's literally the genetic makeup of an individual. Hallelujah. It's your sale. It listen. It's your sale driver's license. It's your cell passport. Hallelujah. It identifies who you are. In other words, the identity of who you are is encoded in your DNA. Yeah, sir. DNA was first noticed in the 1800s. Think about this. They discovered, scientists discovered there's something about the blood that has an identity in it, but the problem is they knew that the blood had a genetic code. They knew that that code lays in the person's gene, but they didn't know how to unlock it. Come on. They knew there was vital information that's laying there. Oh, if they could only look far enough and there would be a microscope. Oh, that would be able to appear deep enough into the blood. They would know how to interpret the information that lays in the blood cell. I'm going to say that real slow. I said there's a mystery that lays in the blood. And they didn't have the answer to what the mystery was. They didn't have the interpretation to the information that laid behind the blood cell. And in the 1800s, the code was still a mystery. It was a mystery and they couldn't they couldn't figure it out. Now, they understood pieces and they understood parts and they could see a little here and a little bit over there, but they didn't have the full understanding of what laid behind the mystery. Oh, listen. They rallied around the pieces. They rallied around the parts, but they did not have the full revelation of what lays there. Yes, sir. But somewhere in the mid 1900s, the mystery of the blood code, come on. Hallelujah. Started breaking. Yes, sir. Now, what they found out is Oh, you talking about powerful. I found this statement yesterday morning. What they found out is that within the blood, it has what they call, look it up, a DNA revelation. And you don't hardly have to be around the message to know that's powerful. They said the blood has DNA revelation. In other words, there's a mystery that lays in the DNA and that DNA has to be revealed what lays in there. Now, listen to this. You can impersonate a lot of things in life. You can impersonate somebody's hair color. You can impersonate their hairstyle. You can impersonate someone's size and stature. But let me say this, all everything on the outside can be impersonated. [Music] But when it comes to your DNA, DNA cannot be impersonated. I Oh, listen to me. first pull can be impersonated. We've even seen some second pull be impersonated. But when it comes to the mysteries of God, when it comes to the mind of God, when it comes to the word of God, let me say this. The third pull cannot cannot cannot cannot be impersonated. No matter how big you are, how little you are, you cannot impersonate DNA. Because of the ability to understand DNA revelation, there's been hundreds of people exonerated. I'd say a few of them right here in this building today that's been exonerated because they've been wrongly accused. Thank you, Lord. Because they tell us DNA evidence leaves no room for error. There's no mistaking. There's no error. DNA is a perfect identification for who you always was. [Applause] They found out in the mid 1900s as the mystery began to open and the science and technology they knew that there was something in that blood. Let me just say this at the same time that science had advanced to understand DNA revelation there was one who was sitting on the throne that had a book in his right hand. Come on, somebody preach. And in that book, that book was sealed with seven seals. And in that book was the mystery of predestination. In that book was the mystery of your origin. In that book was your identity. In that book, listen, your identity was hid under those seals laying in that word. And John began to weep because no man was found worthy. Ain't it incredible? John looked above. John looked underneath. John looked everywhere. He never found one man. The prophet said he looked at Moses and he wasn't worthy. He looked at Jeremiah. He wasn't worthy. Paul wasn't worthy. William Brandon wasn't worthy. Come on, somebody. He looked and he couldn't find him. I wonder. The prophet says, \"Why couldn't John find him?\" He said, \"Because the one who took the book came from the midst of the throne.\" Anybody hear me? From the very heart of God, the very throne of God, there stood a lamb. Hallelujah. There stood a lamb. There stood one that would remember he was a bloody lamb. Showing the office that he was in. He was coming to take the book. And in Revelation five, the lamb took the book. And whatever happened in Revelation 5, when John seen it, John didn't fold his arms. [Music] [Applause] Brother David, I'm a little bit too old to shout. The Bible said the elders, John began to rejoice. Everything heard I, John. And the prophet tells us that John represents the bride. So whatever happened with the lamb taking the book has a direct impact upon the bride of Jesus Christ. Now watch because when the book comes open every mystery that laid in the book everything that was sealed up in Revelation chapter 5 is now going to be loosed. And let me say this we found out that he took the book. And as a matter of fact, if you go to chapter 10, you'll find out that whenever that mighty angel descended, he didn't have a closed book. He had an open book. And let me say this, not only did the lamb take the book, but the lamb opened the book. The lamb broke the seals, and then he handed the book down to the seventh angel to reveal it to the people. Hallelujah. Listen, not only did Listen, only thing we have, only thing you have is the same way it was with Moses when Moses stood in front of that burning bush. You got the word of a prophet. Amen. That's the only thing we have. But let me say this. When it comes to the book coming open, not only do we have the word of a prophet, but the lamb, let him get his picture taken. The Lord let us see him in Revelation 10:1. Somebody say, \"Amen.\" Amen. He allowed man to take his picture. Let me remind you, this was not believers that took this picture. Come on. This was not followers of the message that took this picture. [Music] They had no association at all with the message of the hour. And I believe God allowed that to happen to allow it to be identification of the Lord coming down with an open book. Amen. Let me tell you something. That's not a rocket. [Applause] That's not even an airplane from an Air Force base. That's not a missile. That's a bomb. An a bomb. A DNA bomb. That's Revelation 10:1. I believe it. Don't you? Let me tell you what I believe that is. I believe that's the same one that Daniel saw in his day. I believe that is the ancient of days. I believe it's the same person that John saw in Revelation chapter 1. But he had hair that was white as wool, eyes as a flame of fire, and feet like brass that's been burned in the furnace. I believe that's the same one in Revelation 1. It's the same one that took the book in Revelation 5, and it's the same one that came down on Sunset Mountain in 1963. Listen to me. And we're not ashamed of it. We're not trying to hide it. We're not trying to make excuses. We say, \"Praise the Lord.\" We say, \"Praise the Lord.\" We say, \"Thank you, Lord.\" We're not ashamed of God's message. The prophet tells us who that is. Now, remember when the seals come open, the prophet didn't even have this. It was months later before he even knew it. All right, anybody hearing me? So he has the vision and and actually preached a serious time 1962, months before it happens. Prophesied it before it happens. And then in 1963, here comes down this mighty angel. And the prophet tells us who he is. He's wigged with that white angel wig. Amen. To show that the message of him being God is the truth. He's the supreme judge of the universe. He's the judge of heaven and earth. He is God and nothing else but God. I'm going to ask you, what is the attraction on the mountain? What's the attraction on the mountain? Now the prophet preaches that he goes to a lot of mountain top experiences until he comes to the last mountain and he said whatever happened on Mount Calvary is the same thing that's happened on Mount Sunset. He said it was God fulfilling his word. Amen. So whatever happened on Sunset, here's that very same God. And look what he's doing. He's looking to the right. which is the way he looked down upon the earth when he looked to the right to the thief that was there. Hallelujah. And watch his last dying act upon the earth. Come on. As he told this thief, \"This day you'll be with me in paradise.\" Amen. What are you saying? I'm telling you the very work of our kinsman redeemer that almighty God looked down upon man and said this day what did that man do? How many good works did the thief do? How many good deeds did the thief do? He deserved what he was getting. He said I deserve this. We we deserve this. But you've done nothing. That resurrection revelation, brother. There was something about that revelation that struck that thief upon the cross. And he said, \"Lord, when you come into your kingdom, he never done nothing. He never done one good deed.\" But let me say, he looked past the blood. He looked past the agony. He looked past the the body. And he seen Almighty God behind those eyes. Amen. He seen God hanging on a cross. And here he come looking to the right. Notice this. Psalms 102. For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven did the Lord behold the earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner and to loose those that are appointed to death. That tells me that Paul said, \"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be.\" Hallelujah. Somebody's got to fulfill that. Somebody's got to fulfill that word. So, let's leave this building just a minute. The day of your appeal has come up. Let's go to the courtroom. Can you imagine you've been waiting? Oh, glory. You've been waiting for this moment and now the time has come. I can imagine you're a nervous wreck and you come into the courtroom. Maybe you got your head down. It's real somber. And you walk over and you get behind your place where the defense is and you look over at your attorney and it's Jesus Christ. And then you take a glimpse over at the jury and it's Jesus Christ. Amen. And then you look up then you look on the throne and it's Jesus Christ. I don't know about you. I'm feeling better already. I said I'm feeling better already. He's my judge. He's my attorney. He's my jury. He's the alpha. He's the omega. He's the first. He's the last. He's the beginning. And he's the ending. He's got the final say. He's got the last word. He is the one that can actually declare your innocence. Hallelujah. Glory to God. It's three manifested in one. Hallelujah. Ain't that the way every believer sees him? I see one God. [Applause] The prosecutor which is blind, the prophet said the prosecutor's the devil the accuser is the devil and the star witness for the prosecution come on is the devil. So if you whoop the devil, if you defeat the devil, they're going to lose their prosecutor. They're going to lose their star witness. Hallelujah. They're going to lose everything. If that devil can become defeated, if Satan can be put under your feet, the prosecutor, the accuser, the witness is gone. There's nothing to stand against you. Now, the prosecutor, he's wanting to make a show out of this thing, man. So, they wants to get loud. He wants to get boisterous. He wants to tell you how wicked you are, how dirty you are, how sinful that you are. He wants to remind you of how many mistakes you made, all the shortcomings that you got. Say amen, somebody. And after he gets done of ripping and snorting and tearing and blowing and saying this and accusing that and pointing this finger, there stands the lamb. I mean the the defense attorney Hallelujah. And he says, \"Father, I'd like to present some evidence on behalf of my client, which happens to be my son.\" Hallelujah. I'd like to present some evidence that has come up in this case. What is it? It's blood. I get dangerous about right now. What kind of evidence you want to present? I want to present a blood. And I want to say this, this blood has been kept. This blood has been sealed. This, let me tell you, this evidence has not been tampered with. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want to present this blood. As a matter of fact, we've run samples on this blood. Matter of fact, we've looked so deep into this blood, we can not only tell you that our client is completely innocent, we can tell you who did it. [Applause] Prophet says like this on the token when he becomes both judge, jury and attorney, he he pleaded our case. We found guilty by his own law. He come back and took the guilty's person's place that was in the sanctuary. He took his sin. and he took it upon himself and died and paid the price and shed his blood and give back his own token, his own life. And the prophet stopped. He says, \"While we're perfect,\" he says, \"the case, the case is dismissed. There is no more sin to the believer. Amen. He said there is the case and the case is dismissed. No more case to it. Then safely with the token applied when death begins to smite against the door out there, it has no control. So the same way when the death angel came through Egypt that night that if they had the blood of the lamb over the lentil, the death angel could not touch the firstborn. Let me say this. You're the firstborn, the church of the firstborn. And if you got the blood over your life, death cannot touch you. Invisible Union verdict. You never sinned at the first place. God don't even know. It's in the sea of forgetfulness. Anybody know what that sea is? The blood of Jesus Christ. It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness. You never did it. You were accused of it by the accuser. But really from the beginning, I said from the beginning. God is not looking at you by time. He's not keeping up by time element. He's not keeping up. Are you hearing me? But actually, he looks at you not as you are. He looks at you always was really from the beginning, you were predestinated to be a son and a daughter of God. Hallelujah. Do you know why? There's a higher law that comes. The prophet tells us, let me close. He said everything on earth is under a law. Right? Even we live under a law. That's the reason when you're going down the road and God gives you grace and the speed limit's 55, grace is zero to 55. Amen. No, seriously, that's a quote. And you going over the law and you look in your rearview mirror and there's blue lights back there. That police officer does not pull you over and walk up to your window to congratulate you how good of a driver you are. I'm coming just to tell you how wonderful a day it is. And I'm just so happy and I wanted to pull you over to congratulate you. You're the 565th person that I pulled over today and I just want to tell you how wonderful I drive. You put your blinker on and you stopped at the stop sign and you did this and I just want to congrat Yeah. Right. The police officer represents the law. And his job, come on, is to enforce the law. But if you go below beyond the law, hallelujah. Right? Isn't it something that everything's under a law? Newton tells us that everything is under a law called the law of gravity. This handkerchief's under the law of gravity. Every time I let go of this handkerchief, what do you think's going to happen? Probably going to fall. And Newton said, \"The law of gravity, every time that you do the same thing under the same circumstance, the law will do the exact same thing.\" And this was a lot of our lives right here. We're up and then we're down. We're up and then we're Amen. It's because the law of gravitation has effect and control on this and they tell us it controls it. It actually has the ability to controls it by the proportion of its size and its weight. So the heavier of weight of sin that it has, the more the law of gravity has an effect on it. Amen. Think about it. But if this anchor chip goes to fall and I catch it, if I catch it, do you know what happened? If some Oh, if something catches it, and something gets a hand on it, if something gets a hold of it, Oh, you need to help me right here. Help me bring it home. If something catches it, if something gets a hold of it, it interrupts the law of gravity on the handkerchief. And that interruption stops the fall. I said that interruption stops the fall. Hallelujah. That means that the law of gravity has become superseded by higher law. Can I tell you, Satan's been pulling on you since the day you was born. He pulled on you when you was a child. He pulled on you you when you was a teenager. He tried to drag you down and pull you down. But then something interrupted my fall. Oh, hallelujah. Something interrupted your fall. Something interrupted my fall. There was a higher law that superseded it. Yes, sir. The prophet tells us that an airplane will break gravity temporarily, right? He said, \"But we're not living in the airplane age.\" [Applause] Because in the airplane age, gravity still has effect. But if you ever get sealed in, if you ever get sealed in to the rocket, I'm talking about that rocket that flew up there and it broke open and then it broke open again and it broke open. If you ever get sealed in behind the word, you can go to an atmosphere that is weightless. Do you realize that's one of the big things of the day today? people wants to get launched launched up there into space to where they can witness weightlessness. Well, let me just inform you. I don't know a long musk. I don't know anybody else. But let me tell you who I do know. I know the one who created weightlessness. I know the one that has superseded gravity. And he can take you while you are still on the earth. He can take you to an atmosphere where you are totally without sin whatsoever. Amen. Stand there for today. What do you think's going to happen on the morning of the rapture? He's fixing to be a rocket ride. I said there's fixing to be a rocket ride. A lot of people's looking for an airplane ride. I'm looking for a rocket ride. Amen. I said a lot of people's looking for airplanes. I'm looking for a rocket. I'm tired of this world. I'm tired of this place. I'm tired of this sin. I want to go to a place where there ain't none. Paul even tells us when it's going to happen. He said, \"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout.\" The voice of the archangel and the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Hallelujah. Then when we which are alive and remain be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord, so shall we ever. When did Paul say that's going to happen? He said it's going to happen at the last trump. Now according to scripture, when Paul was speaking this, the people was trained to three trumpets. When they'd hear the first trumpet, the first trumpet meant get up. All right. Get ready. Pull up your stakes. Amen. Pack up. Get ready to go. When they heard the second trumpet sound, that means it's time to line up. Everybody gets in line. But then there's a third trumpet, which is the last trumpet. And the last trumpet is marching orders. [Music] And Paul said, \"At the last trump, I want to tell you this. At the last trump, we may have been sitting on cell block D for a long time. But there's going to there's coming a day where you and I are literally going to be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. I want to say this. We've heard the first trumpet to get ready. We've heard the second trumpet. The bride must stay in line. But the last trumpet, hallelujah, the last trumpet means it's time to march. It's time to move. It's time to get out. Hallelujah. We've already heard the shout. Come on, somebody. We've already heard the shout. The shouts went out. It's to gather the living bride together. We're looking for a feast, a wedding supper in the sky. Oh, don't you want to be a part of it? Listen friends, don't let nothing keep you from it that day. No matter what you got to do, no matter what you got to go through, make sure you're ready. The preparation time is now. He's in the house. Sing it. Hallelujah. Don't Don't you want to go, friends? We've heard the message. We've got the truth. Now, it's time for the manifestation of sons because the books come open. Sons can go back into their rightful position. They can go back to the origination. Friends, what do you think the millennium's going to be? Sons back in their original positions. Hallelujah. Oh, I don't know about you. I'm glad I'm living the day of the fulfillment of Enoch's time. Hallelujah. Oh, help him sing it today. Weeping. They just laughed at Jesus when he said she's only sleeping. Think about it now. As he took her by the hand, she began to live again. Some began to praise the Lord. How about that be you today? Some began to say somebody tell it in the highest had to flee. It has to flee today. Now there is you're living in the greatest hour that every man in the Bible has looked for. Used to be. Now there is hope. [Music] or down. That's what I want to do right now. I want to lift my voice. I want to lift my hands. I want to praise him today. We were like that little girl said it all. Come on, somebody. Jesus touched this heart of mine. Yes, he did. gave me life again. Oh yes, just a house. Just a house of a blessed day. There's a light that shines. Somebody let it shine for all the world. Yes, Lord Jesus. [Applause] He's in the house. Death has to believe. And now there is Oh, hallelujah. Lord God, we receive it today, Lord. We receive your promises, Lord. Lord, we believe that we're the people of the rapture, Lord. We believe we're the ones that's going to fulfill the word. Praise his name. Yes. Praise his name. He's in the house. Hallelujah. Yes. Now there is light. I have light and darkness. Now there is hope. Yes. And there's no more now. I'm going to praise his name. Yes, I am. Praise his name. Yes, I am. season. We were like that little remes. He was locked up on the sail. Glory to God. Jesus touched his heart of God. Hallelujah. Gave me life. Yes, he did. Hallelujah. I am just a house of just a born man at blessing the Lord. There's a light that shines in me for all the world to see. He's in the house. Get past. Now there is hallelujah. In darkness you praise the Lord. Now there is hope. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise his name. We're going to praise his name. Hallelujah. Praise his name. The bride's going to praise his name. He's in the house. Praise the Lord Jesus. Oh, somebody give a hand clap of praise today. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord Jesus. Do you realize that there's a law on our books called double jeopardy? It's a legal term. It's a legal principle. And what it does is it prevents a defendant for being tried and punished for the same crime. So that means if your judgment was paid for, the double jeopardy law comes in effect on your life. You can never be judged again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You can never be judged again. Praise be to God. Oh, let's sing it like this. Well, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. I said, this little light of mine, yes, I'm going to let it shine. I said this little light, [Applause] let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. Well, this little light of mine. Oh, won't you put your hands together? Well, this little light of mine, and I'm going to let it shine. Well, this little light of mine, well, I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Sing it like this right here. I said now I go. Well, I'm going to let it shine. I said everywhere I go. Yes, I'm Oh, everywhere I go, I'm going to let it shine. sing. I got to let it shine. Listen now. Well, Sat, he can't blow it out. [Music] Well, the prosecutor, he can't blow it out. Oh, Satan, he can't blow it out. [Music] Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Where'd you get it? Jesus came to me. I was over in a courtroom one day. Well, Jesus gave it to me. And I'm going to let it shine. Oh, I just feel like worshiping him a minute. [Music] And I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine. Oh, let it shine. [Music] Well, Satan said he don't like it. [Music] [Applause] That blind prosecutor, that devil that's held you all your life. The devil, he know, but I'm going to let it shine. Got to let it shine. Oh, somebody sing it one more time. This little light. Welcome this little light. Oh yes, Lord. This low cost of mine [Music] shine. Well, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine. Oh, let everything that has breath, let him praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Our God is awome. Yes, he's awome. So awesome. Your God is awome. My God is awesome. Oh yes, Lord. Awesome. He's awome. Your God is awome. [Applause] My God is awome. He can move the mountain. Keep me in the valley and hide me from the rain. My God is awome. Yes, he's awesome. He's awome. I said he's awome. Your God is awesome. Oh, my God is mighty. [Applause] I said he's mighty. [Music] Yes, he's awome. [Music] [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I hope when I grow up I can preach like that. Don't you appreciate God's gifts? Amen. I saw a video clip on YouTube of a man that had been released just a couple months ago and he stood before a press corps as they were there and asking him. had been on in this uh penitentiary in prison for 37 years and he had said all along that he was innocent of the crime and that he wasn't even there but it was supposed to have been an eyewitness of course we know was blind just keep in mind your accuser and your eyewitness is blind who would take the word of a blind man to witness a case. So they bring this man up and he he's shaking. He's he's crying and uh you know that they want to say how how do you feel? How how do you feel? He said, \"I don't know.\" He just kind of shugging his shoulders and and the man is so emotional and so torn up. And then someone finally asked him said, \"Do you do you hate anybody? Do you do you hate the justice system? Do you is there anybody you want to get even with? He said, \"No, I just want to enjoy life.\" That's what Jesus made us for. Aren't you glad you're free today? He took your place. You can lock me up in a prison. We sing it together now and throw away the king. [Music] Take away my vision. [Music] From these eyes that now can see. [Music] deprived me of the food I need and even my hands and feet. But as long as I I know Jesus [Music] and I could still hallelujah everybody now. Oh, he said that I could still go free. [Music] Hallelujah. What kind of a man aren't you glad to be will reach down that nailham and do this for me? Even me. know I'm worthy to live and not fit to kill. But the man on the cross had your name written under the seven sea and said that I I could still [Music] [Applause] [Music] I knew you could quite I don't understand why a great king would leave heaven. [Music] put on. Think of it the robe of an earthly man. feel pain of flesh and bone into later trunk of that long that led to Calary or our brothers. [Applause] Oh, where the blood is it broke all your chain. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I could still go free. Tell me what kind. [Applause] Thank you Lord Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. Thank you do this for me. Oh, hallelujah for you and me. So unworthy to live, not Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The man on that cross. Thank you, Jesus. He said that I I could still go free. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Cannot in the middle of the day. Praise the Lord. Let us just sing one more before we go. Can we? The sun was hot. Angry moth gathered by the gray stone building. Great with his crew stepped out on his balcony. nervously washing his hands to rid him of the blood. Pilot never washed away. His wrinkled brows showed the worried lies. I heard P say [Music] I find no fault in this man called Jesus the healer from the shores of Galilee. Glory. But I command you to ask me to let him go free. Don't make me take his blood to the grave with me. [Music] Nervously washing his hands to rid him of the blood. He would never wash away. Oh Lord God, they cried for the blood of this innocent man. But I heard, oh my, oh glory. Oh, and it was midnight in the middle of the day. Trembling solders knelt before his cross. The whole world shook. The veil was ran as a sinless Christ was slain. And it was midnight in the middle of the day. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. And thunder roll across the rock. Hallelujah. Lightning burn like a fire across the sea. But on the holy hills the angels wave a crimson flag of triumph. They shouted death. Good Lord. Don't you know that death is swallowed up in victory? Glory to God. Glory to God. Victory. Oh, hallelujah. Let's sing it again. Thunder road. Oh, thunder roll across the rock mountain. And lightning burn like a fire across the sea. On the holy hills, the angels a crimson ling. [Music] Don't you know that death is following victory? You are his victory. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You imagine Paul in describing the resurrection and he says when this is brought to pass then will come to pass this saying death is swallowed up in victory not at the resurrection of the Lord Jesus but at the rapture of the church. Oh what a day friends. Hadn't it been awesome for us to be here together these few days? Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let me just express a few thank yous and a few appreciations and then we'll let you go. We want to say thank each of you visitors that's been with us in our gates and hopefully you've felt welcome and and at home. Uh also want to thank the deacons for all their help during this time. All the brothers on the parking lot that helped you to park and to be able to show you where to go and out there in that heat. We so appreciate that. All the singers, the musicians, song leaders, the ministry brothers, um the sisters that help prepare the little bag lunch things for you. And we'll have a meal for you over here in the fellowship hall once we close here. And if I've missed anybody else, we appreciate you, too. But it's we call them special meetings of course not just here but other churches where you go and they are special. We could have these three brothers here and they would have come and preached just for our church. But why in the world would we want to keep you all from being here? You what help makes it special. And we want to thank most of all our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for saving us, redeeming us, calling us together in the opaces of the message of the hour. And I've said it so many times, the local church probably gets tired of hearing me say it, but I want to thank him for our place here that he's given to us after all these years. It had been years over at the old church at Happy Valley before we'd even been able to have a special meeting because our people filled it up. We had no place to set anybody and no place to park the cars, but the Lord has helped us to be able to have this place. And we're just so thankful and so grateful that we could come together once again. Let's just bow our heads together and we'll pray over the food. And Lord Jesus, it has been such an awesome three days, Father. Lord, Brother Matt, open it up for us. And I just believe that you'd done great things, Father, in that service. I've already heard so many people talking about it that it helped them. Then Lord, Brother Daryl bringing to us, Father, a message of faith. And the prayer line was so wonderful. And we're believing for great things that happened. Then Lord, today our brother David been able to get out of the way. And Lord, just remind us who we are. So when we leave this place today, we can take the assurance in our heart the case is dismissed. We're thankful, Lord. As we go now to partake of some natural food, we just ask that you'd bless it, sanctifying to our bodies, and Lord, we have a little time together of fellowship. And we pray that you just watch over your children. Many of them will be start heading home north, south, east, west this afternoon, some leaving out tomorrow. It always hurts our hearts when we have to say goodbye. We weren't made to say goodbye like this. No doubt if we have this meeting again next year, there'll be some that will have already gone to glory and some that'll maybe not have the opportunity to come back. And we'll never have this same setting again. But we're longing for the day. We'll all be gathered together up at your house. Father, we'll all be young and we'll all be new and changed. and we'll all get to see you face to face. Keep us by your grace. Father, watch over us and keep us until that time. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. We appreciate the musicians that have played and helped and been singers. Amen. Praise the Lord. Some God bless you. You can be dismissed. You can make your way out these doors here over to the fellowship hall if you haven't been there and they'll have the food there ready for you. God bless you. We love you so much. In the name of Jesus, you can be dismissed. You called the son to rest. You lay it down to rest. You hold this heart of mine. You hold my every breath. You're such an awesome God. So mighty, so holy, so wonderful. You're such an awesome God. So selfless, [Music] so generous, [Music] so faithful you are. You call the sun to rise. You laid down to rest.

been wondering where he was that which direction he went and that you'd like to hear from him even if it was just slap you up to side of the head but you know that he's always faithful he's always there to help us praise the Lord so GL see each one of you tonight grateful for the opportunity we can be gathered together on a Wednesday night to be able to Fellowship around the word and have fellowship with our brothers and sisters that we're going to spend eternity with let's turn to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 if you would Lord willing may be having U question answers again tomorrow night 1 Thessalonians 4:13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope how sad for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord how could Paul presume to say this that he had the word of the Lord quite simple he knew he was a prophet now Peter never says this nor Matthew Mark Luke nor John Paul is the only one in the New Testament Lord willing I may not get to it tomorrow night but one of our youth had asked a question about prophets and how we believe that brother Brenham was a prophet and sent from God they wasn't debating it they just wanted to be able to explain it to other people but I had quite a time enjoyable time going all the way from the book of Genesis all the way through the Old Testament all the way through the new to the end of the book of Revelation looking at the word Prophet prophets prophesy prophesied the word of the Lord came to so and so the word of the Lord came to so and so I already believed it anyway but after I got done with that search I mean I really believed it but I imagine what people think honestly whenever they read stuff like this that don't believe in prophets and they think the law and the prophets were on to John and they quote that scripture and they think that means there are known prophets in the New Testament well if that is so Paul is a liar Ain none of us believe that are they why don't we believe that CU we believe he was a prophet a word Prophet this we say unto you by the word of the Lord now remember the word only comes to the prophet it can't come to me it can't come to brother Daryl and the rest of ministers here KN the rest of the ministers in the message the way it does a prophet that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout an order command specifically a stimulating cry a signal is given to men a commander with a loud summons a trumpet call for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up caught up catch up take up by force catch away to seize amen carry off by force claim for one's self eagerly to snatch out or away that's what we're waiting for to be snatched out that's right to be caught up praise the Lord then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words how many wants to be ready for that great hour let's pray together you have a need something that you're petition before the Lord tonight just hold it to in your heart oh our blessed father it is our hope your Prophet told us in question and answers 1964 that far back that many years ago the only hope for the church is the coming of the Lord Jesus if he were alive tonight what would he say he was Brokenhearted whenever he was here how dark that it had got over the Earth and in that prophetic Realm by Vision as far as he could see was 1977 so by that he predicted not prophesied predicted that the Rapture would come by then so if that be true and we believe that it is then we have been in a place of Darkness that was so dark that even a prophet couldn't find no rays of light so from 77 on to 2024 it has been so dark it's no wonder Lord we feel so alone sometimes in this crazy world that we're living people around us have lost their minds the world was groping in Insanity in 1965 what are they tonight we can pretty well tell by the way they drive by the way they act by the way they dress they're not sure if they're a man a woman or a boy or a girl they just don't know anymore Lord thank you for light thank you for Grace on our lives oh Jesus we're not here tonight to stick our noses up in the air as it were and say look at us but we're here to Bow our heads to the death of the earth and say thank you for Grace thank you for your grace on our lives speak to us tonight from your word father and we pray as you told us to pray pray you therefore always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man Grant it tonight father in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you Saints you may be seated 1 Corinthians 15:54 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory I know I commented on it last Wednesday night but it is so great I want to comment on it again that that scripture not being fulfilled completely in the days of the Lord Jesus himself whenever he raised and when all of those Saints of Matthew 27:53 were raised from the dead and yet this scripture will be fulfilled in its completion not even in the Millennium now remember the Millennium will begin with a great res Resurrection there will be millions of people that will be raised in the Millennium not in glorified bodies but in human bodies you may wonder sometimes where part of the aborted babies will be now remember they never had a chance to choose no doubt they will come up in the Millennium those who never had the opportunity to hear God kept them from hearing if you can understand that they will be given the opportunity to make their choice in the Millennium not under the dispensation of Son of God which is baptism of the Holy Ghost not under the dispensation of son of man which is prophetic but under the dispensation of the son of David they will be given the opportunity to make up their mind in the millenum I know it may may be nearly impossible for us to comprehend that anybody in the right mind would choose not to serve him people will no longer be dying people will be constantly renewing their youth people will be living for a thousand years people will be made of course not to war there will be no more battles no more fussing no more arguing no more fighting none of that sort of thing it'll be under the davidic reign of Jesus as the son of David and yet at the end of that Reign millions of people they may have subjected themselves under his Reign but at the end of that when Satan will be loosed out of his prison for a little season they will choose to follow the devil after living on the earth for a thousand years no one ever no one ever since the fall of Man man Adam lived to be 930 methusa 969 the oldest man we have recorded in history or in the Bible 969 years old no one ever Liv to be a thousand years but yet in the Millennium they will be given that opportunity and God will supernaturally raise them from the dead at the beginning of the Millennium and will sustain their Earthly bodies for a thousand years every day they will be living on the extended grace of God a reversal of old age they won't even be aging they won't be dying there'll be no hospitals there'll be no first aid there'll be nobody with a broken arm I mean those those things are just nonexistent the the the r the rivers that have been polluted have been poisoned will actually become alive whenever he stands upon the mount there and divides it from the hinder part and the lower part there will actually come a breaking forth of a stream which will run directly toward the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea will come alive the Dead Sea will have a resurrection the lowest place on the earth and Ezekiel even talks about the fish and going down there and they will pull fish from the Dead Sea any of you that's ever been there know no fish lives there so much salt content in the water that whenever you go there you can't drown you can't drown in the Red Sea when we were there several years ago many of the people that was there Carol different ones went down there well you can float like a bottle stopper on top of it because you can't go down the buoyancy that it gives you but they will exceed a resurrection of the Dead Sea they will see such phenomenal things every day of their life no Wars no no Mayors there ain't going to be no fussing and fighting no drunk drivers there'll be none of that sort of thing even existing and they'll see it every day they will be living in a place to where the word the weather will absolutely be perfect the temperature will be absolutely phenomenal and it will be the sun will B would be seven times brighter than it is right now according to the book of Isaiah and the the waters will become so pure all the inhabitants of the earth and the knowledge of the Lord will cover the face of the sea as the waters do and there will be such a Time on the earth and they will live under this jurisdiction of the son of man and at the end of it they will say I hate you Jesus I hate you I hate your kingdom I hate this miracle stuff I hate everything you've done I'm going over with the devil you think how in the world can people do that and it shows you that the blessings of God Alone will never change people's lives living for a thousand years will not change their perception of who he is and yet look at the contrast between them and you so you're born Immortal from the day you start your life you struggle some of you have struggled from day one when you become a Christian your family turned against you your your friends your loved ones you've been reproached you've been lied upon you've been ridiculed you've been called a cult you've been oh my the things that you've been through and serving the lord Jesus and you've got a greater determination to serve him than you've ever had in your life and he's not offering you a flowery bed of East he's not offering you a Garden of Eden he's not even telling you that all right I'm going to keep you you serve me and I'll keep you exempt from trouble from heartache from all that but he tells you if you serve me the world's going to hate you the devil's going to hate you when you get the Holy Ghost it's like a big Target gets put on your back and me knows what I'm talking about and it seem like everybody you talk to in the day and the hour that we're living they're just barely barely able to get over one trial and another one breaks loose and they get over one sickness and another one comes and they barely get over one trial till another one comes and yet the real children of God that are filled with the Holy Ghost they they know every day is bringing them closer to that coming or them getting ready to meet the Lord Jesus and look at these other people with that perfect setting an absolute Paradise on the earth that the world has never known and when it's said and done they'll turn their back on him and say away with you I don't want your Earth I don't want your kingdom I don't believe in you I don't love you Jesus I hate you well I'm personally glad I can't relate to that I don't mind telling you since day one when I give my heart to God I've had ups and downs and ins and outs and battles and difficulties I've had people to lie on me my my greatest hurt is from Christians my greatest hurt is from message people my greatest wounds are from preachers but you know what I'm not serving God so everybody will love me I'm not serving God so everybody will like me I'm serving God because I've got a desire in my heart to serve it if people turn their back on me well you know what that's their fault and they're missing the opportunity to have a great friend because I could be a great friends so that's up to them you know it's up to them I I've got a bunch of friends so you know what we it depends on our Outlook and what we're looking for I'm not looking for a flyy bed of East anybody with me tonight I'm not looking for the Lord Jesus to take all the stumbling blocks out in front of me and make it to where everybody will like me I'll tell you one thing if everybody like me I'd repent because I know I got a devil on me I wish somebody would help me preach tonight and you imagine living in a world like is fixing to come in that Millennium and people would turn away from me well to be honest with you I don't know how in the world people would turn away for him living in this world because if they ever have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and know the joy and the peace and the power that comes I I just can't say how they want to live for the devil one more day let me just remind you what the devil don't have to give you he don't have eternal life he don't have lasting Joy he don't have lasting peace he does not have a peace that passes understanding hey y'all come to have church tonight the devil ain't got nothing good to give you he ain't got nothing lasting to give you he ain't got a heaven to take you to he ain't got no crown for your head he ain't got no Water of Life no Tree of Life no bread of life well glory to God all he's got for you is hell every day and torment Hereafter but if you serve the Lord Jesus he said If any man will come after me let him take up his cross and follow me but then he turns right around and says the least that you if you do this unto me you've done them unto me I'll be your friend in trouble some time I'll be your burden Bearer I'll be the one that'll lift you when nobody else is there I'm the friend that sit closer than the brother I'll be your Alpha I'll be your Omega I'll be your middle I'll be the end I'll be your first I'll be your last I'll be there when oh Hallelujah I'll be there when everybody forsakes you what more could I ask for what why in the world would I'm going to trade the Lord Jesus for that line Low Down Rotten canive and sneaking cheating devil I don't want nothing to do with that Rascal anybody else here on the same side I'm on so just in case you're still wondering yes I am a fanatic for Jesus Christ I said I am a adct for Jesus Christ I gave him my heart and my life as you know many many years ago I have not regreted brother Donnie don't you regret I've never smoking don't you regret never getting drunk who told you I ain't never got drunk I've been drunk many a day I've been drunk many a Time the prophet said after he got the Holy Ghost he was drunk every day on the baptism of the Holy Ghost why you say brother Donnie you miss so much dancing what do you mean Miss dancing I still dance I dance come on somebody what yeah but you the da what about all the happiness happiness I've got more happiness than a bottle of vodka or tequila or or whatever all the rest of that stuff out there can ever give you and I don't get no hangover come on somebody I don't get up with a headache in the morning but I do get up wanting more because once you ever get a good drink of the Lord Jesus it's like the more you get the more you want the more you want the more you get and the more you get the more you want you follow me and the more you get the more you say Lord I've got to have more I need more of your peace more your joy oh Hallelujah I believe tonight as the bride of Christ we have got more to Rejoice for than we've ever had in our entire life praise the Lord who in the world was that for now notice in verse 55 oh death where where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ now we believe in a bodily Resurrection do we not but how exactly will that happen now remember there are some of the Old Testament saints that actually never raised in Matthew 27 as a matter of fact Adam and Eve were two of them brother Tony where did you get that the message Adam will reach over to Eve Eve will reach over to Abel Abel reach over to Seth so there will be nobody there is no body for Adam laying in the dust now maybe someone would have just had a funeral the day before the Rapture their body of course would still be there but Adam has been gone for so long you couldn't even find the dust so once the dust goes back to the Earth from when it came then it breaks back to acids and gases and then back to Spirit so where will Adam get his body where did he get it the first time now you see the problem that people have in trying to understand our Resurrection remember the resurrection of Matthew 27:53 was a needed visible Resurrection with multiple eyewitnesses so it could be written in the Bible it needed to be that type of Resurrection but our resurrection and Rapture does not need to be that type as a matter of fact it's going to be a total secret no one will know it for several days that it's been Global for some it'll be weeks now but we say well the graves will open symbolically yes mine's already opened spiritually I've come out from among the dead so my grave is already open praise the Lord but now what's the prophet when he breaks into this and God hiding in in Simplicity in Jeffersonville and he says that watch this when they say the graves will open how is the graves going to open I said I haven't got time to get into this I wanted to but I'm going to have to take it just to show you the Simplicity of God the calcium Poes everything when everything that's in you materials would only make a spoonful so a spoonful so when it would go through the cycle to where bones tissue whatever more would finally decompose and come back to the dust State you'd wind up being a teaspoon now some of you a little bit bigger maybe me and you might wind up being a tablespoon but that still ain't much to brag about is it so You' go back to that then after you would dissolve into that your house I mean then the dust would break up and it would become what it was before the Earth took on chemistry now there was a time that the Earth did not exist where was it though in the mind of God so the Earth was one of God's thoughts one of his attributes and then let's say that he started molding the Earth with the core and the cosmic lights and PES and petroleum and all those things that he wanted to make it out of so he started creating now the Earth is your mother in the sense of the body so God gave the Earth and it passes from one generation of the Earth this is why the Bible of course in the Book of Genesis says and these are the generations of the heavens and the Earth generations of the heavens and the Earth so the Earth was coming from one seed to another to another so it passed in stages and Moses called it as Generations so what was it it was in spirit it was invisible thought form then it come down maybe into a form that taken not a visible thing but it did not look like what we have now so it was a generation so we would say all right you take me and hay and then our father Harry and I is one generation Our Father's another generation his father's another generation his father another generation so then we come down from one to the other so the earth and the heavens was descending they were descending ending into the stage that they are now the generations of the heavens and the Earth and God was writing a story of you and I so the Stars passed in their genealogies from one generation to another and remember that God gave Abraham The Mystery of the stars and the Earth so he said look up there and he said count the stars that you see then he tells him go down the Sands and count that and that's your seed so from dust to Stars now it's written of course in the heavens and it's written on the earth then God brought the earth into its primeval state in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God said let there be light and there was light so in that stage the Earth something had happened in a cataclysmic State because according to Jeremiah that God when he made it he would have never left it in an uninhabited place in a state so God started molding and bringing to this state of what we are today same with our bodies so whenever we would go back say Adam Eve Abel Seth massusa all those that lived those thousands of years ago wh what would they be there wouldn't even be no dust left of their mortal remains so it would break back to acids and gases and then it would go back be on that it would go back to Spirit now notice that would be the Earth had God not sent a protected word you understand I took care the other day I said you know you realize that the earth and the inhabitants of the Earth have never been at the stage where they are now it has never been on the Earth where man had the power to totally annihilate his home it's never been to the spot to where man had the ability to totally annihilate his home and he would do it in this age but God has a protective word over this Earth this Earth is one of God's attributes and he will not allow it to be destroyed but it is in man's ability I heard it just a week or so ago that Iran was in a couple of weeks will have enough plutonium to make a nuclear warhead now remember it's not just the big ones that have it anymore the prophet said whenever he was here that many of those small Nations look at North Korea look at all these different nations and have it so they start sending them off if they do and it send it across the top from the from Russia across the top comes across Alaska we've only got so many minutes by the time it shows up on our radar they've got so many minutes from the White House now keep that in mind when our president has to go to bed at 8:00 at night because he's so wore out so hopefully Russia won't send it at 8:05 which it doesn't really matter to me anyway because I've got a first class ticket it don't matter what time it is so as a bride of Christ you can go down and sleep like a baby at night because you don't have to sit up and wait on that the way I look at it God's going to be up all night anyway there no need for both of us to stay up so if I can't trust him with that I sure can't trust him with My Soul but you think now that if God had not put a protective word over this Earth in this age man would annihilate same with you and I if God had not spoke a word about a bride in this age all the darkness all the sin all the everyday things that we deal in our life how many knows I'm talking about tonight just to keep your head above the water in the day that we're living you're an absolute walking Miracle right here tonight and Daniel prophesied and said it would be that way in this day that Satan would try to wear out the patience of the saints of God but God also spoke a word about you and that's why Satan will never stop you as a member of the body of Christ I'm glad for that tonight now I want you to think about that the Earth would be reversed and go back because Atomic power was released in the beginning when God said let there be and an atom bursted at the bursting of an atom the releasing of the atomic energy from the spoken word of God you see God is the only one that can be able to burst an atom and not produce nuclear fallout he knows what to do but man broke into his laboratory through Oppenheimer and all those men that broke into that but when they broke into it then they broke into the side of death they can't do with the same thing that God does and what would it do it would take this Earth Beyond dust it would take it back into gases and totally annihilate the whole thing but God said I refuse to let that happen I will redeem her she's the only planet whose name is written in the Book of Life show me the word Pluto in your Bible show me the word Mars in your Bible Saturn Uranus or any of the rest of them there's only one planet whose name is in the book of life and that is the Earth aren't you glad your name's written there too now sing so God knowed that in that first resurrection of Matthew 273 25753 there must be visible people come on the earth and sepes would open and they would raise and be Witnesses now watch he says God just speaks and the Rapture will come it ain't going to go out there and the angels come down and shovel the out the graves and get an old dead carcass here what is it it's born in sin but to begin with but it's a new one made in its rightness you know if we have this we'll die again nobody will say the graves will open the dead shall walk out that may be true but not open in the way you say open you see that's right it won't be like that it will be a secret because he said he had come like a SE and the night he's already told us this that the Rapture the judgments will strike sin plague sickness and everything and the people will cry for death to take them when the Judgment Lord why is this judgment upon us you said there'd be a Rapture he'll say it's already come and you didn't know it now why would they not know it they're listening to the wrong voices amen because the preachers that they're sitting under are telling them all you have to do is look to the cross and plead the blood of Jesus and he understands you can't live right he understands you've got to sin a little bit every day and he understands that the Holy Ghost was just for the apostles and we ain't got the Holy Ghost no more well you know if that's what you hear and that's what you believe then naturally you're not going to seek the Holy Ghost and you know what's even to me more sad than that is that we've got a few preachers around this message that are teaching their congregations that there will be people out of the Catholic church out of the Baptist Church out of the Methodist Church that are going the Rapture on Resurrection morning I want somebody to show me where that is the conclusive teaching of this message down through the year 1965 you can stand right now if you got your quotes in with you amen it will take a message that will bring rapturing face how can you be a bride of Christ and wear the mark of a denomination when the mark of a denomination is the mark of the Beast and you pray to Mary in your rosary and you're going in the Rapture and God make us tow the line God make us I mean you do one little saying wrong think one little bad thought and you can't hardly live that day till you make that thing right and God lets people drink alcohol smoke cigarettes commit adultery where many skirts and dressed like like like men even though they're women and vice versa on the other side come on children and they're bringing drag shows to their church and them people are going in the Rapture if that's what heaven's going to be full of I don't even want to go come on don't get quiet on me tonight don't you worry there won't be no drag in heaven and there won't be none that's actually like it down here on the earth well praise the Lord so you see under the ministers that they're set under all we're all going we're all going you know everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die as the old song says and it's not just so much dying natural but it is spiritually so they will not expect it because they're anticipating the Rapture will be for anybody that believes in Jesus anybody that says oh yeah he's my savior I accepted him 75 years ago you know and I live like the devil but that's all right you know he give me Grace for that and that's just the way that it is so they don't believe in the Holy Ghost they don't seek the Holy Ghost and they live under that so they're just going in the in the coming of the Lord whenever it comes so they're not looking for it to be a mystery at all and no doubt they passed by the cemeteries and they say yep yep I can see all the graves other they're still full of all the people that I've buried since I've been here I could go to the cemeteries in Mount Carmel I could go to the ones all over Johnson City and Kingsport I could go to where we laid the body of my daughter the old Coke her grave will not be open because she is not there praise the Lord Brother Calvin ain't there come on your your husband your wife your daughter they're not there friends that's just the old cult now notice God hiding himself in Simplicity all it's it's already happened and you know it not why don't Believers believe the simple signs of his coming now they asked the Prophet this question in 1964 do all going the bride have to live within 15 excuse me 100 miles of the Tabernacle I believe I had that again last Sunday now in this know the bride doesn't have to be in any certain place many of them will be in the dust of the earth that'd be around the Earth in the snow and the North in the dust of the tropical jungles all around the world but when the trumpet of God shall sound the dead and Christ shall arise waken and Come Out of the Dust of the earth notice Out of the Dust God never made Adam's Body out of the red clay 6 Ines down beneath dust level where is the dust right on top right on top so God reached down on top where does God reach for all these millions of bodies that are going to be called from the earth the dust so he speaks at one time and how many ever there will be beginning with Adam from Adam Eve Abel Seth on down to the very last bride member that pass the day before the morning of can you imagine there may be somebody passed away that morning and about 15 minutes later they're raised from the dead said boy that was quick praise God hallelujah short sleep was it man that wasn't even a nap but God will speak not shovels Not Angels going down it will be a secret yes sir well how are we going to know his voice what dust will respond to the call now you see it will depend on you and I whether or not we are part of that number how do we know brother Brandon when he was there and Acton Kentucky when he preached at the campground and he preached Jesus with dirty feet was the subject that he was dealing with in 1955 and sister Nelly and brother Charlie and sister Nelly was there and brother Charlie wasn't serving the lord yet sister Nelly wasn't either but boy in that service the Lord got a hold to them s Nelly went up and you know cried and prayed and really give a heart to the Lord and the Lord just really done a work in their heart I was there several years ago on a tent meeting actually that brother Charlie set up on that same uh same ground where brother brandom was but brother Charlie after that the Lord started dealing with him and deal he was working night night shift there in in a place in camville and the Lord started dealing with him real real hard one night and brother Charlie just kind of sneaked you know went off around behind away from the guys he's working with and just kind of settled it right there with the Lord and then the next Sunday he went to the Tabernacle and he he did the traditional thing and know G up front and went up and so brother Ram told him later he said Charlie he said you made peace with him that night seen him in a vision and he said I saw you you know whatever it was where you standing and he said one day that same voice that called you right there at that plant will call you in the resurrection of the Rapture now you see this is our link to deity this is our link to the supernatural which God wants us to have our entire life our deposit our part of God the prophet says it this way a soul of God that was in God so just put it this way that God is a great Dynamo of Soul so you if you are part of him you were a soul of God that was in God I hope y'all come to have church tonight a soul of God that was in God that was your deposit then one day that part of God in you heard that voice of God and started pulling on your heart now this be honest we was not searching for God or you might have went from one Church to another after another but it was really God searching after us the prophet said no man seeks God but God seeks after man so there was something there that began to hear what was it it wasn't necessarily my physical ears or yours but it was that part from God that recognized his voice now if that part laying inside of me or laying inside of you was able to respond to that call and no doubt for some of you the state that you were in you thought there's no way I'm in such a bad shape I'm so lost how in the world could I ever come to God I don't feel worthy of course we were not but something within you begin to match up with something that it hurt it overwhelmed you as a matter of fact because it was beyond your own power your own choice your own capability of doing it what was it the father calling to a son or daughter that is the part of you that never sinned in the first place that is the part of God that was inside of you oh glory to God I got in trouble years ago when I first come to Happy Valley for preaching predestination and I'm still preaching it and still getting in trouble but you know what I believe it the way the Bible and the way this message teaches us that whenever I was born and when you was born that was the seed of God went inside of us hallelujah many of you can fellowship with me on this thought he said there was something in you when you were a little child he said there was things that seemed like it didn't bother other kids but it bothered you what was it it was your representation by predestination oh my when the devil thought he had us and we were so blind and so lost and so wretched but little did the poor old dumb devil know father had projected something down inside of us well I didn't just take the breath of life I took my own bro Hallelujah I took my own predestinated seat like that when I took the breath of life it would lay there I was one year old two years old 3 years old at the age of 12 the spirit of God would start hovering over my heart I remember remember when it happened to me just like it was yesterday I was out at Mom's house my grandmother lived right by us in a house I don't know if I've ever told this public or not but I was out there in the yard and we were little old Reagans man we were redneck young ons I'm telling you what we didn't have high dollar toys we made toys we made our go-karts swung on grap Vines if you ever seen any heathens we was part of the Heathen Clan that's what we were but I'll never forget I was out there catching lightning bugs anybody know what lightning bugs are boy you kids don't know what you missed well you what let me tell you what you do you catch a lightning bug Firefly if you wish to call it that and you drop it down in a jar and then you keep them then what you try to do is get a little piece of thread and you tie around you know them little guys that June bug is a lot easier to tie around their leg but every now and then we'd try them little things you couldn't hardly do it so we got to where we just put them in a half pint clear jar and we draw drop them little lightning bugs down and through there and then we'd walk around on the outside at night and say we had a lantern oh my you kids think you're having fun on the computer all day you think you're having fun on video game you don't know what fun is till you're swinging on a grap fun you're about 10 12 feet high on a grap V and that thing turns loose from the top of the tree and you're really screaming like tarsam and you H the ground oh my and I remember being out there in front of mom's house I never was really afraid well until every now and then Daddy would scare us but I never was really afraid at night we' go out and play and run and carry on at night time like we would at day but I remember been right to her you remember right in front of mom's house and that little old driveway that pulled in and all of a sudden I felt this presence it was my first experience with him Hallelujah I just it's like I walked into something how many's ever experienced it before I just walked into something and and it scared me cuz I never found nothing like it before and it wasn't but a few days after that I started talking to my mama cuz she' went to Revival and got saved little did I know it was my daddy it was my father mother hallelujah oh I got saved in that trinitarian church got baptized and titles you've heard a lot of my story Little did I know what Journey he had for me but that same thing that touched me then I have felt him countless of times since oh my I cannot wait till I walk into his divine presence that day oh hallelujah how many knows what I'm talking about and your experience is just as real to you maybe he met you out in a bar somewhere out in a barn or out in a pig lot wherever it was but brother it was sacred grounds wherever it was cuz there you met God for your first time something has already it the other day and the prophet talking about when he saw that there was a god out somewhere he didn't even know how to pray so he wrote God a letter imagine a man that's fixing to be Elijah and he didn't even know how to pray and he tacked his letter on a tree and then he thought well no I know I've I've seen him come through there he said and then he thought no no I've seen people pray so he went in a little Co shed and he knelt down and he seen a picture and people was holding their hands a certain way and he said sir I I've come to talk to you I'm I'm an awful guy I'm an awful guy and he said sir I I've heard people say you you talk to them and they he said sir can't you understand my language he said well maybe I hold my hands different you imagine a man being so a young man being so blind and so ignorant not even knowing how to pray but he had one of God's seeds in him oh hallelujah it's not all the do gooders and it's not all the holier than thou that Jesus found I'll tell you one thing when we get into heaven we're going to set down by some of the lowest people that ever walked on the earth some of them have been married a half a dozen time some of was so mean nobody wanted to marry him in the first place some of them was so low down there's Bootleggers there's Liars there's adulterers some of them was Hypocrites and Liars come on somebody but the grace of God reached down and got a hold of them and he saved them and he Sanctified them and he filled them with the Holy Ghost and they heard that same voice of Jesus sake come on come up children oh I wish right now I was out in the woods by myself but since I ain't I'll behave and finish my sermon watch this when the trumpet of God shall sound the dead and Christ shall arise waken Come Out of the Dust of the earth Come Out of the Dust of the earth not six foot deep dust it's all he needs no matter where they are now in this the resurrection will be a universal everywhere every creature on the ball of the earth that's in Christ will come forth with him when he comes no matter where they are just think in the days of the early Martyrs when those Christians were thrown in into the lion's den and those lions kill the Christians and eat up their bodies and yet they were scattered their bodies in the wastage of the Lions across a face of theirs you're made up of a substance that's unseen made material unseen made material unseen become visible and God will give that substance back my holy ghost in my body is my Assurance that I'll have one and I'll see him in my flesh job said I'll stand on the last days and in my flesh I'll see God though the skin worms consume me now you take a cell and you break it down from a cell and it comes into a cell in a Cell into an atom and to a MCU wow this sounds like a scientist talking don't it don't you understand this is not from the mind of a Kian this is a man of called called by the spirit of God to break into the original creation of human life Hallelujah come from a cell then a cell and a cell and into an atom and a molecule and on down like that finally it ends up into the Unseen and it goes from a natural something you put your hands on to gases from gases into acids acids into gasses and gases and on back like that till it finally winds up in one little thing and that is spirit and this Spirit who occupied these gases now say you've got gases in your body now element of oxygen nitrogen hydrogen right what is what is water H2O hydrogen oxygen and the Earth itself would be destroyed if God would have allowed it to be so the Earth would have become like our bodies nothing but God stopped that process on the earth and said you can only go this far and the spirit that occupied these gases now listen to this it might not be the same gasing but the features here's what matters friends it don't have to be the same oxygen the same nitrogen calcium phosphorus phosphate on and on and on what matters is the image praise be to God but the features of what you are will be exactly what they are again the spirit has control that I actually had to come through physically Dawn and Betty Reagan I could not have been born into the Arrowwood family nothing against that family probably better family and what I come from maybe you could not have been born a Reagan you could not have been born a Smith or born a McGill cuty or whatever but God put so much brass and so much copper and so much iron in the making of the bell and you had all that had to come together so in the resurrection you're going to look like you did when you was a young man a young woman well you said Brother D you mean oh no don't tell I'm going to look at like a again I'm I was thinking more like a Marilyn Monroe type uh no I don't think you want to look like her I don't think you want to go where she is you see we'll look at things so different the pretty ugly all that sort of thing no it it won't be there no more now watch and in other words when you become a young man or a young woman wow God takes a picture of you Smile everybody so God snapped your picture no matter how old and wrinkled how disfigured whatever it may be it will run right on down through and that body may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up by lines whatever it is but it was made up of gases 16 elements of the earth that was calcium potes petroleum Cosmic light and so forth all goes together to make up the body now no matter the whole Earth is filled with that but now this picture is the main thing now there's always been a book that father has guarded around his throne Satan was right next to him his right-and man to Fellowship he knew a lot of things head of the music department in heaven thy tablets and thy pipes were created in thee the D the day that thou was created so he loved music he still does but there was this this book and papa never would let him get close to it he's never yet to this day even seen page one Papa always guarded it and watched over it it was his family album so in his mind he went he's snapping a picture so where was it at where was it recorded in his mind so he saw every one of us every millions and millions of his elect he saw them oh glory to God can't you see the way he looks at death is so different than us what matters is the picture you see the picture becomes exposed the first light hits it the moment of our new birth it's like the light rays Break Forth from eternity on the seat of God and the exposure just and the image starts taking shape and form so what was it you didn't know I didn't know I still don't know exactly I'm I'm praying oh God help me to to be in your will we all are me Lord I want to be more than you will cuz we know sometimes it'll it'll change you know the Lord will change the direction the way he wants us to go so we're still we're still looking for that but the main thing is is this image this picture so this is why it does not have to be the same dust you see we we think the main thing is this dust oh this is what we touch this is what we love this is what we focused on this is we fellowshipped around and shook one another's hands and cried and prayed for one another and we think this is the main thing no this is not the main thing the main thing is the picture but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and things come right back into place and develops this picture again so for those who are already in the sixth Dimension and their theophany therefore what happens therefore if you've entered into theophany what happens you will bring your theophany to the Earth to pick up your redeemed body you will bring your theophany to the Earth and if you are still here you will take your body to meet your your the offering the resurrection and the Rapture is the developing of the pictures oh thank you Lord God the developing of the pictures that are being brought back into the realm of visibility praise be to God thank you Lord Jesus oh and if these things come right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you was 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best when was it taken before the foundation of the world and it was put in God's Great file now unlike Microsoft and Oracle and all these technologies that we've got in this day you've got a file saved over here and you've got a file saved the pictures over there and my you looked at it this morning and you go back to look at it tonight and it's gone and it says we cannot retrieve your file or your file has been corrupted you say oh no oh no that's years that's years of of of of pictures oh no oh no Satan cannot not corrupt these fils as we know what happened just a couple of weeks ago whenever a certain thing and all the mechanisms tied to Microsoft and all that and Delta could not fly American could not fly and You' heard about it why because somebody in the partnership of their fouls missed it all up so they couldn't do it oh I'll tell you one thing the devil thought he had it all messed up in the garden of Eden he started corrupting what he thought was the image but God kept a Master Copy he s oh Hallelujah he s there in the Garden of Eden boy I have messed up this whole program poor old dumb devil all he done was just work right in the permissive will of God and by every one of those children there will not be a one of them that will not be there that day come on children our our name our looks our identification has kept in the foul of the father there will not be one lost and when God releases those in the sixth Dimension and they come down to the Earth all of the sudden it's just like the instant Kodak pictures you remember them and they go right at the end of it and in a matter of seconds there's the image praise God but you see God knew better than to trust us with selfies so it wasn't me and you it was not me taking my picture or you taking yours he took it Oh Glory let me go a little bit farther can I listen this now the only thing it did was featured it self here for you to make your choice then you become a servant of God him for knowing it it makes him a redeemer as we've been through it then that picture is absolutely this is the negative the negative part of life is where you're living now and anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere if this ain't the POS oh my the real thing this is only a foreshadow the real thing that is to come you got it you got it so I don't care what they would do with you they cannot destroy that profile that picture sir in God's Great Gallery up there thank you it cannot destroy it it's in heaven you could burn it up feed it to the liines do anyway you want to it'll come forth again just as sure as two twos is four just to sure as God spoke it it'll come forth so no matter where you are than and it will happen in a moment and a twinkling of an eye every ready tell you last Wednesday night a moment and a twinkling of an eye at most it's a measurement of time that is so small it cannot be divided quicker than you could do that you'll be changed and the positive will come down and merge into what was the negative and you will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye let me read this to you more close I found these words to today I thought it was so wonderful when God's people begins to get back together there's Unity there's power and whenever God's people get together completely I believe the resurrection will take place then there will be a rapturing time a rapturing Time when the Holy Spirit begins to gather it up it'll be in the minority of course but there will be a great Gathering now in this rapturing time like this there'll have to come a time now that the bride that rejects the head part of the Bride will have to suffer for her rejection now listen to this carefully this shows there will be a people who've been around the message of the hour but before the Rapture they will actually turn against the head part of the message there will come a time now this bride that rejects the head part of the Bride will have to suffer for her rejection don't you see these people out here that's never heard it how can they suffer for their rejection they never heard it there will be an element of people around this message that will come up so far and right before the changing time they will reject it they will polish it up and make the message more presentable they'll take off the prophet's rough edges and you know his vernacular and all that sort of thing and polish it up for the day not realizing that when they do so when they do so they'll stand before God for adding to and taking away from and they will be rejected in this briad time because the gospel wasn't made plain to them back there it's made plain to you today you see it's plain it's done all those years in examples the seals open Church ages laid out everything like that it's so plain you can't miss it then if you fully rejected there's only one thing to do suffer for it Lord children don't set you in this church don't set you under the hospices of the message of the hour and turn it down let's stand together he takes his little boy Joseph down to see the armus day parade and he relates the going home in a similarity to this parade one day there will come a blast From Heaven the dead in Christ shall rise first them Old Testament Saints back Yonder who are waiting Will Blast forth and come out of their first and go into the resurrection and will drop right in line going into the sky now notice the Old Testament Saints will come out first those not included Matthew 27:53 oh my what a time well drop right in line going into the sky these old Mortal bodies be changed made like unto his own glorious body what a parade that'll be when it starts heavenward and some of these days and that rapturing time that lays ahead oh proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ upon their chests the message of God in the hour that they lived in so tell me how can you take a Rapture and not be a part of the message of God for the day you lived in when the word become blood and the word bled for you so when people reject the word of this day they're not rejecting a quote they're not rejecting you know just a message of a prophet they're rejecting Christ Jesus he divided himself his word dispensation so when they rejected Luther's message that was Christ in Luther's day Wesley's message Christ in that day amen tongues gifts restoration and Pentecost that was Christ in that day now the fullness of the godhead bodily has come back under the administration of the son of man they're not rejecting me they're not rejecting you they're not rejecting William random they're rejecting Christ Jesus and his revealed word in this hour the very thing they reject is the very thing we will rise to meet him in ploud proudly displaying on our chest the blood of Jesus Christ the bloody bleeding word dripping blood to wash the briide in and we'll display that on our chest the message of God for the hour we lived him God bless you Saints may God you help each of us we can be ready for that day let's B it if you would oh Father Lord as we all look look back through pictures of ourselves and every now and then somebody will send me something that my sisters or my brother Jamie will put on Facebook and it'll be us as little Reagans and maybe some of our school picturers or whatever more sister lyia Swanson had sent one the other day to Carol it was Brother David and his youngest son Josiah standing there at a certain spot there in Canada 10 years later there both of them were standing Josiah had grown up now a married man brother Dave his hair had turned colors getting some age in his face what a difference 10 years makes but Lord we're so grateful that that real picture is in your gallery thank you Father oh Jesus May every one of us make preparation and plans while those that are turning away from this great word preachers that are polishing it up Lord God I pray that you'd help us to realize it's not the message that needs polishing it's us that needs polishing by the message it's not us that needs to polish it up and made it make it more presentable to the world all but I realize it's always been that way many want to use the message as a springboard for themsel I pray myself nor this church will never turn into such a thing may we preach this message in its Purity and its power Lord God where you can always be among us we know there's one way to keep your Dynamics among us and that is to keep our mechanics straight because if we get off of the mechanics part you will not bless a lie nor will you bless arrogance or Pride so the mechanics is part of what we must do and then you will strike our mechanics with your Dynamics we've been given a promise the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've only worked it in a small measure we're looking for it father we love you

I'd believe absolutely nothing if I didn't believe this truth. I'm so glad God has revealed something to us that's steadfast and sure. &gt;&gt; It'll never fail. The word of God will never fail. Do you believe that with all your heart? Give him another good hand clap of praise. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, it's Sunday morning and we're glad you're here. If we have any visitors with us today, we want to say we welcome you. Glad to have you with us in this service. Trust you just feel right at home. Make yourself at home. We'll be as good to you as you'll let us be. And if we're if we don't, you just let somebody know and we'll have brother D to take care of them. Amen. And to all of our streamers locally and around the world, we want to say we welcome those folks as well. They're part of this service today, too. Let's give all those folks a good hand this morning, if you will. Praise the Lord. Now, look at your neighbor and tell them you're glad to see him in the house of God this morning. Now, some of you ain't glad to see nobody because you ain't said nothing. Look at your neighbor, tell them you're glad to see him in the house of the Lord. It's good to see all of you in the house of the Lord, boys. Journal. Amen. Praise the Lord. Just so good to be able to come to the house of the Lord. God has given us another opportunity to come and worship him in spirit and in truth. Now, I I wasn't able to be here on on Friday night, but I understand it was quite a success, a good turnout, and we want to say all that participated, all that made that happen. Uh you're very much appreciated, and I thank everybody that was here, according to what I've been hearing, they really enjoyed it. And well, we just appreciate the the effort and the work. You know, you stand still long enough, you won't want to do nothing. But if you keep moving and keep going, it'll be all right. Amen. That's why I try to work a little bit cuz I know if I sit down, I'm done for. And you are, too. Don't look at me like I'm the only one. Some of you old people, you're done, too, if you sit down. So, let's all let's all just keep going. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord one more good hand clap of praise. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're going to look at a prayer request this morning. Brother Jim Hughes from Virginia called in need of prayer for he and his family. Also, he's experiencing severe pain caused by a cyst on one of his hands, recovering from a carpal tunnel surgery on the other. Brother Jim's wife's also dealing with severe pain in her legs and hips. Brother Jim's son Brandon has kidney stones that are causing him pain and discomfort. Also, his daughter-in-law named Angie Gentry is dealing with leg pain from a recent surgery. Your prayers are greatly appreciated. So we want to remember those folks today. Brother Terry Stockton says requesting prayer for a nerve block procedure that I have tomorrow at the VA. Also I have an unspoken prayer request for a family member in Kentucky on for on Monday. Really appreciate my church family, brother Terry Stockton. So we just want to commit that unto the Lord. Brother Gary wants us to remember his daughter Paula in prayer suffering from pancreatitis and a lot of pain. So we want to remember Paula as we pray today. Brother Steve Bright says, \"I'm requesting prayer for a kidney stone attack.\" So, we want to remember him as we pray today. Sister Ruth Louise Jax is requesting prayer for her friend Pamela Cook, her granddaughter Elelliana Marie, and Susan Albbright, and her family. She also has an important unspoken prayer request is asking for traveling mercy. So, let's remember that. Sister Barbara Grley had severe pain in the back of her neck. went to the ER, X-ray, CT scan, asked for prayer from brother Donnie, the saints here at the church, and the pain left. She wants to praise the Lord for that. Please pray for brother David Gadman, precious minister for brother Homer Longorius, who had his part of his colon removed. Uh pray that there would be not be any cancer found. So, we want to remember that prayer request. Brother John Taylor and his wife from New York want to thank everyone for praying for their daughter Emily as she dealt with the loss of her husband with the help of the Lord. She is doing much better and they're greatly encouraged. Also that her their oldest daughter has a very close friend that is dealing with uh breast cancer is not responding to treatment well at all. She also suffers from Crohn's disease and some major thyroid issues which prevents her from working. The doctors have given her a poor prognosis, but they are entrusting the great physician to move on her behalf. Thank you for your prayer. So, we just commit that unto the Lord. Uh Fred Walton, stage 4 cancer, and Britney Walton. We'll remember those folks in prayer. Brother Randy sends that in. And today, according to Sister Jennifer, if you if you could, Brother Steve Newsome could receive visitors today. He's in the Sycamore Scholes Hospital, uh, room 313. So, if you could go by and just say hey to him and let him know you're thinking about him, I'm certain that that family would would appreciate that very much. All the unspoken prayer requests, I know there's great needs among us today. Aren't you glad we're serving a risen savior? Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" Let's sing that last verse of that of that song if you will. This weery world with all its toll and struggle may take its toll of misery and stri. The soul of a man, it's like a mighty eagle when it's released. It's destined for the sky. And until my heart will go on singing, thank you, Lord. And until then, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Joy I'll carry on. [Music] Malachi pray. Oh, until the day God calls me home one more time. And until then, my heart will go on sing. Yes, until then with joy we're going to carry on until the day. My eyes behold that city. until the day God calls me home. [Music] Amen. Let's help brother Malachi pray today. Appreciate our brother, don't we? We love you, buddy. Amen. Let's just take these prayer requests to the Lord. Dear Lord, how we thank you once again to come into your house, into your presence, Lord. And Lord, we know no doubt that you're here. And Lord, we can't remember all these prayer requests and the ones that are unspoken. Lord, we have no idea what the needs are here today, but Lord, we're so happy to know that you know every need that's within our hearts, Lord. Even the ones that we don't know how to express off of it, Lord. I just pray that you would just help us, Lord. And we will always give you the glory and praise that you deserve. I pray that you would feel welcome to come here today. May the atmosphere be set for the ministry to come and just be something be said to help us, Lord, in this evil day. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother. Appreciate you, brother. God bless you. Amen. Ushers, if you want to come at this time, we'll receive the morning tithe and offering. Once again, all of you that's here today, we want to say, God bless you. Glad you're here. How many of you enjoyed service your Wednesday night? &gt;&gt; Wasn't the word of the Lord good? It &gt;&gt; was wonderful, wasn't it? Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's sing a song this morning. Won't it be wonderful there? We're having a pretty good time getting there, too, aren't we? Amen. We're living right here in the middle of Satan's Eden, but we're having a good time serving the Lord Jesus. Right. Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" Somebody say, \"Hallelujah.\" Give him another good hand clap of praise this morning. When with the Savior we enter the glory land, won't it be wonderful there? Ending in the troubles and tears of the story land. Won't it be wonderful there? Won't it be wonderful there? Having no burdens to bear, joyously sing with heart bells all ringing.

Though sometimes through weary eyes, I cannot see. So I just say thank you, Lord. And I I won't complain. You know the Lord, he knows what's best for me. Through my tearfilled eyes.

Praise the Lord. What a little angel. Y'all think that when she's keeping you up at five or six hours during the night trying to pray about it, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads together. Dear Jesus, how we thank you, Lord, for another little gift, treasure sent down from heaven. Dear God, I pray today that you would just be with my brother and sister as they embark on this new journey. &gt;&gt; Don't seem like it's been that long ago that they were just a little boy and girl when I first met their mom and daddy. And now, Lord, here they are married and got their own little child. And it's true that time waits on none of us. And Lord, it's it's an honor for us whenever you've committed such to our keeping, but also what an awesome responsibility. Help my sister that she can be exactly what we've been taught in the word, that she's to be that fifth gospel. help my brother to be able to influence his little daughter in the right way. We know that the father's influence upon a girl can have such an impact even on the kind of husband that she will choose, the kind of man that she will look for, the kind of man that will fulfill her dreams. So both of them together, they want to bring themselves, not only their little girl, but themselves with her before you today. I pray, Father, that you'd be with them and strengthen them. I pray for Lily, Lord, that you'd be with her. If she would be able to live and time would go on to where she would know right from wrong. May the spirit of God touch her heart. May her heart be tender toward you, Lord, that she can be able to give her life to you. We dedicate her to you today, Father, for a life of service. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, she woke up about right about when you get done preaching. &gt;&gt; Congratulations, Y'all can just go ahead and tell me whenever I get intolerable and I will step down. I mean, you know, if I put everybody to sleep the way I do the babies. Let's stand together. But until you do, I'm going to go ahead and preach. &gt;&gt; Okay, just long as we had that understanding. Let's turn today to second Peter chapter 1 verse two again. how blessed I have been personally by looking at these great great passages of scripture. Once again, I've dealt with this difference of times, of course, um, in my ministry since I've been in the message, and I've been blessed every time that I've ever looked at it. But I don't mind telling you, I've been so blessed this time because I can see certainly see the need since the last time that I dealt with this to the statue of a perfect man. I knew we needed it then, but as times went on, oh, I realize how much more we need it now. And what's a great thing about it is we don't just need it, we're going to get it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By the help of the Lord. I have that much confidence in him. I can't say I got that much in you or that much in me cuz I know how rotten our old stinking flesh is. But I have confidence in his word. &gt;&gt; He would never put it in his Bible if somebody was not going to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; I figure I'm going to fulfill scripture one way or the other. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to choose the ones I want to fulfill. &gt;&gt; That's right. People's going to go to hell. You want to fulfill that? Not me. There's going to be repbates. You going to fulfill that? Not me. There's going to be children of God. That's the one I want. There's going to be people going to rapture. That's the ones I want. &gt;&gt; So, let's read it together now. And as we read, keep in mind that we are reading from the book that was written by a man that was very flighty, constantly making a fool of himself. Uh Peter was like many of us. The only time he opened his mouth was to change feet. &gt;&gt; And look what God did with him. &gt;&gt; So remember now when we read this, we're not talking about an archbishop or some dascese somewhere, some perfect man that was without fault. But we're talking about a man that had so many issues in his own life. So he's able to write of what God had done in him as well. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given us all things, all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Wow. And here I was taught for years of my life it come through an apple. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us plainly how it came. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and a brotherly kindness, charity. Before we pray today, how many like to be remembered before the Lord, Carol wasn't able to be with us today as we was backing out of the driveway to come to church. She got really sick, nauseated like and um she went back in the house and I just checked on her bit before I come out and she's really not feeling good today really sickly. I believe the Lord can touch her, don't you? &gt;&gt; And all of your needs as well. So, let's just pray together. Heavenly Father, we are so honored today to be in your presence, dear God, to realize that every one of us one day are going to stand before you. I do not want to stand there on my own merits. I do not want to stand there on any works, anything that I could ever do. I don't want to stand before you because of my preaching or because of my hospital visits or anything in this world that I could ever do. I will need the greatest representation that could ever be given to a mortal and it is not our works. I'm so grateful to know that when we stand before you that day that you have made a way for us, Lord. And we believe once the way is made and then we start walking in the way that there's a journey to be completed. And then we know that this is the stature that you're wanting to build in your people. So, Father, as we look into your word today, help us. We know church is is something that's very unique. It's not like going to a store. It's not like going fishing. It's not like going to a favorite pastime to where it's all hoopla and rejoicing and this and that. We do. We do rejoice. Yes. But this is more serious than that. We come, Father, that we can hear our shortcomings, our failures, that we can hear the word of God coming forth as a measuring rod and measure where we are. And by that, we can know where we need to go. So, we're praying you'd help us today. Lord Jesus, I pray for the hands that were uplifted, the needs they signified. Lord, we agree together today that you're going to move for Carol. You see this nausea, Lord, and just so sick that she didn't feel like coming to church today. And as a body of believers, we command that devil to back away from her. Satan, you're a liar. You're defeated in the name of Jesus. bring healing to her body today, Lord. Speak to us your words of life in Jesus name. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, church. You may be seated. It's amazing to me that God would choose such things as he did to be able to add to people's lives that would make them superhuman. Now, having been raised in a home uh whenever I was a kid to where that we had television and I watched all kinds of superheroes. So, there was Batman and Superman and all different ones like that. Maybe many of you saw the same ones or you read the comic books. And isn't there something about us as human beings that we actually look for that type of figure? Someone who is, you know, above and beyond the average person that would be able to be someone that we could all look up to. And we think by them they could go into a telephone booth and change their clothes and come out and solve all issues. and they can come in and save the damsel in distress. And uh you know, you realize that they're not going to get killed because you're only watching part three of a 38-part series. So, you know, they got to live through the rest of it. So, it's not realistic though. It's not They never are going to project, and that's the power of Hollywood, that they want to put something before us. I heard it. I heard it the other day and they were talking about trying to bring some legislation into our nation because they have found out by studies and by relating physical or psychotherapists and different ones that have dealt with some of our youth and this day. and they're hearing it over and over again, especially from young ladies that social media is so affecting their upbringing. It's affecting how they look at others, how they look at themselves. And they're tying the increased um of number of suicides, especially with young girls. And over and over again, as I listened to it, I thought, what a sad thing that we're living. And they are toying around and kind of putting it back and forth before legislators that they would set it at the age of 16 or 18 or whatever more that our our young people would not be able to even have access to the internet and a lot of things like that because they're finding out with psychiatrists and these people that are trying to treat them that it's affecting them in such a negative way. And you think that putting something before people as they are young as I saw a clip yesterday on YouTube and it was in a church, a gospel church so-called and there was a woman sitting on the altar there with the steps and she was the pastor, however that can be since God's word don't ordain it. But she was sitting there and she had a long robe on and and had a wrap around her neck with the the colors of the rainbow. And then they had the rainbows draped up behind it. And they were having a little children's service. And there was another teacher there sitting by her. And she went to the book of Genesis, of course, and talking about God and his great mercy and and God gave the rainbow covenant. And all these little kids were sitting on the first two or three rows. And she asked those little children. Now she said, \"How many knows that there's other symbols that God has used the rainbow for?\" And all them little kids was raising their hand. And she started asking them, \"So what what does God mean for the rainbow to be?\" And you're with these little children now, the size of ours, Sunday school age. And they were answering these perverts as they were sitting there in a denominational church in America and saying gay rights, lesbian, LGBTQ, yo, you know, whatever more all they going to. And I thought if the Lord tries, how many of them will turn out to be just like them perverts sitting there in front of them? Why? This is why Satan wants to not just keep that thing out here in the world. He wants to bring it inside the church. And remember, it was Lot that the Sodommites knocked on his door, &gt;&gt; not on Abraham's. So, Satan knows exactly what it is to put an image before people that they will psychologically attach to that image. And if it ties with something within their soul, then they want to become or at least tolerate that image that they see. So this is why a lot of the churches are having these drag shows as they call it and they're doing it before churches. So they have their fall festivals and all their gatherings and they will have one drag queen after another after another. I wonder how those drag queens will be will be feeling when the angels drag them and hang them over hell and cast them into the lake of fire. Preach it now. Oh, I imagine their drag won't be worth too much then, will you? &gt;&gt; But you see, there's something about it. Satan knows it. He did it years ago in the land of the Canaanites by having them to worship Kimosh. Having them to worship the god sin, having them to worship all the gods and raise their children up under the oposes of that then they would turn out to be even worse than their parents were. So this is in turn why God told the children of Israel, teach your children these principles, these laws, these precepts that I've given them. Why? Because God knew also by keeping that before your children, it can have a great influence on what they become in life. You remember the story that the prophet told us about a family of seven sons and these brothers were raised in the same house and every one of them wind up going to become sailors and they wondered why. And one day walking into the room, someone notices it. And here is this picture on the wall of a frigot or whatever it was, a a naval ship, and they begin to realize it was that influence of those young men that they had that image there projected to them. But you know, God also, he was the original one of course from this. For we know that the Bible tells us in the book of Genesis, in the beginning when God made them, God made them male and female as he created them and he called their name Adam. And God projected the spiritual man that he made in Genesis 1 into a body of dust or clay into the man of Genesis 2. And in the image of God created he them. So God knew there was something about putting an image before human beings that affects their life. Now this is why people want to water down and modify the image of the Lord Jesus Christ in the day we live in. So theologians will get in the pull pit. They'll get on their podcast. They'll do their radio broadcast, television, whatever it is, and they're not only trying to change your image, but they want to change the image of God in your mind. So, they water him down. They weaken him down. And somehow they project to you and I that God was in the Old Testament mean and wicked and God required of a lot of people. But in the New Testament, God got saved and God got rid of rid of his bad old temper and God got so much love and God found so much mercy. So what God told the children of Israel to stone people for which was sodomy. Now God in the New Testament says it's okay. It don't bother me no more. I got I I got saved. I went down to an altar and I give my heart to whoever God would give his heart to and I I got saved. Now I told the children of Israel that if they found a sodomite in their days, put them outside the gate, pick up stones and hit them on the head until dead. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I got saved. So now I'm okay with men, women. I'm okay with gay pastors. I'm okay. Now what do they do? They change the image of God into a man-made image and they start putting it before their people. Now where do them preachers get it at? In some cemetery I I mean seminary that they go to. Oh, aren't you glad your pastor didn't attend such a seminary? &gt;&gt; But then now we don't want to just strike on that negative side. But there is also a positive side to the exact same concept which come of course from the presence of God and that is that we also do likewise but we just don't use the same images but I'm doing the same thing every time I preach to you. I'm putting an image of whatever it is the Lord puts on my heart to bring to you. I'm putting an image before you. Now I can work under both laws of the laws of life and the laws of death of the law of light and the law of darkness. So I will use contrast as any preacher does and I will put before you those who fall and those who didn't follow that image and then I will also put before you the positive side of those who followed in the image, the projected image of what God had for the day and show you both of their end results. And then you have to ultimately choose which path you desire to go. Quite simple, really, isn't it? So, you know, whenever we look at what God is doing, well, brother Donnie, how are we going to know the difference between the bride and the church? That's really not that hard, actually. All we have to do is find the original image of God in his word and then see what preachers and what churches are preaching that image. Well, that's a pretty good answer right there. And that would let you know then whether that church you're attending or that preacher that you're listening to is actually from God or from the devil. Because if he's projecting and changing the image of God, then you know that God is immutable and God is unchangeable in his ways. So you are sitting under a false prophet that's going to damn your soul to hell along with his own because God is perfect. And if we believe that God does not need changing, &gt;&gt; we do. &gt;&gt; Can anybody say amen? &gt;&gt; So now saying of of this word that God wanted Peter to write. Now why did God use Peter to write this instead of Paul? Why did God use Peter to write this instead of John? Peter was not even a prophet. Paul was a prophet of the age and John was a prophet of the apocalypse. But yet Peter was not even a prophet in that sense. And Paul had to actually rebuke Peter. Notice again as we see that instance to where Peter was fellowshipping with the Gentiles. And yet when some of the brothers come from James up at the he was the pastor of the church in Jerusalem. And whenever they come from James and then Peter you know become two-faced. Amen brother Donnie. And Peter kind of pulled away from the Gentiles because he knew that the brothers from Jerusalem would be really offended. Now remember, it's in the transitory time from God just dealing with the Jews only into the merging of the Jews and the Gentiles. And some of the Jews were still having a hard time accepting Gentile brothers on the same basis that they were. Right. &gt;&gt; So Peter when he saw the Gentiles there there and he had fellowship. Oh my praise God eating together and man they'd have church together. He would see the Holy Ghost fall on them just like he did the Jews. He thought this is absolutely awesome. I didn't realize this is what Jesus meant when he said I have sheep which are not of this foe. No doubt different things come back to his mind by the Holy Ghost. But Peter got under peer pressure. Boy don't it happen. And it wasn't peer pressure from drunks and lards and horongers and thieves. It was peer pressure from religious people from Jerusalem which is headquarters. Oh my. Then what did they do when they come around? Peter got underneath that influence and then Peter kind of pulled himself away from them gentile brothers and Paul saw it. Now remember Peter was with Jesus personally. He hunted with him as we'd say. He laid down beside him or near him while there for three and a half years. He ate meals with him. He talked with him. He done all of these things personally. And he could say to Paul, \"You wasn't even there. I was.\" He himself baptized me, never baptized you. Oh, he could say all kinds of things in the flesh. But you know what? Paul realized his position. So Paul actually rebuked Peter in this stage of his journey. Oh my. And said some pretty harsh words to Peter. You know why? Cuz Peter needed it. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to think now of that instance where it's recorded in the scripture that Peter himself had not yet quite attained to the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Woo. Woo. Now, he had the Holy Ghost. He had faith. He had virtue. We saw that going out of him at the lame man that was crippled there. We see that. But Peter was still lacking some things and his walk with God. That gives me hope. &gt;&gt; Does anybody else have hope today? So now then Peter years later, this is coming close to, you know, to the winding up years of his ministry by the time that he writes this. So Peter was like us. He was still a work in progress. And no doubt Peter might have been one of the ones that was a little bit slower, maybe coming along and some of these things of God. Paul was a different type of makeup and his battles were totally different, more intellectual. And when you're that way, you tend to lean back toward the mind. Peter was ignorant, unlearned. You know, he didn't never did battle that thing. But God knew exactly what to put in these building blocks that would cover every saint of God that would live from Calvary to the rapture. I think that's absolutely awesome that God would pick seven great virtues of his own divine nature. Now, I know that you know this as many times as we've read it that that Peter never used casting out devils and Peter never used speaking with tongues or he never used seeing visions or he never used discernment or signs or wonders. Now, I want you to notice that he does not use in that realm of the supernatural those things to be able to make the individual out of. Now, every one of those things are genuine and real, and we believe in them all, don't we? But we also know that most of those are actually bait on the hook in order to catch the fish. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, they speaking in tongues. Of course, that's for the unbeliever. When a man prays in tongues, he's not even supposed to do it in the in the service to interrupt the service because he's edifying himself and not edifying the body. Is that right? So then we know those gifts have their place when they're appropriated, right? But every individual that God would even be able to use in a manner of a gift don't mean that they have the building blocks of this here in in second Peter. So they could be anointed by the spirit of God to prophesy a true prophecy and the spirit of God never fall on them one more time in their life because they don't really have a gift of prophecy. It just fell on them in that service and then the next service it may fall on that person or that person. But this is something that don't don't fall on you and then leave you. This is something that is molded in your walk with God and once you get it, you never leave it &gt;&gt; and it never leaves you. Now let's look again if we can at patience and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience. Let's look at the meaning of the word again. enduring patient continuence, patient waiting, steadfastness in the New Testament, the characteristics of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings. The greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly. I I know we read this but I want to go back to it again if you don't mind in the thy church age this is from the church age book I know your faith now how does he not say here as he did to the church in Pergamos you hold my faith he is not talking about his faith now but he is commending them for their faithfulness I love the way this works that God gives to us a measure of faith and God will require of us that measure of faith to be used in its full capacity. And then there will be things in life that our measure of faith will not attain to. And whenever we're in that time in our life, the spirit of God will come in and adjoin itself to our faith and supplement our faith and carry us right over the tide to bring it to pass. So when the divine sovereignty of God projects a promised word, then the grace of God will also give the strength to carry it through. But that don't mean then that our everyday walk with God is going to be only by the faith of Jesus. We wouldn't overcome nothing if it was that way. But it will be our faith and his faith together. Now notice he said, \"Now faithfulness and patience go together.\" In fact, patience is the outcome of faithfulness. For it says in James 1:3, \"The trying of your faith workketh patience. There is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience. It has to come by the trial of your faith.\" Romans 5:3. Tribulation workers. Patience. How highly God regards the outworking of our patience is seen in James 1:4. But let patience have her perfect work that you won't be. Notice this, that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing. God's will for us is perfection. How many wants to be perfect? &gt;&gt; That is not human sinlessness. That is complete. God's will for us is perfection. And that perfection is patience. Waiting on God and waiting for God. This is the process of character development. And everybody can say, \"Help me, Lord.\" How highly God has commended these saints of the dark ages. Patient as lambs led to the slaughter. Lovingly, faithfully, they serve God. This is all they wanted out of life. Just service to their Lord. How great, oh my, was their reward. I can't wait to see these saints of God as they walked before him on that day. Can you now I want you to think that God is the only one that can be able to bring this measure unlike the realm of the supernatural gifts. Now I you know I I just got to be honest with you. I'm sure I probably don't understand as much about the supernatural realm as a lot of other brothers do but I I do understand maybe a little T90 bit about it. But I do know that Satan can hand out gifts by the handfuls. And I know that Satan actually loves to be able to move in a message of God that he sent down through the ages, all of them, and be able to counterfeit the production or the appearance of supernatural gifts. And the reason he does that is to bring question on the credibility of the real and the genuine. Now, when I'm talking about gifts, I'm not just talking about tongues, interpretation of tongues, signs, wonders, all that. But I'm also talking about gifts of the ministry. So there are genuine pastor, genuine teacher, genuine evangelists, but Satan also loves to impersonate those ministerial gifts. So he has down through the ages and he'll continue to do so. So he will move on men's hearts and they will be totally convinced that they are called of God to be a preacher. And then they will start getting under that load and that burden and oh my, they just absolutely know beyond a shadow of a doubt it's God. And sometimes a learned man, the one that's experienced with divine wisdom can be able to pick it up just like that. Something wrong about that call. So they will be able to see and oh there's something out of cater. Other times you can't. So you just have to let it go. And it may be years, absolutely years before the fruition of that man will come into maturity. And when it does, then you look and say, \"Oh my goodness.\" So this is what this has been about the whole time that this man will be able to carve out a niche in the message of the hour as it's been in every age. and he would be able to eventually pull an element of people as Paul said they're making disciples after themselves. So they're not really leading people to Christ even though that's what they say they're doing. And it what does Satan want to do? He has impersonated many pastors down through the ages. And the church said he has impersonated many prophets down through the ages. Many evangelists. Is that right? Can you preach your brothers? Say amen to that. Now, your brothers here today that's genuinely called of God, you have nothing to worry about because you know you're called and you know that God called you. But this is also a truth that has been down through the ages. And who has caused some of the greatest damage in the message of God down through the age from Pentecost until the end time so-called preachers? But have most of them that's caused such a mess been God called? Absolutely not. Why would God come in to bring hella, destruction, splits, false doctrine, error, this that and the other? God would would would orchestrate a body a move of God. And then God would raise somebody else up from within the same thing and divide and split and separate and make their own group, which is nothing but a miniature denomination is all it is. God would do that. Come on, church. Wake up. Look at the hour that we're living. God would never do such a thing. So he loves Satan does to impersonate God's gifts and then by the impersonation he will cause so much damage. It's no wonder to me that a lot of folks around the message don't believe in preachers because they've been so burned by so many of them. I understand I've been burned by probably more than than a lot of you all have. Believe me. But that does not change my belief in God's word. God's prophet had been no doubt uh took advantage of lied upon everything in the world by preachers more than all of us put together. But it didn't stop him from still believing in preachers. So you can't use that excuse. So what does the devil do? He loves to impersonate them in order to use them to pull away confidence and factual proof by the word of God that God still uses them. And it's the same way with the virtues in our life. So there is a genuine faith from God. Then there is a human faith that people can have and believe God's promise by their human faith. Human virtue, a divine virtue, a human knowledge, a divine knowledge. Every one of these virtues have a twin. And the prophet said, \"Call them naturiven.\" So they were naturiven. How many of you know some good Baptist people that you work with and Nazarene and all kinds of good people as we call them? And yet, do they have some patience? No doubt. And you look at some of them and you say, \"Man, a lot. They got more patience than some of the people I go to church with.\" Boy, they're nicer than some of the people I go to church with. Well, the main reason you're saying that is cuz you ain't never rubbed their hair the wrong way. If you rub it the wrong way, it'll be like an old cat that comes up to you. Now look, all y'all can like cats and you can have 47 of them in your house if you do. But they know I don't like them and they'll come straight to me every time I get in the presence of one. They'll come right to me and go to rubbing yourself. It sends chills up my back. I'm telling you what, they'll pur and look at me. You know, I hear a growl. I don't hear that pur thing. But you realize that's what it is with a lot of people. and you only know him at certain level and you're rubbing them on the back. Oh, nice kitty kitty kitty. I don't get the kitty kitty view. I get the real view. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But does that change then that there's not a real faith? It does not. It's the same way with patience. Now, real true patience, it will grow like all these other virtues. And don't think that it's inside of you that when you first get it, oh my, it's full grown. No. Patience can be in every Holy Ghost fil child of God in this service today, but it can be at different levels. So as it is being tried and it comes to this stage of the trial, it grows, it puts on more muscles as we would say, and it's developing and maturing. But the same God wants is to where each of these virtues are matured in your life. But your level of patience may be different from the person sitting beside you. And your mature level may be different as well. No doubt I'll never have to have the maturity of these things that a lot of great brothers have. I'm not a great brother. I just want to be saved myself. Me and greatness ain't nothing really in common about me and greatness. No, I never has been, never will be. But what I desire to be is the measure that God has ordained for me. You understand? Now many of you ley you'll never attain oh if I can just wind up like brother so and so and brother so and so that ain't nothing but a trick of the devil for you to get the wrong image before your eyes and that's what you're looking to and you look at this church oh man this is the perfect church in the message there are no perfect churches in the message oh this brother here he's a perfect preacher there are no perfect preachers in the message &gt;&gt; come on look at every New Testament church and how The epistles were written to those churches. I'd like to take every one of them sometime. The Lord lets me live long enough. I'd like to take every one of them letters in the New Testament where Paul wrote to them and also in the book of Revelation and show you those same things have lived repeatedly over and over again for the last 2,000 years. I guarantee you that today I could take every one of them letters and find people in our assembly and those who stream and claim this as their home church and find traits and characteristics of the church at Ephesus of the church at Pergamos of the church of Thotyara of Thessalon Church on and on and on. Why? These are not just pretty books in the Bible. It is prophetic from God. God chose certain churches. Don't get in your mind. These were the only churches that he addressed. There was all kinds of other churches by the time the book of revelation was written. It's 96 AD. So there was all kinds of churches under different names. But he selected certain churches that had traits about them that would be suited for prophetic type a symbol. So what is the book of revelation? When we look at the church ages, what is that? It's an image set before us. Do this and don't do that. do this and don't do that. You understand? &gt;&gt; Now, when we look at this, then God, now keep in mind Luther Luther could never stand in the full stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Wesley could not stand in the full stature of a perfect man. Pentecost could not stand in the full stature. &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute, brother Donnie. Now, how how how so some of the people in our church that have already passed and went on and you're just now preaching some of this stuff. What about them that went on before you started preaching this stuff? Our father will supplement and take care of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You worry about yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Ain't none of his going to be missing on that day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you. I've watched many saints in our church pass and been around them in their final days and watched things transpire. I had a situation that happened to me several years ago and it was a brother that's been gone now for a few years and oh it was a man that I had such awesome respect for and still do. great brother in the Lord and been here for a long long time. And as he was coming close to to passing over, maybe just a week or so before he actually crossed over. And he he I I went to visit the brethren. Whenever I did, there was this person there and that person there, another person, and he said, \"I want everybody to leave but brother Donnie.\" So, okay. So, everybody left. And he said, \"Brother, come here.\" He was he was in the bed and he couldn't get up and he said took me by the hand. He said, \"Brother Donnie,\" he said, \"I I I said something against you years ago.\" And he said, \"I I I didn't understand what you was preaching about this and preaching about that.\" And he said, \"I should have already made it right, but I guess I just had too much pride.\" And he said, \"My brother, I want you to forgive me. Will you forgive me?\" I said with all of my heart. It wasn't but a few days he was gone. I've seen and heard things like that for decades. Now what was God doing? Completed. Now I knew that brother for years. I never even knew this sort of thing. I didn't need to anyway. I mean the important thing was he needed to make it right before the Lord. Now you saying whatever is lacking. But brother Donnie, what if I go out today and I go through the drive-thru and I order a hot dog and they get me a chicken leg and I lose my temper and then I go down the road and I get killed. God knows how to take care of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If Jesus had to drive through the drive in this day, he might get a little bit upset and bothered too. &gt;&gt; One of my granddaughters told me the other day learning how to drive. They say, \"Poppy, I can't wait to pull up to the driver and just give me what you going what you want. You're going to anyhow.\" But there's something about the time that we live. And the closer we get, friends, it's no wonder you feel like sometimes you can't even have a same thought in your mind. Look at Israel and keep them in tight. Look at what's going on the land of Israel. They are being bombarded and it will change from one thing to another. Just not long ago, it looked like that Iran was going to wipe them off the map. And look at Iran today. What happened in a little while? Look at Syria at the the fall of the Assad regime. And what happened there? They were building up arms. Building up arms. And did it work out then where Israel could have great peace? It only changed from one thing to another. Now look, the UK is wanting to recognize a Palestinian state. the German chancellor want to recognize a Palestinian state and different countries are wanting to start arms embargo against Israel. So it's like it comes down on one side and it starts on another side. Can anybody relate? So you get through one problem of life and you say, \"Woo, thank God that was close.\" And then you get through that and you get about 45 minutes of break maybe if you're lucky. And then something else happens. And then you get through that and something else happen. But the problem of it is sometimes you don't get through this before something else does happen. And then you get that took care of and something else. Don't you understand why? And you saying, \"What's wrong with me?\" There's nothing necessarily wrong with you. It's the hour we're living. It's an hour of tension. It's an hour of trouble. It's an hour of anxiety. And as Satan is following and pressuring the bride, so is he Israel because the transition time from the bride to the nation of Israel is so close. It's so close. He's working both parallel at the same time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So we say, God, I want patience. Oh God, I need it so desperately. Could you have it overnighted to me? Oh, you know what? Even better than that, having it a package at home when I go in after church. God said, \"No, I don't do that. I'm still doing the same slow aging process.\" So God, when it comes to making patience and these virtues, it's like he can be like the sloth, &gt;&gt; the three-toed sloth. That was a yawn, in case you didn't know. Just takes them so long. And we are a nervous wreck. Oh, I'll tell you one thing gets on my nerves as a stuttering preacher. I just want to say, would you sit down and please let somebody say it? I can say it. God don't stutter. But he just goes, \"Has your patience today, don't he?\" He don't need lying to him because he knows anyway. I mean, I might lie to you. You might lie to me. We might lie to one another. We shouldn't do it. Oh, I'm I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. But he knows. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows I need help with mine. &gt;&gt; All these virtues. I want more. Don't you have any of these? I have all of them. I said I have all of them, &gt;&gt; but they vary in size &gt;&gt; from raisin to M&M's. How I'm longing for the day when every one of them be about the size of a monster pumpkin? You ever see them great old big pumpkins they raise, you know, wow, that's my image of a perfect man. But that may not be who I am at all. My maturity may be no bigger than a cantaloupe. And there will be all seven of them in my life. And right now I feel like a little tiny bud. I'm still a cantaloupe or I'm still a watermelon. Whatever I am, I'm I'm right there. And the same with you. And some of you are long and you think there's something there's something wrong with me. I I don't have the Holy Ghost. That's what it is. I don't have the Holy Ghost. and you're waiting until you get into the stature of a perfect man before you got the Holy Ghost. What if you can get that without the Holy Ghost? What do you need the Holy Ghost for? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise the Lord. Let's skip a couple there, brothers. Let's go over to taking sides of Jesus. Now, the opposite of patience is impatience. I'm sure most of us today is like a tandem truckload when it comes to patience. Ain't it? I know some of us are taking signs of Jesus. I believe that all these things has a time of lingering waiting. But it's waiting for a time for the scripture to be fulfilled till everything gets right, everything in order, waiting. Many times we get impatient or patient rather and then says impatient like a child great anticipations and many times we jump ahead &gt;&gt; that just hinders the work &gt;&gt; until the work gets caught up. See, we must move more reverently, have a purpose in the heart that God, if he would desire to use us in such and such, but wait till he makes the opening cuz he has to go ahead of us. &gt;&gt; Now, that's so with preachers. That's so with every aspect of the five-fold ministry. And that's so not only with preachers, but with you all looking for your vocation. Lord, what I want to do, oh, I've always wanted to be a nurse. Oh, I've always wanted to be a doctor. Oh, man. I've always wanted to be this, that, and the other. And then you go to taking six, you know, six months or six years of school and whatever it is, and you realize, I hate this. Who in the world taught me into this? I cannot believe I ever wanted to take I wanted to be this. Now, you think how many of us have wasted years of our life because we did not go to God and said, \"God, please help me, but brother Donnie, I'd rather do something even if it's wrong.\" You're crazy. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you understand how long it can take you to try to ever fix a month's worth of wrong? &gt;&gt; What's this? A year. &gt;&gt; You remember David going to battle that night. He was weary about that fight. Laid there on those malberry trees until he heard the Lord and the rumbling of the leaves going before him. Then he went with courage because he knowed that God had gone before him. And if we only do that, brethren, knowing that the battle must come, but we must wait till we see the hand of God going before us to make a way. Now, I want you to notice, look at the service Wednesday night. I told you there was a time to rush and there's a time to wait. Now, if Rebecca would have tried to apply this right here, she'd have never made the bride. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; notice patience. I love this in shalom. Patience. Some of us get so some of us gets in such a hurry. I think many a good man has done that. You get in too too much of a hurry. You want to you want to see you do it yourself. Minister, brethren, you know from what I'm talking and you just take and listen to this tape. I'm talking to you, not only the little congregation here, but men around the world. Many men go out impatient but believing that the time is near. &gt;&gt; Well, if the time was near in 1964, we're already in 2025. So, if preachers would become impatient in 64, imagine how impatient they would be. genuinely called ones in 2025 and they think if I'm going to do anything for God, I've got to do it. I've got to get out. Oh, I want to help people. I want to I want to reach. Oh, I've got to do something. I've got to do something. I've got such a burden, such a burden. And now, what what can I do, Lord? What can I do? &gt;&gt; You realize what a dangerous state it is for a man when he gets there? &gt;&gt; Cuz if he's not careful, his zeal will drive him straight out of the will of God. Why? Not the right time. And it's evident by the way he's acting. He don't have the proper knowledge to handle what he thinks he can do. Well, I realize I'm going to have to preach today and say amen and ouch and oh me and everything. I'm going to be wore out when church is over. It's hard to play multi characters, you know, at the same time. Oh my. Wait upon the Lord. Patience is a virtue. If you can have patience, it's virtue. They that wait upon the Lord, not they that try to get ahead of the Lord. They that try to tell the Lord, \"Lord, I know you want me to do this.\" &gt;&gt; Glory to God accent it, you know, with a little glory to God. That makes it more spiritual, I suppose. Lord, I know you want me to do this. As a preacher preached at our church one time, he heard a little something in our church that he didn't like. Wasn't from me. It was just something, you know, amongst the people. When he gets up, he says, \"I told the Lord, if I ever get to preach at this church again, I'm going to deal with this. I wanted to make a lasso out of the microphone cord and rope him like a two-year-old calf, flang him down on the pull pit, tie both hands and feet, and have the deacons throw him out. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Cuz I realized he didn't have a lick business being up there in the pullpit, although he preached for decades. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are going to tell God sir. &gt;&gt; Now come on. Some of you ley don't jump on that preacher back cuz some of y'all do the same thing with your life. &gt;&gt; There's more of y'all than there is me. I better get behind this pull pit right now. &gt;&gt; Premen. &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord. I know you want me to do this and glory to God. Don't do that. He says wait upon the Lord. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. God took thousands of years to fulfill his promise of a coming savior. But remember, he noted it all the time when it was coming. There were many people rose up and tried to be &gt;&gt; Messiahs. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? There was more Jesus's &gt;&gt; in the days of the Lord Jesus than just one. &gt;&gt; You realize that the historians say whenever Pilot when he stood before him and Jesus was on one side and Barabus on another that Baraba's name was also Jesus. &gt;&gt; So which do you want? He said in the Aramaic Jesus the king of the Jews or Jesus Barabus. Oh my goodness. Both of them seem like troublemakers. Both of them seem to be bad type of characters depending on who you would ask. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wonder if it's not going to be closer than we think. &gt;&gt; Do we want Jesus Christ the revealed word &gt;&gt; or do we want a Jesus Messiah wannabe? God help us. Now watch this and hear you him. A group of Methodist brethren just received the Holy Spirit came to my church where I used to pastor talking about the tabernacle there and they was great men lived up in Indiana and they said, \"Brother Brandham, we've received the Holy Ghost and we've been reading some books.\" I guess it depends on the books you're reading, right? said, \"Should we wait on the Lord and seek the Lord to tell us our ministry?\" And I said, \"Don't do it at all.\" Whoa. &gt;&gt; He said, \"Well, the book said, I said, but wait a minute, brother. If you ever take men that's so zealous that they want to always be doing something, God couldn't trust that person. If you'll notice in the Bible, the man that God used was a man that was trying to get away from all of it. &gt;&gt; That's the one that God used. Say for instance, Paul, Moses, and so forth, trying to run from the very cause? You mean to tell me that a man can have a desire just to help the people of God? &gt;&gt; A woman can have a desire. So she thinks she's called to preach because she just feels for the needs of the people. &gt;&gt; She just feels it so bad. The Bible gives her no no scripture to preach, but she's just overwhelmed by this burden. &gt;&gt; I've heard a few women preachers that could actually outreach men. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Notice this. If a man's got to give man to do a certain thing and he was so zealous of it, the first thing you know, he'd be so swelled out. But if a man doesn't want to do such, maybe God, now listen to this pitiful rendering of this equation. Maybe God can use him for a while in hell. Do you understand our God which can do anything and everything? One of the hardest things that he can do is to find a man that he can use. And if a man's ministry will grow and grow and his effect and his name and his personality and whatever, &gt;&gt; and if he's not careful, his pride and his arrogance &gt;&gt; will grow right with it. And the next thing you know, he wants to become a god or an angel. I'm quoting you a quote. Question answers 1959. He wants to become a god or an angel to the people. But if God can find a man that he can use him and the more he uses him, the littleer he gets. And the more he uses him, the littleer he gets. How many men that God used down through the ages that he was able to use him the entire expanse of their life? How many of them when they got older didn't get off here with women or here with money or here with popularity? How many of them run the full course? &gt;&gt; Look at Noah died a drunk. &gt;&gt; Look at Moses got cut off because of his temper. I hope and pray to God if God ever sees me getting off in some stupid something another. I pray he'd take me right before you this morning. I never want to lead God's children astray or bring reproach on this word. But let me tell you something, that ain't just so with a preacher. It ought to be so with every deacon. It ought to be so with every trustee. It ought to be so with every man, woman, boy, and girl. Come on. It's easy for us to point our pre our finger preacher, but let's point it right back to you as well. There's been way more leoty that's done that than there has been preachers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Because we like these materials in our souls that we were motivated by this inward nature of these stones. And each one runs right into the other. It's amazing to me how God can use something so structurally sound and solid and make it so fluid that it blends right into the next one and it all parallels and vulcanizes into one structure which is totally inseparable. This is the perfect man, the perfect preacher, the perfect woman. And you will never see one of them. Never. As long as you're looking with this right, &gt;&gt; cuz this is the phenomenal thing about it. They will be a perfect work in their soul and their humanity will still be so flawed. And you'll look at their humanity and say, \"Well, another one bites the dust. Well, this one ain't no good.\" Well, he got upset. Well, I don't guess there's anybody going to be that. God never put this image before us if somebody wasn't going to get it. I ask you this morning, word of life, is there anybody at this church that's going to attain to this image of the living God? I ain't just talking about preacher but men, women, boys, girls, teenagers. What about you young people? Is there any teenager in this church? Is there any young boy that said, \"Lord, that's what I want to be more than anything else in this world.\" Are there any young sisters here today that said, \"Lord, that's what I want to be. I want to be a full daughter of God with this image of God inside of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, notice the prophet said if you just if he can just get something out of him. But man that usually wants to go and blast over the world and tear it down, usually God can't trust him. He wants to do it himself. He wants to get into it his own way with it. And if a man don't want to go, then God almost has to drive him into it. That's the type of man that God usually uses in the scripture. And I said, \"Now, this is a prophet's advice to men that are coming asking him about their ministry. I said you just live for him &gt;&gt; and love him &gt;&gt; with all your heart &gt;&gt; and he will place you in the place that he desires &gt;&gt; thank you Lord &gt;&gt; for you to be &gt;&gt; so you don't seek your ministry you don't seek your gift &gt;&gt; you seek him &gt;&gt; and it makes you so in love with him that if he wants you to do something he's going to have to make you do it anyhow believe me I've run into a lot of preachers down through the age and Oh, you know, I'm I don't know if I'm one called to preach or not. I don't want to do it, brother Donnie. I don't want to do it. And you come to find out they done got 32 sermons studied out and ready to preach and wait for somebody to ask them and sitting right there lying to you. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. But God himself knows their heart. What are you doing studying it out for? If you don't want to do it, come on, somebody. Well, you want to go before the Lord and say, \"Lord, just whatever you want me to do. If you don't want me to do nothing but come to church and give brother Donnie an amen.\" I know brother Donnie would appreciate amens. Brother Donnie would appreciate amen. Oh, praise God. Lord, if you don't want me to but clap my hands and say, \"Preach it, man of God.\" And every now and then when I get beside myself and wing a buck, I'll stand up and say, \"Glory.\" Brother Donnie will come too and then we'll go on with the service. Israel was so impatient with God. 1st Samuel 8:4, all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel and to Rama and said unto him, \"Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways.\" Really? &gt;&gt; So, we have a prophet of God who had sons. and they wasn't walking according to the ways that their daddy taught. &gt;&gt; Everybody call 911. We're going to need them quick. &gt;&gt; Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, \"Give us a king to judge us.\" And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, \"Hearken unto the voice of the people, and all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them.\" &gt;&gt; So Samuel was taking it so personal. He just feels put out by this. And God said, \"No, it's not that they're rejecting you. They are. They are. But the most consequential one is me. They're rejecting me. &gt;&gt; But how are they rejecting God?\" Through the message of the day. &gt;&gt; They're rejecting the word. &gt;&gt; They've rejected me that I should not reign with you. Imagine almighty God was out among them reigning over them. But how was he reigning? Through a prophet's voice. All right. Glory. &gt;&gt; But they didn't want to be reigns or a prophet's voice. &gt;&gt; They wanted a two soul king &gt;&gt; or a return ministry king &gt;&gt; or a seven thunder king. Woo. But we going to get into something here. Somebody would preach with me a little bit. They wanted a king, a man that could be among them and be a socialite, you know, and do all this and that and the other. and they could go up and just talk with him and hang around with him all the time and fellowship with him. They wanted a man that they could look and say, \"There's our king like all the rest of the nations.\" Well, you put a few more letters in front of that and you'll find out the parallel of where we are in this day, denominations. As the nations were the parallel in the Old Testament, so the denominations are the answering to that in the New Testament. And that's why we are against a man-made religion. God never chose bishops to rule his church. God never chose a headquarters to say do this and do that. He called men filled with the Holy Ghost anointed by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And that's God reigning through the ministry &gt;&gt; preaching the word. &gt;&gt; Every man, woman, boy, and girl with the king on the throne of their hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Let's read verse eight together. And according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. Now, God told him in the preceding verse here, \"They're not rejecting you. They're rejecting me.\" And then God turns right around. Why? Because Samuel had it out of proper cannon just a bit. He had it out of sequence. God places himself on top and then brings Samuel down under him. He said, \"As they've rejected me, listen again. According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, where would they have forsaken me and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.\" Can't you see what happens when folks leave God's anointed prophets message? &gt;&gt; Some of them will pick another preacher over them. &gt;&gt; Others will pick businessmen. &gt;&gt; Remember, the children of Israel didn't just always want a king. As a matter of fact, when they was going to pull away from out from under the ministry of Moses, they said, \"We will find a captain.\" &gt;&gt; They got tired of that prophet stuff. &gt;&gt; So, they wanted a military man, &gt;&gt; an educated man. Give us a captain &gt;&gt; that'll lead us back to Egypt. That's the way they wanted to leave the message &gt;&gt; by a captain, a leader of men that would lead them back to Egypt. &gt;&gt; Follow your leader if that's what you wish. &gt;&gt; But you make sure of this. You make sure your choice that you're fully looking at it clearly. Captains out from under the oposes of the message of the hour will lead you to hell. &gt;&gt; Pastors will &gt;&gt; that pull out from under the influence of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many times old Lot relived his choice. Oh my friends, don't you want to be what God wants you to be? &gt;&gt; Humble, small, little, insignificant in our own eyes, what difference does that make? Really? If we could do something, you imagine if we lived our lives and one soul was helped along life's journey. One soul was helped, maybe not even saved. Maybe you didn't even leave them to the Lord, but they was at a point of breaking point in their life and God used you to encourage them. &gt;&gt; You imagine what your reward will be through eternity. And Jesus said, \"If you only give them a cup of cold water, &gt;&gt; just a cup of cold water, you'll have a great reward in heaven.\" A cup of water. It's amazing how we devalue things that are so valuable and put such value on stupid stuff, &gt;&gt; wealth and this and that and the other. &gt;&gt; People will devalue truths for the sake of money. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Some of you brothers in your business back and forth and all this that and the other and I know it, you know, it can get tough among you, but I'm asking you brother something. Is your business worth lying for? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you have to run one another down and and spread lies and things on one another in order to get more business and get bigger this and that? And you honestly think God can bless you &gt;&gt; in that way. Cannot we be Christians in our business if we can't? You need to get another job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If your business is turning you into a liar, &gt;&gt; uhoh. Did you attend the the work fair here Friday night? Maybe you ought to be more serious. &gt;&gt; Don't lying matter no more, children. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how many people I find that lie. &gt;&gt; Preachers that lie &gt;&gt; get caught in certain situations and lie to your face. And some of them you think hung the moon. &gt;&gt; Oh, but it don't matter no more, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Really? Are you sure? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You mean lying matters? &gt;&gt; Being dishonest matters? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody among us that can still say, \"I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I messed up. &gt;&gt; I said this wrong. I did that wrong.\" &gt;&gt; Does it even matter anymore? &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; It does. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, it really does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, good. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm glad to hear you say that cuz I believe it does, too. &gt;&gt; If this message does not produce people of integrity, character &gt;&gt; above this out here, &gt;&gt; what better are we? &gt;&gt; Why bear the reproach? &gt;&gt; That's right. But it will, my brother, sister. &gt;&gt; Remember, this ain't my standard. This is not William Brandham's standard. &gt;&gt; This is God's standard. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wonder, was no one looking around today? Have you put a king over your life? Have you chosen a king that would dictate to you and rule you and it's replaced king God? I don't mind telling you his ways aren't always easy. Oh, no. I'd be lying to you to say that. His ways can be difficult. Sometimes he moves in ways we just don't understand. But we trust him even when we don't. But give me him any day over any other king there is out there. How many like to be remembered today? May the Lord just search each of our hearts. Search mine, Lord God. Let's just make sure, friends, that we've not placed any king above our God. For you see, the Lord went ahead and told Samuel to give them what they wanted. It wasn't his will. Be careful what you pray for. Be careful what you get in your mind as God because you may be moving into a permissive will that'll throw you out the will of God for years if you ever recuperate from it. Heavenly Father, I know these sermons I've been preaching lately are serious. They're they're they're soulsearching. But Lord, I believe myself it matches the time we're living. What good Lord would it do us if we just have a bunch of emotion and jumping up and down and singing and hollering and we thank you for all that? It has its place. But Lord, whenever we stop jumping, we want our feet to hit the ground. We want a life that is your prophet preached it, is your life worthy of the gospel? What a title. Is your life worthy of the gospel? So the title itself conveys to us this title is not for sinners, but it's for people professing Christianity. people professing they are disciples. Lord Jesus, like Peter, I admit to you today, I need more growth, more maturity in my life. By the time Paul rebukes Peter, he had already had supernatural miracles. Phenomenal, phenomenal things you had done through the man, but he was still lacking in its character. It's easy to see, Lord, some of the emphasis that we've gone and the direction we've taken the last few years, it's more on the supernatural, so-called. And yet, for those who might differ with some of those, it's going in that direction, if you don't go along with them, they write you off and you're dead, and you don't believe in a move of God no more. and they cut you off, have no more fellowship with you. So is that brotherly kindness, Lord? Is that patience? So it shows once again the same devil that's moved down through the ages is moving right among us. It's easy to see why we're not already gone. Father, help us today. Lord, forgive me Jesus of any shortcomings, any faults, any flaws. Help me, Lord, that I can grow and grow into that stature above perfect man. I'm so glad with you that every day is a new beginning. I'm so glad that our failures of yesterday and last week are not what will dictate our future. For every morning, your mercies are renewed. Oh, we love you, Jesus, with all of our hearts. Anybody here can just raise your hand and say, \"Lord, be mindful of me today.\" Maybe you look at the map of where you are and you look at the image that I've put before you today and said, \"Boy, I got some growing to do. I need some more changing in my life.\" You ought to be so happy that you can recognize it. Think of it, friend. We're living in a time when millions of people are walking on the earth with reprobate minds. They no longer know right from wrong. You could put right before them and they wouldn't even recognize it. So you're blessed even have a thirst, a desire. You're blessed to stand right here this morning and raise your hand and say, \"Lord, remember me. Remember me, Lord Jesus. Don't let us leave this world until the requirements of God have been met in our life. For we know this is not the end of us. We know, Lord, there's a resurrection coming. In order to be in that resurrection, we must be included in the body. And we know this is why Luther could not raise on their own. The Methodist age could not raise on its own because they were lacking so many things. They without us cannot be made perfect. But Lord, you're going to complete a body on the earth. I don't know how many there will be, but it will be enough. Praise God. And whenever they reach that state of maturity, the resurrection will take place and you will have capped off the entire church ages as the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes at the very top. Then Lord, it will cap off the ages Lord. And we know, oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. The re the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost. Lucer had a portion of the Holy Ghost. Wesley had a portion of the Holy Ghost. Pentecost had a portion. But this is the evening time for the token, the fullness, the attribute of the fullness of God to return back on the earth again in the last days to cause a resurrection. Oh Jesus, don't let it one of us walk out of here today. Men, women, boys, girls, may we search our hearts. We've been in the message for 40 years, 50 years, however long it's been. May we open our lives before you today. Search us, oh Lord God. Search me, Jesus. Put me up on the scale of your word, my father. May I not compare myself to a Baptist preacher. May I not compare myself to a Catholic priest or the pope, cuz comparing me to them, it would certainly make me look better as far as scripture by scripture. But I don't want to compare me to them. That's not the image I have before me. The image I have before me is you. So every time I look at you and I look at me, I see so much wrong and so much flaws. Oh Jesus, anoint my eyes with your eyes. I have help me to get the proper balance of my sight spiritually to see the work and progress is divine. But the human element is still human and will never be perfect. Would you come through this building today, Father, and anoint our eyes? What's your eyes of recognition? Your eyes sav understanding for we could open our eyes and see something and say, \"I see it, but I don't understand it.\" It's because the way we're perceiving it. Anoint us today, Father. Oh, hallelujah, Lord Jesus. We worship you today, Father. Mold us, Lord. Shape us, oh God, into that which pleases you. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Can we just worship him a little bit now? How many believes with me now? This is the promise of God. This is the word of God. And we by God's grace are going to come to that promise. &gt;&gt; He can only do for us in heaven as we confess that he's doing it on earth. And I'm going to confess it this morning. Every elect member and our church, not only ours, but the churches all around the world will attain &gt;&gt; to this image out here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Word of Life Church said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; And I just happen to believe I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Do you believe you are? &gt;&gt; And what you going to believe? You're going to believe your shortcomings and your faults, or you going to believe that you're identified with a promised word &gt;&gt; for this hour? &gt;&gt; We're there and sing something. Let's worship him together a little bit, can we? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you appreciate the Lord today? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. We love you, Jesus. Let him pour a little bit of oil and wine now and kind of minister to us a little bit before we go. We worship you, Jesus. Remember brother Wayne Lawson and myself this week, Brother Joe Green's meeting starts on on Tuesday. Brother Wayne Tuesday, myself Wednesday, Brother Wayne Thursday, myself Friday, then I'll be back with you on Sunday, Lord willing. But remember in the meetings there, missionary meetings. So there'll be lots of brothers from overseas, all different parts of the world would certainly appreciate your prayers. Let's just worship the Lord a little bit now before we go. &gt;&gt; I need more of you. &gt;&gt; Oh, we do. Jesus, everybody now, &gt;&gt; that's the way it's got to be. &gt;&gt; Make it a prayer to the Lord Jesus this morning. I need more of you. &gt;&gt; More of you, Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Till there's no room left in me. &gt;&gt; All those wasted hours and minutes. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; They're yours now. &gt;&gt; Yours now. &gt;&gt; From the start to the finish. I need more. &gt;&gt; I need more of you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Everybody now with all your hearts for there is. Sing it with all your heart. &gt;&gt; I need more of you, &gt;&gt; more faith, more virtue, more knowledge, more temperance, more patience, more godliness, more brotherly kindness. the way it's got for the capstone. &gt;&gt; I need more of you just for Jesus till there's no room left in me. Hallelujah. All those wasted hours and minutes, they're yours now. From the start to the finish. I need more of you. &gt;&gt; More of you in me. Everybody, oh Lord, I need more of you. Thank you, Jesus. That's the way it's got to be. I need more of you till there's no room left in me. Oh, all those wasted hours and minutes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yours now from the start to the finish. I need more of you in me. Oh, I need more of you. That's the way it's got to be. I need more of you till there's no room left in me. All those wasted hours and minutes, they're yours now. From the start to the finish, I need more of you in me. Oh, I need more of you. That's the way it's got to be. I need more of you till there's no room left in me. All those wasted hours and minutes, they're yours now. From the start to the finish, I need more of you. [Music] Our sister's a teacher at school and I know we have some more teachers in in our church as well. If you'd like to come up and we'll pray for you all as well. Um, I I've talked to some of these teachers and they've told me some of the things that they have to deal with and they have to hear and even with such small children, it's it's just unbelievable the age that we're in right now and what they're going through. &gt;&gt; So, it puts them in a real a real difficult spot. I want you to think about it. Most of those kids at school will never see me. They'll never see the rest of these preachers. This might be the only Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's true, brother. &gt;&gt; That they see &gt;&gt; and they have to be so careful in what they say and how they say it. We're not living in the same America it was when some of you all went to school &gt;&gt; where the teachers could say this and that. But Justin, God bless you, buddy. Glad to have you all back home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Dear God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; as these sisters and this brother stand before you today, Lord, &gt;&gt; I cannot imagine what all they see and what all they hear and what all they have to deal with, Lord. Lord God, I pray for strength for them. And I pray that you'd help them, Lord. They can't really preach to the kids as we'd say and forbidden to say so much anymore. But I'm asking you, Lord, that should be with them. Lord God, how many of these kids Lord don't know hardly anything Lord having le having worked with it a little bit, being a teacher's aid and some of the things that she had tell us is just heartbreaking. Lord, I pray the spirit of God would be with them. Lord, may they see Jesus. May they see Jesus be lifted up. &gt;&gt; May they know that there's a difference in the lives of these children, of these teachers rather. May the spirit of God help them. Lord, may they be a light. May they see Jesus through them. May they be able to recognize that there is a better life than maybe their mom and their daddy are trying to offer them. Father, would you be with them? Give them strength. Lord, you told us, \"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven.\" I pray for them today. Lord God, in the name of Jesus, may the spirit of God anoint them. Give them strength. Give them wisdom. Help them. Father, I pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless y'all each of you. Praise the Lord. Pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. [Music] Our sisters wanting us to pray for these children. Maybe maybe all of you children that go to school, if you'd like to come up and gather around here, we'll pray for you all as well. Maybe our school starts at different times. maybe in a week or so or two weeks or whatever. But if you'd like to come, we'll be glad to pray for each of you, too. We'll wait on you. So, I'm coming up out of the mezzanine there. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know what it was like whenever I was a Christian going to school and laughed at and made fun of. And I can imagine it is so small compared to what our kids have to deal with in this day. But the question comes back is, is our Jesus capable of helping them? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, parents? &gt;&gt; This is what we preach to them and teach to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of our kids attend, of course, some of the Christian schools around here, and we're we're thankful that they can be able to do that. And I've been to some of the different things the kids go to and there's definitely a difference in in them in the public school, but they also still need help and prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyone else before we pray? Amen. No doubt there's children that have streamed today and your mamas and daddies gather, your little children around your computer there, your phone, whatever it is. Can we just pray together for them, church? Dear God, these poor little sheep, these little lambs. Dear God, we pray for them today. Father in the name of Jesus, that you'd help them and be with them. Lord, we know that we can teach them and try to rear them and bring them up in the right way. Yet we also know, Father, that we can't isolate them totally and keep them from the world. So we seek the balance of trying to in the years of their education know how much to expose them to, Lord. And I feel each each set of parents has to deal with that individually, how they should do their children. So God, I pray for every one of them today. Some of them homeschool, some of them going to the Christian schools that are around here, Lord. And for many of them, I've I've had to sign and validate a form for them that they attend church and any recommendation or drawback that I would have about their children. And it always does my heart good when I'm I'm able to send out that form and send them back and say, \"I know this family and they've been in our church for x amount of years and they're good people. They love God and I can stand and vouch for their character.\" Oh Lord, it's one of the honors of my life to be able to do that now. Lord, their little children are standing here in a week or so. They'll be going back out into this, Lord God, into this school system. And I pray that you'd have mercy on them, Father, for those who choose to homeschool their children. I pray, Lord, that you'd be with them. Most of the times falls to the to the ability of the mothers, and I ask you for them for strength and help, Lord. And we pray, Father, for those going to the Christian schools that are around. And we're grateful, Lord, because I know in dealing with some of them, Father, that they do try to maintain somewhat of a standard. Father, would you be with them? Would you help the children, Lord God? Oh Lord, they may be offered things like this and that that they're not used to and words that they wouldn't say or whatever, but may the teachings of mama and the teachings of daddy and their Sunday school teacher, Lord, may it be there in them. Lord, would you keep our children? Father, Lord, &gt;&gt; if you would, Terry, Father, this might be the evangelist of the message in the future and pastor's wives and deacons wives and little deacons standing here today. Lord, we don't know what they are, but we pray you'd watch over them and keep them. Father, help their parents to be sensitive when they come home at night to be able to pick up on anything that they're dealing with. Lord, bless them. I pray father in the name of Jesus we ask. Amen. God bless y'all. I love every one of you so much. Can we give him a hand today? Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I didn't get to it today, but I'll pick it up maybe next time. But Jesus asked his disciples in the book of Mark, \"How is it that you were in a dispute along the way?\" But they didn't answer him a word. So what had happened was they got into a debate about who was going to be the greatest in the kingdom. But Jesus has just told them he's fixing to die. And this is what they're concerned about. &gt;&gt; You see, he also has to have patience with us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So to prove his point, he called up a little child and it said, \"Except you become converted and as humble as this little child, you'll no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" What a lesson to preachers. Amen. &gt;&gt; So to get a message across to preachers, he uses a child. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Has it been good to be in the house of the Lord today? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's just bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, thank you for another Sunday. Just in a few moments now, it'll go in the book of the records. I'll have to stand before you that day and answer for what I've preached today. But they will have to answer for their attitude toward it. And we'll all have to answer for our attitude of how we apply it. Or do we let it go in one ear and out the other as we say? But may we be like James said that we're not just hearers of the word and he called them forgetful hearers, but may we be hearers that will apply to our lives. go with us today, Father. Keep us by your grace, Lord. You see the meetings coming up this week, and I pray that you'd be mindful of us there, Lord. And help us meet with us in a in a great way, Lord, in your presence. Dear Jesus, watch over my sheep. Keep them, Lord. They're not really mine. They're just yours that you've allowed to meet to be an undersheperd. Lord, you see those that are sick and needy. Father, Brother Steve Newsome really having a a hard time, Lord, and in the hospital. Lord Jesus, you see where he's at. Dear God, I pray that you'd be with our brother. Father, Sister Patty Cooper, Lord, you see, dear God, our sister and her needs, others, Father, with great needs in their lives. And we just ask that you'd be mindful of your children today. Go with us, Lord, through these great trials of our life. You're trying to bring us to that completed stage of patience. And so be it. May we not falsely accuse you or charge you, Lord. But may we at the end of the trial be faithful. God, go with your children now, Father. I pray as we dismiss from this place, let not be dismissed from your presence. In the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. I love you, saints. [Music] Pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me. Fill my cup again. Heal my heart and make me whole.

coming by and being with us amen blessing for our brother to be with us when it tonight thank the Lord as a matter of fact if I'd known a little bit more of ahead of time it would be me sitting back there and him be stand up here T not be taking serviceman next time praise the Lord um let's turn to the Book of Proverbs if you would tonight 11: 18 Lord Willam we still on tomorrow night I guess brother Joe brother Rob for question and answers all right I told our youth that I was done the last time that I did question answers on on the one question about prophets but I took care one day this week I just could not get it off of my heart and I thought hm so maybe I should look a little more boy what did I find oh my goodness so looking forward to that tomorrow night Proverbs chap 11 we've been speaking about seed for the rain we all believe the Harvest time is certainly closer than it's ever been before do we not but we know that we are not just sewing for down the road you know the latter ring that we're looking about and looking forward is going to be the Rapture the Mount Zion Showdown but while we're going that way there's a lot of seed and a lot of sewing and a lot of harvest that we're going to be doing right now in this life so Proverbs 11 chapter verse 18 the wicked workers a deceitful work but to him him that Seth righteousness shall be for a sure reward the wicked worketh a deceitful work but to him that sth righteousness so if we are righteous and then we live righteous we are sowing righteous seed so to him that Seth righteousness shall be a sure reward word also Galatians 6:7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that Seth to his flesh and remember you got two main Gardens your flesh is a garden and then the spirit Capital which is not your human Spirit but the spirit of God is another Garden by which we can sew into he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit capital S shall of the capital S Spirit reap life Everlasting now listen to this quote it's very very simple but very profound and Powerful as well so don't say nothing evil about Christians don't try to harm Christians because you'll reap what you sow every time now can we differ with Christians yes and will we discuss situations that we don't understand among family members and and the family of God members we will but there's a difference in that and trying to harm Christians just remember now don't say nothing evil about Christians don't try to harm Christians because you reap what you SE every time touch not my anointed and do my profits no harm it was far better for you that you'd have a millstone tied at your neck and drowned in the depths of the sea than to offend my anointed I realize we're living in leoa which is people's rights and people are more concerned about their own feelings and their own rights and what they want to do than they are God's word but this is God's law yeah and the church said amen now want you notice that he does not just put the anointed only on preachers preachers are not the only one Anointed The Bride is Anointed Ed to be bride yeah so he don't don't just say don't talk against preachers but don't speak wrong against Christians and try to harm them so don't say nothing about Christians maybe some of them don't live just right or just do right but that's God's child let the father take care of his own kitties don't you love that vernacular let the father take care of his own kitties you know if we go to fighting one another now listen what's going to happen to us so whether it's preachers in the pulpit leoty in the pews when we go to fight one another God give us both a whipping maybe dear Jesus help us Lord help us Lord so let's just leave the other fell alone and pray for him try to love him and correct him and maybe God will help him I wonder what kind of church would' be if we took this one quote tonight just just one simple quote and try to apply this every day to our lives for the rest of our lives amen there'd be people coming from all over the world world trying to see what broke out at Word of Life Church cuz it would be so phenomenal it be so wonderful that the love of God would be so amazing Among Us and the greater his love is the greater his presence is I wonder what we would become well I can just give you a little bit of Prophecy if you want me to yeah this is the type of people that's going in the Rapture remember when he went down on the curtain of time and he said you lay aside everything so that includes everything until you get perfect love then in sort 1965 when he reiterates that story he said I believe the people that go in the Rapture will be something like what I saw before they go so you mean perfect love will be pressing its way so far into this Dimension hell is why shouldn't life hell is pressing itself all around us every day is it not you mean hell's going to do that heaven's not going going to do that I just can't believe that that's the kind of person I want to be can we just pray together Lord Jesus we believe tonight that what we've read is the truth and we thank you already for the service that we've had just for singing and worship and prayer and prayer request and Lord our brother Jeremy blessing our hearts father was with the songs and the talent the anointing that you've given him now father as we come to this p portion of the service the word and we're a needy people we stand here tonight and we're not ashamed to say that we need you we need your help oh how we long to see you moving Among Us your Prophet tells us in perfect faith that we long to see those Apostolic times moving Among Us and he said we see them but we just want to see more of them but father tonight my focus is not just on the apostolic part my focus is if we can get more of your love and more of your nature and more of your character I just believe all those other things will follow right in line as we have need of but if we focus more on the sideline and if we try to Major on minors instead of minoring on majors and putting it all out of the circumference of where you put it no telling what will make a mess out of it all we need your help tonight father speak to us your great word would you Lord shut my mouth to anything that would displease you father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you Saints I trust that you all are getting a whole lot more seeds to be able to sew in your garden from these services from the text and the WhatsApp the emails the phone calls and um all the feedback that I've been getting from these Services apparently they're very very needy and uh I'd like to say and thank the Lord tonight for the testimonies that I've been hearing uh not only from our church but from other people who string the service that the Lord has delivered I don't know how many people of unforgiving spirits and all different types of things that God has already done I believe tonight will be no less of a miraculous visitation from God read with me if you would to 1 Peter chap 3:8 finally be ye all of One mind now do you believe that that is possible yes y'all believe that's possible God would have never anointed his man's servant to write that in the scripture had it not be possible now will that be of one human mind no it will not be Carol and I are born on the same day uh I was born that morning she's born later that afternoon so we have the same pattern in the stars that we're so much alike we think alike our tastes are very very similar we like a lot of things but yet there's other things that we differ on as far as day is from night that woman could eat broccoli till the cows come home if I never even look at another piece of broccoli I'm good for the rest of my life she's constantly trying to get me to eat more greens and I tell her look honey I I'm eating from the trees chocolate comes from the Cocoa Tree so I'm more of a tree guy instead of you know and we realize as far as humanly we will never and I'm afraid that Satan has tried to bring us to that spot thinking Lord in Mercy the bride will never get together how could you even think such a thought the bride will be together now it may not be together in the way that you're thinking or the way that I'm thinking it will never be of one human mind we will always differ one from the other but there is a mind a persuasion that which God will be able to accomplish and I love the way the prophet says it and souls it in prison now now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul there is the soul now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul there is where we will be in one mind now watch Peter says be you all of One mind having compassion one of another now we've been looking at the virtues is what also that Peter wrote about and remember these things are not something that we put on and the prophet uses the little simple illustration about a black bird trying to take peacock feathers and stick them in his cell and say see there I'm a peacock and he said why he's only a hypocrite that's all he is and he's trying to illustrate to us how important it is for us to have these things but we cannot get them on our own accord or our own ability so what are these These are attributes of the Lord Jesus himself so when the blood cell was broke open released the very nature of God it allowed it to come back inside of us so it will not be my Fai my virtue my knowledge my Temperance my joy my peace so on and so on but it will actually be his living out of you and I now one thing that we notice the Lord Jesus that was so different from the scribes and the Pharisees the scen and rodians and all them of that day was that the the four writers of the Gospel they noted that there was something about him that was really noticeably different and that was that Jesus had compassion upon the multitudes but now remember the ases the herodians the Sadducees the Pharisees they would not even allow the common people to touch them so they would go out in the marketplaces and they were just you know this holier than thou saying so before they would eat lunch they would go home and wash their hands beginning at the tips of their fingers come up to their elbows some of them would roll their garments up and come pum up to the armpits well if I was going that far I'd go ahead and go my face when you I mean just do it all but they they because maybe they had touched some of the lower class Jews while they were out so they would not put food in their mouths L some of the uh you know whatever that they had touched on the common people had got on them so you imagine then whenever Jesus would allow a woman which had an issue of blood which according to the levitical law anyone who even sat where a person sat on a couch where that person was was contaminated for several days you can imagine then when they saw this woman with this issue of blood coming out of her body and she went up and touched the Garment of the Lord Jesus automatically their minds was this man is unclean he is filthy he has been touched someone with Leprosy are you kidding me people with all types of diseases and sicknesses and they touched them and if they didn't touch him he would touch them which made it even more oh my goodness you've got to be kidding he actually went over and touched people with Leprosy he touched them with all types of plaguy and diseases he would lay his hands on them so there was something so much more different about him than just being sinless it was notably the aspect of God which was compassion now if we are truly bride we are also going to be compassionate so it's not now that we're going to do it from our heart or mind rather and we say oh yeah I have passion on people and I understand yeah I feel sorry for people no that's not it the Lord Jesus was willing to be touched by the unclean and I don't mind telling you that there is a reproach around this message of even trying to identify with people that have backl especially if it's a preacher or if it's somebody that's gotten in sin and got in trouble it's amazing how many people don't want to help them they don't want to get their hands dirty they don't want Oh you mean somebody might find out that I was there Jesus reputation was made known among the prostitutes and the foul and the unclean I ain't talking about rubbing shoulders with them and living the way they live I'm talking about them needing help and trying to find somebody that'll be willing to do it for you do we want to be that way notice he said finally be all of One mind having compassion now remember when we are living this out by the very nature of God in us we are planting the seeds which will turn right around and multiply to us again having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be pitiful what watch that means is to have pity on one another and even be Cur courteous wow I mean this is really deep stuff right I know this is not Thunders and it's not perusia it's all that sort of thing and it's something that we're not going to hear preach very often but it's still in the pages of God's word notice what the word compassion means suffering or feeling the like with another sympathetic so they notice Jesus that when he would get among the people that he wouldn't stand offish like the priest and the Pharisees and them you know that they would stand off and and the people knew better than to touch them they knew better than to get around them so they had this holy type of thing around them but there must have been something about the Lord Jesus this or of the supernatural that pulsated a welcoming atmosphere because these people had been raised up around priests and they called him a rabbi too and they must have known you don't touch a rabbi you do not get near them holy righteous men but there must have been something projected by him that was inviting to the ungodly that was inviting to those who would have plagues and have all kinds of things and they just felt a drawing oh don't you want to be that kind of child of God that people even though they may smoke and drink and run around and whatever but yet they know if they have a need they've got confidence and God don't want it just to be in the preachers God wants it to be in our body in our local assembly that they might feel a little bit ashamed of the way they look and maybe a little bit of the way they dress but they feel like you will not criticize them that you'll do what you can to help them and the church said amen having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous now let's read some examples about our Master Matthew 9:36 but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them notice now nothing about what he could get out of the multitude so when he saw the multitude he was not moved with pride so that he could speak to them and give a big report that I spoke to the largest congregation that any man has ever preached to so when he saw the crowd it wasn't that something about himself was arrogantly waiting till he could go back and tell his disciples uh that I I spoke to so many today the largest crowd that's ever been known to the to a preacher to ever preached and I I spoke to him that wasn't what moved him it was compassion so it wasn't a big number it wasn't the following but what dominated his life was compassion so when he saw the multitudes now not one multitude but multitudes in plural and this is what his reaction was compassion so when you and I go into Walmart Kroger Food City Mall wherever it is we see men dressing in this day looking like women we see women looking like men anymore you don't know what they are you know you want to be courious and kind and say yes sir and yes ma'am but you don't know if you ought to or not anymore I was told not long ago one of our brothers here once in one of these drink places around you where you drive to and get a drink and they thanked the man and the man let him know that was not his pronoun so he did not want to be identified as a man so you don't know what to do so whenever we look at them what goes through our mind do we look at them with pity and compassion or do we automatically you pervert you're going to hell you rotten sorry thing but what if that pervert as You' call him is holding the life predestinated seed in the Tri City area what if that prostitute dressed woman that's that looks absolutely horrible but what if she's the next woman at the well oh my listen children we don't know we don't know my look at some of us how we were before God got a hold of us would we have ever looked like bride ain't no way would we have ever looked like what we are today no and it might be the same way today they may not come from an Apostolic church or a Baptist Church they may come straight off the street it might be a man that's wanted to be a woman for half of his life well will we welcome a Word of Life cast that devil out of them yes we'll do that first but will we welcome them and can we say come brother you believe whatever you want to believe I believe before this bride leaves this world there will not be one devil not one devil that will be conquered by somebody in this bride around the world somebody is going to conquer liver cancer somebody's going to conquer homosexuality somebody's going to conquer jealousy come on preach with me tonight somebody's going to conquer lesbianism somebody's going to conquer pride and arrogance and selfishness and so on and so on you mean you believe God's going to take a bride and say every Devil's subject to her and thousands of devils not conquered n that ain't my God my God is a mighty conqueror and the life stand of Victory will be where it was not at Calvary Paul even said it so emphatically that in that day when the resurrection of the Saints takes place then we'll be brought to pass the saying death is swallowed up in Victory how come they didn't say that when Jesus raised from the dead Hallelujah because he wanted that to be consummated in Bride form Not only would deaths be conquered by the bride but all these other evils in this age are going to be conquered somebody's going to conquer Alzheimer's somebody's going to conquer lung cancer come on Sheldon somebody's going to conquer absolutely conquer blindness and deafness and legs yes sir I believe there will be missing limbs that will be restored before the bride goes home Hallelujah but you know what it's going to take for the body Hallelujah compassion yes sir compassion notice when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them notice why because they fainted and were scattered abroad having a sheep having no Shepherd so instead of condemning and he could have instead of judging them and being harsh instead he looked at him and thought poor things they faint they're scattered they don't know what's right they're going from church to church Pillar To Post I don't know what to do oh hallelujah hallelujah Matthew 14:14 and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and healed they're sick chapter 15:32 then Jesus called his disciples un to him and said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat I will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way now watch so in in chapter nine it's because they have no sh no Shepherd they're scattered he has compassion in chapter 14 he was moved with compassion because he needed healing in their body in chapter 15 he expresses compassion because the have material needs they were hungry naturally but if you notice Jesus didn't just say now all of you that believe I'm the Messiah you all get on one side and all the rest of you bunch of devils get on the other side and I am going to feed my followers Jesus didn't even divide him as far as belief and unbelief but he had compassion thank you Lord on the flood victims yes sir you understand what I'm saying you see friends what happens because of the type of message that we have we so narrow everything down we bring it down smaller smaller smaller I understand that concept I understand that principle but the danger is if we're not careful we'll narrow down love we'll narrow down Mercy will narrow down kindness compassion what's wrong with trying to say a kind word to these people out here it may be the only kind word some of them hear all day long I'd rather be kind to everybody what brother done what if they don't believe the message well what if they don't I don't see the Lord Jesus sorting them out and say all right all of you that believe the message come over here and I'll heal you he heals him he heals him praise the Lord but you see whenever we go to naring get down naring it down if we're not careful we get to a spot it becomes Only The Selective few that we like it ought to be something in us if we saw a rank sinner that was sick and the spirit of God moved on our heart I've done it before and I've told you of examples and Sams and Walmart and other places and I'm going to continue to do so they may never come to this church that don't make no difference I want to be like Jesus I see Jesus Healing The Sick that didn't even believe him I see Jesus reaching out a hand to help people of those that he knew would crucify make me more like Jesus oh my help us Lord chapter 18 verse 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how of shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him a man I'm tell telling you Peter stretching this limit wow I mean he's thinking I'm so much like Jesus I'm a preacher and I I cast out Devils I'm telling you what I'm a man of God I'm going to reach out here Beyond myself I I'm going to say I'm going to say till seven times yeah what do you think of that Lord this is what Jesus thought Jesus said unto him I say unto thee until seven times but until 70 times 7 therefore is the kingdom of heaven like unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him 10,000 talents now according to the price of the troy ounce of silver which is what this was the price will vary somewhat but one of the prices that I found last week in studying this was this amount 226 million 291,000 $72 and 50 CS so this is what this man owed his Lord or his master for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant there therefore fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay the all which is totally impossible then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion I want you to listen to these words carefully and loosed him right and forgave him the debt look at the word loosed release set at Liberty let depart set free to detain no longer to let go free to acquit one accused of a crime and set him at Liberty so he owes $226 million and this master says you're free now notice he didn't go by the Avenue of wisdom of knowledge of shouting of gifts all them had their places now but what attribute was it that moved on the master compassion compassion but this man in the parable had experienced compassion but did didn't have any himself he experienced great forgiveness but didn't have any himself now watch so Jesus in his Cho choice of words it's amazing to me so he loosed him and forgave him now the first word would have been powerful enough but then Jesus uses another word to let go to disregard not to discuss so you're not only loose from this you and I will never mention this again when you get around me don't even bring it back up again oh I'm I'm so thankful you forgive me I'm so thankful I'm don't no no it is taken care of to such a degree we will never talk about this again now keep this in mind what this man received but he he himself is fixing to reverse being loosed and being forgiven well y'all listening good tonight they always tell me is a good time to sew seed when the wind wasn't blowing then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave gave him the debt but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him 100 P which is 17 $17 compared to $226 m291 72 50 so this man owes him 100 p and he laid hands on him now look at the difference in this servant and the master the the the Bible Jesus in giving the parable does not say that the Lord this King laid hands on this man that owed him millions of dollars now this is Express ex of intense anger so he laid hands on him and took him by the throat I mean this guy is in a mess Ain now you would agree with me that this man experienced forgiveness this man experienced compassion this man experienced being being loosed from a terrible terrible debt but he did not know how to do the same thing for a man who owed him $17 now remember Jesus is setting this forth in a parable so it's a story Parable is a Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning so this is like the kingdom of heaven so in the Kingdom of Heaven going to be all kinds of people like this so this man now is released and loosed and boy he's so glad for himself but he is so harsh and so judgmental now watch the king is almighty God of course in the parable and then the man that owed the millions of dollars will call him Donnie Paul Daryl Jeremy Scott Carol Barbara Linda you you you and you Jesus is trying to get us to see our indebtedness to God was so tremendous there's no way we could ever settle it so he forgave us oh my and then he turn goes out and sees this friend of his and he took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him now notice he's saying some of the exact same things that he said so it wasn't that he was saying weird bizarre things that was off the pattern you see Jesus said this exactly on on purpose he sure knows how to say stuff don't he so he's saying the right things and got the right approach and no doubt has an element of sincerity because apparently to this man $17 was a tremendous amount and he besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison is till he should pay the debt now somebody please explain to me you're going to put a man in prison because he owes you so much money tell me how's he going to work in prison and pay you off I mean I realize I'm d a c bucket if you're smarter than this cold bucket C bucket go ahead and tell me what you know it don't make any sense to me but I want you to notice the terms as Jesus goes on and he said so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done then after then his Lord after he had called him said unto him oh thou Wicked servant uhoh so even after being loosed and being forgiven of the former debt he has now accumulated apparently this tremendous debt another debt but this time it was against one less fortunate than himself dear God speak to us tonight oh thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desirest me that was the only reason I forgive it because you wanted me to and had compassion on you should us not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had pity on thee so you mean the Lord Jesus wants us as his forgiven people to be able to forgive those who trespass against us now remember this whole Parable is an answer to this preacher's question I like to emphasize that this is a preacher it shows you they're not perfect either amen so this whole Parable and story was an answer to this preacher's question about forgiveness now I want you to notice how strange and his Lord was Ross and delivered him to the tormentors now how is this possible his debt was clean now the word that Jesus uses here you see there was two categories of crimes of things that we're talking about so to be able to grab that Man by the throat in some countries would be assault but they did normally did not turn a deor over to the tormentors now the tormentors were people in the criminal prisons and they would beat criminals uh they would keep food from them talk to them really really bad and really really treat them bad because they were a criminal but a debtor's prison was simply for people who didn't pay their debts so normally it was not normal for them to be tormented but you see this man after receiving forgiveness and not having really understood it even his own torment was changed from a Dead's prison to a criminal's prison because he had experienced such forgiveness and such Mercy Mery and such compassion and he was forgiven Millions hundreds of millions of dollars and yet he did not have $17 worths of Mercy oh so by law if this man's debt was eliminated so he was loosed and forgiv gave how could this man ever by the court of law ever bring this man back in brother Jeremy and say send him to prison why well he owes me well but but but sir you you forgave him here we have many witnesses that heard you say that you forgive him children look what being uncaring and cold and not min ministering compassion look how the Lord looks at it did the Lord forgive him did the Lord loose him well how is this man going to go to prison then how is he going to the tormentors and they are going to torment this man because he had no compassion on fellow human beings wow you see the big debt was from a fallen sinner to a mighty God which could never be paid by any mortal but the other debt was from one mortal to another mortal one flawed human being dealing with another flawed human being but the evaluation that they placed upon thems and upon that other human being was so different and by simply that one deed it was going to get this individual thrown into torment makes me want to be kind to everybody if I'm guilty okay if I'm guilty let me be guilty of loving people that'll never be bright just let me be guilty of offering a smile to somebody that may never even walk down the streets of God let me be guilty of reaching out my hand to help others anybody with me tonight you know what because I've tapped into a source that there's no end to his love and mercy and compassion so it ain't like that I've got this little teeny bit of goodness and mercy and man I've got to be a scrooge you know I've got to just D it out just a little bit here I'm I'm afraid I'm want to run out what if all I've got is my own I will run out but if I've tapped into eternal life there's no end to it oh my the more I give out the more he'll put in me to give out and the more we love I believe the more love he'll pour in us to love out look at our Master we got so many of our brothers that want to be like Jesus but why is it they always relate to signs and wonders and miracles when we're talking about being like Jesus right ain't there no preachers in this message that wants to to be like this like Jesus yes sir is all we one of Jesus the miraculous and the supernatural Don't We Want to Love Like Jesus don't we want to try to help the people that's in such need if there was I believe with all in our heart if Jesus was here on the earth in this time frame he would be reaching out exactly the same way he did whenever he was here before well he ain't here but I am he ain't here but you are let them know there is a risen savior hallu oh my and his Lord was Ross and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him oh my now listen Jesus still going on with the parable so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you now remember this still is an answer to Peter's questions if ye from your hearts forgive not all your special friends and all your close family and all of those that you really really like that's our modern day version ain't it from your heart forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses and Word of Life Church said and then Word of Life Church also said help me Lord help me Lord to be more like you I'm not interested in Walking On Water friends I have no need of walking on water in this day and age I have no need of doing some of the things that Jesus did I have no need of doing some of the things that Moses did most of us can afford to buy groceries I don't need to pray that God will ring quail and bread out of Heaven if we needed that I'd have enough Faith to be able to do it I believe God would do it don't you yes I do if we're out of gasoline I believe we could pour uh water in our tank I mean you know brother walls brother Mike Wall's grandfather that happened to him years and years ago he was scheduled to go preach a meeting and didn't have gas to put in his car so they poured water in the gas tank and prayed over it and God turned it into into gas if he could turn water into whne and turn water into gasoline well come on plus you don't have to pay federal Exile tax on it too so I mean that's pretty good deal you me if I needed gas in my car and didn't have the money my God could do it but as long as I can do it I wouldn't have faith enough to ask him but I've got faith to ask him tonight give me more love Lord give me more compassion Lord May Word of Life Church not only be not known as a nice church and a church who does this and that and the other may we be known as a compassionate loving people that can forgive those that run us down and talk about us come on somebody let's have church on Wednesday night let us be known Our Testimony be known that we pray for those that despitefully use it and we forgive those that trespass against us amen oh my 1 John 3:17 who so hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shut us up his bows of compassion from him how dwell us the love love of God in him so here the Apostle of Love is questioning where a person was truly even born again if they had material means to help someone else who was needy and they wouldn't do it if you lived in the first century they questioned your Holy Ghost well if they questioned it I think I've got a right to do the same you say I'm not a judge but I am a fruit inspector comes with my vocation I'm a fruit inspector now watch Peter says finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful and the meaning of that word is tenderhearted and compassionate be courteous and this is one of our struggles in this age right here I want to give you a warning right here th Tire Church age it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the L of sin or last age self love and love for material things will take place of the true love of God listen selflove and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many listen now this is a warning to us this is our time frame so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit I don't mind telling you some of the hardest people I've ever dealt with in my life are message people and you know what's heartbreaking I preach in a lot of Youth conventions and a lot of Youth Camps over the years and I've seen youth you know from this high and watch them grow up and become bigger and bigger and bigger and taller and older more mature and so on and so on but you know what is also so heartbreaking is to walk watch them become hard-hearted to where the word no longer moves them they don't have no more tears to cry you don't see them make an altar anymore you don't see them because you know they've sat there and they've went from one Youth Camp to another to another and they've got Camp meet and cramps as the prophet said and they've heard this preacher that preacher that preacher their pastors tried to bring in ministers you no matter where they go to church that would be a blessing and a help to them and it becomes to where well so what you know we've had this guy and that guy and that guy I want somebody that'll move me it ain't somebody that'll move you it's you moving yourself it's you surrendering your selfishness to the Lord God what is going to dominate L to seea but it will not dominate The Bride self love self love oh come on I wish somebody preach with me tonight it's going to be one of the things that every person in this building must put under your feet even with the Holy Ghost it will be something that will war against our flesh because there's something that the part of the anointing the accumulative spirit of the last day will dominate self why it is Satan trying to make man think he is a God right so man what he got self-help books on this and self-help on that and self-help on something else we might as well admit it we cannot help ourself we are lost without God even after we become Christians we need the Holy Ghost after we get the Holy Ghost we still need to be corrected by the word of God but look at a lot of the message people stay home and play a tape they wouldn't darken a church door for nothing why they fell underneath this thing of selflove people sitting at home and rather stream than they would to put Force effort come to the house of God I say shame on you if you're able to come to the house of God you ought to be here tonight you ought to come in them doors praise the Lord with an attitude I'm going to well a little headache set me back well a little headache keep you from the soccer game and the football game come on somebody you'll go to a basketball game when your granddaughter's playing with a headache and you'll stay home and you got one and miss the house of God I say shame on you what's doing it self love and people losing the love for the house of God they're losing the love for the word they're losing the love for one another woo because of abounding iniquity the love of many shall wax wax cold in the lead of s or last self love and love for material things probably most of us have got more things than we've ever had in our life are we better off or do most of those things take up more of our time it's amazing how many people are in love with things you know why it's easier to love a thing than it is a person that's a thorn in your side God ain't going to use your car to Humble you God ain't going to use your poodle dog to get you to heaven God may use a person that's nothing but a big Brier right in your side and they love that seat right across from you and they sat there and look at you and you look at them and they Bri you every time you come to church and God said go ahead and gouge him cuz he's got too much flesh in there and then he'll have somebody else gouging them and then they're gouging you and you're gouging them why character does not come as a gift it must come by molding and making and shaping and we're living in a time when God is Not catering to our every wh we're not a bunch of spoiled brats and God's got to give us everything we ask for or we ain't going to serve him if he never answers another prayer I pray for the rest of my life I'm going to serve him I don't deserve anything he's done for me I don't deserve him being so good to me he don't have to Baby me he don't have to answer every prayer that I pray and when he says no he Oh my he offers me and I do not demand an explanation if he says no I'll say yes sir if he says wait a while I'll say yes sir why because I owed Millions times Millions times millions and he said Donnie I lose you I lose you and in order for me to stay Loos I'm going to lose loose you so if you trespass against me I'm going to loose you I'm going to set you free so when you stand before the Lord that debt won't be hanging over you I want to stay loose oh my it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day Church there any honest Christian in here tonight that say yep I've felt that before well I will whether y'all will or not and I don't like it come on somebody I don't like it brother Jack and when I feel it I say hey you leave me alone you get away from me I don't want to be cold I don't want to be lukewarm there's only one option for me burning fire amen I'm going to be on fire now so I won't be on fire later that's exactly right I choose Holy Ghost Far Over Hellfire I choose the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and my soul so saturated the presence of God brother the D do you have to fight it why of course I do it's a spirit in the last day but I am fighting fighting and I am winning by the grace of God I said I am fighting and I am winning you I feel cess about worship sure I feel cess about this and that the other sure but I only feel it for a while and I'll tell cess to get out of my life I ain't got room for you in my life Hallelujah I ain't got room for no l to see self-love coldness of the last day it is time to draw an eye to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us oh no Lord don't let us go that way don't let us be forgiven of so much and loosed of so much tradition so much sin so many things that's unlike the Lord and then we turn right around and shut off our bowels of compassion and become so isolated from everybody El my it's becoming that way and the message we becoming so so divided and so separated how many is going to be left when we all get done well first of all we need to quit playing God let God be God and you just be happy that you're part of the family of God let God do the separa let God do the judging notice Peter again let's pick up this word courteous finally be of all of One mind having compassion one of another love his Breen be pitiful be courteous friendly kind oh my not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing railing is to speak reproachfully or reviling but contrary wise blessing so when somebody rails against you you bless them and I don't mean bless them out and some of y'all is good at blessing life blessing that that that is what Peter was saying notice blessing this is the root word of where the word a lot of us don't even like eulogy cuz we think eulogy you know is just all for the sectarian religion but notice this eulogia fair speech praise fine discourse an invocation of blessing oh my goodness so when somebody rails to speak reproachfully against you and revile you you are to bless them not out but in so you speak fair speech praise fine discourse and invocation of blessing well you know what friends I just realized maybe maybe my Bible has got some verses in it that y'all's Bible don't have have I got a strange version or something really okay so this is all's Bible okay man I sweating her from minut I just thought I was reading from some foreign book but the look shall got on your face tonight it just seem like y was like I was from another planet or something I Am From Another Dimension martians ain't got nothing on me believe me knowing notice now not rendering evil for evil raing for raing but contr eyes blessing knowing that you are there unto called so we're called to be bride we're called to be baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus we call to heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils but this is also part of our calling yes sir that's good well if I'm called to do it guess what I'm going to do her right anybody going to do it with me knowing that ye are there un to called that ye wow so you mean me sowing blessing for railing I'm sowing seed yeah and then the last part of that verse that you should inherit a blessing so when I bless those that run me down and talk about me and you know just whatever more I'm actually sewing seeds for my own good and I will inherit a blessing yeah yeah thank you Lord verse 10 I love this verse for he that will love life you're blessed if you love life cuz a lot of folks in the age were living simply don't they don't want to live for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil harm of a bad nature not such as it ought to be Troublesome injurious pernicious or destructive let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no gu let him escue evil and do do good let him seek peace and ensue it let him seek it and ensue it es skew run away from depart from not be near a skew evil and do good and seek peace look friend our life is a lot about choices if you want to be sad there's enough in life to be sad about I choose to be happy by the grace of God hey look I deal with so much sickness I deal with so much deaths I deal with I don't know why it's been my lot in life as a pastor to have to deal with so much deaths so much sickness constantly being contacted every day every day with so much stuff going on around the world oh I I I I I just get so worn with it sometimes with so much sickness and so Much Death and so much suffering and if you don't let the spirit of God help you under such a state You' never have nothing to be happy about but I'm so happy cuz there's a world coming that there won't be no more of it I'm so happy that we have a God to take all of our troubles to come on somebody oh I know you got you folks have got things you could be really really sad about you've got all kinds of things going on your life but you can choose to be happy in the midst of your trials you can choose to be happy it is your choice do you want to be Laden down and oh I got this grim look on your face all the time or do you want to say the lord gave and the Lord take away blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh my let me close here in Hebrews 10:24 let us consider here's another seed for you to put in your basket let us consider one another to perceive remark observe understand consider attentively so not just a casual how are you brother but consider attentively let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works and the church said amen let's B our heads praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord no one looking around now I wonder how many say Lord that was so true but I admit I need help with certain Avenues of it in my life father just raise your hand to him God bless you and and me say this if if you're already doing these things it's not so much that you're saying that you don't do it at all but you just want more of it you want more of it to you want it to abound in your life and to flourish and be exactly what the father you're called to be this children we're not just called to be Pride but we're called to have a certain attitude a certain Behavior a certain way that we should do don't you understand it's more than just getting together and well we're going to lift an offering and we're going to help some Churches over in Uganda we we've we've done that many many times we just did it just recently because they're experiencing some famine in certain parts and we've built churches by the grace of God all over the world we've helped buy food we've helped drill water wells we we've helped do all kinds of things like that but it's more than that that's people without a face you people if I lift an offering here tonight and say you know there there's these requests over here and over there I know what y'all would do y'all would drop money in there they don't tell how much we'd raise here in one night just no notification at all just telling you tonight but why is it we find it so much harder for those that we go to church with and we may have a little hard feeling toward or a little grievance toward it's so much easier for us to be kindhearted and tenderhearted to those that we don't know or an individual without a face or just a name or they live in a certain country but the real test is for those who don't like you as a matter of fact the prophet tells us eternal life is living for others and he said you live for that man that would kill you if he could I want you to think about that a man or woman that would absolutely kill you if they had the opportunity to do it and they could get byow was it and yet you would do something above and beyond the Call of Duty for that individual to help them you see that's what Jesus did so his life is the same whether it's in his human body or in mine or in yours now friends we're talking about bride material we've had all kinds of so-called bride revivals it's went from one theological term to another it's went from one emotional spin to another but what I'm preaching about to you from the scriptures and from the message is something this bride will have before she leaves this world hallelujah oh Lord Jesus as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth and if time goes on unless we or changed each of us will go by this way we don't know that there's a one of us here tonight that'll be back even here Sunday but we want to live every day of our life as if though it could be our last because it could be so Lord we don't want to have to call this person and that person and apologize for saying this or doing that or sewing Discord against them or what whatever Lord cuz we might be taken out of life within a matter of seconds tonight on our way home an automobile will run across the road and our life will be ended so I wouldn't have time to pick up my phone and call somebody and say hey would you forgive me I said this about you and I talked about you and I I did that and I'm I'm really sorry won't be no time so we want to live every day of our life was every debt settled so if there's things we need to make right we want to make them right now I don't want to wait till Sunday if there's anybody in this building or anyone around the world that I need to fix something with them I give you my word as your son if you will show me I will do it before the dawn of another day if there's something I need to fix something I need to apologize for I want to live every day of my life Lord God as if though it were my last Lord Jesus may you move among the ministers tonight as I mentioned it a few weeks ago to me it's no real great surprise really that as a message Community we're not any farther up the road than what we are because of the way sometimes preachers act and they're the leaders so if they're arguing and fussing and debating and this building a kingdom and this and wants a build a bigger Kingdom and this and that and the other how and the work can we expect the people to be any closer to God but if every godall man could realize he's called to edify the body not the body edify him he's called to serve he's called to bring things that'll help the body even most of the time when it will kill him to have to do it but he's called to do it help us Lord Jesus I want to be like you Lord as I mentioned earlier I have no desire to walk on water it's something I've never wanted to do I've never wanted to be able to prophesy who would be the next president or I've never wanted to be an outstanding person a great person so you could tell me this and that and I could get up and tell people well the Lord told me this and the Lord told me that the Lord told me something else and it come to pass I've seen what that produces I have no desire for that Lord but I do want to love like you I want to forgive like you cuz in the parable I don't see that this man this man didn't believe in speaking in tongues or this man didn't run or this man didn't quote the scripture and this man didn't know the Greek and the Aramaic but this man failed to show compassion and he reoccurred this massive massive debt which had him thrown not in the Dead's prison but the prison where the criminals went and there he would be tormented help us Lord God I have been forgiven much oh I didn't get out and drink around do all that stuff but I failed you so many times I've grumbled and complained and wished I wouldn't a preacher and wish I didn't have to go this way and that way and preach certain things and and that's been wrong with me and I'm so sorry we love you tonight Jesus we want to make our altar right here in our hearts father and ask you to forgive us Lord We Worship You Lord God then as I pray and I Repent before the people and I pray they will do likewise we accept forgiveness and we are loosed then help us having experienced loosing to go about loosening others praise God praise God We Worship You Jesus we bless your name tonight father hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you of a name Word of Life Church a wonderful blessed name a wonderful blessed person I'm not here to preach of some great superhero preacher in the message or some great move of this man or that man around the message I'm here tonight to point to the only perfect one that ever lived a perfect human life on the earth and that was the Lord Jesus to the bride his name is still the greatest name that has ever been uttered his love is greater than the love of a father the love of a mother a husband a brother a wife praise be to God don't you love him tonight with all all your

master that threw him back in prison it was his attitude toward his fellow man yes sir he didn't hate his master or he didn't turn oh you're rich and I hate you I wish should have never forgive me that was not his problem his problem was with this fellow man so we not only want to say we're free we want to go on and say we are still free and we are free because we understand forgiveness so if I

her I'll bear her out there with the rest of the family I'll love you as much as I ever loved you and months later we came home and all that the Lord had done for her I run it to Brother Louie at

that you have revealed to us in this hour the prophet said the Mysteries that was what in your mind has now been placed in the heart of the Believers and Lord we believe you have revealed these great things to us that we would not set out oh Lord but we would take the things that we have heard Lord and that we would use them for thy glory and Lord the things that we have heard tonight is the things that we desire Lord in our hearts that we could show compassion Lord that we could be that friend that we could be that hand that we could be that word of encouragement to someone and father God there are so many needs Lord as brother Donnie has so well said sometimes Lord there's so many comes in I tell my wife I can't I can't take another one today I just got to quit but Lord there's so many needs but none of them is greater than you Lord l so I pray dear God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus and that anointing that raised my Lord from the grave may it move dear God for those that are afflicted those dear God that are suffering Lord I think of different ones in the hospital Lord with blockages facing surgery but I pray oh God may your hand move upon them Lord that the doctors would be astounded and my brothers and my sisters Lord that are battling this cancer dear God I pray in the name of Jesus may you loose them dear God that they would be a great testimony of thy mercy and

through God's got this and here's the reason why few weeks ago there was two children of God on a roof and the waters were raging and coming up very fast but God provided Isaiah 432 when you go through the rivers they won't overtake you when I needed healing for a diagnosis of cancer he brought another word Isaiah 535 by stripes we are healed so I just want you to know whatever you're going

people off that roof you did those things and honor and glory to you people have need Lord You've provided that need already so father we're stepping into the vision as children of God and we're going

just from your mouths but from your soul you are one blessed human being that's right a lot of folks that like to heal like Jesus they wouldn't mind even walking on water like Jesus raising the Dead Like Jesus being able to do all kinds of things of their own sort what they would pick but I wonder how many wants to be hated despised rejected Jesus reputation was not made among messeng people his reputation was made among Liars prostitutes thieves Tax Collectors the number one IRS agent in Israel and you imagine the Lord Jesus taking an IRS agent as W say and said I want you to write a book I'll even let it be called after your name the Book of Matthew now some of us we wouldn't have give them the time of day cuz we're so holy and so Pious and so high and mighty ain't we I'll tell you friends I don't want to have that attitude myself I want to be like Jesus amen so my reputation is made among those that other folks won't have nothing to do with so be if my reputation is made among those that are have a terrible evil rep reputation God Saves evil people some of the most evil people I ever dealt with in my life are church people anyway sometimes Ain can be mean or the rattlesnake twice as fast so well praise the Lord that's a good greeting wouldn't it how yall doing we're good you good all right praise the lord well we certainly appreciate the kindness of the Lord to us and want to say we had a a really good youth service over in North Carolina the Lord really moved and blessed the services there and brother Andrew of course always does a great job and brother digs done done a really good job as well and had a prayer line on Saturday night and I'm still hearing of the things that the Lord Jesus done it was absolutely wonderful to see what our Lord done and how he came by I got several uh things today and just absolutely phenomenal what the Lord is doing Matthew chap 6: 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not life more than meat and the body than Raymond let me read it to you again now therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life look at the word thought take thought be careful to be anxious or in other words to have anxiety now would not this be the common thing that most of us would be so concerned about why could Jesus say such a thing take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink near yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than rment now look in verse 31 therefore take no Sal saying what shall we eat eat or what shall we drink again the same word there thought is to be anxious for so Jesus is not saying well don't go to the grocery store and don't plan your meals and don't even worry about it I mean just happy gol lucky just be like the birds and The Sparrows you know just sit around the house and twiddly thumbs and wait on God to drop something out of Heaven he's not saying that to us but what he wants to get over to us is that we are not so anxious and so tore up listen how he breaks this down what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek oh wow wonder why he didn't say Jews for all these things the Gentile seek so then we as Gentiles maybe we need to pay pay special heed to this since Jesus specifically this is a racial scripture it's aimed for the race of the Gentiles in particular amen and some of the Gentiles said all right okay for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you so you see it's not that he doesn't want us to pray over it and think about it but he doesn't want it to be the priority of our life the first priority will be the kingdom of God verse 34 take therefore no Sal anxiety to be anxious tore up worried for the moral for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself who ever thought tomorrow could think you see why the words of the Bible can seem absolute foolishness to people who go just by education and signs for the martal shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof now I mentioned to you the prayer line for a reason brother Jason and them do their prayer line a little bit different there at the yam so they have two preachers up here two here two here two here and two there like five different positions then the deacons will bring people up to these two these two these two instead of one guy having to pray for basically everybody then it kind of divides it up so he wanted to put brother Diggs and myself together and then other brothers that they pick to put together brother Diggs and I kind of stood in the middle and I noticed as we started praying that it was one after another after another after another after another after another and this one word kept being requested prayer for anxiety anxiety some of those you were standing in the prayer line for their parents cuz some of the parents wasn't going to church some of the parents had got cold on God and the youth were standing in for their parents some of the requests are just heartbreaking of course they're private anyway so I'm not going to tell it any all but I was so curious so the next morning which was on Sunday morning the ministers was back in the office there to pray before the service started so I asked the rest of the brothers that was praying here here and and there I said' Brothers I'm just curious did you all get a lot of request for anxiety and every one of those preachers which had doubled up every one of them said it was the biggest request that they prayed for brother Jason spoke up and said brother Donnie I've noticed it in the last two years he said last year anxiety was 3 to one three to one greater than every other need that was mentioned some were oppression some were you know just different stress and things like that but after that on Sunday and then I talked to a couple more preachers afterwards and and they said the exact same thing one after another after another so since I've come home on Sunday afternoon I've not been able to get this off of my heart so I'm going to speak to you tonight on freedom from anxiety nervousness oppression fear and depression and if you'll listen tonight to the word of the Lord and you'll be able to open your hearts in faith some of you will not even need prayer he'll deliver you as you're hearing the word amen let's pray together shall we heavenly father I stand here tonight at your bidding Lord God you see our needs we know that they are many you know the needs of your children around the world father we've come here tonight to report for service dear God all we can do is prepare ourself and as a minister I can pray and study and then as you give me inspiration and I break into the channel of your anointing then try to put it together as best I can and Lord as I set Monday and I went downstairs to study and your anointing came to where I was and I sat there father for a couple of hours under your presence Hallelujah after a bit I got up a little bit after 9: and went up get me a little something to drink Carol said you okay I said yeah I'm just exhausted been sitting under the anointing so Lord I believe you have something in your heart for us tonight so dear God we ask you that you just come and speak to us Lord I bind every devil every demon spirit that would try to hinder us tonight speak to us from your words father Hallelujah we look to you tonight for you are our deliverer our Mighty God take charge of this service May every evil spirit be brought subject to the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ for it's in his name and he is the word that we ask it amen and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated as I've done a little research and looking on anxiety and stress and I found so many therapists and counselors that are constantly coming up with methods to help people deal with anxiety the three three three method and then the five five five method and the 10 10 10 method so it's to breathe in for 3 seconds hold it for 3 seconds and breathe out for 3 seconds then someone else said breathe in for 5 seconds hold it for 5 seconds but I've got a remedy tonight amen it's not the three five or 10 it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen being Christians we know that we're not exempt from anxiety and trouble notice again Jesus in Matthew 10:18 says and you shall be brought before Governors and Kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the Gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought again same word anxious anxiety take no thought how or what you shall speak now I want you to notice that Jesus is saying these things and it would be the exact opposite of what our human human tendency would be so if we knew we were going to be brought before a tribunal a governor a police officer a judge and we're going to be questioned about what we believe the church we go to what we stand for why why do you women dress the way you do why do you men do the way you do and there could be some kind of consequences for us doing this then the natural thing would be for us to become very anxious would it not kind of troubled about it and okay what what will I say and how will I go about saying it now you see what Jesus is trying to set us straightforward that we would not rely on our own ability and we would not become anxious which would go in on our nerves and then we would come to a spot to where we would try to talk our way out of this situation but he said don't become anxious if you before the judges don't think about what you'll even think or speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak so what would premeditated thoughts do no doubt make a mess and it might even make a coward out of us because we might think of a way to compromise and get out of it so look at what Jesus wants to replace anxiety with arama word from God so it will be given you in that hour what you shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you now look at what we trade what we trade for the spirit of God leading us and speaking out of us we get anxiety or we can go the the other way and trade our anxiety back send it back down to Hell where it come from and let our father give us the right words to say which do we want notice again in Luke 10:41 and Jesus answered and said unto her you're familiar with the scripture I know Martha Martha Thou Art careful exact same word anxious or anxiety never remember Martha got upset at Mary cuz Martha was fixing Jesus food and drink and all of that hey that would be an important thing would it not sisters if Jesus was at your house and you'd want to feed him and you'd want to take care of him but yet her sister was constantly wanting to sit at the feet of Jesus and be able to eat of the Mana so Jesus has to turn and he doesn't actually rebuke Mary but he actually speaks to Martha and Jesus answered and said her Martha Mara Thou Art careful or anxious and troubled about many things but well I guess I don't understand why that we as Believers add to this scripture and we add this one word million one million and ain't that the way life is oh I got to do this and we got to go there and we got to do this and we got to go that that's contrary to the words of the Lord Jesus when it's all said and done when it comes right down to Deaths and it comes down to the reality of God according to what the Lord Jesus said there's one thing needful all the rest of it all you say oh I can't do it without I can't do without it but if you're put in the hospital tomorrow and you're in a coma could you do without it so if you were in a car ready and you were laid up and you broke every bone in your body oh I've got this great appointment I've got to do this I've got to do that I've got to do that can it be put on hold it can be so notice how Jesus now sets it in order but one thing is needful Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her now Mar say it may make you upset but I will not take this from Mary now believe it or not most of us have both a Martha and a Mary in our own makeup so we have things that we can be so upset and so troubled about and we will let the Needful Things Go aren't you glad though the Lord Jesus is merciful notice in Philippians CH 4: 6 same word be careful for nothing now Paul is not telling us to live a halfhazard life and PA don't even worry about them I you know drive down the road 90 M an hour around a 5505 m m hour curve and don't worry about this just drive Reckless don't don't be careful about nothing he's not saying not to be careful but he's talking about anxiety and being anxious as I begin to study these scriptures the other day as the Lord begin to put together for me each scripture that I read I begin to ask for more help Lord help me y'all already asking Lord help me Lord help me why because it's our human makeup it's our human nature for many of us to become so anxious and to become so worried and so Laden down and we allow the devil to Rob us of the blessings of God be careful or anxious for nothing but in every Thing by prayer in supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God now the same Greek word there which means exactly what I told you that is to be anxious notice again Peter says in 1 Peter 5: 7 casting all your care upon him for he carth for you now you know what I found amazing was the same word so the reason we don't have to be anxious is because Jesus is for us so why should most of us do it I mean it's not human anxiety of course but Peter chose to use a word that you'd think it wouldn't even match his Heavenly Body it wouldn't even match his his glorified state but to draw from it that would be able to pour out to us how concern the Lord Jesus is about what we go through in life casting all your care upon him because for he carth for you now watch the prophet as he was here and he was dealing of course with many many people and their troubles and he said the uncertainty of the security of the nation not only this nation but all nations because little Nations can just got the same weapons that the big Nations has got we can certainly say Amen to that in this day can't we the security is certainly uncertain and we don't know just what there's unrest among the people now if it was that way in 1961 can you imagine what it is now traveling around from Nation to Nation I find that everyone seems to be nervous and the psychic Wards are filling up and the people down the street there seems to be so much anxiety and they rush just as hard as they can till they don't have courtesy even one for the other and I noticed it amongst all people they go down the road at night and the man will diem his life and the next man won't dim his lights just go on and pay no attention to it let him go let him go and blind him as necessary that's Pentecostal cursing now I w't ask how many of you tonight are Pentecostal cursors so when you meet somebody and they've got their lights on bright and you reach over and flip yours on bright that'll show you buddy you just cussed uh oh guilt is a hound dog in the hen house I didn't see it right now now watch our brother Brandon would pick this up no I know this is not deep it's not a great tremendous great Revelation I'll tell you why we can't get no deeper because we think things like this don't matter amen let him go blind him as necessary that's Pentecostal cursing you see let him alone oh he says we shouldn't have done that no matter what the other fell does let's show what we're made of let's get something down in here to show love and respect and respect the next man and love him whether he's right come on now friends we're separating bride from Brites I hate to be the bear of bad news but we've got a lot of folks around this message they're just simply brandit that's all they are they will not go in the Rapture they'll go straight to the tribulation period you think this flood is something I told Carol yesterday we talking about I said you know people look around I'm I'm just marvel at the kindness and the generosity of people and what all people are doing but I told her said can you imagine in the tribulation period it'll not be the way it is right now in this flood time and disaster relief it'll be every man every woman every boy and every girl fending for themsel because they will be starving they will be looking the Bible says they will cry they will seek for peace and safety they will cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them it will be as it was when the Lord Jesus told oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I would have gathered thee together if thou would have only known the time of thy visitation and Jesus said there will not be one stone left upon the other and we know of course whenever Josephus wrote about what went on that the people would wait in the streets and the people of Jerusalem would die and they would fight over who got their body to eat it they ate the bark off the trees they ate grass they ate bugs they ate ropes they ate animal skins and hides it was every man for himself you imagine whenever the blood of the Lord Jesus Takes the bride there will be no genuine love left on the face of the Earth people will kill one another for food they will absolutely turn into hell oh Lord Jesus let us miss it father notice there'll be no love there'll be no respect notice he said if you just love those who love you the Sinners do the same thing but we're different when Christ has come into our heart we love those who don't love us love the unlovable can Word of Life say Amen to this quote tonight love the unlovable and we were unlovable one time too and we were unlovable one time too and you know Christ loved us until we came to him then if we be of Christ and Christ is in us we have the same Spirit of fellowship and cooperation and helping to try to move the great load and make life a little easier for our fellow men and the church said oh I know this is not a convention quote it's more of a Wednesday night quote but it's a pretty good quote anyway isn't it we want to make life a little bit better for people and not just for those of course that we love but for those that are absolutely unlovable now because the age is so anxious and we know that the pre-tribulation period is already among the people now and we can see the nations of the world have turned against Israel over and over again more human resolutions uh uh have been passed against Israel than all the rest of the nations of the world put together and they seem to be looking for another excuse by which they can penalize Israel and now of course our president and blinking are telling Israel if they don't do this and this and this that they are facing an arms embargo and remember Israel and their Iron Dome and their David slang and all of that they may have helped invent that but they cannot afford to buy every one of those missiles to be able to shoot them down because they average from 30,000 some of them up to $200,000 a piece so whenever they're sending two and 300 missiles at a time then you count 50,000 100,000 150,000 easy in a few days you can wind up spending millions of dollars so what does our great nation do they put them under pressure you do what we tell you or we will not send you missiles to defend yourself now remember being a friend with America comes with a great price because America will give you money as long as you do what America say you know the sad part about it is we got folks in church that do the same thing oh I'm the greatest Pastor they ever seen in their life until I do something they don't approve of and then boy they get mad in the Hornet and they claim to be filled of the Holy Ghost well I'll tell you one thing I'm glad my Holy Ghost helps me to love those that differs with me come on somebody but America that's part of being her friend you do what we say do and then we'll reward you yeah that's the way they are so then it puts Netanyahu it puts the liud party it puts shenet it puts the mad it puts all of these things in Israel under a great deal of pressure and even though they're looking at it and they think this is the best thing for us to do but our government says no we don't want you to do that and we can see the same way in our own life this person tells you to do this this one tells you to do that you get you know influenced by your job you get influenced by people on social media as I was reading this week that even some of the Hollywood leftists that is left as they can be that they have started limiting their children's time on the internet and their children's time on social media because they've been having to take some of their children to get therapy because of so many hours that they're spending in social media and especially young girls because they see the images and the body shapes and forms and they look at theel and they don't find themselves as pretty unattractive as them images that are put on there and they they go through all kinds of this thing suicide rates have went up why it's not bringing them peace it's causing more anxiety so they they're constantly bombarded is anybody going to say Amen with me tonight it is more anxiet Y and more anxiety every day that we live in and what does it cause and that anxiety runs in on our nerves which God gave us of course what would we be without nerves but Satan knows how to multiply that to create or cause a nervous tension watch this he said we're living in a neurotic age nervous tension everybody racing here going there going nowhere and it's just that kind of an age and I know this church of be plagued with it as everywhere is plagued with it he said the Tabernacle is plagued with it everywhere you mean to tell me the church our brother brandom was plagued with nervous tension oh my you understand setting in brother brandom's church was people that had been married three and four times do you understand there was people sting in brother bram's church that had all kinds of trouble all types of anxieties so for those of you that are looking for a perfect church that has nobody in it that's been remarried nobody in it that has problems and issues I hate to be the bad bad bad news tonight but you ain't going to find one cuz there is no such a thing the Ephesian church is not perfect the church at Corinth was not perfect the church at galatia was not perfect but what you need to do is find the church where God has ordained you to be there get behind it with all your might and your strength and if you got a man God that's telling you the truth get behind him and pray for him and instead of trying to add his trouble pray for him that God will lead him praise the Lord love your brothers and sisters do what you can to help one another but notice brother brandom identifies it now he's preaching another one of the local churches are in Jeffersonville so he was referring to that church and also his church the Tabernacle is played with it everywhere the whole world it's a day of pressure h hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait oh my hurry hurry hurry up and wait Drive 90 oh my goodness 90 miles an hour and then get home for supper and wait two hours till it gets ready that's right it's the time in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension the wife say something a little contrary and you want to fly off temper husband say something and you'll patch your foot and tell him to get in the room see well now husband I don't want no words with you you get out there wife I'm so nervous see why what's the matter all this together this tension building up then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place that's right so it builds up and then you do something wrong and then you act out of your place that's right now it'll make the poor act that way it'll make the middle class we're hearing a lot about the middle class we always do in the election year so let let bring in the middle class from another perspective shall we the middle class will act that way it'll make the rich act that way so you got the lower class the middle class and the upper class sound lot to me it covered everybody on the earth don't you so the all like that what if you speak to the kitty come in your mama oh there you are it builds up oh my you feel like you're notice you feel like you're going to your heads going to come off I know I'm with it every day so I know what it means you mean Elijah that with that kind of pressure every day no days off Church age book each age had it it pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches self living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in you understand the majority of people on the face of the Earth today are fitted for this age you're not you're they are fitted to live in drunkenness and blindness in Le DEA it don't make them sick they're all looking for a great time they figure if they can flip the hide house and get Trump in there boy the whole thing's going to turn upside down I agree it's going to turn up upside down it don't matter no difference who gets in there this nation is done my hope is not on November the 5th my hope is in the coming of the Lord Jesus now watch this there's a difference between being nervous and a demon of nervousness anointing you now remember God made us with nerves emotions and feelings un let everybody be attentive and be careful but when a demon of nervousness will start moving on an individual it's it's more than they normally would feel it's similar but beyond what they normally deal with in their nervousness now watch this 5 years ago when I was here I saw you now listen to this this is a discernment and in the vision the prophet recalls seeing this this individual five years before when he was in Jonesboro Arkansas I saw you you went through a line or something you was healed then between you and I comes a dark shadow it's shaking and jumping there's only one thing that can mean that's a demon a demon of nervousness so it's everybody then that would have bouts of nerves is that a demon not necessarily but can you imagine then for all of this nervous age that if we would allow a demon of nervousness to jump on us and we're already nervous anyway then here would come this jerking shaking demon is that right now notice what this Demon Done to this individual it's a woman you think sometimes you've lost your mind isn't that right but he's a liar now want you notice how he separates this he does not call this this Christian woman a liar Hallelujah he does not call this woman a liar but he addresses what is anointing her thinking and you'll never find him ever referring to a demon as a her so he wants this woman to see where this is is coming from now he said he's a liar you're not you're just the same as anybody else but he's trying to get you down lady Oh Glory to God don't you pay no attention to that now I want you to watch him now as he challenges this demon thou devil in the name of Jesus Christ you're exposed come out of the woman Leave Her Go rejoicing sister you're free now may the Lord bless thee Oh Glory to God thank you Lord Jesus come here sister what's the matter you're you're you're all nervous mental nervousness you just feel like you can't get to yourself you want a place to put your foot this is right now at the cross I can make it leave you but it'll come back it's it's causing this presence now he couldn't stay here if you had to but it'll come back but if the good man of the House's face isn't there you've wanted a place to start you see friends this is what happens to people sometimes they come and get prayed for and God will do something for them and they may feel better for an hour two maybe a day maybe a week and that thing will try to come back you understand what happens when the men of God that are called and ordained of God to pray for you and if they've been given delegated authority by the Lord Jesus and to make that devil leave then that devil when you're away from that man of God and you're feeling weak and you don't feel the anointing you don't feel the presence of the Lord that's when he will try to come back oh brother Donnie's out of town oh my goodness brother Daryl Arizona oh my where's brother John where's brother Joe where's brother Pete where's all the brothers that oh no oh no but but remember if you've got the good man of faith in your soul if I'm a thousand miles away the good man of faith is resident in your soul now that's keep this in mind that's when the devil will try to attack you and many times it'll be when you're by yourself oh my what this now you've wanted a place to start now start from here Lord in the name of Jesus Christ now watch this Shadow Of Darkness like a Mist hanging at the woman in the name of Jesus Christ demon of nervousness leave the woman now go and rejoice look be happy just rejoice and thank God it'll stay away from you just believe it now you imagine a man that was called by God to break into that type of Realm and whenever he would see this this sphere of demons some of them would look like bats and have long hair hanging down off an epilepsy devil would look like a tortoise shell now I'm quoting to your quote why why would they take on such form I don't have a clue I'm just glad God gave us a window to the supernatural in the end time to be able to unveil that devil do you believe the same Lord Jesus is here tonight to set you free from nervousness if you've got it listen to me friends as I'm reading these quotes to you if your faith can rise to that level you can be free as I read it several years ago I had an Affliction in my body and always really really Troublesome and really been bothered me I was listening to a tap and I was down the basement building something and and while I was listening to the discernment there and the presence of God came in that little room where I was and I thought wow it's strange I mean it was a really good tape I've already been blessed but it was just something that just like could swep in you know what I'm talking about you felt it before yourself and brother Brandon it was before that he did it as serman and he called someone out and told them exactly the same thing that I was experiencing and what I found was something like leaped within me and that thing left my body right there now you see we want the message of the hour to be not just something that was recorded back 1955 and 1965 and 1958 I believe that same thing if we will receive it in the right way it can happen to you right here tonight watch this let's go now to oppression Judges 6: 7 and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you look at what the word oppressed means to squeeze to squeeze and press I get in your mind is you would take a lemon a lime or an orange or something that you're trying to get the juice out of it and you squeeze and if you do what Carol does when she gets limes which are harder she'll roll it on the counter or if I'm there she'll have me to do it if I'm not there she'll take a hammer take it on the back porch and soften the outside of it and then roll it because you get more juice out of it so this is the word that the auar of Judges used this is what they were doing to you in Egypt you understand demons out of hell are trying to squeeze the very life out of us oh my look this way sister something's wrong with you yeah you also have bad eyes too and you're a nervous case aren't you you have a real demon depression isn't that right oppression just bothers you all the time nervousness isn't that right God bless you if I'll tell you that you're healed will you believe me all right go home you're healed Hallelujah you understand understand if the Lord Jesus was here tonight preaching this service he could do no more for you than what he's already done he would just try to get your faith to a level to where you could believe it notice again I want to say there's so many people passing through here that suffering with mental oppression demon manifestation now look children I'm not here tonight to scare you I'm not here tonight to try to open up a realm Beyond where we should walk but I want to let you know what this is that you're feeling and I want to let you know it's not you it's your en but he wants to make you think it's you you're weird you're strange you're crazy you cross the line there's no hope for you you'll never get back he is a liar but he tries to make you believe his lies by symptoms lying vanities but I'm here tonight to tell you there is a way out hallelujah hallelujah freedom from anxiety freedom from nervousness freedom from oppression Freedom From Fear freedom from depression I don't think you have to wait till Sunday I think you can lay it right here tonight and walk out free by the presence of God demon manifestation Satan I seen a vision breaking before me of a young lady she went back there and sat down a few minutes ago that thinks she's crossed the separating line don't let Satan tell you that as long as you love God God still loves you anybody believe that tonight as long as you still love God God loves you and I'm going to tell you one thing Word of Life Church if almighty God offers Mercy to people that you and I think is beyond Mercy who are we to say they can't have Grace I want somebody to stand here tonight and tell me how we have got a right to say this person's this and this person is that you don't know that if almighty God can give people Mercy who am I to say they can't have have it I hope and pray some of the message folks never get to a place they need a lot of Grace cuz they're going to be hurting when they do need it oh my for the same judgment that you meet out shall be Meed to you again my goodness you have a real dark look around you and I don't mind telling you I'm glad I'm not made to see all this okay I've been able to see some of it before I've never asked for it and I'll be perfectly fine the rest of my life if I never see it again but I've dealt with them enough to sense when they're around and they're here tonight and they are getting some kind of scared too I love it when the Holy Ghost makes nervous demons nervous but don't the Holy Ghost shouldn't make you nervous you ought to be calm tonight cuz the Lord's fixing to do something Hallelujah you have a real dark look around you cause you're suffering from some kind of Oppression demon bothering you now friends if we tonight God would open our eyes into another realm and let us see what would be here tonight it would probably scare us to death some of us it would haunt our dreams we probably would would take weeks if not longer to get over it what is right here present can you imagine those demons the prophet said they would follow his meetings so say he was in Colombia South Carolina and evil spirit was forced to leave people and he would go from there say to Charlotte or wherever more and then demons would go to the next meeting why because them demons knew there would be people there that didn't believe they would ridicule that prophet of God they would make fun of him a church is a perfect place to get demon possessed that's why brother benam would tell people to Bow their heads and be reverent respectful right why you making a demon go out they ain't looking for a dog ain't looking for a cat or looking for a human being to go into so the gend to somebody that's got a bad mood they got a bad Spirit they've developed a critical spirit you know they're just mou they hate this and they hate that that's a very good home Prophet called it a church home for for a demon well praise the Lord everybody oh my now think I want you to be aware that every day of your life these things are around you taunting you tormenting you whispering to you but you don't have to put up of the devil's garbage now what you have a real dark look around you CA you're suffering from some kind of Oppression demon bothering you is that true you're haunted it's like something haunting at you all the time it' run you wild if it could now what's amazing aming is this person isn't a Christian now watch brother Brenham goes down there in this in this quote and he said now will you at this time accept him as your personal savior ain't that amazing that an individual could have this kind of Faith operate the gift of God and wasn't even saved will you at this time accept him as your personal savior before this group of people and promised by God's help from this night on you'll live for him the best of your knowledge and the rest of your days if you will by God's help I'll make the evil thing leave you and never return again praise be to God now you talking about a time when you got a voice of a prophet of God and that devil on that person can you imagine now it's nervous time for demons oh Lord I love just for a bit to been able to look into that room into that real whether than you imagine when they got back down in Hell together and they was arguing back and forth why did you holler why did you holler at me I was standing up there under in the platform and you you cowed you you was sitting Plum back there in the church he didn't even know that I was there but as soon as you said help me help me you coward why did you do that and there was a black streak that formed between you on the platform and me I was headd back there on the back pew and all of a sudden them prophetic eyes followed that black streak and it unveiled both of us so we got two with one discernment hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'll tell you one thing if we could have a testimony meeting tonight from the Devils down in hell you wouldn't hear them say what the believe the sign people say they would not make a YouTube video and said I'll tell you one thing that man's a false prophet he's a liar he's this and that if they could tell the truth they say it's one of the scaredest times I ever had in my life it was like that man could look right down in The Souls of human beings he saw my claws he saw my feathers hanging off of me he saw this and that and the other well come on somebody aren't you glad our God now look there is no prophet in this building tonight to be able to discern your heart but the very word of God that I'm preaching is a discerner and he can go right down to the deepest recesses of your soul and declare to the Lord Jesus what you have need of in this [Applause] service you're B bothered with nervousness any how that's your trouble you believe he'll take it from you it's your age and this time there's probably only one remedy for you and that's Christ it's a horrible thing it's the worst feeling anyone could have nervousness there's nothing like feeling that that distress you see but Jesus Christ can make you well so you mean nervousness it's actually like an Affliction a sickness if you're nervous here tonight Beyond human nervousness I'm talking about do you understand it's no more than a demon spirit that would try to anoint you like a person with cancer or a person with a gross or a malignant tomb it's a demon he haunts your mind he keeps you out of church he tries to keep you away from The Fellowship of the saints of God to torment you to get you off by yourself and every friend you lose and every friend that you cut off you get weaker and weaker and weaker what you want to do weaken you down till you get to a place you can't take it no more and you ain't got confidence in nobody and you ain't got respect for no preachers and you don't need nobody no more you understand what you're doing you're getting yourself off in a corner and then the horde of demons are going to make their attack and you'll not be able to withstand it dear God it's oppression demon oppression like a dark shadow ble hangs and it always causing you to be that way but he will heal you if you can believe will you believe now I'm asking you he can deliver you this very night of your nervousness will you believe friends are as real as you're real I see them many times when they leave I've seen them leave right here at this platform I've seen some of them in the shape of bats look like long hairs hanging on their legs but an epileptic demon look like a tortoise with round legs hanging up but use said demon of Oppression seems more like of a cloud form like a wave a cloud form but like a wave for the first time since the fall of Adam and the Garden of Eden we get a view into the way they appear the form the shape that they take their traits their sounds even the words they say can't you hear them he said they're saying keep them from believing keep them from believing you imagine in that realm in that fourth dimension where they communicate he could hear them de demons and they were gathering in the service he said the demons are here and the angels of God are here unbelief is accumulating and faith is accumulating which way will the battle go he says depends on which way you believe so the demons were saying keep them from believing keep them from believing so evil spirits right there in church keep them from believing occupy your mind with this occupy your mind that over the Don stor that r you oh brother darl meant that right at you oh this this this what is it it's to try to keep you from believing but the angels of God are standing right by your seats here tonight you

his soul I was convinced he was struck out but I saw that ball I am the Umpire you're only the pitcher get it in your mind the devil is the pitcher he's the one that pitches all this stuff towards you sickness evil thought this and that and the other but your umpire behind the plate thank God it ain't people thank God it's not even yourself thank God it's not your feelings thank God it's not your

those in the visible audience for those of you that are home or those of you that are stream this service take him at his word believe what he says if you believe what you've heard tonight the nervousness nervous tension oppression depression fear anxiety whatever it is it can leave you right now if it hasn't already Hallelujah and remember if it leaves you now it don't mean that he won't try to come back but you let the good man of Faith stand right there and say you are a liar I refuse admittance I am not going to be your home Church you can forget it my house is dedicated a service to almighty God friends you understand you cannot let peace be dominating your heart when you've got nervousness is tearing you up all the time fear frustration that's what it's all for it's to rob you of Peace if we ever needed it we need it now I want you to hold your need your request in your heart I don't want you to lay hands on one another right now just we just we just want to pray don't lay hands on one another right now and maybe you're you're tonight you're not nervous you're not praise the Lord if you're not thank the Lord but I guarantee you they were somewhere he never had me to go this way so I want you to pray with me for them whoever they are with all of our hearts praise the lord lord Jesus I preached what you placed upon my heart I believe it's true Lord God I'm joining my face with the faith of these saints of God ministers in the building and officers deacons trustees and Lord different ones that are called here to help us and then with every believer Lord I pray for every son every daughter Lord I've never experienced depression or I've had sad days and things like that but I've never dealt with what I know know some people have and I know it can be a terrible terrible thing and it don't mean I got more faith in nobody or I'm better no it's just not been the battle that I've had to fight but Lord I pray tonight on their behalf in the name of Jesus if their faith can rise to that same level of the individuals that I read about tonight in the 50s and the 60s I preach and we believe that you're the same yesterday today and forever in the name of Jesus Christ I command every nervous demon to go away from these people Satan I call your bluff tonight and say you are a liar you are trespassing on our inheritance God wants peace to be the umow of our hearts not nervousness and shaking and quivering scared to go here scared to go there you are defeated you demon of Oppression I don't have to see you tonight I don't have to have prophetic eyes to be able to look and see we're declared by the word that you're here to fight us but guess what we're here to fight you back oppression in the name of Jesus take your hand off of these people if there's any suicide that's left hanging around you might as well go with them hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord God father right now as your children we believe the promise of your word now children lay your hands on one another Brothers fits and sisters standing by you you don't feel comfortable by you laying your hand on her just move around and grab a hold of her brother just we just want to pray for one another now hallelujah hallelujah friends you believe I was led of the spirit of God you trust me as your pastor I got an email today before I come to church from someone in South Africa the streams are service and they were so tore up and so tore to pieces because a preacher there in South Africa had been preaching around to the people that the Millennium was going to start tomorrow you ought to thank God for the men of God that come to our church to preach us the truth instead of a bunch of garbage you imagine brother Steve facing what you're facing in your life and you're sitting under some kind of trash and garbage that preachers say God told him to preach let's believe together Hallelujah Heavenly Father we have our hands laid one upon the other Earthly Brothers touching Earthly sisters husbands and wives siblings mothers and fathers touching their children deacons reaching out of their place and touching others musicians singers Lord God we need you tonight Jesus Lord God I believe father that your word is the power that will cause demons to leave and the presence of the Holy Ghost is here right now so father we within ourself would never come against such an army as hell how could we come against beings that stood before your throne that were one time holy created angels how in the world could I ever stand against such I would be an idiot to do so but father with you living in us we are more than a match for the devil tonight I believe you have got men of God on the earth tonight they are called hallelujah oh thank you Lord to cast out Devils out of your children father then the prophet would have us to lay our hands over on one another Eagle to Eagle believer to believer then Lord we believe that that can also Minister strength to one another maybe just another little bit of faith that would help them Lord to believe for whatever it is they have need of oh God I pray right now in the name of Jesus would you heal the sick would you deliver those that are bound father maybe some father God under that oppression of the devil may they be set free tonight father maybe some of these discernments described exactly the way they feel and we have no problem in believing that because even though those people that those Spirits were on then have been dead for many many years yet Spirits do not die so we can see the same traits on people decades thereafter but that also means the Holy Ghost has not die so the same holy ghost that made them demons leave in 195 8 and 1965 can make them leave right here tonight so we're calling on you tonight Lord Jesus bring healing to our troubled hearts father I pray Lord God in Jesus name make them free from oppression set them free from Suicidal Thoughts set them free oh God from nervousness may they walk out of this building tonight oh God in the name of Jesus Christ free from the power of the enemy and if that devil tries to come back may that good man of faith in their heart take these scriptures help them to pin them down and when the enemy comes against them may they just quote it like a Gatling gun and aim for that devil straight to the heart granted I pray tonight father in the name of Jesus Hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight father can we rejoice in the presence of our God hallelujah hallelujah those of you that need Deliverance tonight as a servant of God I speak to you in the name of the Lord Jesus believe it and you'll be well from this night forward hallelujah hallelujah Halle hallelujah thank you Lord God I

there across the mountain in Bard North Carolina don't you I believe he's just same Jesus I believe he loves you just as much as he loves those folks there I believe he's mindful of everything we've got need of friend but sometimes we got to get sick and tired of the devil stealing our joy and we got to be sick and tired of the devil pushing us about and the devil dictating to us it's time for us

I mean those are being in his presence can change us forever and we will allow it to second Samuel chapter 12 verse 1. and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing say one little you lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own hurt to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him I mean Dr B remembered today as we pray just hold your need in your heart heavenly father as we come into your great presence we are so thankful that you're mindful of us Lord Jesus we're asking you take your word and speak to us open our hearts we are very grateful that you have allowed your book called The Bible to be written of true stories most happy and sad both the types of stories that make us rejoice and the type that make us repent we're thankful that it is not fictitious or made up of some people's imagination but it was you who inspired the authors to write it we love it we thank you for it we ask you to be mindful of the needs today of those that are present we know we have many that are sick flu and flu symptoms and viruses and things like that that are going around but we pray you'd be mindful of your children today Father helped me to get out of the way in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask amen God bless you you may be seated the year is 10 35 BC David is now a middle-aged man rich powerful influential has at least three wives many children flocks herds quite a Palace that he lived in he has political ties with Egypt with many of the Great Kings during this time he was totally taken off guard you can imagine as the prophet Nathan comes to bring this story to him I don't know how but somehow he had been able to convince himself for about a year now that he will still okay with God which is more than I can comprehend I trust it is you that a man that loved the Lord so much a man the only man that we have recorded in the scripture that says he was a man after God's Own Heart very beautiful and yet unusual title for any Immortal to have but in this stage of his life is not that same man in one way we look back in retrospect and you're able to see that it was through this LAX type of condition in his life the time when the Kings go out to war and David had not done that so he was trusting maybe too overconfident too much looking to the blessing of God and thinking well you know I'm in a good state right now nothing can happen to me I'm so blessed the lord loves me so much so he enters into this very dangerous time we know that trials can be so difficult and trials can be devastating but after looking at when people get into the lacks time of their life they aren't going through trials I think I prefer trials most of the time the people of God it was not when they were going through such tests and such trials that they fell away but it was when they got lacks when they got cold and different when they were so blessed as we would say they were so happy and you know they become a little bit loose with sir walk with the Lord and this is where we can see that David was now as we pick up where we were last week I'm sure that most of you were quite shocked as I was and I've talked to several this week and um by by text by email by what's out by all types of communication from different people around the world I've come to find out I wasn't the only one that was shocked about David and Bathsheba now in my thinking I've always thought such Grace such Mercy to Bathsheba but after Sunday my view has changed somewhat now I'm thinking such Grace such Mercy to David and we know that God has no problem in identifying women in sin and calling them out so it's not that God had some sort of issue in identifying Bathsheba and her wrong and in her sin but as we read the parable again here this morning if you notice and I'm sure you did that God never blamed Bathsheba for any of this but God identifies her as a few lamb a lamb so you would not call a prostitute a lamb you would not call even Tamar a lamb you would not identify someone like Rahab and I hope it doesn't stumble you but even in the New Testament of carrying over the story of Rahab both in the book of Hebrews and in the Book of James Rahab is still called a prostitute now it's not that the blood coming through the cross did not wipe away her old identity and why the authors chose to still identify her under that name I can't say that I rightly know but all I know is that God allowed these women to be part of the genealogy of the human birth of our savior and for those of you who study genealogy I'm sure you know that it was through the son Solomon that God bought part of the genealogy but not all you see God had also pronounced judgment against one of the seed of David because of his idolatry and God said not one of his seed was set on my throne that one was through the lineage of Solomon but remember David and Bathsheba had another son his name was Nathan Nathan begat children the genealogy kept coming till we come down to the Book of Matthew Joseph come through Solomon's lineage but Mary came through Nathan's both Joseph and Mary were of the seed of David had Mary been of the seed of Solomon the Lord Jesus could have never been the heir to David's throne David remember God promised him friends this is when sovereignty steps in and overshadows man's ignorance I'm so glad he's had to do it he's done it for me is he done it for you so God allowed both Joseph and Mary to be of the genealogy but yet it was through Mary read it when you get time when you read the genealogy there in the Book of Matthew and how that Matthew pins it and writes it down of each one of those women and he changes the terminology when he comes to Mary and he says of whom of whom Jesus was born which is called the Christ God in his sovereignty stepped in and allowed Mary also to come of the genealogy of David that it might be fulfilled he would fulfill and be of the tribe of David even call the son of David can you imagine God allowing himself to come through a man like David all before like Sunday we all had no problem with that I mentioned that for many of you it was the same as it was with me that to be honest with you David was one of my favorite Heroes of the Old Testament and I think Hollywood helped shape all of this in us that we can find it easier to forgive the man than we can the woman [Music] y'all going to preach on there look at me so for David to be forgiven and David to be you know the great Giant Killer and David the mighty a psalmist of Israel and David the harpist and David all of this and that but to accept the fact that David was a sheep stealer and David was a premeditated murderer that's hard on our iconic view isn't it now watch in Genesis chapter 3 verse 11. when Adam and Eve had done wrong notice how God addresses the woman in this wrongdoing and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me now notice man after the fall he doesn't take the blame but in one sense of the word he blames God forgiving her to him the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman the knitted amazing when God sends Nathan the prophet he does not send her to both David and Bathsheba we have no record that Nason ever even addresses Bathsheba in this wrong wonder why she was not the aggressor I hope you can understand it she was actually innocent overpowered by a strong aggressive leader well praise the Lord and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done so God has no problem in addressing women when they aren't wrong right God has no problem in communicating and even indicting them so God personally indicted Adam God personally indicted Eve and God could speak directly to her and yet why does not God do that in the case of David and Bathsheba unless the scenario is different what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat of course as we say both of them are passing the buck until it comes to the serpent and he asked nobody to pass it on to Ahab and Jezebel in First Kings 21 17. and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tish by saying arise go down to meet Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he's in the vineyard of nabos whether he has gone down to possess it you remember the story but to save time you read it when you get time and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the Lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the Lord in the place where the dogs licked the blood of nabos shall the dogs lick thy blood even thine verse 23 and of Jezebel also spoke the spake the Lord saying the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel so God has no problem addressing women as well as men you agree so why doesn't God do that in this case notice again Paul in the New Testament first Timothy 5 6 addressing not a woman just by name but women in general but she that liveth and pleasure is dead while she liveth again Revelation 17 16 and the ten horns which thou solest upon the Beast these shall hate the which what we've been dealing with on Wednesday night and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire so God has no issues no qualms whatsoever in addressing either individual women or women as a category or women as it was here which is wrong so God surely would have had no problem in addressing Bathsheba had Bathsheba been guilty but in the parable the mystery that lays in the parable that Nathan gives to David shows both guilt and innocence now unlike today to where that women are getting more and more of their rights of course and I agree that some of them did need more even coming in the New Testament we find that Paul even though many of the people want to call Paul a woman hater yet Paul actually placed the women of the New Testament in a higher category in Christ Jesus than they ever had in the Old Testament he wrote more about their Liberty in Christ more about their Liberty and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so where these women get that Paul was a woman hater I don't understand it at all he was one of the greatest liberators of the New Testament but not liberators in the sense of sin but liberators in the sense of the Gospel like so God then would have no problem because he's the same one that anointed Paul so he gives Nathan this Parable and he identifies Bathsheba as well he calls back again to second Samuel 12 3 the poor man had nothing saved one little you lamb so he identifies Uriah the hittite as being the pastor now notice this God is going to take a pastoral synetting a setting rather which was something David would have been able to relate to and I hope you understand this that brother Branham makes this comment and how can overcome when he was talking about lot and lot's why and he said your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking now I want you to think of this in this light then that in the Old Testament scenario it was in a similar sense that Uriah the hittite which was her husband would have also been her pastor he would have been the one that would have been leading the flaw now he had a small flock it consisted of his young wife and it all so consisted of children that were still in the home that had been brought to the Earth in between Uriah and his first wife so he raised up Bathsheba along with these children I want you to think of the consequences now that Bathsheba is going to have taken from her so Bathsheba was not asked did she want to come to the King's house she was not asked did she want to leave her home her husband she's now the stepmother of these children but David is looking at it through eyes of what compassion Mercy servitude to God he's looking at it through eyes of lust and selfishness he does not love Bathsheba he does not love Uriah or love the children that are going to be involved now seek of it all that the great amount of pain and anxiety and remember each one of these women brings something into the Kaleidoscope of the Gentile bride when we look at Tamar she brought something totally different than did Rahab and did ruse and yet we look at Bathsheba and I hope the Lord will help me to be able to bring it to you that Bathsheba was not just a one woman individual alone but she represented a spectrum of those that would make up the Gentile bride and she brings something into this genealogical equation that is totally different than the other four women so she's bringing something into this equation as a person with all types of hurt and all types of anxiety and all types of disappointments in life and thrown into a situation that she did not ask to be and yet also an individual that would not let her hurts dominate her life Bathsheba learned to love again Bathsheba learned to trust again that Sheba had to learn can you imagine now she's forced into this situation she becomes with the child of the king she did not ask for that she was taken from her husband forced into the king's bed she was forced from those step children that she had been taken care of right by whom a man of great Authority a man that had she resisted him he could have had her killed just like he did look at the power this man had writing my goodness uriah's own death warrant and he carried it back to the commander-in-chief look what Authority as I've said before God never intended for man to have such power in the first place so the relationship that Nason conveys to David look at the words that he uses which he bought and nourished it and it grew together with him and with his children it did deed of his own meat drink of his own cup laying his own bosom and was unto him as a daughter so every one of these attributes are attributes of deep kindness and affection so what's he doing is contrasting what David did versus what Uriah did so everything your eye did was love it was tenderness it was generaless it was affection and what did David do David come to feed his passion and his lust which was the stranger that come through and he did it out of selfishness out of his own lust praise the Lord which was the exact opposite sip of everything that Uriah had done notice in verse 4 and he said there came a traveler under the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock now here again he's identifying David as being this rich man which has many many flocks and he identifies the other guy as only having one little small you lamb he says of his own flock and of his own herd now to us you know this wouldn't mean very much but David spent many many years of his life as a Shepherd he's supposed to be doing the same thing now that he is King he is a Shepherd over God's people and he said to dress for the wayfaring man that was coming to him but took took the poor man's land and dressed it for the man that was to come now what is David fixing to do David is fixing to divide uriah's flock he's fixing to separate uriah's flock now they were happy they were just a simple family in Israel not a great renowned people who knows if we even know that much about Uriah had this story not come into view I personally believed it must have been the will of God in time for David and Bathsheba to be together how that would have come about I don't have a clue because there was a genetic pool that Bathsheba would have added to the lineage of David that was necessary for Solomon and for Nason and for the other two sons to come through it was through these four sons that the greatest children that David whatever father would come true notice a lot of the other Renegades and you see the mother church that they were born from and you see what a difference they were from Bathsheba now Bathsheba was not the type of woman the natural she was abused by all of this actually some of the Hebrew writers say David basically raped her it was not it was nothing on her own part she did not want to do it and yet a woman that was brought into the economy of God your first time to be beckoned into the Palace of the king it's against your will you're talked into doing something which is against the law of God against your husband against your own conscience and yet the king the greatest man in all of Israel is the one that forces you to do it how terrible now I guess my question to some of you today is this had you been living in the days of King David would you all had enough courage to stand for God and to say David is a sheep stealer and David is a murderer or would we have said well now you know um well now well now what well now some of you would have took up for me you know why because you take up for people now that do the same thing if it's one of your kids or one of your friends or somebody that you like shame on us for having respect a person the Bible calls it sin friends [Applause] now you imagine there were people in that day that heard about because the word got out that what David had done and some of them they were disappointed they were let down and no doubt people ain't changed one bit of what they were right then and some people took up for him said well you know you're right he's just an old dog and he ain't nothing but an old Gentile sorry outfit like King David he's loved to the Lord he's blessed of the Lord I may not totally go along with the way to do but I'll tell you what the blessing of God's on that man's life I ain't never heard nobody play that harp like he can play it I ain't heard nobody ever heard nobody sing like that man can sing have you ever heard anybody write a Psalm the way David Bob that man's a man of God he but God said he was wrong I want you to listen what kind of impression that Uriah made on your prophet brother REM says it this way when I get to Glory I want to walk up to Uriah and shake his hands and say God be praised for your testimony meant something to me in my Earthly Journey is that something a what Elijah is going to walk up and shake hands with Uriah the hittite and say your testimony meant something to me that's quite a man to me is it not to you now notice David then being the aggressor and as he moves into this spot as being the Predator I hate sexual predators I don't care if they're a preacher I don't care if they're a king I don't care if they claim to be a prophet I don't hate their soul but I hate that conniving low-down evil thing that gets on and let me tell your parents something in this age of social intercommunication that we have you better watch your children you better watch your daughters because we've got prayers oh my that love to pray on our teenage daughters and our teenage Sons well come on somebody say Amen some of you are too trusting in the first place and you know everything's all right my boy goes to church I don't mean one thing to God your boy ain't got the Holy Ghost he ain't no different than David was your girl ain't got the Holy Ghost ain't no different than anybody else was [Applause] now whenever we look at this scenario you know to be honest with you I don't like preaching this about David man he's one of my favorite Heroes I mean that you know this is a giant killer this is the bear killer this is the lion killer but I've got to add to his resume he's a Uriah killer can great people do stupid things great people can much less us ignoramuses hahaha and it ain't too astounding to me that crazy people can do crazy things but what have we done to a lot of these people we've bleached them out we bleached them out and made them where they were just almost faultless and without fault we need to take another read in our Bible I'll tell you every person that ever steps their feet down the streets ago you know how they're going to get there the grace of God oh my so David divides this flock this loving wonderful simple little home oh my goodness notice David the murderer second Samuel 11 14 and it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joe I've been sent by the hand of Uriah and he wrote in the letter saying set you your ride in the Forefront of the hottest battle and retire you from him that he may be smitten and dying it came to pass what joab observed the city that he has signed Iran to a place where he knew the Valiant men were and the men of the city went out and fought with job and therefore some of the people of the Servants of David Uriah the hittite died also yet when he hears this in parabolic form he gets so mad why it was a nameless story so if you and I look at scenarios and we don't know who it is but we just show that ain't right go ahead of God I'll tell you one thing and then we attach a name and all of a sudden totally changed you need a closer walk with God remember friends the bride is going to be part of the judgment we are going to judge angels now let me just paint this soil say where I'm going with this God will not tolerate a sheep stealing King he will not tolerate a sheep stealing preacher neither will God tolerate a sheep stealing disease do you understand every child of God that deals with cancer with TB with pneumonia with all these diseases do you understand one day them demons that caused that are going to stand before us and they are going to give an account for trying to steal our life on this Earth I don't want to be no part of them demonic warfare to you because they're going to stand before God every devil that's tried to talk you out of your place every devil that's trying to talk you away from the word of God one day they're going to stand before you and they are going to be judged and condemned now watch David's response in verse 5 and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man hmm because the prophet does such a wonderful job in setting this Force he still don't realize it's him so David passes judgment and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that has done this thing shall surely die of all the blindness this is the worst kind because it makes us blind to ourselves how many has ever been there and done that and then all of a sudden the Lord by his Mercy opens your eyes and you say Lord have mercy it's so easy for us to see the blindness I wish brother so and so could I wish brother Paul could see how faulty I wish brother Aaron could say boy I'll tell you one thing I wish he could see how far glory to God I wish he could be like me I just wish everybody in the church could be like me well as the pastor I wish they ate I hope he ain't watched David render the Judgment in verse six he shall restore the lamb Thor full because he did this thing because he had no pity where did he get this now because of the way Nathan conveyed it the rich man was merciless no pity on this poor man and David picked it up Nathan said to David thou art the man you can imagine where he hears these words anybody ever done that besides me when that old heart goes and you feel the flush in your cheeks you can feel your blood pressure as it's going up and all of a sudden thou thus saith the Lord God of Israel I Anointed The King over Israel are not delivered thee out of the hand of Saul by coveting committing adultery bearing false witness and killing he trespasses for of the Ten Commandments yeah it Still Remains righteous enough to pronounce the judgment on some nameless character I could not imagine the anxiety and the trauma but this man now enters into him David sunk so low that he used the sword of the enemy to kill Uriah you see those who have left this message and it blessed the prophet and blast the bride that but then itself is condemnation enough but by using the sword of CNN ABC CBS Fox YouTube Google by using the sword of social media to try to kill this bride they add damnation to their judgment it would have been bad enough had they done it on their own but to bring it out as I saw one of them a few years ago that said in a local television station there in Louisville and was going to give a little essay of this message and how rotten it was in him formally setting at the Tabernacle and and he asked that his identity would be hid and asked that he would sit behind a screen and his face would not be seen because he feared for his life and I saw that I saw you coward you traitor you better fear for your soul not your life there ain't nobody in the mess is going to kill a person like that ain't nobody in the message going to get out for him and yet to do that to bring all of this on the prophet and his message come on saying so sit there and look at me like that don't you see what David done this is why God he just kept adding more and more to this sin notice in verse 9 wherefore thou Hast despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil and thy sight now once again how God is going to lay the blame thou has killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and assign him with the sword of the children family so after he forces himself on her then he takes her to be his wife he does not even allow her the 30 days of mourning why he's worried about his own height she's going to start showing so here David as he's sharing these words by now his soul is opened the sword has penetrated his soul let's just say Nathan can see he's so distraught his heart rate his blood pressure is affecting him physically Nathan looks at him and says Thou shalt not die that soon the mercy of God turns David's judgment and God forgives him and releases him from his own penalty of death Amazing Grace how sweet is him God's grace could forgive him but God's government demands you see this is something I'm not sure a lot of message folks understand that whenever they do wrong that God can forgive him yes he will and he wants to but you see when we do wrong we are sowing seeds and our repentance does not go out there and dig up all them seeds out of the ground but it simply pardons us and we won't have to answer on the other side of the veil for them but we planted that crop and the crop will come up that's God's government now God's mercy can forgive him and God right there the display of Grace come on the scene and he said Thou shalt not die but the sword will never leave your house so God accepted the sentence of the four-fold punishment now watch this I put this down so and skip over it so the baby died Absalom killed amnon joab killed Absalom I donate you was killed by Ben and I so David reaped fourfold and that's just Tamar was forced by her half-brother Absalom tries to take to Kingdom goes into David's concubines out on the roof in public View of everybody Tamar's life was ruined David sowed lust he ripped lust David sowed murder he reaped murder notice in verse 10 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou Hast despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittype to be thy one now my little friend David's adultery was a sin of passion and we know if you know the law you know even today that many times defense attorneys will try to defend a client that has done things and that even the judges and the you know all the law understand that there is Crimes of Passion a rage a fit of anger and someone loses their temper and they kill someone and a defense attorney will try to plead the case that way and even God in his love understood that David's adultery was a crime a passion but his murder of Uriah was premeditated murder Lord God oh Jesus notice verse 11 thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee notice God does not say against thee and Bathsheba I will take thy wives die notice all of this is personally directed now to King David I will take thy wives from before thine eyes and give them unto Thy Neighbor Absalom lived in a house right next door to David he shall lie with thy wives and the sight of this son for thou didst it in secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son and David said unto Nathan I notice the difference between David and Adam I just read to you just a few moments ago what Adam said the woman that thou gave us to me this is why God conspire David the death penalty brother sister when you do wrong the thing is do you know how to repent and there's one thing about David you have to give him credit the man knew how to repent Saul did not know how he blamed this one he blamed that but he blames somebody else true repentance is a great gift from God don't blame your wife don't blame the pastor don't blame the children don't blame the church assume you're on and ask God to forgive you repentance and so moves the heart of God oh my Lord God David said unto Nathan ah not her what if she hadn't been out there taking the mcval I would have never said it ain't my fault don't blame me oh I love the way he grabs a whole to the heart of God and that in that moment the heart of God was moved against a sheep stealing murdering King praise the Lord hmm I have sinned against the Lord Nathan said unto David the Lord also you imagine that quick the Lord also has put away thy sin Thou shalt not die how be it because by this deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die Nathan departed into his house and the Lord struck the child that uriah's wife notice how God is still calling her uriah's wife but Uriah is dead and David is now married to her but God's still calling her uriah's wife now this is a bad scenario whether it's a wife or a car or a house or spiritual sheep God's calling them belonging to another man and you've got them uh-huh come on now notice in verse 18 that it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died as I said earlier I believe from the genetic makeup and the DNA that bathsheeta Bathsheba would have attributed into mixing with David God somehow in his plan must have had it that they would be together with your eye fulfill this life and David would have met her in a uh the right kind of way and they would have been joined together maybe that was the will of God and you know Satan is so cunning that if he can get a little bit of insight about the program of God and let me just be honest with you and say I don't know how much Satan can always see ahead of time but apparently he can see some things ahead of time brother Brown tells us about Brother Richard Blair from Arkansas and he said that brother Blair the devil tried to make brother Blair doubt brother Branham and question him now there was a scenario happened that brother Brown got very very sick at the point of death and sister Blair call Brother Branham on the phone and brother Brandon but prayed for him and the Lord spared his life and brother Branham relates this scenario on tape and you can hear it and he said that the devil knew that brother Blair was going to need him now how did the devil know that I don't know exactly but it sounds like there are some things that Satan can be able to see in the making and he will try to mess it up as if though it will foil the whole program of God does that make sense to you so then when you look at this it would have seemed as if though there's no way God would have ever blessed any Union between David and Bathsheba why because Satan messed up the time it was the right people but the wrong time in the wrong place which is just as much out of the will of God as if it's the wrong people now watch this the prophet and believer's position in Christ he said the main thing is if we can find where God's word belongs in our life God sets times and God sets limits then it works all to that time now notice he said God set time and God sets limits then it all works to that time so it's not just the will of God Alone that we're looking for but we're looking at the right time and he said people tried to do it within themselves and they try to make God's word fit in their program but you've got it vice versa you've got to fit in God's program and we find that that's true now Moses when he was there knowing that God had made him a promise he was going to deliver the children of Israel Moses knowing he was called for that purpose now when you have a call from God that doesn't altogether a name that you just jump right out and you're doing the will of God now listen carefully you have to find the will of God and the time of God to do it I may believe Moses is called to be the liver he was called to be the deliverer that God had ordained for send him down there but Moses jumps ahead of the program of God now remember God told them I told Abraham that they would go down and sojourn into a land and be a stranger for 400 years how many knows how many years they stayed 430. God said 400. well where did the 30 years come will it come by Moses and also the people Moses missed the time of God that means every missed the time of God well I sure have now people think because they're called to do this or that the other whatever it is as soon as they feel the call and feel God calling them to do something they feel that's the time to jump right out and go after it and if you're not careful you'll get in more trouble than the man who don't even move because you may have found the will of God for you as an individual but you missed the timeline now notice he said Moses thought the children of Israel will understand I said you have to find the will of God and the time of God to do it and Moses thought well the children of Israel will understand now that I'm to be the deliverer so he starts out and he killed him that in other there's no way in the world that you and I believe that God was the one who called Moses to kill the Egyptian so Moses starts out on his resume a lot like David so he's a murderer now did God want that on Moses resume there ain't no way how did that come about he got out of the will of God he missed the time how long was it I don't have a clue but there must have been an element of time and Satan messed him up on the time frame and caused all of this mess and chaos cause the children of God to suffer for 30 more years than necessary well I wish somebody preached with me this morning now notice so he starts out to do it he killed a man and he found out the children of Israel did not understand yet Moses thought they would understand what was missing in this whole scenario the time of God the time of God Moses was the right man and the church said he was the right man for the hour but the hour had not yet synchronized quite where it was right and it enters into a complete mess then Moses lost all hopes can you imagine Moses lost all hopes the power that he had thinking that the freedom wasn't for the children of Israel now Moses gets all discouraged and gets all down on the mouth as we'd say and he lost all hope that it was even for the children of Israel what God even going to do it well God must not love him God don't care for him and no doubt the devil was turning it around and blaming God in Moses mind when it wasn't God's fault at all it was Moses fault he lost all thoughts of Freedom so God met him one day in a burning bush and then when God season came along just exactly then he revealed his plans to Moses now the reason that Moses had forgot about Freedom God's promised that he would free them but God hadn't forgot about it Moses tried in himself and failed so what happened here with David David got in himself and committed adultery so David takes Bathsheba to himself not in love but in lust I firmly believe that David and Bathsheba fell in love later but God never intended for them to be joined together in the birthing Canal of lust oh my Moses tried it himself and failed that's what the church has done many times we've tried in ourselves to do things and we failed to find God's element of time God has times for a season he has seasons for his word he has times in the scripture where it said in the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick you talking about mind-blowing I want you to listen to this there was times when the Lord was there to heal the sick that's where when Jesus was ministering too you imagine when the Lord Jesus was here ministering to Jesus had to operate in the season the Bible says in certain places Jesus went in and healed them all and then he went into another place and he couldn't do any Mighty Miracles because of their unbelief and the angel would trouble the water when when the people were ready at the Lord God's pleasure in his season maybe that other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick wow the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sin I'll tell you a friend I love to sing I love to shout I love to have prayer lines I love all that but if we're not careful we're creating another repeat to where we feel like if we don't have a prayer line God can't move we feel like every special meeting's got to have a prayer line or God don't move come on don't get quiet on me if we're not careful we're going right back around the mountain that we come away from years and years ago our God is not going to be told what to do he's not going to be told how to move God wants us to follow him not him follow us [Applause] we find out that God works everything seasonally seasonally and now when Moses when he failed to find what he failed to find was the time limit of God and many times we try to do the program ourselves and fail to direct what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will and the time of God so now here stands David indicted by God's David's sin was so rotten so vile David could be restored to Fellowship but the Judgment must be lived out now let me let us look at Bathsheba for a few moments can we try if you can to be able to let her be the sister that she really is she is the one that they say Proverbs 31 was written about who can find the virtuous ah so if your mother was a harlot would you write that about her if your mother was a prostitute would you write that she was a model of a virtuous woman but let's look at her realistically now Bathsheba was a victim who suffered from many life-changing situations after that invitation to the Palace she was separated from her husband as being a military wife so she's already dealing with that whenever David beckons her to the Palace so she's already suffering with loneliness and trying to raise the children she then deals with being forced upon by the king the king taken advantage of her then she deals with grieving over a murdered spouse then she deals with dealing with being pregnant with the king's baby and being pregnant as a widow I wonder why we ain't thought of these things before but we've bleached out King David and made him the Great Mighty conqueror and then just put this rotten sorry woman back there in the Hog Pen where she belongs I think we need to move her from the Hog Pen now if this wasn't bad enough now she is called into the king and the King takes her to be his wife and by the way the Bible does not tell us that she even wanted to be and oh my goodness so she makes this transition how can you imagine your your marriage to this man one day and then a week from now this man here marriage and you're married to him now what happened to those children those step children your eye was dead she is now brought out of that house into the Palace of the king what happens to those children do you honestly think David even cared the epitome of selfishness how rotten how devastating selfishness is come on now Saints can we dare to look at David as he was some of you can some of you can well I'm going to be real Brave this morning and I'm going to look at him the way he was because I want to see the grace of God the way I've never seen it in my life hmm so she now becomes his fourth wife she loses this baby oh my God not only that now she starts a new future she is King David's wife her children I put these things down let me just read them off to you her future children will be raised within a context of sexual misconduct manipulation competition cover-up and violence welcome to the family of King David let me read them to you again sexual misconda manipulation competition cover-up and violence now can you imagine you got four wives they've all got youngins and every one of them thinks hers is you know it's the very best this needs to be the king this needs to be in charge of the music this needs to be the service leader this one year needs to be the Deacon that's why folks want to run a church you know this is the way it ought to be and this is an honor to that can you imagine Four Women and they're all telling you that their son is the greatest he's the brightest he is the most brilliant and we can see as they grow older that they go Divine for the competition of who's going to be king and you remember the story of adonija of course before David is now old and before David ever declares who the heir is after Niger begins to pull men away and he begins to start in saying that he is the king the Revolt has started so her her little life that she had back there by herself was her and her little your husband that she loves so much and he loved her look what woman would not want that kind of a husband when you read all your life the way he loved this woman and the way he treated her putting her up on a pedestal as it was he nourished her he loved her he cared for her so much what woman should have to be out of her mind to not love such a man there's no way that this woman broke off all that love all that feelings all that emotion that she had for this husband which was her hero and now she's supposed to fall in love with a man who forced himself on her but we just read through the Bible sometimes and we omit so much pain we read to the Bible and admit so much suffering oh I'm telling you friend nobody is so tried as the bride of Christ there's so much suffering there's so much anxiety there's so much pain that's hidden between the verses of these Bible characters and we read right over the top of them because we all prefer the slang stories oh we prefer the sword cutting the head off and the glory blood and all that sort of thing what about the people setting back crying because they're called in situations they never asked for some of you sitting right here today are still dealing with trauma and things in your life that happen to you when you were children things that you have dealt with things that people did to you I know my what are we gonna do it Bathsheba is such an example of one that dealt with so much pain so much trauma so much anxiety so much that was forced upon her by others not by her own choice to let it move huh in a negative way I hope you understand this her husband had the reputation of being a man after God's Own Heart that's what I've been studying about her for the last several weeks I just kind of renamed her for my own sake this morning and called her a woman after God's read about her in Proverbs 31 and see what a woman she became read what a woman she was in so much someone King Solomon come in and he sat down on his throne and his mother come into the court and she said she had a petition to lay before him and the king of Israel gets up off of his throne and bows Hazel basins to his mother causes for a throne to be made for his mother and sets her at his own right a woman who refused to let her negative circumstances make her negative all her life but allowed God to mold in her about chapter Bible chapter in the Bible rather that many of you sisters have read and desire to be your model is from there that I took my text when I preach sister Karen pure's funeral and oh my the women the daughters of God when many of you ever sought that that was Bathsheba if I was you I wouldn't let Satan ride off your life I wouldn't let your parents write it up know your friends and last and most important of all I wouldn't let you write it off but if you knew my track record so you want to compare it to David's today and you want to stand and say I've done this bad or worse and yet the Lord God chose when he come to the Earth to come down through that and be called the son of David remember also the New Testament son of David have mercy on me son of David Henry he's like Tara don't call me an old daughter son don't call me the even in the Millennium when he sat on the throne he will be called the son of David Amazing Grace how sweet to sound Hallelujah so the other women of David now one that was so hurt one that had so many scars so many issues she refused to let those things shape her and Stitch he became a woman after God's Own Heart so notable that Solomon mentions his mother over and over and over again through the Book of Proverbs forget not the instruction of thy mother of the instruction of thy father and the wisdom and the teaching of thy mother how could you do that if your mother was a a prostitute so the world let him look down at us let him make fun but one day when they walked Before the Throne of the Lord God they will see surrounding that throne is the makeup of a roof a Rahab ath Sheba a Tamar and the fifth for Mary hallelujah hallelujah let's Stand Together I can imagine that Bathsheba like many of us myself having dealt with many people who've dealt with abuse whether it's sexual abuse or psychological abuse verbal abuse there's many types of abuse many times the innocent person is the one who feels so guilty though they were the one preyed upon huh many times them sorry outfits that Prey Upon them will scare them you better not do this you better not tell nobody you better not this that the other and somehow they feel themself that it's their fault I wonder if Bathsheba put it over her mind over and over again oh if I hadn't have taken that Mikvah that ceremonial basket maybe if I'd have done it earlier maybe if I'd have done it later maybe if I'd had done it the day before the day after that's generally the mentality of a victim that they look at themselves what did I do which works on what their self-esteem and they look at themself it's unworthy and worthy of favor Unworthy of Grace Unworthy of Mercy so to get around good people what they call good people people that wasn't like they were and they said well I'm not good I'm not as good as them I'm not as good as them people I'll never be nothing I'll never amount to anything I'm worried that it'll be treated bad I'm no you're not the Lord Jesus loves you so much having been a victim myself of abuse abuse I can tell you some pain I can tell you some anxiety having been a victim of being abused by preachers lied on used made fun of I went and preached meetings for preachers and them ask me for the offering so what'd you do I give it to him of course and went and preached other meetings and when I get home the preacher would write me a letter and say my wife said I'm worth about a thousand dollars a month so could you care to send me part of the offer preachers um so when people come to me with their little big flimsy excuse they got hurt by one and they don't want to believe in Preachers no more I'm sorry it takes a little bit more than that to be able to excuse you for me because believe me I've been lied to I've been treated I've been used abused but I still believe God's gotten in that are sincere that love him that love his people right don't you that's right I refuse mother don't you still dealing with some of my stuff ah I sure do I'll probably have to deal with it until one day The Sweep comes over me yeah but I refuse to allow it to dominate me do I fight the thing that the only reason brother Donnie that people call you and contact is you because they want money I get it all the time sometimes daily we need help with this we need ten thousand dollars we need twenty thousand dollars we need this we need a new car we need a new microphone we need a new PA system and I think if I didn't help people with anybody even know my name would they even care a thing about me sure that's stuff we have to deal with I'm just being honest with you who's next but I refuse to let that dominate me so does that stop you from giving huh what do you think no well I've been hurt I can't trust somebody I can't so you're going to let that dominate you are you if you ever get to heaven it'll be because you were led by men you were encouraged by men you were helped by men you were preached to a New Birth by men you were preached to the baptism of the Holy Ghost by men you were preached into rapturing Faith by men you reached a body Changed by men you say why because that's God's way that's God's way Hallelujah [Applause] sebastshiba you can take your hurts you're paying your anxiety go way back in a little room have nothing to do with nobody have no confidence in nobody and just stay home the rest of your life and play tapes I'll never be hurt by a preacher can I'll never be her I'm just going to stay home and play tapes the rest of my life and the person that's being hurt the worst by that is you or you can venture out and love again Trust Carolyn I said at a funeral a few years ago of my aunt in Kentucky out of the corner of my eye I saw a man coming up on a walker as I looked at the side of his face I realized who it was the preacher that molested me cold sweat popped out on my face I felt my face Flushing Carol could feel it she's sitting right by me she grabbed me by the hand you okay humanly I wanted to grab up walk up to that man and grab that Walker and beat him over the head with that time why still the scars pain but Jesus inside of me raised up and I felt the sweat stop and I felt the color of my skin changing my ears were burning and they got cooled off and Brother David I looked at him and what I felt sorry for him and it wasn't a Fitting Place or I would have danced most of the people there knew me anyway that had already been eyeing me you know I can't I just can't describe to you how I felt because but Joel I realized the Lord Jesus had helped me I was glad I was able to see that man because they've been years and years since I'd seen him I wasn't quite sure how I would react but I was so happy the way the King of Kings reacted him no doubt I would have been ashamed of the way Otto acted but I was not ashamed of the way my king acted what about it today friends we come in our lives to make up the Kaleidoscope for the making of the Gentile bride some of you will like rehab some of you maybe like Tamar there may be a few of you that's like Mary they say oh I'd personally like to be able to shake your hand after church since since apparently I don't know any of you all that make up our church but I wonder how many of us will be like Bathsheba so hurt so scarred so wounded but we refuse to let our past dictate to us our future you remember when the prophet went overseas and he missed God and listen to preachers instead of listening to the Lord and he picked up the amoeba and he come back and he thought he was going to die he got up early one morning run a bathtub full of water running a fever and going to all these different signs of the amoeba and he saw a vision appeared before him and a Heavenly being took pieces of paper like sheets of paper in his hand and he threw those pieces of paper up toward the sky and it made a pass up into the sky and he said you'll pass or your future before you it's clear you said friends you cannot imagine how I felt why because the Lord had forgiven him scared to death oh he always wanted to go back to Africa again got to go in 65 couldn't preach he always wanted to redeem himself from that that's the way we are our mistakes our failures our shortcomings somehow we want to go back and do it again but you know what I'm also face facts some of it will never be able to do all we knew is David did committed into the hams of God so God takes the first child and the Bible says Nathan come to David and said go into your wife and comfort her so David comforted his wife and she brought forth a son and called his name peace Solomon but the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to them and called his name Jedediah beloved of the Lord and put his own name yah in that name Jedediah from the same woman that was so broken-hearted so maybe it's time for you to be comforted by your husband the Lord Jesus to woo away your anxiety and all your burdens and all your trauma of your past and let you and him be able to produce a man of peace Solomon you already know it but the name shulamite from The Song of Solomon it's the feminist form of Solomon so the Song of Solomon is about Mr and mistress Solomon Mr and mistress Jesus Christ can we bow our heads together I wonder how many today would like to be remembered as we go before the Lord God bless you your need your past your present maybe some of it's not so much your past that you're dealing with things it's just where you are now things got a hotel and you hate it you've tried your best to shake it but you just can't you can't stand yourself you can't stand where you are let him be the god of your present tense what about it Bathsheba you bring all the hurt the anxiety the pain can't trust David you can't trust the man that's sent to get him you can't trust this one that one the other one and yet this man asks you to be a part of him with the Union takes you to yourself don't even let you grieve for your child or your husband you're a widow and you're with child how you're going to raise that child who's going to be there to help you Hallelujah or can you cast all of that in the hands of the Lord Jesus those of you that in preacher hurt those of you have been hurt by this and that and the other bring it all to God look friends don't make me or any other man don't put no man to be your idol all men will fail you there's only one that you can look at as your ultimate example and that's the Lord Jesus he's the only one that will not fail you Heavenly fathers we open up ourselves to you today oh Jesus it's painful for me to mention some of these things Lord there's no doubt some of them stand there and I see it on their faces their expression as they mince a frown in their corners of mouths will twist up and a wrinkle will come on it it's because the very salt of their past es the dendrites in their brain to release hormones oh God we all carry our baggage we need you Jesus we need you oh Father we bring all we are today all our hurts all our anxieties some self-inflicted some inflicted by others we bring them all to you Lord God I pray may we become the type of woman spiritually speaking that as your bride the bride of Christ can spiritually reflect proverbs 31. unlike the woman of Revelation 17. help us Lord to see that woman is so different but who can find a virtuous woman and there are no virtuous people on the Earth and the only way you could even find one you couldn't find one either so what you had to do was make one so you place the seed inside the soul and waited to the right moment in time for that seed to be quickened then Lord God under that quickening which was our new birth then that person never done it in the first place that's why that we are the virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ oh we can still remember those things but our seed can't because it never done it our sin was under that old nature that nature that old husband that passed away and died praise God so justification under the opening of the seventh seal is not that we get forgiveness and we try to patch up that old man and try to live with that memory but under the opening of the seventh seal we never did it Hallelujah the lamb takes the book of our life and Strikes off the seal and calls our seed to birth praise the Lord help us Jesus father may you bring healing today not only to those in the visible audience but those that are streamed those around the world that will hear it Lord we've been called to the Palace but like Bathsheba many of us have brought baggage to the Palace oh David Fell in Love with their looks the Bible doesn't even say knew anything about who she was in love with her as a person but her looks so here she comes to the Palace of broken-hearted pregnant Widow she had to leave her stepchildren David did not want them there so she comes with all this baggage but little by little she become a woman after God's Own Heart in the midst of that chaos she found out God had a purpose for her not only to be the wife of the king but in another time be the mother of the king Hallelujah the only woman that we have in the Bible that would gain that position in that same way to become the Queen Mother oh Jesus we entered into your courts ashamed we entered into your courts with a baggage of sin and load of memories but may we hear the voice of the king as he hears us you see we hear him say come my queen come my queen let me Comfort you oh my Lord how will you comfort me how will you bring Comfort to my heart I will give you my seed you shall bear my seed o glory to God glory to God for we know through the Gentile bride will usher in the Millennium the births of the Millennium comes through the consummation of the Bride thank you Jesus Hallelujah when the bride is carried away the next great thing that takes place on the earth and father in the honor of the glory of God is the Millennium it will be produced after Christ and the Bride of United together thank you Lord oh Jesus take us Lord wash us cleanse us purges father Hallelujah anybody willing to raise your hand to the Lord just bring all your baggage your memories your past your present what about your future don't just give God your past give him your future you're young people don't take your teams don't take your 20s give it to the devil and say I'll wait till I'm 40 years old you may not live to walk outside this door give him everything your past your present Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah oh Father God We Worship You Lord God thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah let's just keep our hands up there in the presence of the Lord now he knows exactly what each one of you need you're streaming from home he knows what you need healing in your body healing in your spirit maybe you just need to unload a bunch of your baggage whatever you need Jesus is mindful of you Hallelujah oh don't think that he's going to give you according to how good John how good your past is no if it gives us according to that we won't none of us get very much but let him give to us what He deems us worthy to receive amen of his Mercy of his goodness for this is the way he looks at you in Psalm 23 surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord oh praise be to God Hallelujah little Branch you're washed you're cleansed you're sanctified you're forgiven if you're not repent right here this morning you got something in your life you need to repent of do it right now and as fast as God forgave David God can forgive you praise the Lord praise the Lord God we worship you Jesus we bless your name father your imagine as Bathsheba would walk to the Palace and she would look at the full-length mirror that would be before her maid of burnished brass not glass the way we have today pick up the mirror off of her table and look at herself and think who am I what am I doing here look at my entrance into the king of the Court under justification and condemnation but now I am the King's wife maybe your entrance into his presence was condemnation the preacher preached right at you and you think Lord have mercy there ain't no hope for me but the mercy of God reached and grabbed a hold of you and forgive you now you're in the courts of the king you're his favorite wife Amazing Grace shall always be my song of praise foreign [Music] to love us [Music] oh he looked Beyond all I fall and he saw our sins everybody oh I shall boys [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] so he looked here thank you Lord my fall and song by everybody oh let's raise your hands as we sing it I shall voice [Music] save the time Rahab sing it to him Tamar Hallelujah [Music] Jesus died for you and me thank you Lord God how marvelous how marvelous Lord God [Music] hello [Music] my seed I shall forever I shall foreign [Music] [Applause] how marvelous the grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus We Worship You Lord We Worship You Lord we worship you day Lord Jesus we bless your name thank you Father oh friends what kind of a what kind of a mighty God are we serve him now be honest with me if you had this in your genealogy one of them was a woman who dressed like a prostitute so she could deceive her father-in-law to become with child with him another one was a known prostitute the other one the king of the king of Moab was your father eglon and you were a moabitus you was a priestess to keemosh you offered living children to kimash as a sacrifice then you've got Bathsheba would you have a problem and people know it well yeah my aunt was a prostitute and my aunt before her she was we wouldn't hardly want nobody to know that would be but the Lord Jesus allowed this to be in his patronage his genealogy why so the people who would need him as a savior would be able to look at where he come from and said if that was in the natural family tree surely he won't have no problem saving me so who are we really sinners centers that's what we were saved by the grace of God bless you aren't you happy to be a part of the family of God why don't you turn around and tell somebody I'm so happy to be a part of the family of God today I'm so happy to be part of the family of God I'm happy to be a part of you I'm happy to be part of you brother Joel Brown I'm happy to be part of you my brothers and sisters I can't wait for us to get to eternity together will we be able to spend all of our time as we would count time there together in his presence worshiping him forever and forever don't you love him Amen brother Matt Carter turn this in thank you for praying for my sister Dorothy she came to her cancer surgery fine the doctor says it got it all continue to pray for her she has a bad cough To God Be The Glory thank the Lord we're so grateful for that also like to mention something to you we had some curving people to come up over at the church to be able to curb the parking lot somehow another they got mad and left and it wasn't my fault this time I never said nothing to him anyway um they're supposed to be back tomorrow so pray they will be if we can get the carbon done and we've got the base coat of the asphalt down the foreman said if we can get the carbon done get the dirt in there get the trees and all that sort of thing hopefully they'll give us a certificate of occupancy for the fellowship home we'll be able to have church in there I'm grateful for the Holiday Inn but it ain't ours we want to move to our new home don't we so pray for us that that'll work out I believe if God can move on Heathen Kings God can move on Heathen black

the little girl little baby Genesis to dedicator to the Lord today know Genesis is the book of Beginnings I'm not sure if this is the beginning of a big family or exactly bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of s bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to [Music] Jesus now you think that ain't something look at that really got she's checking you all out let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father what a great honor it is Lord to be able to stand in this last days and to still see mothers and fathers that desire to carry out part of their responsibility on the earth Lord we know that in our nation women's rights and women's control over their bodies and so on as they say it's been so devastating but we're so grateful dear Jesus little Genesis as my brother Israel laid her in my arms and now Lord I want to bring her up to your arms you're the one who gave her to them I pray father that you just helps them we know it's not just really a dedication of a baby but a consecration of mother and father that they can be able to accept the awesome responsibility that You' placed in their hands she never come with a manual from the hospital she never come with a how-to book from the doctors but we're so grateful you've given us one it's your word a how-to book to raise children and we're thankful that it carries right on out to this last day so father we bring a little Genesis to you today we ask you Lord that you just watch over her little life help her mother help her father keep her from the evils and sickness and diseases that are so prevalent in the day that we live we dedicate our little life to you today Father for a life of service in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen praise the lord conratulations we stand today and we'll turn to the Book of Genesis no kidding Genesis praise the Lord is an awesome day to be a Christian serving the lord living for him today praise God Genesis chapter 1 verse 14 and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years now s Moses covers the big scope of everything first and then he breaks it down in a few more verses here let there be lights in the firmament which is the expanse of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs look at the meaning of this word signal a distinguishing Mark Banner token ins sign or also a standard so the lights in the heavens are going to be for a token or a sign or a standard Manor standard is something that that is used to measure other things by and for seasons and for days and years now look at verse 15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth H so the Earth is going to be the focus of a lot of what God is doing yet by far not the biggest not the brightest but his choice and you see that's what makes all the difference so the Earth is the only one whose name is in the Book of Life you won't find Mars Pluto Saturn Neptune Uranus now the rest of those planets and all those that have been found now but Earth to give light upon Earth and it was so now watch him there breaks it down in categories and God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day which is what we know is the sun and the Lesser light which is the Moon to rule the night he made the Stars also I get overwhelmed every time I look at this word and I click on it look what it is it's kokab which is of Messiah Brothers of Messiah Brothers numerous progeny personification God's omn missence which is figurative of course God made the two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also Genesis is overwhelming really because it condenses unbelievable amount of things that was happening and it sounded like it was just Bam Bam Bam but in this this little verse and he made the Stars also quite simple quite Compact and yet the estimated number of stars and the visible universe so far that have been seen one septian that's a one with 21 zeros behind it and God made the Stars so far over two trillion galaxies that they found two trillion galaxies and what was your problem s that was so big today that you thought just no way and think who made this your father thank you Lord makes me feel ashamed sometimes don't it you I great he is and listen how Moses says in verse 17 and God set them God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth notice again he mentions the Earth again to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good Genesis 2 verse 1 thus the heavens and the Earth were finished would you notice how that Moses puts the Earth in a different category from the heavens the heavens and the Earth the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them which is saal that which Goes Forth an army an army war Warfare host a host of an organized Army over one septian in the army of God and you realize not a one of them has ever caused him one problem in my little short life brother Phillip of 68 years I have caused him more heartache more trouble than trillions of galaxies and yet I can give him something that all of those Stars cannot they cannot love him they serve his purpose but they're made to do so what difference between me and them and and you is I choose to do so they were made to do so we choose to do so and many he has a need in your heart today a request Heavenly Father we are so humbled at your greatness I pray today father that your blessings would be upon the word that should help me to be able to get out of the way Lord I'm not here today to belittle what your children are going through because they're many of them suffering tremendous things facing terrible battles and things in their lives but yet Lord if I could somehow be able to show them maybe just a little bit greater of what you are I think it would help them to bring it all into perspective that no matter how big our problems are how big our issues are and our troubles you are so much greater than them all father I have this prayer cost in my hand today Lord you see our sister Lord that this is going to you see the problems that she's having in her body and we're agreeing together as the saints of God lord Jesus that she's going to be completely delivered and made well of this anoint me Lord and anoint your people speak to us the words of life in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated I want to speak to you today on the right to be in divine order the right to be in divine order let's look now about our father and how great he is some people the way they view God they resent anything about order and structure and things that are put together it's like some people view order as Robin them of a element of their freedom they look at structure they look at things put together and it running on a methodical pattern and they look at that as if somehow it takes away from the great Supernatural or the phenomenon but yet our God is a god of structure and God of order so he doesn't just make things and let them run as they will he doesn't choose any of us and says well just do whatever you want to do try try to get to heaven as best you can um just live as close as you can to me and whenever it's all said and done whatever you give me I'll take and U I have no requirements I have no no guidelines no set standards just do whatever you think is best now a lot of people have that that idea of God that they will do whatever they think they can and they'll wind up giving it to God and God is just so desperate God is so desperate for anybody that will just give him any attention at all that he'll just pretty much take whatever they give him that's not my God our God is is a god of divine order that being said it does not mean that in that order is not freedom and liberality but it never goes beyond the guidelines of the one who set it up so he structured a church he structured a body he structured the order of ministry he structured it in the Old Testament knowing that it would have a time limit on it that it would run for several thousand years and then there would be a new order that would replace it and we know even where we are now the order of grace mercy through the perpetuation of the blood of the Lamb of God that is a great divine order of God holy wonderful order but it too is only here for the SE season for one day we will no longer need blood between us and our father we couldn't stand to be able to be brought into his courts today in his presence without the value of a mediator there's no way we we would just die there's no way we can do it because our bodies are still marked by sin and we still bear mortality in us today so there's got to be something that will stand between us but I want you to think now for those saints of God that have gone beyond the curtain of time they no longer have that barrier that you and I are limited by today called Fai one day you will no longer need faith faith will actually be become sight and it will become reality now today we believe there is a God right so all that come to him must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him but for those who have already entered into paradise and into his great presence they don't have to have a faith walk because they've already passed beyond the curtain of time and they have experienced reality in a form that you and I know absolutely nothing about so Fai will end in sight and then the Blood On The Mercy Seat will no longer be there as a matter of fact when the bride goes up in the Rapture it will be pulled from there it's only symbolic anyway but it will be pulled from there and no longer be needed to go between you and I in the presence of our Lord and for the first time in the Rapture will be able to walk up in the face of Jesus himself and look at him with our changed eyes touch him with our changed hands and himm reached back to us because this order that God has given us will have brought us to a higher place and we know that there was a levitical order in the old test but a prophecy of a new order in the new and it was going to be a priesthood after the order of MDC right so God will have a new order of a priesthood just to let you know we're already in it so whenever God before he ever brought human life upon the Earth and then Moses being channeled by God to to pull into this Avenue wherever he was whenever he started seeing all these things and he looked out across what scientists call the elliptical plane now remember on the earth since the Earth is placed in this certain part of the universe everything looks different from the earth than it would from any other planet now for those of you that have traveled in different parts of the world and you would look at the Zodiac here and then you would look at the Zodiac in Europe or if you've been to New Zealand or Australia and you look at it and the stars and their patterns they will look a little bit different for those of you that are privileged to be able to see the Northern Lights in Canada or in in Norway and some of those places like that and you see how different that the stars and the placement of the stars look according to where you're standing on earth now remember they are there for signs for season for days to divide the light from the darkness and all that so depending on where you are on the earth and you look up and see the exact same Stars you might see them in a little different way having been out in Arizona and some of the places and the parts of the Earth where there isn't as much population and light pollution it's amazing how many stars are there right in our our skies every night but we don't see them because we have so much light pollution now whenever God wrote them of course and put them there because they were his first Bible there was no light upon the Earth so the brighter the light gets upon the Earth the more it takes away from the glory and the Brilliance that's in the heavens so some of the greatest telescopes that man has upon the Earth are in some of these places where there isn't any man-made denomination I I mean uh man-made light because man-made light will distract from Heavenly light you see that's what always gets people in trouble when it comes to them looking at the word and trying to understand the word because they're looking at it from The Grandfather's light or their father or their mother or their uncle or their aunt and they're always reading the divine order through tradition or church entity and it always hinders us every time now let me let me just go back here to Genesis 1:16 again and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also and God set them in the firmament now let me share these numbers with you again estimate suggests that there are about one septian stars in the universe and I said it was 21 zeros but it's actually 24 so a one and 24 zeros and an estimated estimated two trillion galaxies now by the way that scientists have been able to measure what they call the observable universe now that is only what they've been able to to see them they use gamma rays and they use other X-rays and things like that and they will send them out as far as that Ray can travel and then it will turn and come back and they measure the distance from where it leaves its original point back and then they time it how far it is now watch this the observable universe is approximately 93 billion ion light years in diameter 93 billion light years in Diamond now listen how big in a lightyear is if you forgot it since you went to school a lightyear the distance light can travel in one Earth's year is 5.88 trillion miles so in one year light will travel 5.88 trillion miles and so far the observable universe is 93 billion light years so you take 93 billion and multiply it by 5.88 trillion and you're going to blow your calculator all two pieces now that's just what they found so far I find it so amazing that they found all this out in our day sir in our day you see they started they looked at the stars way on back and they looked at him in a very primitive form but in this day the mysteries of the universe and the stars and all that they found so far it's just incredible because it's unfolded in the same time frame that God sent an Angelic message down from heaven and a releasing of an anointing from Heaven on the earth to take a people back to their origin which is in heaven so while God is doing this great thing on the Earth and then science always forer runs what God is doing on the earth is that right so we live in the age of astronauts astronauts so then they send out their their Hubble and then once they got it out there they didn't realize that the Hubble Tes scope had to have something similar to glasses put on it because it was unable to focus and do what they needed it to do and then they had to send some people out there to readjust its lenses and they likened it to putting a set of glasses on the telescope and by that in the last how many every years that it's been there it's opened up an entire new realm and what they were able to do and they thought they could never surpass that until of course they made the new one and now they've sent it out there and it's blowing away the previous Church ages before it now remember the signs are there for Stars the Stars rather for signs and tokens and visible say of God writing his Bible so if it's going on up there and the observable universe and remember it's still expanding now when life travels it's still ongoing it's not like that it's ever actually stopped when he said let there be light it has never stopped from the time he said that so if time would car another 100 years or 200 years and they would break into it more and more and they would measured as a matter of fact they've already proved it by the scientific research from back in 1959 to where we are now that from the measurable difference of the on the elliptical plane and by using what's this the radius of the visible universe according to calculations the current comoving distance to particles from which the cosmic microwave background and you saw you just use them in your house the microwave background radiation was emitted which represents the radius of the visible universe is about 14.0 billion parex 45.7 billion light years everybody got what I've said so far I was going to say those of you who raise your hand I'm going to have you to stand and repeat it now what does this mean to most of us absolutely nothing do this sister is going to help you make better pancakes I doubt it better beans and cornbread and maters and ters no but hopefully it will overwhelm you to realize how great our God is and to think that nothing moves up there out of cater the only thing that has ever caused him problems are those beings that he put on free moral agency you see all these things that I've read to you so far today not a one of them have a soul not a one of them have a choice a mind to reason and think well I I don't think that makes sense I I don't think God wants that I don't think they can't think they were made to do all this great glory and he hasn't had one problem with one of them none of them have ever caused him any issues let's read Hebrews 1 one God who had sunry times and diverse manner spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he has appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world's plural the world's plural and man Einstein broke into what understanding he had in his day and believe it or not they've surpassed Einstein Hebrews 11:3 and when he looked at where that broke into eternity if they could send something out so far from the earth and measure it by time and how many millions of light years it would be out in the universe and then come back to the Earth it would only be gone just a few years and Einstein said there's only one answer for that they broke into eternity and when they ask him how could it be he said there was one only one explanation through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God Amen worlds not one plural the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so all this matter and mass and black holes and time and all of that where did it come from nowhere where'd God get the Magnesium the iron the atomic fire that's in the Sun every day that and we're setting on a molten ball of it upon the Earth where did all that come from the Sun s so n yeah for by him God created all things what was the son the word so when God spoke he gave birth and out of his existence come his creative word which is the son s o n and by him all things were created a brother Ram is on a hunting trip greatest battle ever fall tells us about it and him and the brothers was looking up at the night skies and I imagine being out there in Arizona I've hunted some of that same territory there and it's quite phenomenal when you get out there and you go to looking up uh what what you see and he said I I said somewhere now he's talking to the brothers I had pointed out to me one time in an observatory the Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming over through the cancer age on down until the last was the lion Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ the Virgin the second coming by the line of the tribe of Judah and I said I tried my best to see that zodiac and I can't see it I love his honesty don't you so here's someone who was trained to look at the stars and then through a telescope to be able to look up into the night skies and then maybe point it out to brother brandom and say now look here's here this that and the other unlike you and I today where we can download an app and hold our phone up I mean know what I'm talking about and it will be able to tell you exactly here and there and there so then if you have a telescope which my son-in-law Scotty does and then we've been able to get up there on their uh paved parking or driveway coming in and at night skies look up and take that and point you directly into where it is now look how much further it's Advanced now than it was even when brother Brandon was here so brother brandham was shown it and yet he by the naked eye looking out there in the night skies and he couldn't find it so what do we need we need direction direction to be able to look now it's there but it don't help us if we don't know which way to look now by the grace of God it's the same way with the godhead and the gospel and with the church now you know a lot of people they don't have a problem being identified with the church mystical but most people's problem is being identified with the church local the church mystical then they oh yeah absolutely I'm a Christian I'm born again I'm part of the body well where do you attend oh I don't go to church I I I don't attend church cuz I I really don't need to but I'm part of the body wow so they have no problem being identified with church mystical but they have a problem being identified with church local but if you're actually in church mystical you will be part of an assembly that's right and there's many people the stream our services and other brothers all over the world and the reason they're not in church is not because they believe they don't have to be but because circumstances will not allow them to be there they live in places where there are no churches and it's not their first choice to have to stream but they also are identified with an assembly now see so it's a miror reflection of the stars that are in the heavens now most of us have no we can't even relate to the Stars up there and the numbers and all that that I gave you some of you don't even remember them right now you definitely won't remember them over your lunch today because you can't really relate right we we just can't relate it's so far over the top of our head and that's just not where we live but yet I like to look at it myself because I see my life story I see your life story I see that the dragon will be got a hold of I see the Capricorn I see all of that in the mystery of God what a little bit that I've been able to look at it and see and understand so to me it's predominantly over me every day of my life that I am going to win in this Warfare because it's already declared in the heavens now remember what's going on on life now and on the earth and time it Falls to us hour by hour day by day week by week month by month but if you want to know how it's all going to end turn up this way and look at Leo the Lion and then we'll look at the water spout and we look at all the things that are up there and we see the end has already been declared from the beginning it's written in the stars now whatever then we look upon the Earth at oursel and you're the prophet was down on the earth and looking up and him and the brothers is out there and they said uh it was showed to me by the Zodiac and I've tried my best to see it and I just can't see it yet it's there those who are trained know it's there job saw it now remember when God come to job and and God quoted to job the Bible that job knew and God asked job about the constellations which was pades the Seven Sisters Orion so God qu oted to him even about Urus did you are you the one who controls Urus are you the one that does the plees and why in the world would God quote that to job because job was a stargazer so he watched how did the Magi able to follow the lord Jesus and get exactly when where he was born and yet King Herod didn't know nothing about it it was right under his own nose because Herod did not know how to look in the Stars well let me tell you something don't think that I'm crazy now this morning and think Lord have mercy brother Donnie studied so much he's went absolutely nuts you see that's one advantage that the bride has in every Church age is that we also follow the Stars so in the Book of Revelation we see the right hand of Jesus being open and we see seven stars in the right hand of our Lord Jesus and those Seven Stars point to us that there will be seven Messengers that will come on the earth and out of their ministry will come the reflected light from the S so n of God and it will lead the elect back to where they come from the rest of the world look at oh we don't believe in no church AG Messengers we don't believe in no prophets well I feel sorry for them but they just can't see the constellations of the church ages amen now watch the prophet goes on and he said man used to look at it because it was a Bible but in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years now what I'd like to know is how did he know that before they started talking about it billions of liar they observable universe was not then what it is now as far as their knowledge so we have a Kian that did not go to NASA school or did not graduate from Harvard but talking in terms that scientists use today he could probably say it took you all long enough but you finally did get caught up now watch this in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years God sets in the midst of it all and he looks down Paul is in there my mother is in there somewhere looking down and I thought of the order of that Heavenly Host now watch keep in mind and we're talking about the ride of divine order so it's not like these Stars they just go at random and they're upside down and sideways and you know one goes this way and one goes that way no they're everyone in an orbit in so much that our scientists will be able to tell us when there will be a solar eclipse or a lunar eclipse they'll be able to tell us pretty much the length of the days they'll have it now look at your Weather Channel they'll tell you when the sun will rise in the morning and they'll give you an approximate time of when the sun will set tomorrow afternoon and they can tell you out for years to come when a lot of these things will happen in the heavens why because they've studied it and it is so in order that they can forecast years and years to come when this and that and the other will happen is that right now now whenever it happens then then people on the Earth that love those sorts of things oh my uh a dear precious friend of mine brother Doug Baker from out in out in Tucson brother Doug Loves to to take photos and things of the eclipses and all that just this past year out in Arkansas and then went in different places and he's quite a quite a photographer and he's been able to get the one that is very rare and very occasional that it can be got but it's called the wedding ring I mean know what I'm talking about ever seen the picture of it few of you hardly none of you okay all right what whenever the eclipse comes upon the Earth and it's a certain time when the moon and the and the sun will come across the path and it reaches a certain spot and when it does if you have your camera right on it then the illumination from the outside forms a perfect circle and there will be a little tiny light right at the very top and it looks like a wedding ring ah a wedding ring so God wrote it up there in the scar in the stars and in the skies that the moon and the son would be husband and wife and every now and then God lets the sun Crown the moon with a wedding ring and it's written and the Stars so none of y'all have ever seen it well go online this evening Google will blow up after church morning go online and you can find it now why would God do such a thing which that is only visible from the earth now if you is up on Mars you'd never see it if you on Pluto you'd never see it you know you have to be at a certain place in a certain time frame to be able to see that the wedding is going on I just think when we were in our little denominations and even in some of our independent churches where many of them were just as bad as any denomination that was in the world we would never be able to see that there was a wedding going on but God called us out and opened our eyes and let us see there's a wedding going on and let me tell you today we are not going to the wedding we have already been wed we are going to the marriage supper of the Lamb because the wedding is going on right now we are joined together to our lord Jesus in an invisible Union praise be to God from all over the Earth from every nation every culture every race of people God is calling out a bride why because all of these stars that there in the heavens and this one that makes the sword of 9 and then nebulus 3:19 that's down on the bottom of it and it was actually there the light that you look at tonight when you look at the nebula which comes down from The Sword of The Swordsman on a Rion and you look in through that that light was actually started and left that nebula in the days of the Emperors of Rome it is that far away by the time it gets to us one day you will realize that Heaven is not a 100 billion light years away it's right here around us in another dimension our departed loved ones are not a billion light years away they are only 20 ft from where we are not only that your glorified body is right here in this building this morning and it's one to send a charge through you like a battery oh God let us get our jumper cables hooked up to our body what will it do it will unite us to the [Applause] groom I sought of the order of that Heavenly Host not one of them's out of place it's amazing what one child can do in a house right Harry it's amazing what one grandson can do everything is in order everything is in place and that one child comes in and in five minutes it's turned upside down and of course if you're a grandparent you just smile and laugh and acts like it's so wonderful as a matter of fact they say grandchildren are reward for not killing your kids brother Homer Longoria says the grandchildren were so Grand you wish you had had them first and forget them young ones but can you imagine our father and this is only an estimation of what they see has over one septian stars in the universe and not a one of them has ever broke time how many millions and billions of years have they been there and they're just going around and around what's their purpose to please him to serve him and to be able to actually for you to look at him and say wow wow a't that something and he says go ahead and join him kids enjoy him I put that out there for you when you would walk out there in the night and your battle so heavy and your trials so difficult and you think I don't know if I'll ever make it through this one or not that you could look up and say yes that star right there is the same one Adam looked at think of it the stars that you see at night Moses stood under them not so long ago Adam and Eve oh my his father would come down in the evening and the evening star would start settling in Adam and Eve would look at it it's the very same one you'll look at this afternoon that morning star that if you're up early enough in the morning and it comes out of their seat exact same one that Adam whatever he would awoke from a good night's rest in the Garden of Eden and stepped out there oh glory to God it was the very same star that Adam looked at the very same star that Joshua looked at the very same star when the Lord Jesus walked upon this Earth and he must have looked out there and looked at it and thought wow wow what a say in my word form I spoke all this into existence it's the same star is the same son that you look at at your church is the same one that he hurled out of his mouth millions of years ago the same one that Joshua when he stood there that day and say Moon stand still and son you stand still the very one that you will look at after church is the same one that Joshua stopped what's so sad for us is we just keep carrying our troubles carrying our problems trying to figure out our difficulties as if though it's left up entirely to us let me tell you today watch some of you ain't getting no victory over the things you're dealing with because you're trying to solve them yourself cuz there's something about as human beings it's one of the hardest things we can ever do is let things go let your hatred go it will destroy you if you don't if you don't let hard feelings go they will destroy you not only you but your children and their children and on down and on down you are making a way and setting a path for your children so if you hold resentment and pack that on down to another generation another generation you understand you're going to stand before God for Generations resentment generational hatred generational be the big people let it stop here come on somebody let's not carry on we don't want to be like people that if feuded down Through the Ages let's lay aside and be the bride forgive [Applause] I thought listen to this how he relates this God's Great Army and I thought of the soldiers so he views the stars as soldiers I thought of the soldiers and how do that Moon would happen to get out of order the Earth would be covered again with water in just a few minutes the Earth should be just like it was when God decided to use it to have us here on it it was without form and void and darkness and water was upon the breadth of the earth and if that Moon would ever move it would do the same thing again now look at the order of the stars and we all know of course by the tides and how the Moon it don't just get in your mind that that water is coming up on the visible part it's actually taking place under the the core of the earth as well that's why whenever they drill down on the earth this high tide and low tide they will hit salt water at certain times and will not hit salt water at other times why it's moving in the earth remember when the flood came it wasn't just from up here the Bible says The Fountains of the deep broke up so there hangs that Moon oh she's the weaker one she comes to four quarters justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself she she grows in glory she condescends in glory she grows in glory she condescends in glory she is a mirror of her husband the sun yetep the sun being 93 million miles from the earth the moon on an average of 267,000 miles and yet the atmosphere is so thin upon the moon the footprints of the first astronaut are still there it's like the scars that's on our hearts sometime we bear them and we carry them the only way we'll ever be able to rise above them is we must be overwhelmed by the presence of our son and our son can change our thin unforgiving unloving atmosphere and bring us into a regeneration of the soul and help us to look like the sun live like the sun act like the sun [Applause] and how long has it been since the moon has done all this maybe millions of years and when Papa made the Earth she stood up like this same temperature all the way around no Seasons no spring summer fall stood on her axis top and bottom but he made her with a degree an element of degree by which after the fall she would start tilting over like this and then when she did so it would allow the wobble inside her like this do you know why she does not wobble out of orbit and annihilate herself try to do your top that way try to take a bottle and set it and make it do that very far it'll just get completely out of wh you know why don't do it the lunar effect so being tilted over like this she still spins at a th miles an hour how in the world is that possible and every one of us sitting here day not sick as a horse we're spending a th000 miles an hour you all have been sitting you're spending a th000 miles an hour oh and people say there ain't no God oh my goodness we're spinning around last out here a, miles an hour and we're spinning over like this why don't we just wobble wobble wobble and annihilate oursel because God put this power above us she saw my this over 200,000 miles from us but God created her with a power that would affect the Earth God created an element called The Church the body of Jesus Christ this is why we need to go to the house of God this is why we need Fellowship watch people that get out of church and watch them wobble and wobble and wobble and wobble and they get totally out of retrospect to God but God has a church the Church of the Living God it helps balance you up and even in our warp status it helps us oh that's right amen so when the Moon Turns her back the tide comes in and then the Moon Turns back around and say ah oh no no no no only so far and the tide backs off can't you say why we need God ordained holy ghost film Ministry yeah I love the tapes I love reading the books but tapes ain't got an eyeball they ain't got a spiritual eye to watch the condition of the church come on somebody that's why you need a Shepherd that's why you need men of God that are in tune with the message of the hour and they can catch the spirit of the church they can catch where the church is at come on Church oh my thank God for the tapes thank God for our Bible but my Bible does not have eyeballs my Bible does not have the ability to judge the spiritual metrics of our church but God uses men Hallelujah God uses man he always has and he always [Applause] will and when that moon rocks a little bit away from the earth and the tides come up when it goes down it just follows the tithe it's God's Great heart Army and when I thought about that being God's Great Army we went to bed then I begin to think that not a one of those get out of their place they're all set in place and there's moving anywhere out of them it's for a cause and will affect this Earth we're just seen the results of it now from some of moving into other spots now I thought then is that great Heavenly Host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out a cater yeah so you watch it in a church you watch it in a family you watch it in a nation you get the leader of the nation whose mind is so perverted away from reality and Truth watch what one leader one president one whatever it is and can turn that entire nation upside down or bring them back to the trur we see all through the Old Testament that God would have kings that would raise up there was people like Josiah of course and ASA different ones that God Hezekiah that God would raise him up and there might be a good one then there' be 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven did evil on the side of the Lord did evil on the side of the Lord did evil on the side of the Lord as his father did all the days of his life and then thou would send Israel what is it you've got a rogue star a rogue star that is affecting the entire Kingdom so is it with preachers so is it with preachers oh my notice this he says what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order now listen this is your charge we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit now it would have been easier of course to let Angels run the church let Angels run the kingdoms let Angels run the empires on the Earth but God chose to give man a probationary period upon the Earth and to prove to all the races there are no Superior human races every one of them are corrupt praise the Lord now people may call black power and white power and purple Power and pink Power and all that sort of thing it's a bunch of trash and nonsense the black race is not Superior over the White and the white sure ain't Superior over the black or the Indian or any other God made of one blood all people and the church said but God has let these es be able to Reign nrod actually if you look at your history you find out that Nimrod was one of the first ones to rule and according to all the history that I can find emerod was a black man so the one that was a leader first was the black race and then you look at the whites and all that they have done the prophet tells us being a white man that the white man is a renegade well come on you white people you can say Amen to it can you that is a renegade don't you understand all the negative things that he spoke against us As Americans he never spoke against the Spanish or the French or the Italian the way he did us he spoke against America so much and he said the American Spirit is frolic Frolic and laughter haaa but that also means we've got more to overcome and by the grace of God we will overcome the American Spirit we do do not want to be just identified as Americans we want to be identified as Sons and Daughters of God oh my let's can I have a few more minutes watch Joel prophesied that there would be a return of an Army in the last days Joel chap 2:7 they sh run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War they shall March everyone on his ways plural now watch the word of the Lord using a symbolism as an army so this Army of God in the last days these are the descriptions of what they'll do they'll run like Mighty Men if you notice it doesn't say they were Mighty Men but they will run like Mighty Men there's only one Almighty Among Us that's right and it ain't you and it certainly ain't me it's him but we're going to run like mighty men and women and they shall climb the wall like Men of War and they shall March everyone on his ways now why would he use the word March so a March is and you've seen it of course in military parade I just think it's so neat myself whenever you look out there and you've got hundreds of thousands of soldiers and they're just marching and their legs are moving back and forth like that and their arms are doing whatever and you think wow they had to train so much to be able to do that but I wonder if Word of Life Church is marching today are we all going at the same Pace are our legs going this way or one's going this way and one's going that way and one's going that way somebody's heading over here some of you is heading over there how are we ever going to defeat the Devil if we don't join together as an IND you I'm an individual yes but as individuals that are joined together for one purpose to the house of God we're not trying to take your individual identity but simply rob you or take away from you an error that you do not need an identification with the Church of the Living God you do if you are a Christian there should be a hunger in your heart not just to come to a building but to be a part of the body of Christ notice what he says they shall March everyone on his ways so it's a decare dedicated path for each one to march on and they're not going to be marching over over here the pastor's wife ain't going to be over there and the Deacon's wife the Deacon's wife ain't going to be over there with the pastor and the pastor is going to be down his place and the trustees there and the song leader and the musicians and the lay people everybody finding their way and marching marching marching and they shall not break their ranks now most human beings have a problem with rank here we go now we're out of the stars now we're out of the galaxies and we're right back down where we all live oh my y'all will be raising your hands for me to go back to the septian and all the rest of the stuff huh they shall not break their rank so what is breaking the rank so it's one that would be designated to be in a certain position and someone else looks at that position and they would rather be there than to be where God placed them but Joel's prophecy said they will not break the ranks look friends as a pastor I have a designated rank in the body of Christ I am not a prophet so the word cannot come to me I am not called to straighten out the Prophet I am not called to give all understanding to what the prophet said I'm not called to be a Joshua to come and follow up on the prophet's message don't get quiet on me now and neither are you as lay members called to straighten out what you think the prophet messed up you are called to get in your position get your army get your uniform if you've been given a butcher knife or whatever you been given get it out if you're a tater peeler have the sharpest Tater peeler you can find if you're called to peel carrots and maters and ters for all the rest of us get in the kitchen my sister and go to peeling them maters and don't you feel like that we don't need you if the Army don't eat they don't fight oh you say well brother Donnie I'm not a great man of God the only thing I can do is pray for you and that's what will help me to meet the devil one onone that's what'll help the rest of the men of God around the earth is Mam and daddies and young people that are praying God help our ministry God help our pastor give him wisdom give him knowledge give him understanding God help brother Daryl God help brother Joel God help these Minister Brothers to preach the word that's your rank [Applause] they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War they shall March won't you notice the order of the army of God they're not playing around they're not just josling back and forth I was never in the military but there's many here that have been and they could tell us how it is oh and I go to low sometimes in Home Depot I bought a bunch of the plants and different things for around here and they say you're in the military I said does the army of the Lord count depends on whether they're religious or not if they're religious they said well sir it ought to I've never picked up a gun to fight for our nation I never took training but I have been called to the army of the Lord oh yeah brother Daryl tells the story that whenever he was called and he went up as a young man he's left-handed he always assumed he was left ey dominant so whenever they sent him out on the Rings to fire guns they told Brother Daryl that he would be on the howitzer that you don't know what that means do you well they didn't give him a Target this size they give him one this size but it wasn't until he got out of the armed forces that he realized and found out he was right eyed dominant so being left-handed automatically had go this way couldn't already at the side of a barn but he found out he's looking through the wrong eye uhhuh the wrong eye you see God's changed eyes now for seven times so it went from Paul to the second Church a satday church a and this is why that the Pentecostal and many of them here behind us they're still shooting but they can't hit the side of a barn they can't do nothing they're compromising on marriage they're compromising on birth control they're compromising on abortion and all these other things but the only reason you can see is because you're seventh eye dominant you found out what eye age you're living in and then you looking at it well Hallelujah to God you found out well glory to God I'll tell you one thing yeah I was that too I was Pentecostal eye dominant I couldn't hit the side of a barn Harley but thanks be to God I found out that I was seventh angel I dominant and once I've got lined up you ask the devil my success rate that's why it ought to be with you as Sons and Daughters of God it ain't me it's you ain't you it's the grace of God that lined up our eye dominance and that's why we won't just overcome drinking we won't just overcome the negativity of the world we will actually overcome death itself for there are people I believe with all of my heart that are sitting in this building today that will not die it's because you've got your sight lined up our sight is not just aimed on cigarettes it's not just aimed on Tobacco our sight is on death Hallelujah and we will conquer death itself in a moment we will be changed by the power of [Applause] God listen but when you're out in eternity time flies look in verse eight and we'll close with this so they run like Mighty Men they'll climb the wall like Men of War they'll March look at them running climbing marching but not breaking I know people don't like don'ts but there's dos and there don'ts right in the same verse you got to mixed together look at verse eight neither shall one here's another don't neither shall one thrust another oppress or crowd one one of the very few armies on the earth that kill our own wounded so when we see a man or woman down if we don't like why can we just push them down farther I'd like to ask you Saint something if we were not in 2024 almost 25 we were in the first century and there was a woman showed up at our church we don't know exactly what her name was cuz the Bible doesn't mention her but all we know is she has got son some kind of reputation cuz she had five husbands and was living with another man that wasn't her own but we heard that Jesus got a hold of her would Word of Life Church be okay with the woman at the well coming to our church what about the man from Gad right who had a legion of demons in him drinking lying adultery so many demons when they were cast out that it killed a whole herd of hogs and every one of them demons lived in one man but yet it just so happened that man had robbed you one time that man had knocked your daddy in the head that man had violated your niece but after getting saved that man wanted to come to church would we be okay with that or would we tell him well you set out in your car and stream you can't sit in here amongst us us what former Liars prostitute denominational prostitutes and everything else I want the person in here this morning beginning at this pull pit who has been without sin hello testing one two one two if any of us make it it'll be God's grace not our works not that we deserve it so who is it that keeps us the grace of God I have risked my reputation many times over the years for preaching for certain preachers the mainstream message preachers told me don't go there don't go there oh don't go there I have risked my reputation counseling and praying for people that was so lost and such scum on the bottom of the barrel say how in the work can you do that oh because the prophet told us Jesus reputation was made among such people and I realized hadn't been for the grace of God I could have been an adulterer a liar a murderer so if we were in the first century and our church a messenger was not brother brandham but it was Paul and Paul wanted to come and preach in our church hold a meeting and some of you all began to search his background you found out this man this man had Steven stoned this man had many of the children of God thrown in jail yes sir they were beat because of him they were whipped some of them lost their lives the prophet said the very reason Paul wanted to become a martyr was because that thing haunted him of all the people brother Phillip what he had put him through would if any of you all have a problem with Paul come and hold us and meet him ain't it amazing how we get we become so self-righteous so l lift it up and we're the ones that can give people Grace and you can have Grace and you can't and you can and myself I go back to the words of Jesus blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy pades is in the same same spot that the Lord God placed her in millions of years ago not saying that there's not a variance of degree by which atmospheric pressure or something might make them you know back and forth back and forth but it's not like that the star from pleades went to um Urus or wound up in in Taurus or some of the others I honestly can't say that myself I've complained I've grumbled I still to this day wish I was not a pastor I wish did this day I wasn't even a preacher cuz most of my problems in life has come from God's people being a preacher has just about destroyed me and annihilated my sanity Welcome to the Real World but in reality if the Lord God were to say to me this evening okay Donnie I heard what you told the church there um you want me to just drop this thing about the preacher deal and we just let you go I look up and say now Lord you know I was only teasing right I mean I it's odd isn't it it's odd how we are in reality we want his will and his word more than anything else but we're in the middle of it boy it can be so hard it can be so tough but remember there is a divine order all it takes is a husband to step out of the will of God and watch that whole family a wife to step out of the will of God step out of the will of God just for a period of months and cause all kinds of pain and anxiety same with a pastor of a church so a pastor starts in a certain direction away from God can you imagine if I'd get so stupid stupid just beside myself just out of my mind I think I ain't going back no more that's what some of you all say so if I just said I'm done with it I'm moving to I ain't telling none of you cuz I don't want you to where I'm going but if I was the one God sent here to help you then where would you go what would happen to you and you and you because you see a man that's really called of God it's like God has put him there and being part of that constellation then God sends the other stars to be part of that constellation then another man comes in tries to boot him out or you know they try to take people from another constellation I don't want anybody else from any other constellation myself I only want people at our church who God sends cuz if they come floating in with us and they come on their own we're all going to be unhappy what would happen to your life if the devil could wear me down and wear brother Tim PR down and other men of God down so low that they just think I can't take it no more and that star just goes out of the middle of the cluster oh it's plenty of preachers yeah you could get another my you could have one vot in in by next Sunday but how would the constellation work how would this be how would that be you see that all right now you can see it from my spot so what about yours well it seem like I ain't got no friends at the church it seemed like this is going on I I think we should look for another place I I think we should go ah but you'll tell me I shouldn't do that but you look at yourself and well you know what I'm a free moreal agent yeah exactly that's what's got you in so much trouble right and me and every other human being so what we should do is say Lord help me if this is my place I'm a part of this constellation then help me to do what I can let me shine and you know there's a certain equation that scientists have come up with to be able to measure the brightness and the illumination of stars a lot of it has to do with distance of course from where we see them but what they found out is it's the depths of the iron core and how much iron is in the core of that planet and there are no five pointed stars as you know they're all uh in a circle anyway but it's because of that and then the borrowed light reflects upon them so the star cannot brag about anything that it's done cuz whoever made it put that iron or in its core so the density of the iron core will say would be 27% then it will have the capability of catching the light well there's another star out there and it may be closer to the Earth than that one is but it's density of its core it's only 21% iron or no matter how much it tries it will never produce the same light as the other one so the 27% guy can't really brag to the 21% guy I got more iron or than you got all he can do is shine shine shine back to the Creator my goodness if you can sing like a mocking bird this morning and every body here just absolutely loves your singing and maybe there's some that sings like a crow and then sometimes they sing like this and that and the other but they're singing with all their heart don't make fun of them God's the one who gave them that much iron or yes sir maybe there's preachers boy they can preach and they're absolutely your favorites boy they get called to preach conventions and great big meetings and then there's other little brothers and they go here and there and there and never preach conventions but rest their life I thank God for them Stars how many wants to be what God made you you're a part of the army friends let's bow our heads praise God lord Jesus as we have our heads bowed down to the dust of the Earth from when our bodies were taken Lord we believe that our origin is not of this Earth but of a Heavenly nature we're praying that you'd help us today Lord I pray for myself first not because I'm selfish but because I think I'm the most needy one here no doubt I'm more needy than anybody that'll stream this service or anybody that'll AR of it because to my care and charge has been committed The Souls of hundreds of people and thousands that I affect around the world and sometimes it scares me to death to think about it if I ponder over it much I get so nervous I can't hard even think about it it I need you Lord help me help me Jesus that I'll stay magnetized to your word as long as I do that then I'll have no no worries about going off this tangent or that one or money or women or popularity or nothing else as long as I'm magnetized to your word which your Prophet said was the north po star and the needle always goes to that North Star then I'll be safe as long as I'm there in you Lord I pray for my brothers and sisters this morning that you'd help each of them some of them are looking and they're searching We Believe Lord that many of the people of our Earth are going through an identity crisis they don't know who they are father we realize Satan is taking great advantage of that for the time frame that we're in Satan is feeding all this transgender stuff and this gay stuff to the young people and they were born a boy but through all this corruption it confuses them and they're not sure if they were a girl born in a boy's body or if they're a girl or vice versa and it's an identity crisis and then our rotten government has got so rotten that they want to change them from what they were born to be to something else and what they're finding is which our government present tense government has hid the documentation and the proof that many of these young people that have gone through these things has increased suicidal rates and has increased regret of doing it true Lord God we at one time had an identity crisis some of us thought we were Baptist we thought we were Pentecostal we thought we were Beyond salvation we could never be bride but what you did was you sent a message in the last days that would wake us up to our true identity and the crisis was settled and the chaos was changed but since has happened Lord now is a attacking us from outside cu the soul is so anchored to the North Star he can't move it no more so he'll hit us with diseases and arguments and difference of opinions and this and that and the other to disrupt our minds and our hearts and our homes and our churches Lord we need you so much may our church never lose our true identity if there's any standing here today today going through an identity crisis whether it will be a sexual one or a spiritual one I pray father that you would help them to bring back bring back to their being their original purpose and program of God we're here to serve you despite our failures our mistakes Satan tried to give Fallen Christians this identity crisis when they mess up horribly terribly and they think they can't be saved he tries to bring back the memory of the identity crisis trying to make them lose their identity that they are the elect of God David must have went through that whenever he committed his terrible Deeds at B Sheba and all the things went on we can hear him crying out praying but finally David was able to find it cleanse me with hisp and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be pure for it is against thee and the only have I sinned oh God but blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate both day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water which bring forth its fruit in its season whatsoever he doeth shall prosper but the ungodly are not so but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away hallelujah hallelujah therefore the righteous shall not stand in the

Got some good specials for you today. Sister Isabelle and brother Josiah, they're going to be singing for us. So, we got a lot going on here today. Let's sing with all of our heart. Never been this homesick before. Is that your testimony this morning? Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" Well, give him one more good hand clap of praise this [Music] morning. There's a light in the window. The table spread in splendor. Oh yes, someone standing by an open door. Thank you, Lord. I can see a crystal river. Lord, I must be near forever. Thank you, Lord. Cuz I've never been this home sick before. Oh, see the bright light shine. It's just about home time. I can see my father standing at the door. This world's been a wilderness and I'm ready for deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been this home sing. I can see the family gathering. Hallelujah. Sweet faces look familiar. No one's old or nobody feeble or feeble anymore. Hallelujah. My lonesome heart is crying. I feel like I've spread my wings for flying. Cuz I've never been this home sick before. Oh, see the bright light shine. It's just about home time. I can see my father standing at the door. This world's been a wilderness and I'm ready for deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never in this home sing before. Yeah. See the bright light shine. It's just about home time. I can see my father standing at the door. This world's been a wilderness and I'm ready for deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been this whole single. This world is just a wildlife. Oh Lord, I've never in this home seek me before. [Music] Hallelujah. Will be done as our singers come to give us a song this morning. Sister Isabelle, if you'll come and brother Josiah, if you'll come to the platform and we'll enjoy your specials this morning. But let's sing a song this morning. A little chorus we sing quite often around here. It's already done. Do you believe the work is already done? I believe we're just waiting for a body change and we're looking forward to that, aren't we? Let's sing you with all of our heart this morning, if you will. It's already [Music] done.

[Music] [Applause] Let's just sing this before brother Donnie comes. Uh, you're such an awesome God, brothers. Hey Help me sing it. Let's worship him together. You called the sun to rise. You lay it down to rest. You hold this heart of mine. You hold my every breath. You're such an awesome God. So mighty, so holy, so wonderful. You're such an awome God.

You're such an awesome God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many can say amen to [Music] that? Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank the Lord for his mercy to us all. We welcome you here today. We have several visitors that are here. Um came for the school graduation which turned out so beautiful yesterday. Want to say how much we appreciate all of the effort and all the work, the students, the parents, the teachers, the faculty and all that that did it. It's imparted a wonderful thing in the lives of these children. We're grateful we would be able to have it here in the mountains of Tennessee to be able to bring all these Yankees and Southerners and Canadians and all together. As I sat yesterday and I heard the different teachers as they was describing their students and this one got a award for that and another one got an award for that. In my mind, every time I go to a graduation, I think what it'll be one day when we all walk before the Lord. I want to be faithful on that day. Don't you? I'm not interested in rewards and payback or nothing like that. If I can just hear these simple, powerful words, well done. effort, success, this. No. No. Just as long as I know that I've pleased him. Is that what you want from your heart? Amen. It's one of the things that I love about him so much is that we unworthy ones, he changes us and helps us. He gives us the strength to do what he calls us to do. And then just like him, when we get there that day, he gives you a reward for doing what he helped you to do. Truly, totally selfless. That's our God. You sisters, you may think you've done nothing, but you may be one of the very ones that out of your home, God will produce a boy, maybe a preacher's wife, a pastor's wife, or something like that that will affect thousands of people. You remember the prophet telling us about the little lady had a burden on her heart to have a meeting and she goes and rents a place and a preacher comes and preaches. God wanted that woman to have a reward. You're worth something today. It's wonderful to be together, isn't it? Praise the Lord. We have brother Michael Ray here with us today and we're so glad to have him with us. And um he don't want to ride on his father's coel or his grandfather's coel, but he's brother Biscll's grandson and brother Tom Ray's son. Um but he has his own identity. He's brother Michael Raid and we're grateful to have him with us and we just want him to come and uh speak to us today. How many come with needs on your hearts? No doubt our needs would be as diverse as the congregation that's gathered here today. So no matter how spiritual we might think we are and how much great mysteries that we understand, I hope that we never forget how to contact the Lord Jesus. There are many many great theologians in the New Testament, but how many of them could stop Jesus in his tracks? That's the kind of believer I want to be. Can we sing together touching Jesus? and we'll just invite brother Michael to come and let's just open our hearts now. Now, God knows what he's studied and the direction that he's studied. But maybe you have a need today that will lay outside the confines of what he's prepared. But keep in mind, the Lord Jesus loves you so much that he'll cause him to veer off of that, maybe for a sentence, a paragraph because you have a need. You believe that? Let's sing it together. A woman tried so many [Music] physicians yet grew worse. So did Jesus she came. And when that crowd tried to restrain [Music] her, she whispered these words, hallelujah, through her pain. Sing it now with me. Oh, touching Jesus. [Music] [Music] will never be the [Music] same. And there's only one way to touch him. Oh, just believe. Just believe when you call on his name one more time now. Oh, touching Jesus. Oh, is all that really matter and your life will never be the same. And there's only one way to touch him. Just believe. Just believe when you call on his name. Amen. You believe that this morning? Amen. and we just call on his name. He's that close. Too many times I think people think he's far off in some distant place, but he's right here present. Right here present. You just need to call. Amen. Isn't that just just what they did as brother Donnie was mentioning in scripture? You just need to speak out. Maybe maybe blind Barnameus. His faith cried out and he was there. Amen. I greet you this morning. It's uh well I'm just going to take it in for a moment and just uh so honored and privileged to be here with you and I've we've of course known of the congregation here in Tennessee for a long long time but to to be here in this capacity is was never in my wildest imaginations but the Lord has a whole different trajectory for our lives and sometimes it takes you on a maybe a 180 and uh so here we are and we're just thankful to be sojouring with you today. I greet you from brother Tom indeed and the congregation back home and my grandma sister R brother Ed Bisco. They would be I'd be reminis reminiscent to not uh remiss to not regret you from them. And so we just we're fighting the battle up in Canada. I know there's a few here from Canada. Brother Kyle, Sister Christina, I think I seen brother Ben and Sister Well, Amanda, where are you here? Wave your hand at me. I know you're here. There we are. I knew you there. And then some old friends are here. Sister Heidi and I seen brother Nathan. My goodness, we're just so blessed to be part of the family of God and do thank you for opening the the congregation here and all your help yesterday. You just were a real expression of Christ. That's what was just so beautiful just to see the body just joining together from all ends of the earth. That's just a little taste of heaven. Amen. Because that's what the body is from all over the world. And so we just so thank you and butter Donnie so appreciate you. We haven't maybe had a lot of time together but your life has impacted. We were speaking in the office there and I'm just I can say I've been impacted. I know the other side you'll find out the greater but my life hasn't. I just thank you for your testimony for this gospel message that's been around the world. Amen. You have a you have a precious pastor. We do indeed. So this morning we'll just I'm just uh there's been some giants of this message preachers that have preached from this church and uh and I'm not one of those. So just a little simple word this morning, but you pull because it doesn't really matter. Actually, it's all words. So then it's all simple. And so it doesn't really matter how where and in the depths and such. If it comes from from his word, then it it'll feed our souls this morning. Amen. So we'll just turn to the word and not take any more time. We're turn to Genesis 11. You going to pull this morning for me? Yeah. I do. I'll need it. It's going to take me a moment to settle down. All them butterflies. Genesis 11. We'll start at verse one. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shannar, and they dwelt there. And they said to one another, \"Go to and let us make brick.\" And burned them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar. And they said, \"Go to and let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach into the heaven. And let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\" If you go back in scripture and even brother Brandham speaks about it, God had actually desired and he had instructed them actually to multiply and replenish the whole earth. and and their objective now was though to be united here underneath their own desire for a name for themselves. And we'll maybe go into some further scripture, but I'll let you sit and take your seats. But before we do that, let's just have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we stand here Lord tonight, this morning and conscious Lord that there is each one that are listening this morning standing here. Each one is a soul that you paid a price at Calvary for each one worth Lord is we've been told worth more than a 10,000 worlds. the value that you place in one precious son or daughter here this morning. And Lord, here there's many. And Lord, to stand here, Lord, and to to speak in this capacity, I Lord, I pray there's not a word of my own thought would be expressed, but that the only thoughts would come from the very throne of God this morning, Lord, because that's what will feed a hungry heart, Lord. Maybe somebody here is thirsty and Lord, they need living water like that little woman that sat at the well. Or Lord, maybe somebody is in dire need of some food, some spiritual food in due season. And you alone, oh God, would break the very bread of life to them, Lord. So I pray this morning, Lord, it wouldn't just be a service, but Lord, it' be a time where we can be refreshed and renewed and strengthened and comforted, Lord, brought, Lord, just that little bit closer to your side. and you could Lord come and your presence would draw near and we would leave here Lord never the same again Lord we just don't want to come to a Sunday morning service we want to come to where we can encounter the almighty God and Lord we could our children could know and that you're a living God still the same today Lord not just a God of scripture but if you could raise up out of history as your prophet said and Lord we could just worship together and you'd be pleased Lord to dwell within your praises and within Lord our presence this morning we commit Lord those that would hear and myself that would speak to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. I feel like I'm a little bit uh I need to grow a few inches cuz uh this is definitely high up on me here, but maybe we'll we'll just uh share a little bit from our heart. The scripture there says, as I was saying there, go to let us build a city. And they said, go let us make a name. This was the Tower of Babel. Of course, we'd have heard this in our Sunday school when we were little children. And their objective was to build something that was great, something that was mighty, some accomplishment that they had done themselves, something that they had they had desired to do. If you look at the scripture, it says, \"Let us make us a name.\" They that's their whole desire was somehow to raise themselves up. But God, he had actually had a desire to scatter the people. He wanted the earth to be filled with life. They said, \"No, no, no. We we want to make us something. We have our own names sake to be made. We we need to put an image out there of who we are and and what we can do and and what we're made of and what we're about and and how big we are lest lest we be scattered. They didn't want to be scattered. They didn't want that really to to replenish and to let that life force go out upon the earth. They said, \"No, we're going to be here and we're going to do something for ourselves.\" And and today I can imagine, you know, how not much has really changed God's seed is is desires to send forth. But unfortunately through the world today too many are concerned and we live in an age that is very self-centered and and all they care about is really let us let me make an image unto myself. Let me create my own Instagram profile or let me create my my new explatform or or this or that or the other. Let me project what I am and what I can do. Now that spirit hasn't changed since Genesis till now. Amen. And so that continues in scripture. He says, \"And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower.\" So God now has stepped down to see what the children of men had built. And the Lord said, \"Behold, the people is one.\" God recognized that they had come together as one. They were united and they have all one language. And this they begin to do. And now nothing, listen to what what God is is saying here. Now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do. Anything that is in their heart, anything that's in their imagination, nothing can be restrained. They've united together and they can do anything they desire. Think about that. This is a an observation as the Lord came down. He said, \"Go to let us go down.\" And there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech. And they at that moment were unified together by their language. This is what gravitated them together. And in a moment that language is is is is what made them one. And in a moment they were no longer one. Amen. Their unity disintegrated. The moment their language was removed. They no longer could communicate to each other. They they couldn't express what was in their imagination. And here now one was speaking this language and another was speaking another. And the unity was broken. And just like that, they were suddenly separated. And what had united them was was not of a of a heavenly nature. I could say it was of a natural ability that they had within their human human uh being and to to project their own aims. And the scripture continues. So the Lord scattered them abroad and from fence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city. Therefore the name is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth and so here we see the the beginnings of in Genesis as the people now scattered broken and separated and I'll just point and I'll maybe just read the scripture in John 17 and 10 Jesus saying and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. And I come to thee, holy father, keep through keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me. Jesus is praying that they may be one as we are. God had a desire for unity. He had a desire for union that they may be one as we are. And so I want to take up just a little thought this morning and maybe if I could title it unified by our identity or united by our identity and unity is is is something that uh people can come together in a moment to find a common ground. It's it's when people can can find maybe a common cause and it can be as small or as great as as one can imagine. You know some people unite on soggy Rice Krispies. Brother Kyle, as I heard yesterday, you know, you know, you find someone that has a common like as you like and suddenly you're best buddies and uh because you know, you have this interest or a hobby that you find common ground on or or you unite. Many of course countries have united to conquer and and they've come together because they they desire for their for for unification. I would say the world longs for unity. They really do. It's why everyone is so inclusive today. You know, they're trying to come up with some way to bring a unification of the world in some way, but it's a perverted way. But it's something they thirst for. They thirst for unity, something inside of them, cuz at the beginning there was, then they were broken up because they had a perverted desire. But God desires unity. That's his heart. And so, man, it has it built in. And so, there's a incredible power that can come with that as we see in the in the scripture that they had, they were not restrained. And so man seeks it because they know with unity there is indeed power. There's an ability and and if I could just maybe drop in a little uh anecdotal piece of a factual piece of nature for you that could maybe uh bring this out. There's uh there's a Japanese honeybee in Japan and uh there's also a Japanese hornet in Japan. And so these two uh live in the same world in the same area but the hornet is actually the largest in the world. It is two almost has 2 in or so long. It's got a quarter inch stinger and it's got a wingspan of about 3 in. You they're they're big. They're they're monsters and they pack a wallup of wallops of a sting. Not that I've ever had one, but I can imagine. And so these hornets are so large they can actually take on 10,000 count honeybee hive. If there's 10,000 or so bees in a in a hive of a honeybee, they only a dozen or so of these hornets can wipe them all out. quite immediately. They go in there with their with their pinchers and and just tear them apart. And you real you'll notice that an American and and a hybrid and import um honeybees actually cannot stand against these hornets. But the native Japanese honeybee have figured out how to deal with them. And so these hornets will send in a scout and they'll send in it to try and find where the honeybee is. And they'll come into their into their uh into their hive. And the the honeybees will not do nothing until until that hornet touches one of the honeybees. They they kind of let let it be. But the moment it takes and starts to attack one bee, the bee after bee now in the hive start to conglomerate on this hornet and they create what they call a beeball on this hornet and they just continue to grow grow grow and grow until they completely surround in unified force against this hornet as he's tried to come in invade their territory. But they find here's an attacker. And so they come and they they create a a whole ball around him and they surround him and intensify the heat around him and they raise the heat just um not even a degree above what that hornet can handle and they kill him. They have figured out the strength of unity. They figured it out. Nature figured it out. If a bee can figure it out, surely surely man, surely God's people, we can understand God's desiring to unify with his people. Amen. And so all other ground, as we know, the scripture is sinking sand. And and and if if it isn't Christ, if it isn't the word, at some point, whatever you're founded on, whatever you're unified on will crumble. That's just the the bare facts of it. Balum, we see that happen. Kora unified people. They they they they they brought people together, but their unity I could say the unity in itself isn't necessarily the key, but what they were unified on was the problem. So whatever you're unified on is the key to unity. That's really where where it counts. And so some, you know, have unions and are teetering on a fine edge because indeed it's just a whisper away from fracturing their foundations. We've seen conquerors over time try and do that and bring certain things together for their own desires. But human unity is fragile. It's fickle and it's finite. It is. And if you don't know what fickle means, it's an older word. It's changing frequently, especially in regards to one's loyalties, interests, and affections. So, humans unity, if it's on a humanistic aspect, it's sitting there and it's really only based on some interests and affections. And we know that interests change. You grow. And we know interests change as we heard at the grad yesterday. And so humans change and they can get into a problem when they unify on some humanistic aspect. And if we go into scripture just as a a bit of a foundation or or sometimes I find myself going I go down the uh you know kind of go down the negative road to show the positive. And uh so I'll just I'll just going to go down there a little bit. Help me. And then we'll jump back on the other side. Is that okay? The law of contrast is sometimes an easy lesson. Yeah. Jehoshaphat in the scripture, he gets approached by Ahab. And Ahab says, \"Hey, Jehoshaphat, we've got land to take. There's our God-given possession. You know, this is a good, you know, a good idea. We we should go and take our land. Would you come and and join with me, please? You know, your armies and your chariots and and your horses and let us all be one, Jehoshaphat.\" And so Ahab had a desire, but his desire, I don't really think, was to to possess what God had given him. Ahab's desire was not quite founded, I don't think, on really the real foundation. Then Jehoshaphat, you know, he was seeing through he wasn't really seeing through it all completely because he was getting drawn into, well, that sounds like maybe a good idea. I mean, what he's saying is is not too terrible, but you got to be very careful what you listen to and what you get caught up with because it's very subtle how that drawing into, hey, be part of what I what we are and you're like, well, you're trying to discern and got tripped up sounding the the idea sounded pretty good. It it sounded right. Well, yeah, that is our land. You know, we should we should go out there. But if you don't be careful, unity on the wrong basis can get you in deep deep trouble. deep trouble. Jehosh jehoshaphat knew and I I just wonder you know Ahab had been prophesied to die. Elijah had already prophesied that the dogs would lick his blood blood and here Jehoshaphat was in this position and Ahab worked on him. Brother Brandham said he was a borderline believer a lukewarm halfbaked so-called believer. That's that's brother Brandham. He was a pretty good fellow. He repented many times. Brother Brandham said he was caught up in the things of the world but was it was he had enough to believe some scripture. you know, let's claim some land. And so, you know, there was enough. He looked good enough. Or maybe he came to church often or somebody, you know, it's like, yeah, he's a pretty good believer, but he was not all the way. But Abraham said, a pretty good fellow and he was repented times, but he's lukewarm, halfaked, and so-called. So, here was Ahab, and he calls for Jehoshaphat to make an alliance or a union and unite. But Abraham says, Jehoshaphat was invited down to visit Ahab. Ahab showed him all his all the fiery that that that Israel had. And that's when a believer can get into the wrong company. When Jehoshaphat went down to fellowship with Ahab, he got in the wrong pew. He got in the wrong pew. Somehow he got he came to church or something like that. He got in the wrong pew with Ahab. And Ahab started to talk to him, but it wasn't of the right origin. The unity wasn't coming from the right channel. And he started to poke at at Jehoshaphat. I don't know how long he he tried to poke him, but he did for long enough. And Joseph started to lean in. He says, \"Now,\" but the Ram says, \"Now, there's so many times that people can do that with good intentions, people don't mean to do wrong, but they can get caught up with what sounds good. It's a real issue, but they don't see the spirit behind it. And then they don't consult God and what about it and what they and what they should be doing.\" And Abraham says on at one time then when a believer got in the wrong company, he says, \"We have that all the time. A believer by the name of Jehoshaphat got on the wrong company. And when a makebeliever and a believer get together, you got trouble. So we had trouble here. And so Jehoshaphat not realizing it unites with Ahab and he becomes part of Ahab's cause. You don't realize what you actually join yourself to. When you you unite with somebody, you realize you're actually united with everything that they are. You've united with their whole cause. You've identified with everything that they are. Willie, whether you like to or not, you have because you've you've saddled yourself up beside them. And so now his problems is your problems. His worries are your worries. His beliefs almost look like your beliefs. You're like, \"Well, no.\" But no, you've identified with that. You got to be careful. See through it, please, brothers and sisters. We can look at the scripture, but we're living in a day and age where the Satan is so subtle, trying to unite, trying to get you off the word just a little bit. unite with something that's just twisted just a little. It looks pretty good. But it's of death because it's hybrid. And a hybrid religion, a hybrid word is death all the way through. And Jehoshaphat needed to see through it. And here he gets right now mixed up with Ahab. He's assumed now all Ahab's problems. Ahab's enemies were now Jehoshaphat's enemies. Think about it. Jehoshaphat wasn't fighting them people before, but now he's with Ahab. I got to fight with him. Well, you know, let's go. You've saddled up now. Now here we roll. And so Jehoshaphat now is associated. He has to accept the things that he normally maybe wouldn't do. Ahab might come with his whole strategy and say, \"Hey, this is what I think we should do here. We should move our armies this way.\" And Josh's like, \"Yeah, I don't know. That's that's a terrible idea. I I really don't like that. You know, actually, Jehoshaphat, I'm going to disguise myself and you're going to go like looking like kings.\" Uh, that really puts me at a disadvantage, doesn't it? No, I think that's a really good idea, Jehoshaphat. You look all you you dress in your kingly robes. I'm going to disguise myself so they don't know what I look like. Yeah. Well, so then I'm the target. Well, I don't agree with that, Ahab. Tough luck. You You join with me. I call the shots now. Jehoshaphat, wait a second. Isn't this a 50/50? No, no, no, no, no. I'm I'm running this army. I'm running this battle. And suddenly, Jehoshaphat realized he sucked into more than he bargained for. You got to watch what you unify with cuz you might get sucked into more than you bargain for. And so Jehoshaphat now is is gets here. And he comes to pass when the captains of the chariot saw Jehoshaphat that they said surely look at this now. Now if I go back Jehoshaphat did have a little bit there. I don't want to skip too far but I'm I'm racing against the clock. Of course he called for Micaiah. We know that he called for the prophet and they he said you know they everybody was saying you can go. It's good to go. And Jos said, \"I I'd like to hear from a a prophet, please.\" And so he he his heart was stirring. Something's a little off here. Something's a little wrong. I need to We need to go back to the word. I just don't I just don't quite see this lining up. I need to go back to the true word. I need to get into the message myself. I need to hear from the word of the hour. Give me a prophet that's true. I don't like him. I don't like what he says. He kind of preaches against me, but it's true word. I know it's too tough. I got to hear it. Sometimes it tells me I can't do this. I shouldn't do that. Ah, grace against me. Come on, Ahab. I want to hear the truth. Something in Jehoshaphat rang out cuz a seed inside was just grading against it. It got sucked in, but he was grading. Amen. So they go forth into battle and surely it came to pass when the captains of the chariot saw the Jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of Israel. Yeah I can bet you Jehoshaphat said see I told you Ahab. Thanks a lot. It's like well you unified. And so he's there in his chariot and he says and and they turned aside to fight against him. So now it's like Jehoshaphat suddenly the target and the scripture says he cried out. Jehoshaphat came to a point where he was not willing to take the hit for Ahab any longer. He came to the point where he's like, \"Forget it. I'm not willing to go down this road any longer. I It's not true. It's I'm not falling. It's it's off a little bit and I'm willing to I need to cry out, oh God, take me. Save me from this.\" Nothing mattered anymore because now it was Jehoshaphat's life on the line. You come to a point where you realize my family's gone this way. My life has gone this way. I've gone off the edge to be an edge. I' I've unified with things of the world and I'm done with it. Oh God, I'm crying out this morning because I need to come back to the word. You should have never been there in the first place. Amen. And I wonder how many believers are getting in trouble in times and they may even be in a battle and it looks like everything is against them and they get because they get caught in the wrong union as Jehoshaphat did and they don't realize that the battleground around them is actually really the cause of a wrong alliance and mistakes they've made, trials they've had actually the trials that Jehoshaphat was going through is because it was his choice. He made a wrong choice. We've all made wrong choices. I've made wrong choices. But you know what the difference is? Jehoshaphat was willing to do something. Jehoshaphat cried out. Jehoshaphat did something. He didn't hunker down in his idea. Well, this just is what it is. and and and and and that's too much pride. You mean I got to humble myself and I got to make this right here. I got to do that or I got to walk back and I got to go talk to the pastor and and tell him, you know, I was wrong here. I shouldn't have never done that. You know, no. Jehoshaphat humbled himself. Yeah. He was a king, but he humbled himself. And the scripture says he cried out. But if you go into second Coronicles, it goes even a little further than just that. cuz if you leave it there, it cried out. He's like, \"Well, what what happened?\" But 2 Chronicles 18:31 says, \"And it came to pass when the captain saw Jehoshaphat, and they turned there, and the compass about him to fight, but Jehoshaphat cried out.\" And it continues on, and it says, \"And the Lord helped him, and God moved them to depart from him.\" If you cry out, don't hunker down just because you've got maybe stuck in some sort of unification with something that you know is wrong. cry out. And the Lord helped him. The Lord stepped on the scene. The Lord says, \"I see you. I know you maybe made a bad choice. That's okay. I'm still here. You're still mine. You're still my seed. Just cry out. Don't get all condemned and oh, down and the devil pound on you. Yeah. No one's going to accept you anymore. No one's going to even want to talk to you anymore. You should be ashamed of yourself. You just go in your little hole and hunker down until the end of time.\" No. cry out and say, \"Oh God, restore unto me the joy of my salvation.\" And your scripture says, \"And the Lord helped him. And if he helped Jehoshaphat, if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, I can tell you if you cry like Barnameus, if you cry like the woman in the in the well, or anybody in scripture, he will help you.\" Sometimes we just don't cry. Don't get sucked in to some alliance with some union with something of the enemy and stay there. Not a moment longer. Jehoshaphat's there for you. Cuz a trail of of a wrong union. When you unite, you create a covenant. A union is a covenant. You know, when someone makes a covenant, it does more than just bring people together. They when you enter into an alliance or a covenant or a union, it's it's something more. You're joining at a layer much deeper than hey, hey buddy, how's it going? Yeah. Hey, great. Great. Having a good day. See you later. That that's that's not a union. When you unite, it's you're becoming one. Scripture in Exodus 34 says, \"Observe that thou which I commanded thee in this day. Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Hitittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\" This is God speaking, \"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, whether thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee.\" God is warning, don't unite. Don't make an agreement. Don't make an alliance with the inhabitants of the land. He says, \"But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, cut down their groves, for thou shalt worship no other god, for the Lord whose name is jealous.\" That's a strong scripture. Why is his name jealous? He said, \"Really?\" Because we we often have a a negative connotation to jealous ether jealousy or or someone has a that's a it's a negative word in our mind jealousy. But God has actually said his name is jealous because God when he would when he identifies in scripture and if we go to verse 15 he says lest they'll make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods. God always, if you see often in scripture, when they start to go and unite with idol worship, he relates it to whoring. He relates it to a union, a false perverted union with a perverted life that comes out of it. And so God's saying, \"I'm jealous over you. I desire unity with you.\" It's a jealousy of a husband for a wife that someone is trying to make approaches and he's jealous over you and he says don't you dare go a whoring after another god. Don't you dare unite with something that's perverted because out of that union produces perverted life. [Applause] You and I have been trained to believe that God's heart is a heart of love because we have a fuzzy self-centered possessive desire. this kind of definition of love. We we tend to imagine that God's just always forgiving, which he is, but generous and kind and overlooks his children's mistakes and rebellions and holds his breath until eventually stop acting like we are and return to his care. But we don't realize that God's a jealous God. Do not care. He God cares for you. He desires your unity. He desires your relationship and he's fervent for it. And so he's passionate in scripture. He says, \"Don't go a whoring. Don't make a relationship with another idol. And that's in that's in Israel. But what about today? What about today? God's just as passionate about our spiritual walk. Just as passionate about our natural desires. If we place anything above him, it's an idol. It could be an interest. It could be a desire. It could be a sports. I don't really care what it is. But if it's above him, you are going a whoring after it. And he's saying, \"I'm jealous over you. I desire a union with you. Kill it. Knock it down. Kill the idol. Break the statue. I just want you [Applause] cuz idolatry was always connected with a wrong union. It relates to a marriage union. The worship of another God was viewed as entering in to a perverted relationship. And God hated it. He hated it. And he's jealous. My name is jealous. Because a union is actually the passing of life. It's the transition or the transferring of life from a man to a woman. And idolatry as a union was passing perverted seed which brought forth perverted life. And Israel was forgetting that they have been called, as we go through the different scriptures, Israel been called to be a separate people, a peculiar nation, not to be united with any other. We know this. Anything before God was an idol. You know, it always starts small though. It's not really a big deal. It's a little harmless, especially in this age. We have to tolerate so much or they try to tell us we have to tolerate so much. We don't have to tolerate nothing. You don't have to you don't have to succumb to anything. Hollywood pushes its way in your face. Politics push it way in your face. Music, fashion, I don't really care what it is. Your culture, social culture, I don't really care what it is. It pushes change in your face. You have to accept it. You have to believe it. You just have to tolerate this. I don't tolerate nothing that is beyond this right here. If it isn't on the word, if it doesn't align with that, I will not unite with your idea because I will not accept your battle. I will not accept your redeem all the the the consequences of it. I unite with the word and the word alone. That's more prevalent in this age than any age. Never. Never just take a step as Jehoshaphat did. Well, it's all right. Maybe I should. You shouldn't. Stay right here. Stay right here. Amen. Often people leave this message and often they become more spiritual. And it has this perception, why we've never had it better. You just give it time. You just give it time. And you find out because it takes time for a little seed to grow. and you just don't move and you just watch the life and you watch the life and then you just wait and you watch that life. It'll either be true if it's on there. If it's not, it'll be deformed and perverted and in time anyone that I know don't get sucked into the very tendencies of the beginnings. Oh, it looks pretty good. It isn't good. You just watch it. Amen. Amen. Israel got confused on their identity of really who they were. They had gotten Balam had tried to suck them in and they'd created some unions and such and you know I can imagine you know Balam and the Amorites and the Moabites you know the Moabites trying to tell them that they were the same. And if you take a step back and realize that the Moabites in Israel had nothing in common in their identity of who they were and Israel should have taken a step back and and said wait a second where do I come from? Where is my identity? Because Moab would have had to go back and put their identity in a in a perverted relationship with Lot. Israel would go back to their identity and say, \"Wait a second. I come from the lineage of Abraham. I come the lineage of father Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. That's where I come from. And you're telling me I'm the same as you and you come out of Lock B. That's not what I'm identified with.\" They should have taken that step back and realized there was nothing the same with their identity and where they came from. That's good. My identity is in the covenant that Jehovah made with my father Abraham. We're a chosen people. We're a holy nation. We're peculiar people. That's what they should have been saying. No, we're the same. We worships very similar. No, you don't. I worship the true and living God. And I just can tell you just by looking at everything around, we're not the same. But it just takes even just one. And I haven't I'm sure I really want to long I'm going to book an appointment with Caleb in scripture. And so I have many million years reserved with him. So you'll have to take a second seat after me cuz he's one of my favorite of scripture. And he's he knew his lineage. You know, he I I I note in scripture, note his verbiage. Note his words. He spoke in Numbers 13 and 30. And Caleb stealed the people before Moses. You know the scripture. And he said, \"Let us go up at once and possess it.\" He said a certain word in scripture. It's let's possess it. Because if we can go back, he can track his identity back to his father Abraham who said in Genesis when the angel of the Lord came to Abraham the second time and he said, \"By myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord, because thou hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee. Multiplying I'll multiply. Thy seed is the stars of heaven and the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy.\" That's what Caleb was reaching back and saying, \"That's what I'm uniting with. That's where I come from. We can possess it because the promise is there.\" Moab couldn't go back to that. Yes, sir. Good. I wonder about the spiritual seed of Abraham, the royal seed. Can we get caught like maybe and cry out maybe like Jehoshaphat? We sometimes we can get confused on our identity and oh maybe slip into that but because we didn't come from a harlot mother. We didn't come from some denominational system that says well we just kind of look the same. We can worship the same. No we cannot. We have a word of the hour. I can go back to where the source came from. That my identity is straight from the word of the lord. Not from some system not from some unification that we see going on today. We're not unified with that. We are unified with the word of this hour. My eternity doesn't my my identity doesn't go back to some nice council 325. I ain't going to some celebration 1700. That's not where I came from. I came from eternity and I go back to eternity. I don't have an origination here on this earth. I come from the eternal seed of God. Oh glory. Thank you. It's important to recognize your nationality. I realize I'm speaking in America. I do realize that, which should be a plus because then you really, really get it. But, you know, that's why the Olympics is a big deal because everybody rallies around their nationality. Yeah. You could be living in America, but your roots go from Sweden. Well, I wonder who are you cheering for suddenly. Well, you know, it's Swedes that I'm cheering for. Or maybe it's Norway or maybe it's China or wherever it is. But somehow something greater than maybe just your habitation takes effect. Maybe where I'm planted don't matter no longer, but where I came from suddenly has a very powerful pull. And so they cheer. They Yeah. Go Norway. Well, you're red, white, and blue. Well, yeah, I know, but actually I come from Norway. Who knew? Every four years you find out. And suddenly it conjures up a level of unity you never see in other aspects. Way beyond the Rice Krispies, but a cow. It goes somewhere deeper. Brother Brandham says, \"Let me take it a little further. The scriptures is what tells you what you are.\" And I wonder what could really happen or I should say what is happening when the church of the living God starts to recognize my nationality. [Music] Hey, where you really came from. It isn't a red, white, and blue banner. It isn't a red maple leaf. It isn't nothing to do with that. I come from another country. And when we can come to that recognition, the unity is at another level. I said, let's identify who we are a little bit. Can we do that this morning? Let's let's go back and find my type, your type, because it's always good to to rehearse where you came from. Amen. I They can reminisce. You know, when people get together, have been apart for a long time that are come from the same place, they start talking about different things. Hey, do you remember this? Yeah. If I was going on the Norway thing, hey, the Lepsa, you like the Lepsa? I love Lepsa. I mean, yeah, I know the best Lepsa comes from here. I don't even know there's any Norwegians in here. But you start to talk about your origin. You start to to discuss all the all the different things you love there. Maybe some you haven't had a certain piece of food for so long, you're like, \"Oh, I just wish I could have certain such such food.\" Yeah, I know. We don't get good stuff here. So you talk on that level. So let's talk about our origin. You can find a match in scripture where you are and who you are, who you can line up with because scripture is where you come from. And so if you can find yourself here, you can actually then you know where you do come from because this is telling you as brother says scripture is what tells you what you are. And so you can say, well, many can go in there and I can see ones that have have perseverance or those that have courage or those that have patience or steadfastness or Job and different ones longsuffering through through hard pains and such. But I want to go even deeper than that because there's a strain that goes deeper than just identifying with someone that was perseverant or David with with great courage because there's a strain that goes somewhere deep past the surface level of our beings. And it's when the word was made manifest in their hour, something triggered. It's called faith. Amen. Amen. They believed. When God came by Abraham's way, he believed. Yes, he did. When the widow of Zarapath stepped out on Elijah said, \"Bake me a cake.\" And she's all she had was just nothing left but for herself and she's going to die. And he says, \"Bake me otherwise.\" And then, you know, we'll go from there. Kind of thing. and she just trusted in the word that was speaking to her in that moment. That's a strain that runs through all of God's people. It can point you back to your origin when the word comes by your way. Like a Peter when he said you're from your name is is Jonas and and he points to Nathaniel and said I seen you under the tree or the woman at the well. All of them had the same strain. They believed the word as he stepped by their way. Then in this day, if the word of this hour would start by your seed and shines a light on your life, what is you're going to what's your heart going to do? It responds and it tells you where you came from. [Music] Shunomite woman, Jeremiah, Paul, Polycarp, Luther, all had a word come in their hour. And in this hour, heaven's homeland security is coming by and is doing doing identity checks. He's looking for a passport. You know what they're looking for? The word's looking for a faith response to the word of this hour. When this message came by your way, you say, \"Can't sell believe?\" And the word presents a check. Uh, can I see your identity? You know what it looks for? It's like, I see faith. I see faith. I see response to the word. I made an understanding, brother Michael, but I believe it. That's all heaven's looking for. It's like, yep, there it is. There's another one face seat of Abraham. There's another one face seat of Abraham. There's another one like the one at the whale. They got the same identity on the check with the word of this hour. I can say they're homebound. Amen. Fathan and Kora in the scripture, they went along for so long. But when it started getting a little tighter, that's when you realize then you can see, hey, where's the identity? Where's your identity? It's going to come. It's coming. It's here. It's getting squeezing. The pressure is becoming so tight, this going that way, someone going this way, and you finding out, wait a second, and I'm walking alone. That's okay. God's people have always walked alone. Micaiah walked before Jehoshaphat alone. Elijah walked alone. Many in scripture walked alone. That's your identity. Standing on the word. If it's alone, so be it. So be it. The 70 he left went to weed them out when the word got real tight. Oh my. But through all them dark ages, God was waiting for a time. He'd prepared a word for a special hour to ignite. He knew it'd be a dark age in Leosia. He knew it'd be oh gross darkness fill the earth. He knew young people that it would be difficult. He knew what you'd be going through. He knew you'd be hammered and hammered through ad and this ad and through every app and social media platform and everything. All the pull and the draw and the desire and the tanalization of entertainment. He knows and he knew. So he prepared a word for this hour to ignite a recognition of where you came from. That's why we cherish this message because it's bringing to you the reality that we're heavenbound. a reality of your identity that you came from God and you're going back to God. That's why Brother Brandham could speak on the ego scream because that's exactly what was happening. The message would scream out and bring you back to that pro little ego as you know the story probably 1,800 times. But I'll tell it to you again because there he was pecking his life out in misery on the worms of this world and he's wondering man living surely he would look down and then look up and look down and look up and man we're just not the same. No, some of you that maybe were sitting in some denominational system and you would go to church maybe day in and day out or week in and week out and you'd be like, \"Man, it just ain't hidden.\" You know, but what else is there? This is the best I can see that old chicken eating the worms. Really? Is this all there is? My soul crith for more. My deep calleth for more. But this is all I see around me. That's why God prepared this message to help you to look up a little bit, hear something a little different that starts to trigger something. You realize, you know, that first time in that story when that little eagle would have seen mama eagle. Wow, look at that creature. That is the most stunning, amazing thing I ever saw. Amen. Wait a second. There's something similar to what I see. There's something similar to what I hear that's calling something here. That must be where I belong. Hallelujah. Amen. Then you look at the chick and you say, \"Exactly right. I knew I wasn't like you. That's what I'm like. Oh no, that's the enemy. Run for the hills.\" We'll leave it there. Why? Because God was desiring to unite you with him. Cuz God is desiring union. It's not dos and don'ts, young people. It's far beyond dos and don'ts. Cuz when you recognize his love is calling you. It's a love relationship. You say, \"Lord, you've called. You saved me.\" And you start to go through scripture what he did for you. I say, \"Lord, the dos and don'ts fade away.\" And all these things and all your eyes stay on him. The son of man, Christ Jesus, united heavens and earth. God reconciling man when he came to break the curse that divided and broke fellowship and broke union and he comes down to mend that a complete union. Now God dwelling in flesh. Brother Brandham says when God and Christ became one when the dove came down on the lamb heaven and earth kissed each other and God and man was reconciled together. He says, \"Why?\" It was one of the greatest moments the world has ever had. God desiring to unify once again with his creation. But this was not the end. The end all, I should say, as God had he he's going to bring now peace and men the chasm. The image that he had made now was redeemed. But God had a greater desire than to leave it just there. This hour he was going to reveal himself again as a son of man for the whole purpose so that you could come to yourself and recognize your identity and realize I don't just want to come and mend the chasm but I need to I need to abide within you. Yes. wasn't just to come and and redeem man that way, but God wanted to come now and abide within and unify him with you and that aspect of coming to yourself and when you realize where your identity is and God can reveal that to you in such a revelation and and that union then therefore cannot it can't be broken. Revelation can't be broken. When God reveals that to you, it's you and your alone. Devil can't put his little fingerprints or his toe printints on that area that God alone has. So when he reveals where you came from, now that is tied for all eternity because there's nothing that can break it. It's like the prodical son when he was there there in the in the pig in the mud mud pit of of sin and despair and there he was wondering and and in the muck of shame and condemnation. But something changed. An angel came by his way and he came to himself. That wasn't something he conjured up. It wasn't something that he, oh, I must, I must, I must believe, I must believe. No, nothing of that nature. It was God that descended and said, listen, boy, get up and go back. God brought him back to himself. A revelation came upon him of what? Who he was. He sat there and said, \"Wait a second. What am I doing here? I am actually the son of my father. Why am I in the pig pen? That was a revelation God gave of his identity. His identity never was broken ever. He just came to recognize it was there. Your identity has never come out of nowhere. It was always there. God always knew you. He had you in the foundation of his mind before the foundation and you just came to the recognition. Yes, sir. That's what this message is. Has the power to bring recognition back to your soul of where you originally came from. Hallelujah. It didn't matter what the prodical son did. It didn't matter his all his mistakes, how vile and how wretched, how terrible and how down. It didn't change his identity. That's true. I don't care how heavy the condemnation that the devil puts upon you. It don't change your identity. Amen. Amen. All you got to come to is allowing God to straighten your soul with revelation and it's over. It's over. Amen. That's that is a unity. Believing on his word will bring life. We can see it all through scripture. Abraham believed God's word brought forth in Isaac. Hannah believed the priest's word and she brought forth a Samuel. Shunimite woman believed the word of a prophet brought life to her son twice. Actually, Elizabeth brought forth a son. Mary by faith in the word of God brought forth the word of God. And so when you unite with the word, the inevitable production is life. But Abraham says, \"There you are. That's oneness with God.\" When that power works in me, works in you, we are one. He said one is with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word all the word the whole word and make it manifested in power. I thought Lord if we could just come to a place where we can recognize really what lies within you like well brother Michael I'm just a believer here in Tennessee. No, no, you're not just a believer in Tennessee. You are actually omnipotent. You say, \"Well, that's a tough one to swallow.\" Well, wait a second. Wait a second. Does eternity lie within you? It does, doesn't it? Because you're a seed of God. If you're a seed of God, you come from the eternal thoughts of God. And God does not have any time bound elements to him. So, he's eternal. So, therefore, who's eternal with him? Amen. So then if he's omnipotent, who is also filled with omnipotence? It would be his people. And so therefore, if you realize that you are walking with that seed inside of you, therefore the scripture then says, if two or three whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again, I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done of them of my father which is in heaven. Why? Because two omnipotants actually are coming together agreeing on the word of God. Your origin, your identity is there and you realize, wait a second, we have the power within us because the life of God is flowing through me and through you. So we agree on any one thing. Who is now coming behind that? [Music] You're calling on the power of all heaven. I have in my notes somewhere. I I can't even imagine Satan when he tried to tempt the King of Kings. You know that Satan actually Satan knew God on so many different levels. He was a Lucifer, angel of light. This He was powerful. He'd seen God in action. He'd seen God do so many things in heaven that I would even know how to describe. Lucifer had a second seat to it all. He had a front ring seat of all of God's power that uttered through the eternities as he as he worked his wonders. And then he saw God in his fury as Satan pulls away, takes the angels out, and they the war. And Satan knows the fury of God. Satan's seen God at work more than you and I have seen than ever. He knows who the King of Kings is. He does. Oh, yeah. and he comes down and he sees this little humble man and he's wondering who is this? But Abraham says he didn't believe that he was Emanuel and he's like who is this? Satan has seen God. He'd seen him in fury. He'd seen him in glory. He'd seen him shining. He'd seen him manifest attributes you and I haven't. And he's wondering who is this? And it was God. And he's confused. Well, dude, turn these stones into bread. And he's trying to he's trying to find out. Are you really the creator? Are you really the one that can preserve yourself? I've seen God show his force. I've seen God show his fury, but this isn't matching. Turn the stones into bread. It is written, \"Man shall not live by bread alone.\" That's an odd response. Well, I know that's in the scripture. And so, he throws it again. And he throws it again. And God spokes back the word to him. Speaks the word back to him. Devil's just scratching his head. Who on earth is this? I just don't believe it's Emanuel. There's no way this can be God. He's too humble. He's too simple. He's too He He I just can't even see it. He's from an illitant bird. There's no way this is the son of God. No way God would go into humble flesh like this. There's no way omnipotence reigns in that fleshly body. Amen. And the only time he got an answer to his question is when he stepped into hell. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. That's when he found out who he really was. He says, \"You've wondered, devil. You've wondered and you've wondered and you wondered. Wonder no longer. I'm going to take them keys from you. I've conquered everything you've tried to give and I'm stripping you of death and hell in a grave and I've come to show you my true identity. Hallelujah. He's doing that to you. Every day he pounds you, he's wondering, \"Are you really a son and daughter of God? Can you really be that? There's no way. She's too humble. She's too simple. There's no way. She's got mistakes. I mean, I pound her and I pound her and I pound him with her faults and his faults and he was tripped up here. How on earth could omnipotent be inside that body? [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's okay, devil. We've got a time coming when you're going to wonder no longer. When we sit beside the king in his throne and we stand there before the world and you can wonder all you want, but at that moment, you're going to start gaping. They were all this time I wasted my energy for nothing. Yep, you did. Yes, sir. Because we're more than conquerors cuz I got his life in me. I'm identified with him and he's identified with me. I can't wait for that moment. Because he still has that little question. He saw the miracles. Devil saw all the signs. He saw all the wonders and still wondered until we'll say it all together when we get there. Devil wonder no longer. Amen. Said, \"Brother Michael, I have so many mistakes.\" Well, we took care of that, but I'll just take care of it a second time just in case you missed the first time. God didn't unite with your flesh. No, he united with your soul, your faith. That's what connects you. But Abraham says, and just to give you the quote from questions and answers so you can take it home with you and put that in your pocket and for the next time the devil comes to your door outside in the parking lot. He says, \"How can I take a cocker and make it a grain of wheat out of it?\" He said, \"It's impossible.\" And you know the quote, he said, \"Inside the cockar has been transmitted from a cockab to wheat, cockar germ called wheat life.\" And brother goes through the quote. But the nature, he says, of the cockab is still sticky. See, it will be it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again. So, we're dealing with this flesh until that time. He says, \"And the cockabore is still sticky, but it's got a nature on the inside of it of wheat.\" So, you will make mistakes. We will stumble, but you'll get up because something inside of you drives you to get up. You can't quit whether you like it or not. You feel like someone throwing someone in the towel. Sometimes your family is moving this way and that way and you feel alone. But something inside, what is it? It's your identity. It's where you came from. Man, that's why the devil pounds you to try and make you forget. He tries and makes you forget. You know, it's not a wonder that Alzheimer's or dementia is so prevalent in this day. Natural type spiritual spiritually. There's a lot of spiritual Alzheimer's out there. Satan's so wre havoc. People have got confused and wandered on this idea of what the gospel message is. And the church has become so watered down and so weak need and not following the true word. They're trying to maybe look maybe trying to get people to to like what they're doing and they become more like rock bands than than a church service. That's a hey I nothing compares to worship by the true believers like this morning when you can just come with pure worship. Oh but there's churches are trying to fabricate something. It's that they got spiritual but ram called spiritual amnesia. He says how can you be a Christian and deny the word? You can't do it. He says, \"If I'm living in this generation, what this portion of word has promised for this generation, I've got to be that. If I'm going to be a Christian, I got to be identified with all that the Bible preaches and stands for everything. Every bit of it. I can't pick and choose. If I'm identified with it, I'm identified with all of it.\" Amen. The problem is people don't know what they're identified with. And if I could say this morning, some of you, well, help me. uh you know we maybe we'll be the 51st state sometime so I can kind of walk here prematurely. Okay. But if we I I have to say the US has forgotten a lot of what it stood for. What it founded on and what it fought for. It's it's forgotten that if they if they've got an amnesia or an Alzheimer's disease of what has what those original articles were founded on. If you go back to that life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, freedom of religion and one nation under God, they've left God. They now are even fighting for the They're not even fighting the same nation anymore. It's broken. Unity, the union. Amen. The definition of what even the forefathers fought for, of what America even defines, are very two different things. That's right. what people are fighting for now and really what the American Constitution as such even came up to uphold and to identify what you fought for your rights and rights and freedoms is so different. You know, I wonder if the men that fought for these way back would stand today. Yes, sir. They said that's what we fought for. What a terrible terrible moment. His wounded leg, blood running down. He's got a bullet wound here in his arm. He's leaning on his musket. And he could be brought to time and said, \"This is the state of the union.\" And he'd hang his head and he'd weep. I didn't fight for that. That's not what I stood for. That's not what my forefathers stood for. That's not what was written on the page. That's not what was written there. I didn't fight for that. Steven and Paul and Peter, they brought forth in time and they see the denominational system and Rome raising its head. They said, \"No, that's not what we fought for. We didn't stand for that.\" And not so long ago, then people went through and they started slashing everything down. We no longer want to be identified for that part of history. But that that's that's just part I mean there brother says is the good and the bad. There's all parts you identified with it all. You're destroying my identification. I don't want it no more. Brother says I must never forget this. I want to remain a true American citizen. I must remember that I'm I'm what my nation is for I'm identified by my nation. Catch the spiritual parallel please. to forget her, to fight for her, or to die for her, or to stand for all she stands for. I must stand for it. What my nation is, I am. What it stands for, I stand for it. Amen. You cannot forget what your nation stands for because then how do you fight for it? If you don't know what you're fighting for, you're like, well, I don't know. How do you have ferocity in the battle if you don't even know what you believe in? Well, you know, I think we I think we stand for for truth. Uh, what is serpent seed exactly? Haven't really been in the message lately. What do we What do we believe? Oh, yes. We believe in one God. No, no, you need to know what you're fighting for. Amen. They knew what they fighting for. I wonder if they someone read them the declaration or all of their desires. Here's what we're fighting for. We're not getting taxed. We're not having this. We're not being on the oppression. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm here for. Sign me up. Let me just read for you what we're fighting for. And we can go through scripture after scripture after scripture. And you're like, \"Yes, I believe that. I believe that. I believe that. That's exactly what I'm fighting. Sign me up.\" Amen. But says, \"You're no more an American citizen when you can't become part of it. And you're no more a Christian when you can't become part of him.\" Amen. Amen. And down through the ages, Satan's been trying to cancel or distort or create a a different remembrance of who God is. Trying to remove the statutes of what we stood for. I'd say if I could say, well, what are the articles that Christ stood for? Where are they? What is it that he hung on a cross for? That would take a very long long if I took the scroll of the of our declaration. Amen. of independence. That's right. This is my Declaration of Independence. I've seen yours. I've walked in there. I've looked at the original signatures and it's an amazing thing. I'm not even American, but I stand I almost salute. My goodness. I feel it. You walk in that rotunda and we Wow. I went in Canadian. I walk out like, \"Oh, I feel like an American.\" It's amazing with the natural nationality, the power of it. Brothers and sisters, thank you, Lord. What about when we start to look at the word of God, not signed by John Hancock, his big fancy Jay, whatever is their age, signed in blood from Calvary's cross. And we can walk up to the word and we can start to read it. say, \"Oh, God, I want to read my declaration. I want to read my freedom. I want to read what I'm fighting for. I want to read what I'm identified with because I'm a soldier of the cross of Calvary. This message, this word, lest we never forget.\" What do we stand for? If I could hold the volumes of this message here and stack them up high, God, we stand for this word. One word, one baptism, one faith, a united bride. Everything, our conduct, our respects, our home, our dress, our appearance, it's all there. It's all in our declaration. You know, it says in there, there's a word. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. My somebody was inspired. You know that word unalienable is quite a word. It means impossible to take away or give up. That's in your earthly declaration. Unalable. Unable to be taken away from or given away by the possessor. Freedom of religion. The most inalienable of human rights. Oh my goodness. That's your natural. Amen. What about this? Unal inalienable. Unable to be taken away. Once it was signed and sealed on Calvary, there's no way your rights and freedoms can be taken away. I started to look through. I said, \"Well, do we even have an idea of what those even are? What my what my where my identity is? I that's what the whole loosing of the seals has been is to identify who you [Applause] are. That's why then when you become identified with all of this, every aspect of it, then you can realize when brother Brandham says I'm identified. I was there with Abraham when he put the sacrifice of Isaac on the altar. I was there. Why? Because he's identified with everything Abraham is and identified with. I'm identified with Joseph. I'm identified with Jacob. I'm identified. I was with Moses. I was with David. I was with the Hebrew children. I was with Daniel. I was at Pentecost where the Holy Ghost came down. Why? Because I'm part of him. I was there with him at the cross. I'm identified with his sacrifice. You're part of him. You're united. Amen. Thank you, Lord. But the Rabb says, \"Don't get spiritual amnesia cuz you'll identify yourself with something else.\" He said, \"Stay right with that word.\" There are so many freedoms in the scripture. I don't even have time because of my time is up. Freedoms from guilt and sin and shame. And if you need to go through your declaration, just go to Romans 8:1. That's right. There is therefore now no condemnation. You haven't gone through your declaration. You maybe need to. You need to walk through there and say, \"Well, I'm have a need in my body.\" You need to go through your declaration of independence. And that's where you'd say, \"He shall lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. He's the healer of all my diseases. By his stripes, I'm healed. Yes. It's in your declaration of independence. You say, \"Well, brother Michael, I'm in desperate need. I need his help. I need the Lord.\" Well, just go to article number Psalms 12:21, sorry, 2:8. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. Amen. He will not suffer by thy foot to be moved. He that keepeth thee will not suffer. Behold, slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper. The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. He shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, even for ever more. My help cometh from him. My help cometh from the Lord, the writer and the center of my declaration. Hallelujah. As we come to a close, at least I try to. Now I'm going to descend. You know, when a husband and wife unite, there's something that happens. Everything that the husband has becomes hers. This is what union does, you know, in engagement and when they're seeing each other before and they're getting to know each other, she has no claim on nothing. Nothing. And he actually don't have much. He doesn't got no responsibility. You know those awkward times when the first time he he pays for her lunch, it's like, well, I kind of want to pay for her, but it's kind of weird, maybe. It's a friend. She's like, \"I've been paying for my own.\" It's It's that I'm just going from experience. It's kind of that awkward moment that first time you're like, \"No, I got it. You know, you want to be the man.\" \"Yeah, I got your I got your lunch.\" And she's like, \"Well, no, it's okay. We're not in her mind.\" She's like, \"No, we're not there yet.\" And he's like, \"Well, I really hope we're there. No, we're not. I'll pay for my own lunch. Thank you.\" You know, but you know, if the relationship is is to be, it progresses a little bit and he kind of starts to take, you know, more and more, but he doesn't have to. and and and and she and she has no claim on it's like, \"Hey, pay for me, will you?\" She's like, \"I'm not even married to you yet. We're not even engaged. What are you doing? What this whole thing's off?\" No, that's not it. It just kind of slowly gets there. But the moment they come to an altar, the moment they come into union, the moment they are united as one, everything changes. Everything. When she comes to that moment, he now assumes all her needs, everything. There's no way he can disassociate himself from it. And she has all claim. Honey, I have a great need. And he says, \"Here I am. I am everything you need. All that I have. My whole kingdom is yours. Not even up to half. Everything. Everything changes there. So the resources of your husband is at your disposal. Amen. She don't beg no more. Can I please get a hundred bucks? No, that's not how God works. Well, I put you on a budget, hun. Uh, looks like you're stuck to uh $10 more dollars this month and you're getting ain't no more food for this house. And if the kids starve, tough luck. I don't know if you're running home that way. That's all right. I'm not here. That's the pastor's job. But I know my God. Don't run my union with him as my husband, as his bride. He don't run that with me. Say, \"Oh, God, I'm in need. I've been here before. I'm needing you greatly this morning. My household or or my this or my job or I'm in a need of this. I'm in great financial need. I need a job. Oh, God. Would you come? Would you provide for me? My family, my my loved ones have gone astray. I need you to step and intervene.\" Well, you've been here before in prayer, and I've heard you time and time again, and it's just done and over. All right. No, that is not how it works. All the resources of heaven are at your disposal. Thank you, Lord. Brother Brandham says in a quote, he says, \"Now, brethren, when the brethren receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, this is the summit. This is all of it.\" He says, \"But brethren, that's wrong. There's no summit to God's power. We move on and on. It's the unlimited resources of God has never been tapped. Yet blessings and power that we know nothing about. I say get on your knees. I say cry out to your husband that you've united with. Say, \"Oh God, you're the untapped resource. I need more.\" He says, \"I have it. I have it.\" You haven't even begun to tap into the resources of glory. Amen. It's at your disposal. But have you asked him recently? Don't be shy. Don't be bashful. Maybe like Jehoshaphat, you need to cry out. So, oh God, I need your intervention right now. He's just waiting. You know when blind Barameus was there at the gate and he was going to cry out the crowd is shouting and yelling and Baram speaks about him being distance away Barameus voice could never get through the crowd and he says that faith reached out to him. I just wonder God knows all things and he must have been walking away and he's like two one zero there it is finan waiting for the cry. I just wonder whose cry he's waiting for right now. He knows this is welling up like Jehoshaphat's cry. And you come to that moment and say, \"Oh, God.\" Maybe not audibly, but maybe from here, from your heart, you start to cry out cuz he's here. He's here to answer your need. I don't serve a God that's disappeared since Calvary. I don't believe in a God that disappeared since 1965. I don't believe a God that disappeared since yesterday. He's here today. He's here today. A limitless God. Oh my, I just got too much here. I need to move on. My I'm so sorry. what that union does. You know, when there's union, inside of that bride is certain potentials and inside of the groom is certain potentials, but they can't be made manifest until there's a union. They can sit there dormant for so long. And inside is better brand scriptures, there was the promised seed inside of Abraham. But it needed to become manifest. It was sitting there. And there were certain attributes of Sarah, but they needed to be combined. And there's attributes in him that he needs you to be made manifest throughout. That's right. That's what this message came here at this hour to bring a union. Brother Brandham even says in a quote, he says that Jesus, there were certain parts of his ministry that he could not fulfill and he's left it for you. That to me is powerful. And I've thought about that here. Jesus Christ, the creator said, \"No, there's a portion of my ministry that I need to leave to my bride.\" Amen. What a responsibility you have to now complete the ministry of Jesus Christ living in flesh today. Amen. That puts a responsibility on our shoulders. Say, Lord, that that's what you're asking of me. Yes. Because every bride walks, wherever she walks, she carries the identity of her husband. She represents him everywhere she goes. And you represent him everywhere you go. I'll even read this scripture as we wind down here now. the kingdom of heaven and all of its power. Think about the kingdom of heaven and all of its power. That's a big phrase because my mind actually stops somewhere. What is all the power of heaven? Luke 17:20 says, \"And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of heaven of God should come, he answered them and said, 'The kingdom of God cometh not with observation. Neither shall they say, low here or low there, for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\" God has placed all the power of heaven in you. That is to me powerful. Satan took Jesus up on the mountain. Abraham said showed him all the kingdoms of the world. He said Jesus said, \"Get thee hence behind me, Satan.\" That's right. He wasn't he wasn't care. He said, \"If the kingdom of this world, I could call legions of angels, but my kingdom is not of this world, but my kingdom is in heaven.\" And he said, \"The kingdom of God will be within you.\" So therefore, the legions and powers of the backing of the holy angels, he says, \"Hallelujah is in you.\" Was born into the deity of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yes sir. Who are you this morning? Who is Christ Jesus? He's in you as much as you'll let him be. He's pressing, trying to get into you, to move into you today. And you stand off and wonder and look and gaze and hold back a little. Don't do that. He said, \"Move straight into the kingdom of God.\" The hour is here. The hour for the power of Almighty God, all of heaven's forces, the angels, and the power thereof is right here, pressing into you and me to say, \"Go be my representation. be my bride. Finish my ministry. [Applause] That's what the union has come to do. To get you to remember where you came from so that you and all the power of heaven can end this final age with your shoulders back. Young people walking in a gross darkness and say, \"I'm sorry, devil, but you cannot have me because I'm a son of God. Abraham says, \"Listen closely. The kingdom of God is his word made power.\" If you want to put that down, he says, \"The kingdom of God is God's word made power.\" What is the kingdom of God? Is within you. The kingdom's in you. And when the word comes in, what does the word begin? It turns itself into power, making it say just exactly what it said. Amen. That's why he says, \"Take no thought for what you should say because he is the power within you that is making sure you say what it said.\" You know, I think of all the resources of the enemy's kingdom. Satan needs a vessel. Legion was a vessel that he could express his demonic power through for a period of time. Pharisees were a vessel to express his religious demonic powers. Caesar was a vessel to express political demonic powers. They were all Satan's powers uniting with a vessel to express the attributes from in Satan's kingdom. And if that's how Satan works, we know that that's the perversion of how God manifests because God is desiring a uniting. God is desiring to manifest his own power. And if Satan has billions and billions of people to manifest his attributes through willing, they're willing to unite with that power. And you look at all of those, they're they're they're given over in such desire and they give themselves heart, soul, everything they have, and they throw themselves into everything that Satan is drawing them towards. I thought, \"Oh, God, if that's what Satan's people are willing to and desiring to unite, surely there's a people.\" What about the vessels of God that are desiring with everything within them to say, \"Oh God, I desire to unite with the Christ, the son of the living God, be expressed through me.\" Oh, I sure hope God isn't short changed that he's like, \"Is there is there one? Is there just is there two Satan all through the world? Billions of people that he's just expressing through. Look at that. Look at that attribute.\" And God is saying, \"Is there anybody willing to give themselves so surrendered, so surrendered to set aside everything of this world? I desire union. I've come with this age. I've come with this message. I've brought a prophet down your down in your day. I've preserved all that he said. There's a voice in this hour so that you could know where you came from. So that you could desire. Is anybody prerecting your heart?\" God is saying, \"Anybody, anybody, do you desire to unite with me?\" And I can imagine Satan strutting through all humanity saying, \"Look at all mine. Look at all mine.\" He said, \"Lord, this morning, if you could walk through this little service, you can say, \"Look at all mine. Look at all mine. The fairest of 10,000. their beauty beyond no beauty. I said, Lord, that's what I want to be identified with. I just want to surrender it all. I want you to be able to unite with this being, this vessel, this soul crying out, oh God, in this last day. I don't want any area of my life. If I need to shutter it, I need to cast this aside or that aside or this interest or that interest. I need to check my gauges. Lord, I want you to have full access to everything this being can be. Empty me out so that you may pour in. That's my cry this morning as we stand this morning. Is that your cry? Is that your desire? Say, \"Oh God, I want to be a willing vessel. I want to I desire, Lord, that there's something I need a uniting awaken to me my identity this morning.\" If that's your crying, you call out to him. Maybe you need to be like a Jehoshaphat this morning and say, \"Oh God, I'm in a fix this morning. I'm in a situation. Can you just please help me if that's your need? You just pray to him. I don't need to pray for you. I'll pray, but you pray too. You say, \"Lord, this is my need.\" Why don't you bow your heads this morning? Heavenly Father, Lord, there indeed is billions and billions of people and Satan has his hands on so many. And Lord, it's like he has just full access to to all the things of this world and to present his enticements. But Lord, there is indeed a people. It's a small little group. Your prophet said a little, very, very, very few. Because Lord, you've chosen a little elect lady to be a representation of your pure word in this hour. Lord, we lift our hands as we see the world is uniting. Rome is uniting. The Aoda churches are uniting. If that's in the negative, there's got to be the positive that's happening. You're bright around this world. We're not uniting on our ideas. We're not uniting on some false idea what this message is. We're uniting on the true word alone. on what this word pure word of the hour Lord cast aside we cast aside everything that's contrary to your word this morning and may you have your way move and deal Lord I pray amongst your people that Lord we could be so surrendered your prophet oh what an example he was that he was so surrendered that Lord you could work through him Lord we're not prophets but we're your bride and we desire oh that you could complete the ministry that Lord you've given to us to complete in this last stage, Lord, that we could be eternal life, bearers of eternity, Lord, amongst the dark hour. I commit your people, Lord, into your hand. May you bless them this morning. Would you touch their hearts in Jesus Christ's holy name? Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you, Lord. Oh, don't you appreciate the word of the Lord today? This is your house. Let's sing it together. Father, come and dwell. This is your house, a holy house. Well, the lost and the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares. This is your house. This is your house. Come and [Music] dwell. Let's just worship him now. We dedicate this temple to you Lord. We dedicate this temple Lord. Let your glory fill. Let it fill your sanctuary. Be enthroned in the praise of your people. Lord, we agree. In what? In unity. In unity. Everybody now. This is your house. This is your house. Father, come and dwell. This is your house, oh Lord God. A holy house of prayer where the lost and the [Music] lonely remember. Yes. All your cares. This is your house. This is your house. Father, come and dwell. Thank you Lord Jesus. Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit overflow. Overflow this place. Oh granted our God. Oh decorate our homes with grace with mercy. Let healing and let healing and redemption find search. Lord, have your way. Have your way. Thank you, Jesus. We humbly praise you, Lord. This is your house, oh God. We dedicate our lives, Father. Our bodies and lives are so warm. This is your house. Hallelujah Jesus. Thank you Lord. Holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely bring your burdens to him and all your cares visit your house. This is your house. This is your house. Amen. And we're going to have you, if you would, to just lay your hand over on the person standing there by you on the shoulder. Take him by the hand. If you don't feel comfortable, if it's a sister or whatever, you can move if you'd like. Jesus said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe. If you notice, he didn't just limit it to the preachers. Only God knows how many sick are here today. Maybe how many weary. Maybe some of you that are facing decisions in your life and you feel the spirit of God spoke to you this morning from what you heard. Now remember, Brother Michael and I did not sit down and talk together. Now, Brother Michael preached this, preach that, preach something else. But I know as the pastor, God used our brother here today to speak the very secrets of people's hearts. That's the discernment I believe in in this hour. The word is a discerner. Let's just pray for each other, shall we? Heavenly Father, as your prophet would have the people to do this multiple times and he would say eagle to eagle, believer to believer, Lord God, you see the needs of your children today. Hundreds of your people gathered here in this place. We believe that you've spoken to us. Lord, you spoke to me. I believe that you spoke to many, many more. Oh Jesus, we as American citizens, for those of us who are as our brother brought it so beautifully to us, Lord, our Declaration of Independence and Lord, our Bill of Rights and all that's given to us as believers, it parallels spiritually of what you've done for us. Oh God, I pray for your children today. Lord, in the name of Jesus, for those who are sick and need healing in their body, those who are oppressed of the devil, we say to your enemy and our enemy, take your hands off of God's property in the name of Jesus, sickness and disease and anxiety and suicide, may it leave the children of God right now in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, maybe there's some here today and they've tried and tried to press through and they just can't break it. But may the chain be broken right here today in the presence of Almighty God. Father, we pray for one another. Lord, for the young, for the elderly, for the sick, for the weary, whatever they are. We don't want to just limit it now to the visible audience, but for those who have streamed, those who go back and archive. Lord, may the power of God just fill their car so much they'll have to pull over on the side of the road while the anointing of the Holy Ghost comes inside their car, inside their home, inside their office. Lord Jesus, you see your bride has so many needs in this hour. May the glory of God overshadow the earth. Minister to the needs of your wife, heavenly father. Heal those that are sick. Deliver those that are bound. Oh granted I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the saints of God said thank you. Hallelujah. Oh we worship you Lord Jesus. Can we just lift our hands now in the presence of our great king. Whatever you had need of just tell him I receive it right now Lord. I receive healing of this cancer in my body this tumor. Whatever it is, in the name of Jesus, may it leave my body right now in Jesus Christ's name. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. We worship you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Whatever's on your heart. Amen. Praise be to God. Don't you love him today, saints? What an honor it is for us to be together in the presence of God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. We say to our guests today, brothers and sisters, we thank you for staying over different ministers I know that's here today. And I was thinking as our brother was speaking about things that bring us together and the school from from Cloverdale had brought uh many of these people here this weekend and they come together for what purpose to be able to see their children be able to graduate and give their appreciation to the teachers and all that. But I was thinking what a greater thing we have to come together the revealed word of this hour that God has given us. And we will fight for our rights. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. All we can do is pray for our Canadian brothers and sisters that maybe they'll become our 51st state. A minute. I'm just saying, you know, just Amen. It breaks your heart as an American citizen to see what our nation was and what it has become. I pray to God that one day we don't look back with regret and look at our message and say, \"This is what we had 30 years ago, 40 years ago, and look at what we are now. We're worldly. We're powerless. We're this or that. God forbid that that ever happens. God forbid that that ever happens. It's up to us whether it does or not. It's totally up to us as the people of God. What do we want it to be? To me, we'll still need the same power. We still need the same resurrection, the same Lord Jesus. Amen. God bless you. Harry, sing something for us. Let's just sing a little bit before we go. There's two times that a preacher wants to preach. That's when a preacher gets up and can't preach. when a preacher gets up and can preaches something. You know which one that was today. Thank you, brother Michael. God bless you. We're so appreciate you being here. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. I give myself away. Yes, Lord. Let's just sing this before we go, can we? I give myself away. So you there's anything you can't I give myself away. [Music] I don't have much Lord. You can take it, Father. I give myself away so you can use me. Here I am. Here I am. Here I stand. Lord, my life is in your hand. Lord, I'm going to see your desires revealed in me. I give myself [Laughter] [Applause] away. I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away. know you can use me. Take my heart. Take my life as a livinging sacriice. Oh my. Oh yes Lord I place him in your hands. I give myself away. I give myself away. Oh, you can use me. I give myself [Music] away. I give myself away so you can use [Music] me. My life is not my own. To you I belong. Lord I give myself I give myself to you. Oh my life is not my own to you. I belong. Lord I give myself. Amen. I give myself. Mean it with all your heart as we sing it. Hallelujah. is not mine. My life is not mine, Lord Jesus. You I belong. I give myself. I give myself to you. I give myself away. Hallelujah. Make your offering to him this morning. Raise your hands there. Give Jesus the offering of yourself. He don't want your money. He don't want your car. He wants you. Give yourself to it. Oh, grab it, Lord God. Give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. Lord, I don't know how much more life I have left over. How much strength I have, God, but I give it to you. Take me, Lord. Take every person here for granted. Lord, I give myself away. So you can use me. Our father, we thank you for this weekend. We're so grateful that we could be able to spend time together. Some of these graduates, Lord, the farthest traveled was a family from New Zealand, some from the east, some from out west, some from Canada, different places. For some of them, it was the first time in life they had ever met. And in my mind, I think of what your prophet said. One of these days, hallelujah, we will get together with the rest of the group and we will come up missing on the earth. the resurrection will take place. And he he called it a sweep that would come over us and in a moment we'll be changed and we're getting together with the rest of the group, Lord. People that we've never met, people that we've not even known in life, but we're getting together in another dimension. And he said, we come up missing on the earth. Then we know it won't be long. We'll be traveling like a salt. Father, may there not be a one of us missing, Lord. Oh, we believe that's a prayer that's according to your word. For every name is written in that lamb's book of life. Not a one has ever been taken out, or shall they ever be. We may never gather again quite like this, but Lord Jesus, we're longing for that time when we'll gather together up at your house. Go with those, Father, that'll be traveling back, flying, driving, whatever they will be. Give them of your traveling mercy until we meet together again, if not in this life, before your throne, Lord. Granted, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. God bless you. Would you just turn around, shake hands with somebody, two or three people around you there, it's been good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. God bless you. God bless each of you. Thank you for coming and spending this time with us here in Tennessee. We're so grateful to have all of you. Sing again, every whatever is on your heart. God bless you. Let's sing together as we go and you'll be dismissed in the fear of God. Come. Hallelujah. Sweet Jesus. Yes, Lord. Come take me away. I really don't belong here now. I want to see your face. Come sweet [Music] Jesus, come take me away. I really want to see you, Lord. Jesus, come to come. Sweet Jesus, take me from this [Music] place. I really don't belong here now. I want to see your face. Come, sweet Jesus. Come take me away. Oh, I really want to see you, Lord. Jesus, come today. Lord, you made me happy. And Lord, you've been so good. Lord, you turn my life around when I didn't think you could. Now I love this life of mine. I love each passing day. Oh, but with every breath I take inside my heart I say. Oh, come sweet Jesus. Take me from this place. I really don't belong here now. I want to see your face. Oh, come sweet Jesus. Come take me away. I really want to see you, Lord. Jesus come today. Lord, we are your people preparing now to be the bride pure and holy for all the world to see. [Music] Come in clouds of angels, take us all away to the place that you've prepared a neverending day. Glory cry come sweet Jesus take me from this [Music] place I really don't belong here now I want to see your face come sweet Jesus oh Come take me [Music] away. I really want to see you, Lord.

we were here today but I'm still happy to see everyone and I know that my mama would have been happy to see you all here today tresa was uh born 58 years ago passing away on Monday she was a loving wife loving mother and a a grandmother that just was top of the line you can ask any of her kids and you can ask her daughter-in-laws and you can ask me your son-in-law and I'll tell you the honest truth she was a remarkable person and we love her still love her in preparing this speech it's never easy when reflecting on the life uh as we have to but speaking of my mother-in-law there is not enough time to get into the friendship that I had with her for nearly 30 years before I married Britney 15 years ago go I was best friends with her son Zach and Matt and she was always a mother figure to me even before I became part of the family she was always a family first woman she's married to my father-in-law for over 40 years raising three children together one of which uh turned out okay the other two she tried it's all that can be said but she wanted the best for all of them and she did her best to give it to them in our own relationship it was a few years before I knew this I I she told me this about the time me and Britney got married they had just moved to this area and were talking and she so happened to look down and saw a little boy walking down one of the aisles in a little mismatched suit and she said that's going to be my son-in-law right there 12 years later she was proven right she was always there for her kids and the only thing she loved more than them was her grandchildren and I believe that she truly with all her heart loved all of of them and she gave each of them the equal amount of love she never picked any kind of favorites every Christmas every birthday every moment was made special she was always just a phone call away with motherly advice getting into a different side of her though one of my little Parts was my mother-in-law was incredibly easy to startle and I think my brother-in-laws and I put several of the gray hairs on her head due to our more Carefree attitude and general stupidity mama and I would often get into kind of a contest on social media of who could scare the other more with uh jump scares and different videos she never won but I can still remember the all cap text that I would get back and I can still hear her scream oh gee when everything went everything started to scare she would immediately just lock up she made all of us feel special on our birthdays and Christmas every one of my birthdays I had a a box of no bakes and homemade fudge that was better than anything that Gatlinburg could have ever made and I still have my collection of pajama pants that she got us every Christmas all three of us we'll miss those little things now Jesus forgive me when Mama first got the news we all immediately started praying for healing us and all of you and people who never even had the pleasure of meeting her and I want to take this moment to say thank you to each and every one of you who took time to pray and all the prayer cloths the food everything has just been so overwhelming to my family during this time we appreciate the home visits that we that she got and the support during this this was a lot easier when I was rehearsing this in the days leading up to her passing my wife and I had a visit we just got got the news that the time was slipping and it was time to start making your final preparations and start saying your goodbyes and we went over me and my wife and Mama wasn't quite hadn't been quite herself she wasn't able to talk very much there was a music playing in the house and from different churches and one of the songs was Victory in Jesus was playing and the last thing that I actually got to hear her say fully was she raised those little hands and said victory is mine mama raised her feeble hands and said that in front of all of us to all of you who prayed for her healing and to all of us who had hoped the situation would turn out different in healing I'd like to remind you all of something today God did heal her cancer has never had a victory over a child of God mama just went home thank you [Music] life is easy when you're up on the mountain you've got peace of mind like you never know but then things [Music] change you're down in the [Music] valley but don't

great time wish you were here it never rains and no one complains we haven't seen a tear oh oh having a great time and we wish you were here [Music] certainly wish to extend our condolences this evening to the family and friends of our dear departed sister it's been a privilege to be able to know the Willis family um for all the years that we've been together and so thankful for the opportunity to be able to lead them into the Paths of Heaven brother Eric we good testing one two use the handhel test test test okay now I got it sorry about that it's been a great privilege for me to be able to um know the Willis family when they moved here several several years ago from Kentucky and these young men and young woman that you see here with a little bit of ot9 things and we've been through a lot of hard trials and tests together of life I want to speak to you for just a few minutes this evening on from dust to Glory Genesis 1: 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he them male and female created he them in Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground so wonder what kind of man that was in Genesis 1 that man was made in the image of God and then God puts that man into a dust body and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathes into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so there are most two different types of men that were in the Garden of Eden we look at ourselves today as human beings and we can see that there is a Supernatural part about us a part that does not die when you came around by today and shook the hands of the family and expressed your heartfelt condolences to them and walked by this cast actually what you saw was an empty house a house that was inhabited just a few days ago by another being a being that is not dead according to Genesis 3: 19 after the fall when God had spoke to man and said in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread and till thou returned to the ground for for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and to dust thou shal return but what part goes back to dust the part that came from dust but where is the other part the man that God created in His image that had that Supernatural part so when our sister tresa was able to make peace with God so many many years ago and be able to pass from Death unto life the Old Testament view of death was very very vague very unclear even to the prophets the sages the righteous men that love God job said it this way in job chap 10 ver 20 are not my days few cease then and let me alone that I may take comfort a little before I go when I shall not return even to a land of darkness the shadow of death job is a great man in his day but death was still so obscure they didn't know where you went they didn't understand and he said a land of Darkness as Darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order where the light is as Darkness Psalm 654 in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks Psalms 55:4 my heart is sore pain was meant Within Me and the Terrors of death are Fallen upon me so it was a world an experience that man didn't know anything about and is in indeed man's greatest fear there's something in us and I think of the great creator of God that whenever we see an urgent situation that within 3/4 of a second from the time that we see somebody stop in front of us our body is able to synchronize together with the brain through the tissues and the nerves and all that sort of thing and we can take our foot off the gas and put her foot on the brake um when God made man that didn't have cars and they didn't have people that drive the way people do today but I'm sure go go God made us with that in mind aren't you we'd been a mess today but you think of how that man was so hidden from the view of death when the Lord Jesus came to the Earth he totally changed the view of death look at this in Matthew chapter 9: 24 he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepest so this was a little girl that had died what we call death and the Lord Jesus said something that was so peculiar and so odd and he said hey hey everybody calm down the little girl ain't dead she's just sleeping and they laughed him to scorn so they made fun of the Lord Jesus and laughed at him and said are you you kid who do you think you are well he knew who he was and he knew the difference between death and eternal separation now he knew that this little girl even though they said she was dead in the way that he looked at it she was not dead at all now as we look at this empty house here this afternoon and we know we call it death and we've all had our acquaintance with death and our heart has been torn from us by facing one death after another after another from our families and our friends but we know our sister Tressa did not die and the reason of that is because she has already died she already face death and by facing that death and accepting the life of the Lord Jesus she can never die again you imagine as the Lord Jesus looked upon them and St John 11 some dear close friends of the Lord Jesus sent him a message and it was about one of his intimate friends this man's name was Lazarus his sisters Mary and Martha sent a messenger and they said Lazarus is very sick and would would you come now they had fors in their churches of that day they had already borne a great reproach for the Lord Jesus and You' think if you was a friend to the Lord Jesus that he would do something so special for you and you see this is where many people misunderstand even when a child of God is allowed to go through so much suffering and people will look and from their mind they're trying to comprehend why would a loving God ever allow his children to go through so much stuff and you're saying why don't he just heal all them and then let all the Sinners and all them Wicked people out there let them go through all the terrible things because God knows he can use his children to prove certain things about his word that he can never use a sinner to prove you know it's amazing that God sometimes will answer prayers within 24 hours of the time we pray many of you probably like myself have seen him answered prayers in the matter of moments and watch what he did my wife called her mother yesterday in Kentucky very very sick and she called her in a few moments we had prayer for her sitting at the kitchen table and she talked to her again today and she said after you all prayed for me she said I turned off the phone and went to sleep immediately and she was testifying to the nurses and stuff where she was it was immediate it was much faster than I could drive 4 and 1/2 hours to be able to get to Kentucky but yet there's times God will answer immediately there's times God will say wait a while and then there's heartbreaking times when God will say no I'm not going to answer this prayer for you and all for for Christians and especially for those that don't understand they look at and say how could he do that because they measure God's love by their love so they look at their children and they think if my child was in a dilemma and my child was in a terrible situation there's no way I would let my child go through that I would reach down there and I'd do whatever I could but see you're measuring God's love by your love I've been a pastor of a church for many many years many decades I'm 68 years old I've been preaching since I was 18 and I've seen folks go through things that I have to tell you as far as a preacher I would have stopped it I would have held it off held it away from them and no doubt I would have made the biggest mess of their life because I'm looking at them with human sympathy and human compassion and I say I would stop them from that I'd never let them go through that I would never let them go through that part no way but God and his wisdom looks and sees that when we go through things he can bring us out on the other side and we will be able to testify of what Grace what mercy and what strengths that he brought us through you see there's been many people that has preceded our our sister tresa I read about them in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 called the faith chapter of the Bible and it begins to list many of them by name and it tells the various things that they went through and they trusted God and they believed God it gives several examples of God answering their prayers and how that God moved for them and wrought a great Deliverance but then it also tells about other people but God didn't answer them that way so there's certain people he will be able to prove his great power one of our sisters right here in the church several months ago passed away right back here in church when service was going on we have some nurses here at the church they went back there we began to pray for her and God spared her life the spirit of God moved for her we've seen so many miracles that God has done right here and at the same time we've had so many funerals so the same God that will raise the dead for some of his children he will let them go through the passage of the Valley of the shadow of death all of us are not called to fulfill the exact same scope in the economy of God there will be many many that love the Lord Jesus with all of their heart and they trusted him to deliver them of that sickness that disease whatever they were dealing with until the last breath left their body and people say well cancer got the best of them oh no no it didn't as a matter of fact I want to tell you T today that disease that riddled our sister's body and all that she went through it is not the Victor today because when life went from her body all them cells that was trying to multiply and take her life and so on what happened to all of them they are the one ones who died not our sister tresa as a matter of fact if we could move from this Earthly house here let us take a little brief brief travel we will go into where she was when she brother Randy told me that the night before probably the same situation the brother Philip was talking about that they was playing music and she had raised her hands up and her feeble hands that had been weakened by so much suffering and all that she went through but able to praise the Lord and love the Lord and worship him so what happened to that part so the part that motivated That animated her hands that animated her mouth to speak and to continuously hold on to the promise of God where is that person where is that image of that person that was doing that oh he say it's here no no it's not here something left this all this is is a house just like this building here it was empty several hours ago people begin to come in pay their respects in a little bit it'll be empty again where's the noise coming from in this building coming from singers preachers people well why don't the building itself make all them voices it has no ability to do so it's only concrete material that was put together to make a building that we call a church but this building has no animation and no life on its own and when life went out of this body what happens she can't even move a finger no longer bat an eye no longer make a smile or a frown but the real person that we're talking about today is part of that image that God made in Genesis 1 you see our body is like an Earthly house and Paul talked about it in 1 Corinthians 1547 the first man is of the Earth's earthy and it is simply made of Earth the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are Earthly as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly this Tabernacle that we live in is simply dust but where's the star part you see God gave Abraham two great shadows and types and every called him he said I want you to look up here to the stars and count them if you can and he said that's the way your seed will be then he brought him to the seashore and he Saidi want you to count the dust the grains of sand if you can that's the way your seed will be so from dust to stars from Genesis 1 to Genesis 2 and Paul says it this way for if this Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a build building of God an house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so in this we do grown Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven and if so being found clothed he said we will not be found naked at that day so when this Supernatural part that come out of this Tabernacle sister tresa the real one where did it go what happened to it is she a ghost today just a spirit that might appear and disappear and we may never see her again is that is that what she is no no actually she moved into a body that is called theophany and the word Theo of course those of you that know your Bible Theo comes from the same word that we use for deity Theos so it is a body that was made eternal in the heavens so when the life on out of this body it simply changed houses what sister tresa did on Monday was changed addresses God gave her many years ago an address change notification it was in the form of the Gospel she heard that and something touched her heart she'd been working on on that Journey ever since getting ready to move so instead of when she came down to death screaming hollering crying oh God I'm lost oh God I'm lost somebody help me somebody help me pull me out of the flames of fire no she didn't have to do that she could just simply take her last breath and all of a sudden she stepped out of this house now if you can imagine all that our poor sisters went through as my wife and I went to see them week before last and uh we were just both in shock how much she had changed since the last time we'd seen her brother Randy but just beyond this Veil is another body she'll never have another pain another heartache another sorrow you see the very same event that happened on Monday when the Bible tells us in the Book of Psalms precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints precious was it precious to you all humanly we cry we we feel like something's been taken from us how can the same event be so precious and so heartbreaking to us if we could break in and talk to our sister brother Randy told me the other day and I talked to him my wife Carol and I talked about the same thing I've heard it from two or three people that maybe one of the first ones that when our sister tresa was able to step across Paul likened death to a simple Journey he said the time of my departure is at hand the word that Paul used was a Greek word for shipping so it like the boat was tied to the Moorings the ropes were tied the boat had been loaded the captain was on board the merchants everything was in line and then all of a sudden they say let's go they loose the ropes from the big post which are buried feet in the ground and the ship begins to let go out into the waters and he said the time of my departure is at hand for just a moment before I close let us imagine our sister's heart rate begins to change her blood pressure she's getting to where she can't hear anymore and this Mortal realm skipping breaths she's never been here quite like this before but all of a sudden from another realm that realm becomes more real than this one and she feels herself as it were a vapor which is what the Bible says that we are like a vapor it begins to lift from the Earth's this body here like the morning fog and when the sun begins to shine upon it and it will cause it to just disappear in one moment she was in This Old House and the next moment she was on board the ship of Zion didn't take her 24 hours didn't take her 24 minutes but just in a moment like as soon as she stepped into the ship and she disembarked the ship let's just watch her as she she steps out as she sets her foot upon the shore and she looks around and she sees colors like she's never seen before the sun was unlike anything she'd ever seen the skies the the grass and here comes somebody running there might have been several some from this side some from that side some from that side but I could see one maybe about that tall her long hair hanging Plumb down past her knees her arms out my precious sister who is it oh my goodness it's my daughter Erica sister tresa prayed for her so much there's another one and another one and another one and sister Trestle looks around and she realizes iaz made it I've made it I'm not sure that her and Erica have stopped running yet since she got there my friends if you and I could only be allowed a few minutes to see that land and what awaits us nothing we go through in this life would ever compare to that world to be honest with you I'm glad I can't really see that world all the time I catch glimpses of it every now and then when I preach a funeral or when I'm studying or praying but I'm glad that I I don't have constant access because it would make me why I would be so Heavenly minded I wouldn't be one bit of Earthly good but I know it's there waiting for us sister Tressa would you want to come back oh brother Donnie I've heard you preach about it so much I've heard other preachers preach about it but take my word word for it you don't have a clue what it's like I've already met the CH J's messenger I've met people from our church and the amazing thing about it is brother Donnie we're all the same age there's no babies there's no real old people we're all the same age it's just hard to imagine the flowers and the colors everything it's just I I don't have the word and I've experiened such love I I felt it from time to time in church and i' I'd feel it I could just feel a little bit of it but it is beyond comprehension sister Trester is there anything you'd want me to say to your family tell them to do everything they can to be ready tell them to meet me I'll be waiting for them at the river as God sent me some people down at the river to welcome me I'll be waiting for them may God and His Mercy comfort chch your hearts and help you as only he can I don't know exactly how you all feel today I've still had my wife but I've lost a mother a father Aunts Uncles a daughter but I know it may feel like that there's a hole in your heart there and nobody will ever be able to feel that for you and that is that is true but the Lord God can help Comfort us through these Hard Times until we're able to meet again may God bless each of you and strengthen you and help you is my prayer can we just bow our heads together I know this might seem unusual but with their heads bowed and no one looking around is there would there be anybody here today that would say I want to meet her but I'm I'm not I'm not ready really I know I'm not would you pray for me we won't embarrass you I promise you God bless you God bless you make preparation that wouldn't be my advice Hallelujah have hely father as we come to celebrate this life we know really that a Christian preaches their own funeral it's an honor to be able to stand and try to say something about your children that have lived a Godly life and been faithful Lord we prayed and we hoped and we believe that you would do a miracle for our sister and that you would let her live let her be able to enjoy her life and her children her grandchildren s Carol and I went to see her the other day and someone had made her a a little quilt a wrap of a thing and had all the pictures of the grandchildren on there and she was so proud of it but she didn't just love them here in life she wants to have them there too so I pray you'd help them Father help the parents to be able to instruct them Lord and tell them what to do so they can go where she is we can't bring her back and we wouldn't anyway we wouldn't want to call her back to this old body Lord God the best thing for us to do is just to make ready and stay ready so we can be able to meet her I pray for brother Randy I pray for the children I pray for their spouses the grandchildren the friends the other family members Lord some that couldn't even be here today for the church family God that you would help us that you'd give us strength Lord we thank you Father that there is a land beyond the river we thank you Lord Jesus that you made a way that this part of us which has been quickened to eternal life as a body that's there waiting thank you Father somewhere beyond the Jordan River there's a place Lord that we're longing to go and see help us today I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord let me just say to you that by God's grace each one of us can make the same safe passage that our sister has made and if you want to go where she is you'll have to come through the same route and there's only one way and that way is a person it's not a preacher it's not a church but Jesus Christ himself said I am the way he he's not one of the ways but I am the way the truth and the life and if you don't know him today I just just feel strangely in my heart to say this to you that it's quite simple he made the way for us and we simply accept what he has done and follow his Commandments and his truths and his word and by that if we come by this way it will guarantee us a safe passage to the other side brother Ry buddy we love you going to be praying for you and the children is that right friends when we leave here today we're not just going to walk out these doors and say okay our part's done no please please remember them that God will will give them strength [Music] somewhere just across the Jordan [Music] River there's a place to be Everlasting joy and [Music] peace the tree is blue booming there [Music] forever the CR can we sing it together forgive me I'm sorry Hallelujah that sounds like H to me like where I long to be there'll be no tears to feel our eyes again the heels will Echo with thank you Lord we sing of his grace and Glory where the saints of God will be that sound like to me listen this verse now they see there's Mansions there there's Mansions there inside that City a Crystal River Flow by thank you Lord Jesus the Tree of Life the Tree of Life there puts forth its fruits no pain no disappointments ever come there ever come there and Jesus Christ himself will be can we sing it together that sounds like home to me like where I long to be there will be no tears to fill our eyes again the heels

program of God Matthew 16:18 the words of the Lord Jesus and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter which is little Stone Petra little Stone Upon This Rock I will build my church which certainly was not on the little Stone because the little Stone backs sled just a little bit after this but it was on the revelation of who Jesus was Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it 1 Timothy 3:14 and 15 these things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tar long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Ecclesia an assembly Gathering of citizens called out from their homes into some public place or an assembly in a Christian sense an assembly of Christians gathered for worship in a religious meeting so this is what the church is which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth and the ground is a stay or a prop or a support So in reality it's no wonder Satan is going to do his best to destroy the church now he will destroy this church not so much this building here but I'm talking about the church that Jesus said he would build as his own but I'll tell you what he'll do on the other hand he will build support multiply strengthen and grow his own church yeah because Satan also has a church they are his wife they are his wife I'm glad we don't belong to that church you see he never had one until the New Testament but once he saw what God was doing he thought that was a great idea then he decided he would make his own church and he has they're called different names and different titles but every one of them that are contrary to God's word belongs to the devil now none of them of course would ever say that they are Satan worshippers none of them would ever draw a pentagram they'd never get goats blood they'd never do all that stuff um but what they do is Jesus said in St Mark 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men which is seed of discrepancy okay how may like to be a remember tonight as we pray heavenly father as we bow our heads in your presence it's with gratitude and Thanksgiving Lord that we are here tonight and we're so thankful father for all that you mean to us we love you Jesus so much thank you for the strength that you give us from day to day thank you Lord for healing thank you for the manifestation of your presence among us we thank you Lord for people of God that still want to live right still want to serve you still want to be your people to us that's the greatest and highest honor that any of us could ever have we've assembled here tonight Lord that we might be able to sing pray worship clap our hands turn in prayer request father sing with all of our hearts to you as a group and then as individuals and then his choirs and so on as we've already heard tonight and then we come to this most important part the preaching and the hearing of the word now we believe father that it'll take you to help us it'll help definitely I need your help to help me to get out of the way and help me to say something that'll bless your people they need you too Lord they need you to anoint their ability to hear because we know just because we got ears on the side of our head don't mean that we can hear the voice of God but that's what we want to hear so help us tonight speak to us father may we be better when we leave this place tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you you may be seated Saints looking at the pattern of what God himself established in making the church now truly if if he's the one that's going to make it then I I think in order for us to be able to judge each and every Church we'd have to be able to do it by what the author said himself now you know that I like antiques both Carol and I both do like them and there's a certain period of antiques that we like and it's called The Victorian period Then the end of the Victorian period was the Italian Renaissance and the Victorian period they used a lot of arches and they used a lot of deep U carvings and Engravings and things like that at the end of that period before Charles G Eastlake began to manufacture furniture they had the end that of the Italian Renaissance so Carol and I wanted a a big bed a big big large bed so I'd seen several of them it's called a half tester and I'd seen several of them and they were multiplied thousands and thousands of dollars so I thought after looking at a bunch of magazines and looking at a bunch of them beds I thought I could make one so I started getting a bunch of pictures and I'd had a bunch of pieces and parts off of organs and Mir and all kinds of things that were handcarved stuff now you can't go to Big Lots or you can't go to Lowe's and buy all that handcarved stuff because it dates back to about 1880 to somewhere around 1910 so I started trying to put this together so I laid it all out and Carol kind of draw me a sketch of something she wanted wanted it to look like so what I had to do was take the parts and the pieces that I had and then try to fill in the other stuff now they also used a lot of burl Walnut anybody know what that is well Burl is where the branches come down and grow off the main part of the trunk and it will cause these figures that will be there also some of the most beautiful Burl uh will be found in the roots of the tree which grows down in the ground then what they'll do they'll take that log and they will soak it day and night 24 hours a day soak it soak it soak it and then they'll take a real sharp blade and then they'll start cutting that that veneer now they'll cut it I've got some that's a 64 of an inch thick some that's a 32th of an inch and you can take that and it'll slice it just like this slice slice slice slice like you're slicing a piece of ham and it'll come off and it replicates itself because that Burl has eyes and has different things inside of it so you take one piece and you lay it down then you take another piece and lay it down another piece like that like that and you put it together put it in a vacuum bag and then you put a little pump on it and they go and it draws all the air out of it and then it glues it down to a substrate then you can make pictures and make faces out of all of that that come off of that veneer but I had to have some sort of image in my mind of something that I wanted because there wasn't anything quite like it at Grand there wasn't anything quite like it at the Ashley store so I had to look back at uh magazines at Carol had and they were Victorian style magazines and since I was building it with a gigantic poster and some of the brothers are in the church actually once I got it built helped me put it together and helped me set it up so what I had to have I had for a lot of it I had to have things that was imp pairs now if I was going to put something on this post I had to have something on this post that would match so if I was going to put an ornate pediment up on the top of it I found a dresser on eBay that was out in San Francisco and I bought it for about $200 and had it shipped out here so I found two pediments anybody know what them are okay I ain't going to explain it to you you going to have to take my word for it so I found a matching pair of pediments one to go on the bed one to go on the dresser and then I embellished it added to it added width added height and so on so that it would look like that it was a hair but now I had to have part of it in my mind but I had to have part of it in substance because I can't carve I can't do any of that but I already had a lot of this in bits and pieces that I had it from all kinds of things that I'd saved over the years so I went to laying it out and I'd lay it out like this and I lay it in the in the basement floor and then I'd go to look at them pictures and then I'd take these pieces and I knew that I could make certain things things I had routers and planers and things like that so I knew there was some things that I could make and I could make the Burl faces and I could make things like that but there was parts of it that I had to have that was already original now I would make that and I would take and lay it down and that was one of the hardest parts was trying to get something in my mind now it stands a little over 10t tall but naturally I couldn't make it 10 fo tall and take it through my bedroom door so I had to make it where it would come apart so and the post or big gigantic post headboards about the footboards about this tall and headboard 10 foot tall so I had to try to make it in such a way in my mind and think how can I make it where it'll come apart and yet come back together and then if anything ever happens to me make it where hopefully my son-in-laws can be able to figure out how to take it apart heart so and in that I see similar to what God wanted to do so God wanted to build something that he had had a type of in the Old Testament which was the church which was Israel entire now it was a type so anything in type is not always the True Image but yet it was a people that was called out a people that was different from the rest of the world and God would designate for them to do certain things eat certain foods act certain way and by doing that the world would look at them and know that they were a separate people that's what God wanted God wanted a people that was separate so he would tell them to wear a certain color now God told them to wear what was called a riband r i BB a n d a riband of blue on the border of their garment now that that was quite unusual but it was the merging together on their Earthly Coes of the Heavenly color which was the skies and then God would tell them that don't eat these types of food don't eat anything with the web foot don't eat anything that doesn't chew the C don't do this don't do that so every day they would go to the market they didn't have deep freezers and refrigerators microwaves and all that so a lot of the country still do the same thing today they go to the market every day to buy the perishables so every day when they would go to the market they were testifying that they were obeying the laws of Yahweh because you never saw a True Believer buying any fish or any type of seafood that did not match the program of the Torah of God now everybody would watch them and they would see the way they would dress they were not allowed to have a garment that would be mixed together with linen and wool they would not be able to plant different types of seed in the same row so their Gardens were different their clothes were different everything about them was different they were not allowed to Mark themselves like people do today the tattoos and all they were not allowed to cut themselves so every time you saw one of them you would know they were a Jew and then of course they had the law of circumcision also another sign so God wanted his people always to be separate now when it come to the New Testament God did not take away the laws of Separation but now he's going to move it where it's going to start inside of their soul no matter how much they done all the outward things in the Old Testament they still never had a true and a converted heart cuz the law couldn't produce it but in the New Testament God is going to come inside of them and start sanctifying or circumcising them from the inside out now they're still going to dress certain ways and they're going to live certain ways and there's certain things they're not going to do of course the world today does not want to hear that they must say Well it don't matter what you look like it don't make no difference to God if you paint your face or cut your hair or wear britches why what difference does it make to God well it still does make a difference to God God don't want the women dressing like men God don't want the men dressing like women God don't want men marrying men God don't want women marrying women somebody say amen that's God's law that's what we believe is that right so whenever God then was going to design this church he is the Builder himself so he never called the apostles together for a general meeting and said now look I'm thinking about building this thing called a church first time has ever used of course the word I'm going to build this thing called a church now now Peter what do you sing that I should build it out of now unlike Carol and myself when we wanted this particular thing in our house and as long as I'm around I mean Carol will always think of this and look at this this bed and she told me a not long ago she said Donnie if something was to ever happen to you I don't know what in the world I would do every room in this house has got antiques in it that you've ever either built or refinished every room I I I would see you everywhere well that's the way God wants to be inside his church so whether it's in the nursery whether it's in the bathroom whether it's in the fellowship hall in the pastor's office in the mezanine God wants us to see him in every room of this building God wants to be the main reason that we come here God don't want it to be well they've got nice basketball goals you need to find another church to go to that's the reason you come here because it should be all about him and our love for him then all the rest these things are just nice things to have around that's not really the reason that we come the church is that right so it should be not like with my house I've got things everywhere and it would be the same with Carol cuz Carol's made curtains in this room and curtains in that room and her her you know just her signature about this and that is all through our house which is the way it should be and it should be then that in God's house that it is not the signature of of a denominational board and we look and see well this was Bishop so and so ideas and this was so and so's idea and they think the church should do this or should not no it should not even be that way at all it should be the signature of God should be in every house of God that truly belongs to God but it's so sad to realize that many churches do not have the signature of God they have the signature of a man a single man or a group of men which lead that church so then if that man behind the pulpit thinks that well you know what uh I don't know that it's necessary anymore to really preach on Holiness I don't know that it's necessary to preach against the things of the world anymore we might do better and we might gain more if we would uh let let off of that and then then in a year or two we'll we'll start preaching on it again and by that long you've lost a whole lot of ground yeah so what did they do then the church will start taking on the image of the man in the Pulpit the image that he is creating by the words that he is saying or the ones he's leaving out so you see it's not just important what a man says but many times I like to know and find out what is he leaving out because sometimes what he's leaving out has much more of an impression on the people than the words that he is actually saying because it is a it is a subtly crafted sermon that preachers will put out especially in this age that will say certain things that are very very good but it is the deadly things which are left out which I absolutely annihilates and separates the people of God from the presence of God because if you preach them they'll get you in trouble well I figure if I ain't get in trouble apparently I ain't making the devil mad so God chose then to build this thing called the church now unlike me if You' ever be able to see my bed that I built and I'd be able to tell you well this come from this was a two pieces of mahogany now I said they got a different grain of course a different density of the wood mahogany does than Walnut and you'll never be able to replicate mahogany quite like like you can Walnut but because they're inch and a quarter and they're very heavy Coral heavy type things and I was able to fool with the stain a little bit in order to make it look like Walnut but you see God don't want to do that in his church God don't want Hypocrites and God don't want make Believers there and God will take a little bit of stain and kind of work on it a little bit to kind of dress it up now these handrails here are made out of w so is this so's this so is this but yet the bottom back here is made out of popper and yet we could not of course be able to afford wall and through the whole thing but I was able to be able to take the same stain and be able to work also on this organ here brother John gon dinner buil this and I was able to take the same stain and make it look like Walnut now Naturally by Nature they're not colored the same way in popper you'll find real white wood you'll find streaks of green there's one of these rails in yours got a streak of green about that wide and about 4 foot long but you won't find it and I am not going to tell you which one it is I was able to take stain and work on it and blend it as they call it and make that green disappear now you got to know what you're doing but what you're doing is H hypocritical in one sense of the word because you're trying to hide one thing to make it blend in with something else now this is Walnut these are popper this is this is birch and you've got a mixture of woods on the library in there that's exactly the same way but if someone knows what they're doing then they can take the finished part of it and actually pull several different types of wood together and make you think every bit of it is from the same tree and that's what Satan does when it comes to a church then he will have this church that church that church oh my we're all going to heaven well I reckon everybody is anything my goodness people can live like a devil you hear hear their funeral preach and you think they're just right next door to Gabriel and Michael I mean they're just walking down streets of gold and you think good Lord you got to be kidding me if they went to heaven my the devil will be there in three weeks there look friend I don't care what a preacher tries to put you in the gates there ain't no preacher that can put you in or keep you out it's your own life that you live before God so God wanted this beautiful beautiful creation called the church God wanted this thing now God knew as soon as he designated this to place it on the earth he knew that Satan would want to replicate it so God gave us an original pattern and we would be able to judge that pattern and look at the pattern and study the pattern and I've told you before there was an older sister down the church in Kentucky and whatever I preached on twins years and years ago down there she came to me after the service and said brother Donnie I've got a nephew and said he works for the federal government and he he works in the treasury Department in studying about counterfeiting and she said I asked him one time about counterfeit and he said many years he'd been there studying studying watching it all out and she said how do you know how do you know when you see a counterfeit Bill he said I've never seen one she said what do you mean you mean you don't study the counterfeit he said no I study the real so much that as soon as I see one it will stick out to me now you know I find that a great truth in that that we can spend so much time studying the false and trying to defend this and that and the other and we absorb a lot of that time when we should be studying the real so how are we going to know if our church or any other church is the like to true and original Church well we look at the pattern that's all we do we look at the pattern now you realize that whenever Things become in short or in shortage that people will fall back and on other things to try to replace them now that I'm speaking about furniture let me go ahead and tell you this a little history tonight at the end of the Victorian periods by the time the victorians got done with the black walnut in America almost all the forest the Trees of the black walnut were nearly destroyed because they even made the drawers out of solid Walnut for years and then they got to a spot that they learned how to veneer it although the Chinese have been doing it since the 14th century and they finally brought it over to America and started doing it here so instead of taking a piece of wood 3/4 of an inch for a drawer that taking 30 second of an inch and they glue it on a piece of substrate and you'd have all them other pieces of wood so by the end of that there wasn't hardly any Walnut left so you know what they started doing they started making at the end of the Victorian period some of the Victorian furniture out of Oak but that was bad because Oak was firewood so you can imagine now you buy a piece of furniture in your house and you're used to having Burl Walnut you're used to having at least mahogany or you're used to having Rosewood y'all know what Rosewood is or some of the black wood from Africa and they would have some of that and then they go because why there was a shortage of Walnut the furniture manufacturer still making Furniture so they had to go to another wood so they had to compromise from this high-end quality of wood to firewood firewood and then they all also for those who would not absolutely refuse to buy any oak furniture then they resorted to buying it out of popper and then they would take tricky guys who knew how to do the stain workor and they would start doing it that way so then you would start seeing the sides of furniture out of popper and the front out of Walnut and a lot of the people didn't even know that it wasn't even solid wers so they started tricking the consumer and the consumer looked at it and thought it was the same thing so several years ago Carol wanted a big table in the house so I built her a big gigantic dining room table she wanted some chairs and we went down to Knoxville found some big heavy heavy chairs down in Knoxville well they were made in chinaa now they looked Walnut but I had a funny feeling that the color was not the right color so I had to strip them off and when I started stripping tripping them off I mean the legs are big old heavy ornate things you know and the the I got the top finish off and it didn't take me long to realize I had made a bad mistake because the brownish red looking color on that wood disappeared and I was stuck with purple purple now they did not stain that wood they dyed it how many's heard a wood dye nobody you're getting a woodworking lesson tonight aren't you well they take purple dye now you know what I've realized that a lot of Christians when you go to skinning them down deep enough they're purple and pink and green and yell and polka dot ain't no telling what in the world you'll find when you get the outside finish off but now God don't want a church that just has a veneer finish you know what a lot of furniture is made out of today sawdust saw dust oh but it looks like wood on the outside but if you get it wet one time mhm and you let it get wet very long you'll find that thing will go to swelling up on you and the moisture gets on the inside and it goes to wrink and some of y'all are smiling you bought some of that nice Iron Furniture ain't you well you see that's the way Satan then decided Well if God wants a church I I want one too but I can't make one that'll look so opposite of God because if I do everybody will know it so I've got to make one that at least initially will have the appearance of his church so it will look like God's original church and of course it didn't take long until that happened now we see then that in the Ephesian Church age they begin to get away from that first love that God gave them which was divine Love by divine nature now we know that the prophet tells us then on the day of Pentecost whenever those folks receive the Holy Ghost but then the Bible goes on to tell us that there was added to the church daily people that kept coming and joining the church and then we find that there were some of them that were phir phes that believe and no doubt some Sadducees that believe and others that begin to believe but the Bible doesn't say anything about them getting the Holy Ghost they just joined up with them and then before long they begin to get some of the rich folks to come in and some of the wealthy people of the cities and so on and they begin to say look now we we don't need this this type of religion we don't need this type where everybody screams and and shouts and hollers and runs and Praises God we don't need that so what did nicolan begin to cry for they begin to cry to get away from those crying shouting jumping screaming acts 238 young ones is that right now why because they now had become unestablished church now in that established church there were also preachers of course and there was going to be Apostles of course and Prophets why well if God used an apostle Satan knew better than to use a monkey if God would use a pastor Satan wouldn't use an elephant if God used a teacher Satan wouldn't use a jth if God's going to have a man in charge of the church called a pastor then Satan said fine then that's what I'll get too so I'll get men called pastors I'll get men called teachers I'll get men called evangelists I'll name them the exact same thing except they will preach my agenda and Satan always looks for men who wants to become something God looks for men who wants to become nothing you see the difference in the way we're going don't you so God has this church and it's going to be constructed by himself nobody else nobody else's opinion nobody else's idea and then he will build it upon the doctrine and the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets inspired by God and God's giving them now the original plan the original format as God gave to David and to Solomon the original plan of the of the temple that was called later Solomon's Temple so it was God that gave them the pattern then we come to the New Testament and God gives them the pattern of what they're going to do now they're going to start it out with with men just going around and trying to be say politicians come on now we've got a new relig religion here y'all want to just live for Jesus and and we'll give everybody so much drop M that was the Roman money of that time we'll give everybody 10 drop if you if you'll give your heart to God and and we we'll do this and we'll make you social this and that and no is that the way they're going to do it is that the way the Lord is going to propagate this church it's got to have the ability to reproduce itself so how is it going to reproduce are we going to reproduce it by handing out tracks or should we have sporting now of course the Romans had already broke into that and they had the Arenas everywhere and they had all different types of coliseums and sporting events because they were really big on that so there's no way the church would need to compare to that how is the church going to propagate how is the church going to survive how is the church going to live how is the church going to be run what it's got to be God that will set all this in order you agree so far it would have to be God right because God's not said AR now what are you all saying God didn't have a whole bunch of people say all right now I'm going to put this to a vote how many things you ought to have preaching well somebody say well yeah I think preaching's a good idea others say preaching what and what we need preaching for God never even asked them God just said this is what it's going to be I'm going to have Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers and then in the church y'all going to need some deacons y'all going to need this and that so this is the way that it's going to be now do you believe this is God's original plan so God then ordained this and here Jesus speaks about it and then it's going to start being founded whenever the Holy Ghost comes back on the day of Pentecost and then God is going to form now remember this is the alpha or the beginning of the church whatever God does originally you can go back to it every time because he cannot change his program so God calls One god-given messenger out of every age and then he will give the word the light of God as we looked at the eye in the horn the horn representing the church the eye representing the messenger of the day through him the light of God begins to penetrate into the church and the church will hear the voice of God they'll know how they should conduct themselves well should we go to church should we assemble remember they never assemble quite like that before now in the Old Testament they'd get together at certain feasts and then they wouldn't see one another from months on in but God said I don't want that to happen in the New Testament as a matter of fact it must have been quite unusual because actually they began together on the first day of the week which was the Lord's day which was of course on Sunday now I realize there's there's a group of el of people in the Gentiles the still are sabit Terian and they want to be able to try to worship on Saturday that's fine they want to do that but that is not the Seal of God but the disciples in the New Testament they begin to start something that was different than the Old Testament in that they were starting to meet on a regular basis wow so they would in the Old Testament maybe go to go to the meeting house and they me there at the temple bring their sacrifice they would stay there together a couple of days and then they wouldn't come back for three or four months until some other type of feast and then they'd come back again but God said no that won't work now I want my people to be in fellowship with each other I want them to be in fellowship with me so I want this to be a regular Gathering together of my people so I can meet with them and then they started singing songs and hymns I remember David did that of course in the Old Testament and they had the coites they had the Levites they had the men that was the musicians and so on and much of the Psalms of course was written to them and they would sing but they'd never quite done it like the New Testament so the first service that they begin to have how unusual it must have been but it was the great great Builder constructing on the on the earth what he wanted to call now his church so the preachers never got up and preached about the next mayor that's going to run and you know there was no politicians standing up there saying all the things that the preacher say in this day and time they weren't standing up there and trying to just please everybody but they preached the gospel they preach salvation they preach water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ they preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right so this is the thing then that God started now you imagine for the first several months and say on up into six months or a year and the devil is just kind of learning as this thing is going he's never seen anything quite like it they're meeting together and they're talking and they're singing and then these one guys get up and they're they're preaching and they call call the meeting to order and they just sing a little and they talk about the goodness of God and and they didn't know exactly how to go about themselves so they would just get up and feel led of the spirit of God to preach and they'd preach a little bit and testify and maybe have some to stand and sing of the glory of God and then they'd go to laying hands on the sick cuz that was in the original commission and they begin to form them church services you imagine as Satan began to look on it and he thought this is amazing this is am amazing I love this idea I want a church too I think I see now what God wants God wants to meet with his people on a regular basis and and and I I can see what it does to them it actually makes them magnetized to his Persona it it does something to them that the law never did it's it's actually helping them love one another better and that they're actually enjoying going to this and they're really enjoying being there so then you know the CH first church and that was in Jerusalem and then it began they begin to spread out so they went one here and there and there and by the time that Paul begins to write that there was a church in Corinth there was a church in Philippi there was a church here there was a church there by the time John began to write in the Book of Revelation there was churches now that have spread abroad in caposa they spread into Spain they spread into Europe so the gospel had begin to spread forth and everywhere they would go they begin to ordain churches I want you to listen now this is something that is totally new even to that world which would have been the modern world at that time they had never seen anything quite like this now the Temple of Diana of course was in several places and they would do something similar but yet it was not like this because there was something alive in these services so they would go and they would sing and they would worship and they would cry and the the difference one of the main differences of course was it was the Fountain of Life and Truth um the the idol worshippers most of them had uh all of these goddesses and Priests and priestesses and all of that and they had horrible horrible things that they did but these people were coming together and they were crying and they were worshiping and they were repenting of their wrong and then they would come up and they would sing and the spirit of God would gather among them and they would just love one another and oh my goodness and Satan thought this is awful this is absolutely horrible I cannot believe I let this happen right in front of me I didn't consider this a threat when I saw this first thing called a Church a that what they're calling it church I I can't believe that I did not recognize what a threat this really was but I can see this is worse than a wildfire this is a contagion it's catching on everywhere these guys go they're giving it's like somehow they've got life in them some way and when they get there it jumps out of them and other people get it and it's like they're becoming almost infected with this no it was actually sealed with it it wasn't an infection it was predestination but you watch him now as he begin to look at this and he he's learning he's learning as the move of God is starting to grow and begin its infancy and another time of course if Paul writes 1 Corinthians 55 ad something like that it is already now the churches are set in order and now you've got many of the Corinthian Church you know I'd like to bring it to you sometime I've studied it several years ago taking each one of the New Testament churches taking the positives and the negatives the drawbacks and the great things they had and the faults they had in each one of them and being able to compare and show you even the then it was exactly as it is today that there were no perfect churches in the New Testament so if you're looking for one let me just save you a lot of waste of time you ain't going to find more anywhere you got a bunch of people coming together you're going to have problems I don't care if it's Walmart Kroger baseball game or the church house you're going to have problems because everybody's opinion is so different and this is why that God had to have a designated plan and he himself was not only the architect the designer but also the Builder he did not just say I will be the architect of the church and then you all can change things if you need to now we changed many things on this building here I think sometimes that the architect only to draw draw it up to give brother Michael something to go by then he can make all the changes from there cuz he made plenty of them that's what I said about Carol whenever we built our house I told Brother L I said look I only ordered these plans and give Carol something to go by and there'll be many changes that'll happen thereafter and they did because she didn't like this and she didn't like that but hey she's the queen to the house I want her to be happy so what God didn't say now look if y'all need to modify chain S they said no no no no no I'm the architect I'm the designer and I am also the Builder but the problem is then that Satan wants to put people in that same church move now he does not want to just make his group totally separate and say well y'all do whatever you want to do we'll leave you alone you leave us alone oh no he realizes in order to try to bring the real move of God under his control he has to infiltrate that move move and try to project his own agenda into that move his own headship which will make it contrary to the headship of the word of God now he will do it by different means depends on the area depends on you know as the prophet said certain things that works in a certain area will go over and he said other areas it won't work at all that not only works in the kingdom of God it also works in the Kingdom of hell but Satan knew that he would have to interject so much of this stuff in there with another headship in mind so you've got a a godall man will say you got godall people that love the Lord and they're a part of that body and Satan begin to interject his own people inside of there with another headship then they begin to question this and question that well I don't understand I don't understand why we have to do that and no doubt some of the women and the Corinthian Church I don't understand why in the world we can't preach cuz some of them thought they were and it must have been very hard of them because many of them were prostitutes of the goddesses and so on that they come out of and they were the leaders in the church worship oh you didn't know that they were Absolut the leaders in idolatry the women were not the men So then whenever they got saved some of them had that same idea well they wanted to come in the church and preach a little bit and Paul said no you women you ain't supposed to do that well you know already Satan wanted to try to interject something into this great plan so Paul had to write of course in Corinthians more than any other church about all these things that was going on why why was this written because the headship of another being is trying to come into the church now I want to ask you Brothers here tonight are there any of your brothers in here that would like to share your wife with another man praise the Lord any brothers like to share your wife with any other man would you be okay with your wife having two heads neither does God neither does God now that's what Satan wanted to do he wanted to interject himself into the church in the way similar way that he interjected himself into the serpent in order to get to Eve's bedding ground then by doing that he can inject himself into the human race by vicariously fathering a child then all of us sitting here tonight are still affected in our flesh by what happened by that one act in the Garden of Eden that's why our flesh can't go to heaven in this form it's got to be changed now I know people don't like you to quote this but I'm going to quote it anyhow the prophet said when you see a naval he said you know it's a sign of a renegade so hello Mr Miss Renegade glad to meet you I'm Mr Renegade too so Satan was able to interject himself into the human race and if we look back into the Garden of Eden would see he repeats the same thing when the New Testament Church is being founded so then the Lord Jesus establishes his church and he gives them everything they're going to need down to the ages and he starts with exactly the same pattern that'll be repeated over and over and over again I mean looked at it in the saman church age and every Church age you have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes from through God some God s messenger rather in a certain area then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully tall now God never intended then for just Paul one man to be the one that that would have it everybody else would just pass around his tapes or books as it were in that day but there were others that were supposed to come and have received the same life but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only now listen speak speak speak well apparently that's preacher in speak speak is a verb sir not press play Speak only what the messenger has spoken remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said wasn't that quite bold no he's given the commission of God to be the master builder remember we read that scripture some weeks ago and Paul said he was a master builder How could a man say that under divine inspiration of God now if it is Christ which is deity inside of him then it should be the same spirit of God inside of us notice the prophet goes on to say then that Paul admonished them to say only what he had said If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge now listen let him acknowledge that the things which I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord now this is pretty bold and Brazen but this is a man who knows what he's called to be this is God's way of carrying out the original plan by project his thoughts now remember a prophets made different than us he's made so that his subconscious and first conscience lay so close together that God can project himself right into that subconscious by the Supernatural and that's the way the validated thus sayeth the Lord is absolutely perfect now it's not like a man or woman that feels inspired and they speak in tongues or prophesy and it might be right and it about might be wrong but God never never committed the way of thus sayith the Lord to being an iffy situation so a prophet is the special creation of God so God can project to him his thoughts and it is absolutely infallible amen praise the Lord I'm glad myself aren't you now notice they add here they take away there soon the message is no longer pure and the re bival dies down now in order of course for God to be able to perate this church how will the church be able to reproduce itself because the church is in feminist form it is that part of the attribute of God that projected from eternity so how will the female be able to reproduce herself now there's no question in our minds I don't think that churches and America around the world are reproducing but how what kind of seed are they producing it so you know it's all part of every church I don't care what they believe what the foundation of their Doctrine is every Church wants to grow every Church wants to get bigger and get more members they want more people to come to their Church they want more people to have what they have because naturally they think a r or they wouldn't be there right and they want more people people in their Community people in their family so what do they do they begin to tell people oh come to our Church M we we've got this pastor and we've got this you know this this whatever it is so they use these different things and they actually are trained some of them and they are able to go out and knock on doors and be able to hand out little things you know to be able to get people's attention because they want their Church to grow well we do too in one sense of the word we want our church to grow but we we we approach it differently we want our church to grow by the spirit of God being able to deal with people's hearts and bring them to a saving knowledge if they're not saved of what the Lord Jesus did at Calvary is that right and if they are saved and not Sanctified then we want them to grow into that if they're saved and Sanctified and don't have the Holy Ghost we want them to grow into that and then we want them to grow into the revelation of the end time word where that God will be able to be word on top of word on top of word till they'll be able to be changed in a moment and the twinkle of an eye but we don't go through the ball and hand out little cards and we don't go the typical Church way of trying to get people to join our church neither do we try to call people on the phone and say now why don't you come over to our church and and leave your church cuz y y y'all y'all ain't hearing the truth and y'all going to hell and you know no we we don't believe in proelite there ain't going to be no thieves in heaven that includes preacher thieves some of the biggest thieves you'll ever know about are preacher thieves ones that steal sheep uhhuh ones that Ste sheep they done it in the days of Paul and they've done it all down through time that's right but yet we're not interested in that right we're on the same page right we're not interested in and in trying to bring people from somebody else's church just so we can say well we've got a big church and we've got a large and we got to Big this and that and the other I tell you what we got we got a big God we got a big God and we got a big city we're going to and a big Mighty heavenly father that loves us and we want to get our eyes off of anything big about us that's right but we do want everyone that he wants here with us now whoever that is then I trust him and I tell him all the time lord I want only who you want to be a part of our assembly that's all I want and I tell people if people come and talk to me and the are thinking about moving here or coming here from some other state or whatever more I tell them look I want you I told somebody not long ago if if God wants you here I want you here if God don't want you here I don't want you here because you'll come and you won't be happy and you'll make us unhappy while you're unhappy so if God wants you here that's exactly who I want I have never pulled on one person never in my Decades of preaching I have never pulled on one individual I have never offered one individual a position to come here oh that's done all the time oh we'll make you the singer we'll make you the third violinist and we'll make you the 14th backup on the piano and that you're the 27th back up on the bass guitar and you come to find out a lot of folks their main reason for switching churches many times is because they get a position that's right position means more to a lot of folks than eating right some folks will eat out of a garbage can as long as they can get a position and then they sneak and stream other preachers Services well preached brother Donnie now you realize that of course the Lord knew all of this would come now the Lord knew that oh my goodness one of the most horrible things that would be used down through time as far as instruments of Darkness God knew one of the most horrible things that would ever be used by the devil would be preachers good lord it's absolutely unbelievable the instrumentality of preachers and people of influence now whether it's a you know denominational guy or whether it's a Pentecostal guy my look I wonder how many actually that will stand before the Lord that day and say I cast out Devils I heal the sick I done this and that and the other and will wind up being lost and then the thousands or hundreds or whatever more of people that followed them all these TV preachers friends they are as rotten as they can be come on some of them ain't even saved come on now and yet Satan projects them and people get hurt by them and taken advantage of and then what did they do they put all pre in one big pile well don't put me in that pile cuz I don't belong in that pile there's Brothers here in this church that are genuine sincere men of God they don't belong on that pile either there's Brothers all over the world that stand for the truth of the Gospel that do not belong in that Heap that's what call called them they would Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears so the Lord knew that well why didn't he avoid that because that was his choice to use God God called Ministry he knew Satan would impersonate he knew that Satan would impersonate discernment and Satan would impersonate tongues in interpretation I know we don't hear quoted much around the message but in Harvest Time the prophet tells us the devil can hand out them Supernatural gifts by the handfuls by the handfuls the devil can hand them out oh my goodness now what's he going to hand them out to well they'll hand them out to different types of people depending on their influence and what they can do to be able to pull people away from the original church and always Satan's work will be more flowery it'll be more Hollywood it'll be more of a glitter and you know all that sort of thing and acceptable with everybody and loved by everybody nobody has nothing bad to say about him or nothing like that and Satan will always paint his up and he will make God's choice look so so small and so reproached and so misunderstood and so so hated by the world always and yet God says that's my wife that's my people that's who I put my Vindication on right now think if God is going to build this work himself and going to call it as he called it his church then he's going to have to have a Divine protocol by which this thing will be started God must build in it the ability for it to be able to reproduce itself because that's God's original Law of reproduction we can find that in the Book of Genesis where that the seed was in every kind now we know that the seed started out by the spoken word and then the trees begin to come up out of the earth and then God said let every tree bring forth of its kind of its seed which is in itself now it STS out with the seed spoken word then it comes up out of the ground bust up out of the ground for those that produce fruits then where does the seed wind up in the Apple where does it wind up starts in the ground comes through a process and then it winds up in the Apple itself so the Apple contains the seed a multiplication of the seed form that was in the ground that came from the spoken word is that right so then the fruit Bears the seed I it it really bothers me when I hear preachers blasting the fruit of the spirit cuz you think they don't even know what they're talking about they're blow we don't need the fruit of the spirit why the Pharisees had the fruit of the spirit they did not have the Holy Ghost they did not have the token life they could not produce a genuine fruit of the spirit in the same way and measure that a child of God can oh you say well I want the see well if you produce the fruit open up your Apple open up your Peach Your Plum your pear and what do you find inside the fruit the seed so the seed then comes to its fruition once it produces is the fruit this is where we are Mount Treetop in the last day so this is the attraction in the last hour and it's no re no wonder why that Satan is absolutely coming against a church like never before now as you know I'm in contact with many ministers all over the world I've never seen a Time the way it's been the last three or four years that the devil is attacking the ministry if it's not the health of the ministry it will be their family or it will be the church that they preach to or it will be just constant something going on all the time I don't know how many preachers that I know of right now that are dealing with all kinds of trouble either physical or or mental or psychological or problem why Satan attacking them with everything if he can get them leaders down get them depressed get them sad get them weary and then they just study a little bit and give you a little round mouth sermon and say go on back home now little children then what's he going to do you're not going to be strong to be able to meet the challenge in your hour but I'd like to let hell know tonight God has got some men of God that despite sickness despite disappointment despite sorrow despite misunderstanding and all kinds of other things they are anointed to speak the word they're going to not compromise they're not giving into hell they're not giving into sickness they're not giving into the devil they are preaching the word and they are getting abroad ready for the Rapture Hallelujah Brothers Let's jump down to 1 Corinthians chapter 4 verse1 15 we'll jump over a couple of these quotes here now watch the pattern of how a god call man was inspired by the Holy Ghost to write in the first church age 1 Corinthians 4:15 for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ wow yet have you not many fathers there's a great difference between an instructor and a father oh yeah an instructor may or may not have the power of reproduction or begetting they can make followers after themselves I don't want you to be a reaganite I want you to be a son or daughter of God I'll tell you one thing if that's all you want to be I'm disappointed in you tonight just to be a reaganite no you need to set your goals way higher than me you need to set your goals higher than any man that's ever lived on the earth set them to the Lord Jesus so Paul by now there was already this division that was going on so there were some that did not have the power of begettal in other words they did not pack the seed germ in them now if you don't believe me this and you listen to spoken words Original Seed also end time seed sign in Tiff in Georgia and 1962 you heard the prophet saying the same thing that God was going to plant the way the church was going to grow in the body so the body would pack within itself the ability to reproduce itself so how what is the Greater Works imparting eternal life eternal life now many can study just by the Mind study the Bible study the Greek study the Hebrew study the message and be able to get up and give a good little talk of some sort and I hate to say friend but that's what some of the preachers are on the message they're just intellectual they study and they can talk oh I had one s and talk with me some time ago and and he was coming talking to me asking me for advice and as he sat there and he started telling me that he was called to do this and that and the other and he basically was giving me his resume well I I I went to this company and I turned it around and I went here and I turned this company around and I I done this and I turned this company around I thought called to do something for the Living God what in the world is your success as a businessman got to do with that if we could give Peter a resume now brother Peter we want to give you a resume right here tonight and uh we want you to fill this out uh brother Donnie I can't write my own name would you care to fill it out and I'll put a big X there uh now James what about you well the Bible says they were ignorant and unlearned men but there's one thing they did take note of they had been with Jesus so you could have an instructor oh they could instruct the word and lay the word and lay the word but they don't don't have the ability for Christ to reproduce himself through them but if you'll notice what they do they themselves father the people in their church then you'll watch the church WIll begin to take on the image of that man in the Pulpit why because he is actually the one that is bringing them in that's why they can't sneeze without him anybody preaches in the church they got to look at him say what he says CU they don't know the word themselves they're not be begotten of Father God they have to constantly have the permission from the pastor well come on somebody but you see a man who has the ability to be be bring forth children beget to beget as Paul said I begotten you to Christ he was a father so then that man that can do that all he is is just a carrier of the sea life he is actually a unic himself to where he he cannot interject his own lie to be able to bring forth s in the church so that I'll be like him so what you'll find when you go to them types of churches and you watch them you'll find a diversity of people that are there and they won't all be well if the pastor jer's neck a certain way then you watch those that are under the teaching of a scholar or a lecturer and they will act like him but if that man is simply a pass one that will pass the life of God they will what you'll find is some that'll jump some that'll shout some that'll cry glory to God some that'll sit there and look at them that's crying said man they're emotional L and what is it it's that diversity because the diversification comes from God but like beets like so you watch an instructor as his church begins to grow as we say and the blessing of the Lord is on us and you watch The Offspring and you see is that man producing word burst and how do they feel about the word give them the word test give them the word test now this is what they done in the original church and whenever they come up to them and boy they' go to say them things that Paul hadn't said they would withstand them to their face and call them Liars wow amen and the church said now watch for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have you not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you he said through the gospel wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me look at this word followers an imitator so Paul baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and preachers in this day and down to the ages have baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost they're not imitating Paul Paul said I speak in tongues more than you all but some of our message preachers don't even believe in speaking in tongues they're not an imitator well praise the Lord Paul cast out Devils heal the sick and yet some of our say well we don't need prayer lines no more my Lord we got more sick Fone now we've ever had them that's right well brother d That's a gentile way of believing I say Amen to that but I will also remind you it was the architect and the designer of the church who said these Sons shall follow them that believe and I did not find where he said up in the the last day it will end because you won't need it no more amen now you show me where he said that and I will say Amen but until you do I'm going to go ahead and pray for some right here tonight if they need it because my Lord Jesus was the one who told me to lay hands on the sick Oh Brother D speak the word speak the word speak the word I can do that I can do that yes sir you walk up here and you say brother Donnie I got confident speak the word you don't to lay hands on me I'll quote you the word of God Absolutely I'll say yes brother amen I agree with you I believe the word if that's your faith I believe that but if your faith ain't rose that place yet and you want somebody to lay hands on you here you go I'm here to help you oh but they'll never get high if you don't stop laying hands on them and where is that quote I find the prophet still doing that till he left oh somebody said he quits doing discernment I want you to show me that I want you to show me I don't want surmising I don't want your idea I want you to show me where he stopped laying hands on them I want you to show me where he stop Discerning come on somebody I want you to show me oh he he got H yeah brother Donnie he got away from that Pentecostal thing really well he was in streetport 11 2565 about a month and a half before the Lord took him from this Earth and he was talking about them acts 238 tongu speaking young ones and said that's the only kind that the word can bring forth they got that second Adam oh Hallelujah that second Adam way of acting like they did on the day of [Applause] Pentecost notice Paul says oh my wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me ah you know everybody is going to follow somebody 1 Corinthians chap 11 verse 1 be ye followers imitators of me even as I also am of Christ come here Brothers de ye imitators of me come up here on the platform don't be scared I'm about you now you're going to imitate me and you're not did you last time or not I don't you didn't okay all right you want to change it up sure he wants to imitate me now tonight now Paul said be you an imitator of me you're not imitating me okay and you are praise the Lord praise the Lord don't you believe me are you in the message or are you in the church I mean Hallelujah Jesus is coming okay now I'm realized I'm a dumb Kian but you tell me which one that's right is imitating me him or him if you choose him you're a n thank you bre now why why because these are the men that were inspired with the original plan but George Smith told me something many years ago brother bram's house out in Tucson when they bought the house there brother Bram wanteded to add this gain room and brother M designed it and laid it all out maybe many of you have been there and he wanted wanted a a place to be able to put his trophies and all so the brother that he was going to get to build it brother Ram told him he said now there'll be all kinds of people that'll come in and see it and they'll have this idea and that idea and they'll want you to do this and that and the other he said now you be courteous but stick with the plan now this is the way we want to do when it comes to the gospel we want to be courteous to those that say you don't need this and you don't need that and you need this and you need that and we look in the plan and we say now the plan don't say that we don't want to get the wrong attitude we don't want to get a bad bad thing about it but we want to just be courteous but stick with the plan do we want a book of Acts Church do we want an Omega Church which reflect the alpha church we'll only get it one way that's by following the original plan let me have a few more minutes and we'll close can I yeah now Paul says in 2 Corinthians again chapter 1 verse or chapter 1 verse 24 not for that we have dominion over your face now notice how he wants to put this in there we're not trying to be your bosses we're not trying to be dictators not that we have dominion of your faith but are helpers of your joy come on now for by faith you stand Philippians 3:17 Brethren be followers imitate ERS together of me and mark them which walk so now Paul knew that he was going to pass he'd have too many years after this was written actually and he said now be followers of me and then I want you also to mark them which walk the way I walk why next generation of ministry Next Generation of ministry keep your eye on them and mark them mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example look at this word example pattern manner in the technical sense the pattern in Conformity to which a thing must you see it this pattern is not a suggestion on amen amen that's right it either is or it ain't you know who's going in the Rapture those who fit the pattern you know who's going to be left those who don't match the pattern now that's not just the churches only that's individuals in the churches oh my notice Philippians 3:18 for many walk of whom I've told you often and now tell you even weeping now listen what he says they are that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ now watch they had come so close Harry now they were right around the message they were right there among them brother Larry no doubt said we're preaching Christ oh Hallelujah Hallelujah but Paul said I'll tell you what they are they're enemies of the Cross but did you notice this man's attitude toward them for many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping oh yes this is the true Spirit which God wants to use to speak to people in an error God will never take an angry human Spirit to correct wrong he don't use that God don't need our human angry Spirit now God has an angry an anger oh yeah he anoints His prophets and his servants to speak that way sometimes but there's a difference between his anger and human anger notice Paul speaking about these men and they had actually become enemies of the Cross of Christ because they were some of the guys that was preaching circumcision these were some of the guys that said you got to keep the law of Moses you've got to do this and you got to do that oh yeah the cross is good the cross is good but you cannot be saved if you don't get circumcised Paul said they are enemies of the Cross yet preaching it yet preaching it but not preaching it in its reality it form and Paul was sitting there as he was in the jail which is where this was written in prison sitting there in prison brother Rob writing this tears running down his face or you see those preachers or men that find pleasure in the fact that others are inconsistent and they rejoice when they hear this man or that man or this church or that church is in trouble or or doing wrong and and they rejoice it does something good to them there's something wrong with their Spirit friends if we know there are people in our church that aren't doing right and we know there are churches in the message that aren't doing right and we do and we would Rejoice because of that it would make us happy because of it we need to pray God will help us it should break our hearts should break our hearts to hear if there's anybody Among Us that's not living the kind of Life they should live it should break our hearts to hear that there's any even on the fringes of our message that are not doing right why brother Donnie the next verse is why who end is destruction whose God is their belly whose glory is in their shame so the very thing they should be ashamed of they're glorying in their glory is in their shame their Glory oh we don't we don't preach that at our church we don't go that way and they glory in it but it's really their shame because they don't preach it yeah then we should grieve and pray God please help them please God help them there's someone in our church that ain't doing right God please help them help them to realize it's dangerous to come and set where the presence of God is and not yield to the spirit of Goden oh my whose glory is in their shame who mind Earthly s things to's stand together can you see tonight why Satan wanted to impersonate himself as the church you realize that's a quote he has deceived the People by impersonating himself as the church yes sir so they sang about the blood they sang songs about the cross they sing about heaven they sing and talk about hell oh he said there's such good people good people good people yeah till you show them them good scriptures yeah and then you'll see a side of them that you had never seen before M yeah believe me as a pastor I get aide of a lot of people that you never see I get a side of a lot of preachers that you never see you see that side they want you to see but I see a different side especially when I give them the word and give them the message uhhuh then you ought to read some of the emails I get from preachers you ought to read some of the texts I get from preachers you'd never believe it so does that make you happy it breaks my heart and I hope and pray to God it always does how many wants to be more like Jesus may God help us excuse me that we will not only want a church like the original church but we will so feel this is what Paul another example that he gave for us preachers so when we hear of someone going off we hear of you know a move over in Africa I just heard a song this evening sent to me by someone a group a message group and they were singing about this certain man I mean just about worship just unbelievable absolutely unbelievable I saw a V video of of a group in another country many thousands of miles here and this preacher was walking up um between them going in to preach and they were bowing down before him when he got up to preach later in the service they were calling him Elohim I've stood in that church and preached God have mercy well brother Donnie you think they're sincere you think they're good people no doubt they are but they got under an evil spirit I don't know how much you pray for the bride around the world but you need to you really realize we cannot go home as a group until every member of this bride gets to her place if there's a little girl or a little boy let me quote it to you from Tampa 1964 but there's a little girl a little boy here born over in Seattle Washington and that book holds their name we will not go home friends he said the church will play along slug along have meetings and so forth until that child is able to receive it do you imagine there might be one little boy that's holding up this whole thing tonight and that little boy's got to get saved and got to get filled with the Holy Ghost and we're just waiting and we're having church on Wednesday and on Sunday and we're just meeting and Gathering people people all over the world doing it but he so loves that bride he'll not call that's thousands or Millions home and leave one behind I'm glad I might be that one a you think of this we need to think not only local but Global Lord your people be merciful Lord I hear there's people off in India and this I hear there's people off in Africa there I'm not interested Lord getting myself involved all that but Lord God bring your children home bring your children home if they got to be removed out from under a false prophet Grant it Lord if they got to be removed out from under a false teacher Grant it Lord do you pray that way brother Donnie I absolutely do sir yes I do I pray that God will bring his people out from under false teaching and error we ain't going by ourself we're going Hallelujah as a group around the world oh sure God's calling individuals we know that but this last group we must all go together and no heaven will not be in sections well we can't have fellowship with them people over there cuz we didn't like them down in life and we didn't like them people over there and then there won't be nobody there with that attitude we've got to love one another we can disagree and still love one another praise the Lord oh Jesus let's just bow our heads if you would wow Lord I must say I am overwhelmed by the way you took this this way tonight oh my goodness I pray that I'll always be sensitive to be able to follow your spirit I had all these wonderful scriptures and quotes laying before me tonight and I didn't hardly get to get to none of them but great architect you're still the designer of sermons amen may always be sensitive to follow your leading Lord Heavenly Father our building would look different than the original Church they didn't have no doubt musical instruments quite like we do no doubt there'd be things that would be different but Lord we would want our Doctrine our principles the foundation of our faith to be the same I've tried among the countries of Latin America and their music there is different than ours the music in Kenya different than the music in Zimbabwe the music there different from India the music there different from China and different places that I've been in the world and you leave it that way but yet Lord you we believe you're going to have your people to be one in Soul one in heart one in principle oh Jesus gather your people together father from around the world men always want to try to gather them under one certain man so they're all listen to his stuff but how carnal that is Lord gather us in Christ Jesus Lord Jesus may your presence so move among us here father that we can lay aside our little pet doctrines and pet ideas and be one like never before we will always disagree on things no doubt but I believe tonight you're getting a group of people together around the world that are coming into that Unison and that Harmony of the new births oh Jesus get us together father get us together so we can leave this place we need you Lord maybe there's one maybe there's a thousand maybe there's 10,000 no way for us to know but we know the Rapture will not go until every member of that bride is in her place maybe a little black boy maybe living on the streets of kinasa maybe a little black girl living on the streets of Nairobi the Congo maybe a little black boy Down in Africa somewhere or Florida or New York little Indian maybe out in the reservations oh God wherever they are would you get them Lord yes Lord this world is getting worse every day it's a more unfit place for us to live come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus take us away Lord God if there's any here tonight that needs to fix anything in their soul in their walk would you help them may we be able to move Lord into a sphere of love that we've never had before a love of your word love for your people of course first and foremost a a love for you and I'm sure Lord that there'll always be people that maybe will love you a little more as I read it to Carol on Monday where your Prophet said Peter never had that love in his heart that John had that Peter was more of a representative of face but he never quite loved you the way John did and I thought wow so I can't keep from wondering then if there even people that come to the maturity of love if there won't be some that might love you a little more than us so help us to realize we're not trying to match each other but just become mature in all that we can be I'll never be what a lot of Great Men are in many ways but what I want to be is what you want me to be amen I may never have the love for you that brother Ron Spencer has or brother Tim or maybe brother Daryl but Lord I do know this I want to love you as much as I can I may never have the Fai that some of them might have but I want to have all the faith that I can have to match all the things that I am for your purpose and use I just want to be what you want me to be amen I want to love you I want to serve you I want to be everything that I can for your kingdom Lord cuz it isn't about me it isn't about these people it's about us it's about you it's about you living in US Lord I read it yesterday where your Prophet said we're not worshiping a baby and a Manger deity and a Manger but we're worshiping deity in us so that same deity is not laying in Bethlehem but deity is right here tonight in human bodies oh Lamb of God we worship you Jesus we have seen your star in the west and we

never leave us sometimes we think he does because we don't feel him but we don't go by what we feel we go by what he says amen amen amen how he's happy to be in the house of God today it's a great privilege for us in it let's turn to Daniel chter 7 verse 10 today Daniel 7: 10 I want to speak to you today by the help of the Lord on the right to the god of love the right to the god of love now listen to me carefully not the right to the love of God but the right to the god of love there's all kinds of things that God loves but they don't have the right to love him back he loved the blue the azer colors in the sky he loves the color of the ocean he loves the green God must really like green don't he you ever notice how much green there is in the in the earth God loves that but green can't love God back that's right the sky can love him back he loves a variety of colors and birds plumage white brown green the peacock is just so beautiful with its variety of colors yet the colors and their pigmentation cannot love him back so your blessed today cuz you get to love him back Daniel 7: 10 a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him so thousand thousands ministered unto him 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was said and the books were open 1 John 4 verse 7 beloved let us love love one another for love is of God and everyone that love us is born of god wow so you mean just because a person can love something means they're born of God you see John is using a differentiation in the word love people love pizza right yeah people love their car they love their house some people love the beach some people love mountains and we say I love the color of that suit I love the color of that dress do they yeah they do but just because you love like that don't mean that you love God right amen Now watch how John said it beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that love us love us what what not trees not grass not pizza not cars but everyone that loveth one another that's right is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is amen now notice John does not say that God loves and he does but he actually is love for God is love verse 16 and we have known and believ the love that God has to us God is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God now notice where your house is where your place of residence is he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him to me this profoundly placed put together scripture must be one of the greatest in the entire Canon of the Bible love is not simply a quality which God possesses but rather love is that which is his very nature so the love of God and the god of love the love of God and the god of love I hope today each of us in this building have a right to be able to love this God I may like to be remembered as we pray together today let's just hold our needs our request in our hearts Lord Jesus we're so grateful for this opportunity again that we could assemble today in this place that you've given us to be able to Worship You Lord we've not gathered that we could show off our clothes or gather together that we could talk about what's going on in the world though that certainly concerns us but Lord we believe church is a very special time Church to us is not just a social Gathering to where we can gather together and socialize and we do do that but yet it's more than that to us it's to hear from you and then in turn let you hear back from us it's to meet our brothers and sisters and greet them the people that we believe we will spend eternity with we've also come for correction today if we need to be corrected we've come for encouragement we've come for healing but we've come to worship we've come to praise oh Jesus take charge of the service father help me shut my mouth to anything that would displease you granted I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus and the saints of God said amen amen God bless you you may be seated the right to the god of love I know we say love a lot people say it to us a lot people could we can meet for the first time um Carol and I saw somebody this week and uh woman didn't know us from Adam and Eve but she said love you guys love you guys Carol said well glad to know that she loves us I said how can she love us she don't even know us I mean first time she ever seen us in our life so it can become a term that we use you know I mean here in East Tennessee hey buddy hey buddy hey buddy you know all the cliches that we use around here come to find out they're not your buddy at all are they so it can be that way with with love and we should love we should not only love our own kind but we should love those that are beyond our kind that's what God did in order to save the world God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son you know the rest of the scripture that they might be saved if they wish to be but yet it doesn't mean that everybody that God loved will have the ability to be able to love him back so to receive the love of God is one thing versus the god of love the love of God as I mentioned it last week gives every Mortal on the Earth today fresh air you ever try to figure that out you know you make a little something sisters in your house and uh whatever it is that you're cooking and it leaves a remnant of that smell in your house or your car you carry something in your car and it leaves a little bit of Remnant think of all the debris that is rotting after this hurricane that we've been through the water how bad that it is and the trees tend of thousands of trees that are rotting and yet how come does not fill the air with stench why is it that the mud that was all stirred up by the flood waters doesn't totally overwhelm the scent that's on the earth and yet we walk out we don't even smell it if you didn't know any better you would never know that you're 11 or 12 miles just down the road from horrendous sites of trees that were uprooted others that were blown down and all types of things and burning burning and burning and burning trees to get rid of them and yet why doesn't the whole earth smell like that because God made a way for the ozone layer which is above the Earth to be able to purify so he caused the trees to be able to take in the carbon monoxide and the other things and put out what oxygen so God has this gigantic thing going on in the Earth every day that we live there people don't even think about it they just when it becomes weather with they can they can't wait to open a door crack a window to let in what what we call Fresh Air and yet there are millions of leaves that are fixing to fall off the trees thousands of them have already fallen right and yet they're fixing to start decomposing and they will turn back to matter and you reach down and pick it up and hold it in your hands and it has a smell you'll see black mold you'll see all different types of things but how come the Earth doesn't smell like that because God knew that it needed this ventilation so he created a way that the Earth day by day would be able in all this deaths and all this matter that is rotting God made a way for the earth to renew itself if you look at your own life as a child of God and not get down at all the matter in your lives and and all the rot in your lives and all the rotness around the world God's given you a holy ghost ozone layer that you can be renewed and refreshed in his presence every day you live on the earth but it's going to depend upon you will you allow the spirit of God to renew your joy and to renew the opportunities that you have or are you just going to constantly go around picking up the rotten leaves and the rotten woods and the rotten this and that and the other and there's mushrooms over there and there's all type of bacteria and things here and there you going to focus on that there's all kinds of it out there to focus on if you wish to or you can focus on God has been so good to me I don't deserve anything that he's done but he didn't do it because I deserved it he did it because he loved me now truly every one of us today whether or not you're even a Christian have experienced the love of God okay so it's a quarter till to 12 and we're sitting here we've been here now for a little bit and we've experienced oxygen we've exchanged lungs the air in our lungs multiple hundreds of times since you've been here already our blood has been able to take the food that we digested early the enzymes from our body rush into our our gases and acids and so on inside the stomach have already started doing that the love of God giving you another day to live the white blood cells the red blood cells already going about taking whatever it was you ate for breakfast all this is going on every day of your life you don't even thank God for it most of us don't even think nothing about it unless we start having problems then we begin to think about it right so we we absolutely experience the love of God every day you was able to get up out of bed this morning that was the mercy of God to you you're able to take a breath you're able to have a church where you can come and be able to worship God in spirit and in truth what is that the love of God but does that mean that every person that experiences that element or measure of love has the god of love now to experience the love of God and to have the god of love is two different things now the love of God was extended in John 3:16 as we quoted it already that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved now that's a great thing is it not and there will be millions of John 3:16 people as a matter of fact we just read about it here in the Book of Daniel and they will stand Before the Throne of God many of them will never be capable to enter in into the god of love yeah they will say I experienced the love of God I was a drunk I was a liar I was a wherer and God forgave me of my sins and and I found a church and I went there and then I I I heard other people talk about the Holy Ghost and I never had the Holy Ghost I never saw a need to give up habits in my life or that in my life but you can't tell me I did not experience the love of God and you know what they did God forgave them and many of them become church members and this church or that church whatever church that they chose to go to and they still experience the love of God and blessings and material things and other things that God did for them but does that mean because they experience the love of God they have the god of love here you see John was the disciple of love as we know but yet we also know from the preview that we see of John uh him and his brother how that they asked for a particular place in the Kingdom of Jesus now that was not the love of God that John was going to experience so what I find amazing is that the disciple of Love wasn't always the disciple of love he was a disciple of selfishness so it wasn't like that John was born this Golden Child and he always had this supreme Insight of the love of God and he was just this perfect figure now truly no doubt he was altogether different than Peter I imagine Peter start getting whooped from the time he is two w up you know Peter just got ragged on I mean he must have got his mouth mashed over and over again for those of you that don't know Kentucky language what that is you say something and your mama reaches back and smacks you right in the Smacker and it kind of helps you pay more attention what you're going to say next time so John was not you know like that in the way that Peter was but John himself still did not have the god of love now we know there was a special something about him and Jesus loved him but yet John could never have that God of love until he received his portion of the pillar of fire on the day of Pentecost and John even though he experienced an element of the love of God in saving him and he experienced an element of the love of God and being close to the Lord Jesus as a matter of fact the only disciple that we know according to the four gospels that was there at the sight of the Cross all the rest of them had fled away so it seems as if though John had an element of love that even Peter and James Mar you some of the rest of the brothers did not have but John did not have the god of love though he experienced the love of God now what what I'm looking at this morning is that once God uh expanded and and allowed this type of love to leave from his own being he knew that once he ever let this go out of himself that this love released would demand Fellowship ship now listen once love is released and you me whoever it is Mortals on the earth that begin to acknowledge a love then it will demand Fellowship it's just automatic with love so you take a young man a young woman and they come to that age and they start thinking about boyfriends and girlfriends and all of that and then they get up very old 2021 and they're they're just convinced totally that they're doomed to a life of celibacy their whole life you know cuz their life is just about over they ain't got a girlfriend or a boyfriend and if they reach 25 or 26 I mean they are in major major desperation right brothers so you see some of these young men laughing at me here this morning because something in them is expressing and they they never felt that way when they were little bitt but something in them is calling for an expression and that love demands Fellowship so then they start talking to girls and the girls start talking to boys and they go to camps and now y'all can act like that I'm the old fogy Pastor okay and that I don't know what I'm talking about but there's been many of our youths around the message that have met their mate at youth camps and then there's been many of our youth who met the devil at Youth Camp camps and they'd been better off if they' never met that boy or girl that they met because it want to cause them a lot of trouble but what is that they're in the quest and the search for a demand of Love cuz there's something in them and it's like it's it's reaching out for the love of someone that can love them back listen this and God's provided approach the Divine Fellowship the prophet said that there is a True Fellowship and God is love and love demands love Demands a fellowship now I'm sure all of us know of people you know they really don't like being around people they like horses better than they do humans they like dogs they like cats they like you know whatever more they like just being by theel they'd rather be by theel and they are their most favorite company they talk to theel they eat with theel they just rather be about you know there's something wrong with that person I mean I hate to be the one to tell you today but if they really love right love demands Fellowship love demands Fellowship now we all need that private time I'm not saying there's something weird with you about that but God made us to be social creatures watch again he says it a little bit different and what made God provide this way because God is love and love demands Fellowship love demands Fellowship so he repeats it that love demands Fellowship I I can only imagine in my mind today as you that we would be able to go back to the Garden of Eden and think of what a perfect love that Adam and Eve must have had in the Garden of Eden and that perfect love was between each other and it was between them and God it's something to be honest with you that most of us have never experienced if by the new birth we become born again and we become changed then we're entering into that perfect love but still we will find people that we will struggle with being able to really love them the way we do others any humans still here today that can nod your head or say Amen you see it was totally unlike that in the Garden of Eden there was nothing there that they had to struggle there's only two human beings on the Earth but there was no strain between Adam and Eve and God had to make them in this perfect lovable condition so there was nothing about Adam that Eve would have disliked there was nothing about Eve that Adam would have disliked and there was nothing about either or of them that God disliked so it was the pure perfect love of God issuing force from the stream of its origination now we know that according to the way that Moses wrote it there in the Book of Genesis he said that there were four rivers that came down through the paradise of God and he gives us the great name of them and he tells us of where they started and how they come through and the tigress and the eus and you remember reading that in the Bible and we know that a couple of those have been lost but yet there's some of those that are still flowing and yet the beginning or the origination of those rivers and it's amazing because when God had Moses to WR it that he would say about the gold and this and that and the other that was in the Garden of Eden and the gold was good there so he took something out of that paradise and be to describe what it was so we know then that Not only was uh Euphrates there and the tigress and the other rivers that were there but also there was another River and it was the river of perfect love its issue had started already before the foundation of the world because Angels come out of God the elect Angels come out of those attributes of God which can never fail now unlike us God has thoughts and attributes of things that he wants which will only be in time and there are other things that comes out of him that are of his own Essence which means that they are of Eternal quality but God knew that there would be day and there would be night and yet we know according to Revelation 21 and 22 whenever John saw the city he said there will be no night there there just inside the city so there are things then that we experience here on the earth that will not be in the eth day there are things that we experience now that those who have already passed Beyond on the curtain of time and gone in the sixth Dimension they will not experience nor will they experience it again but there are other things of God that are Eternal so it's as if God was selective in through which part these thoughts projected forth and came into existence and we know that from this Great River of Love God himself began to allow this to be expressed and the first thing that he made was angels and they wor worshiped him then he entered into this attribute called God because God is an object of worship before that he was just the Eternal he dwelt alone with his thoughts the lonely God but he knows if he ever expresses this love it will by itself demand Fellowship so if he's going to love he's going to Fellowship but Fellowship is always risky when you're fellowshipping with something which is less than yourself now God knew when he made the man if he would have left him in spirit form the man could not have fallen but in spirit form his wife's identity was in him but she did not have a separate identity they were together and God knew the very moment that he divides this man whenever he breathes into his nostrils this lump of clay and the prophet said he was his toes was like roots of a tree as they were down in the ground and there he stood so God made him and he made the organs and the tissue and the bones and the brain matter and all of that and yet the man was just standing there God raises him from the table by which he had made him on the dust of the earth then God stands him up and there he stands like a statue his toes are there in the earth he's not breathing he's not moving there's no animation about him his eyes are not batting his heart is not pumping but when God breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life animation struck this man so his heart starts pumping all of a sudden God transforms this pile of dust into blood blood cells oxygen saturation all the carbohydrates and you know all all the things in the body and all that God did an immediate transformation and this dust is standing there in this form and God breathes and Man became a living Soul so here he is straight from the river of God so God breathes into his nostrils the breath of life and it becomes a living soul then he looks at him Papa my father my papa my father now if he an expression of love love will demand Fellowship you imagine the first time that Adam and in the Garden of Eden reached out his hand to take a hold of God who was that there in the Garden of Eden ah you see it was the same one that would hang upon the cross thousands of years later and say forgive them Father for they know not what they do now he's the first one to experience life also the first Gman to experience love I'm yet to feel the way he did I'm yet to be able to look on all that creation that God made and look at it through eyes of perfection and find no fault cuz like you like me like all the rest of us we're all so deeply flawed are we not now God enters into this stage but God also knows that Adam himself maybe not right off But as time would go on that Adam would start developing these feelings too initially he was probably perfectly satisfied we don't even know how long it was might have been a year might have been 10,000 years we don't know but all of a sudden he began to develop feelings that he did not have at the original taking of the Breath of Life feelings that he did not have once God had experienced an allowed him to experience his love and now for the first time father Could Feel Love from a human being he must have been so anxious absolutely every day when he would come down on the Garden of Eden he could not wait till his son would just come up and just hug him and to be able to touch him and remember the invisible God took on a visible form and that was Christ pre Jesus preincarnate form oh God must have been under such anticipation because his love demanded Fellowship maybe it was the first afternoon after Adam felt it around noon or so maybe in the day and papa came and he got around him he said you okay son yeah I'm good I'm good I'm good is sure all right that's the way the Lord does US ain't it sometimes you sure you sure you're all right you sure you done okay Papa knew what it was oh he's come to that spot maybe it was not at the state to where God said it's not good for man to be alone maybe it just started out with a feeling of an emotion he never felt before he had everything he wanted but whenever he started fellowshipping with God it's like fellowship with God brought out the desire in him to want to fellowship with more of God that's so I'm telling you friends folks around this message that think they don't need nobody they need the Holy Ghost is what they need and if they ever get the Holy Ghost they realize they need to find a church somewhere that preaches the truth and they'll find out they need brothers and sisters come on now Heaven ain't going to be made with a bunch of cabins on the hill and you're 500,000 miles away from your closest neighbor I know some of you think that's the ideal place of Heaven There ain't no such a thing well praise the Lord so something in him and then we know of course what God did and then when God looks at them oh my it was it was just unexplainable whenever he looked and she looked at him and he looked at her but you see when a human learns how to love they are so dangerous and when they learn the rewards of love and that's when Satan tries to get them no you understand me today the more you embrace the light of God and the more you Embrace God's love it opens up an element of vulnerability about you that was not there when you were a sinner that's right amen because you have now delved into the realm of the Supernatural and then what you have to be careful for is that your love of the supernatural does not become overcome by the wrong Supernatural yes sir because once we get to the realm of Supernatural then remember Satan always has an element himself of Supernatural reserved for those who want Supernatural Well praise the Lord that's why the prophet said in Harvest time that the devil can hand out them Supernatural gifts by the handful now he don't offer that to people who don't love Supernatural cuz they don't believe in it but if you love Supernatural and we have to if we love God because he is Supernatural so it's like before that become awoken in us we were not aware that it was there and that love you know but once it becomes and you love Supernatural God and you love the supernatural element then Satan also knows okay they've been awakened to that and now that love for Supernatural will demand fellowship and then God listen God himself will even allow him to come and try you to see if you will judge your Supernatural love and your Supernatural desire you will judge it by the word so Satan hands you a gift and yet that gift is not exactly with a word you will reject that gift if you love of him right because you know God don't tell lies that's right well praise the Lord so I've turned now Adam and Eve fall in the Garden of Eden and then of course we know the the fall and how the story goes and how that they both were expressing after the fall they showed that they had now went down the tributary of time and they had made this extensive long journey listen just by one little simple Act of Disobedience they had now left the mouths of this Great River of perfect love and they found them themselves having journeyed by one little sin had now journeyed way on down the river and the tributary of love so now they don't love each other right and they don't love God right now they still love but they're love love is not from the source the way it was cuz they loved perfectly now they're loving in a flawed way so you can see Adam's selfishness the woman thou gavest and then the woman well the serpent did this and what are they doing blaming everybody and their brother boy as a pastor I hear that all the time well it's so and so's fault it's so and so I'll tell you one if they wouldn't Hypocrites at church I'd go to church that don't stop you from going to Walmart does it that going to stop you from going to longh Horn today for dinner you're going to get up and make a public announcement every gay leave this restaurant while I'm here every liar leave this restaurant of course you ain't going to do it you're going to go in there and sit down and sit there and smile like a Poss if they bring your steak out there your chicken whatever and you're going to sit there and you see somebody's green hair and purple streaks down the back of it you see two men holding hands you're going to say pitiful that's the way you ought to do the house of God you ought not to let this person or that person or that person stop you you ought to say I'm not going because of them I'm not going because of that person I'm going because I am a worshiper and my love and my heart demands Fellowship now during this whole time can you imagine what God Lost In the Garden of Eden the love of his life now for those of us in our assembly who've lost a husband or a wife and there's a great love that a parent has for a child there's no question about it there's a great love that you have for your nieces nephews and cousins and so on and so on but oh if a man has a woman that God GES him gave him rather and she has a man that God gave her and their Eternal mates together what a loss that is if God takes one before the other and you feel like your life will never ever be the same and in one way it won't why because as we said that was the love of my life so now God points to the gate and said you all get out leave today but when he looked at him it just so overwhelmed him and he come down in front of them and said to the woman not to the man I I I will bring enmity between thy seed and the seed of the serpent I will bring you back isn't that amazing that he said that to the woman not to the man Satan used the woman through what her Avenue of love so what she did was she allowed herself she come to that spot of loving and Satan perverted that love what was it lust praise the Lord but you see if God would have kept that within her harnessed it never allowed her to experience it she would have never known she would have never known anything about it but love demanded Fellowship don't you understand when you go to hanging around the wrong people oh listen school kids you're going to school you're going to college you got to be careful because Satan will try to pull you into the wrong Fellowship doing the wrong things why cuz there's something in humans is that right yes sir so God must start all over again so he lost the love of his life but actually when you know where something is it's not really lost out of existence it's just temporarily misplaced ain't that right now as far as God's way of keeping time remember all of this and the span of what man has been upon the Earth the fall the cross the resurrection and so on one day being in his time a thousand years it's not hardly been weak yet now we look at oh it's been so long but for him it's not really been that long so in the middle of the week he died and he raised again and we know that God started in his rebuilding of his Masterpiece with a man called Abram and he brings it on down he starts love loving again loving again but now I must love ones who are so flawed not like Adam who was perfect but now that the seed's been mixed to Genesis 6 his children some of them will be murderers Liars thieves idolators and adulterers everything imaginable now his children will be that how can God love such people watch this in the church in this condition I thought of how God of the dove is such a loving bird and the dove God wanting to make love with his human beings God wants to be loved God wants to love you God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but to have everlasting life blessed be the Lord then God wanting to make love he had to make something lovable he had to make something gentle like himself he had to make something that could be loved he had to make something of his own nature oh and yet after what happened in the Garden of Eden there was an element of time to where even after that that sons of God still catered toward father Satan had not yet achieved fully what he wanted Genesis 6 now M mixes the Bloodlines and therefore the the nature so then every human being will become contaminated exactly what Satan wanted in the beginning you realize why many people cannot live right for the Lord today it's all about their love life amen yes sir it's all about their love life the things they love why I can't do this I can't do that what simple it's what do you love the most is that right it's what you love the most so then notice the key here and this is he had to make something of his own nature you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature now Lord willing this week brother Malachi and sister Chloe are going to get married and you imagine if Sister Cy would have come to me a long time ago and car and talked to us and she'd found this young man and she really really liked him and got serious about him and that's perfectly natural and normal right oh what if she would have come to me and said I found this poodle brother Donnie its hair is so curly and I was wondering could we have the wedding at the church oh you say that's crazy it is can you imagine God marrying any of us without us truly being changed now this separates the bride from the church because you see the church wants to come to God and they want to sure give him their sins give him let him go do all the hard work but they'll still keep this and this and this and this and this and this but they want God to love them so much that he just simply overlooks everything about B God is not marrying the bride because of overlooking God is marrying her because she's been so changed he will marry a bride of his own nature friend you realize what a miracle we are here today every one of you that are truly born again every person sitting here or those that are listening to this service and if you are truly born again you are a phenomenal Miracle because you were born a liar you were born lost we were born wretched we were born Wicked we were born come to the world speaking lies how in the world could God ever love us God ministered to us the love of God until the seed could grab a hold of it it'll transform the seed then the seed can get not only the love of God but the god of love Hallelujah there's something in the bride today that I believe with all of my heart that is craving for more love more love from God and more love for ourselves anybody feel that way today you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature loving has to unite with love a husband and wife has to love one another if they ever make the grade family has to love one another if they ever make the great something to be loved you search everywhere find a girl to be your wife that you love She searches finding a husband that she can love and God searches trying to find a soul that he can love here am I Lord here am I Lord Love Me Love Me Lord hallelujah so by our first nature then we were not very lovable Ephesians 2:3 says that this way among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the the lust of our flesh fulfilling listen this the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature by Nature oh my the children of WRA oh my wow how in the world that I become a child of WRA I believe I was conceived naturally between my mother and father is a child of love how did I become a child of rest and it wasn't in their nature it was in my own notice the word rest it says anger Vengeance temper movement or agitation of the Soul those of you that's got enough temper to fight a buz saw you need a little control switch it's called the Holy Ghost amen you may fight it all your life but it'll bring it under control so notice Paul says then we were by Nature children of Wrath even as others so here are some that were by Nature children of WRA but not by seed no a so by Nature I was a child of Wrath by nature I was identified on the other side but not by representation by seed and where do we get that at from the devil oh brother Donnie I'll tell you one thing I run my genealogy I go back to the Duke of England and I go back to the Royal House of the Scottish show and so and so and so all them was of the devil too Royal Blood there is no such a thing that's right come on somebody well I'll tell you one thing I I'm part of this particular Clan out of iron and out of this and that and the other thieves Liars whoremongers robbers that's right the Royal Blood there is only one Royal Blood that's the Lord Jesus yes sir now watch Satan can copy any kind of a gift and any kind of a manifestation listen but he can't love God is love that's right Satan can't love so all of you if there's anyone here today that's not a Christian you're living for the devil you're serving a master that can never will ever love you that's right amen yeah Satan can't love so what did we experience prior to our new birth human love but remember it's so far from the original Fountain the river where it come from now it's beyond me how that a man would want to fall in love with a man and want to marry a man okay it's beyond me it's beyond me that a woman would want to marry a woman woman do they have an element of love for them yeah no doubt they do they bear reproach of doing it they face being ridiculed laughed at rejected by their own family a lot of them is that right so they have some sort of emotion but where is it it's way on down even farther from the original creation of those of you that have married according to God's program but is it love yeah just like a person could love an animal they could love a dog or a cat or whatever more do they love it they do is it the same type of Love they have for a human if it is they're weird that's right that's right where does it come from it's coming from the river but it's way way way way way down way down you're at the bottom it's nearly at the very end of the trickle of love and this I love that person oh I know I do that's my mate I want to be with him for the rest of my life and you're looking say are you kidding me are you you kidding me why because you don't live from there you're closer to the mouse where it comes out up here oh praise the Lord and with the bride of Jesus Christ don't you understand from his mouth Goes Forth a living sword but also from his mouth Comes The Living Waters of his word and there's something in us that's pulling us back we want to go beyond brother Jim what our fathers could love I don't know about you I want to go beyond what my mother and father and they I I want to see them that day but I want to go beyond the love they were able to have for God anybody else what about some of our fathers those that originally founded this church as Happy Valley we want to go more why because the light of God is shining brighter now than it done 40 years ago or 45 years ago and as we progress in the word of God in our walk we're getting closer and closer and closer to the Fountain closer to the origination then it should not make us have more hatred it should make us have more love not only for God but for our brothers and sisters and for our fellow [Applause] men listen this you see a man humble and loving good to his neighbors and a good citizen a good fellow and a good man a Christian man full of love and humility you watch that man see that's right he's good charitable longsuffering you can talk about him it's all right like he forgives you testing one two testing one two I must have had a malfunction there on the microphone uh Houston we've got a problem here Brothers uh did it break out on y'all it didn't break out okay I think I'll read it again just in case some of you had a hearing block I can't hear you I can't hear you can you hear me now can you hear me now can you hear me now you can talk about him it's all right right he forgives you don't make any difference to him there's the real man keep your eye on him that bears and he's an example but no matter how much he shouts in church how much he does this or that or the other still hasn't got that Paul said though I speak with tongues oh my of men and of angels and though I have all these other things have enough Faith to move mountains now boy wouldn't that be a man with all keep our eyes on a man that could speak in tongues like men and angels and a man that would stand right here and move Buffalo mountain and you walk out there and say Lord have mercy what happened to that mountain that man of great faith moved it right in the middle of Johnson City they're having to build a road around it right now cuz he decided he want that to set right on North throne and he done moves boy where's his church at man a lot that's that's my pastor right there oh my notice he said though You' understand all the mysteries of God all the mysteries of God and I've been through all the seminaries and know it all up and down one side and the other and have not charity it profiteth me nothing that's right amen who doesn't want to be loved we all want that yes that's right we all need it yes we do and then the way to get it come on W that is not the answer you always expecting oh you thought I was going to say the way to get it is point it out to people you all ain't loving me right you ain't out to you one thing come on brother no the way to get it is to love somebody else then you will be lovable praise God but remember in order for God to make us truly lovable there must be a nature change second Peter 1:4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature listen at the meaning of this word divine Theos godhead spoken of the only and true God that we might be able to partake of Theos the only way that I can love him back right is he must be in me loving out that's right if I get a religious spirit and I go to church I'll love him and I'll you know I'll do all of that and people do they love him yes you the prophet tells that you can love and even love God and still be lost because you're loving from the human realm of emotion that's not what it takes to give him the love that he wants back the only way to really be able to love him is when he comes inside of us and he changes us takes the world out of us and then we start l in God like God wants to be loved and like God wants to be served so God said don't do that don't do that oh why in the world oh my goodness that's all they preach dos and don'ts and dos and don'ts and to a person that don't have God in them it's too hard to bear it's too difficult they just can't do it but if God ever gets in your soul Theos the divine nature so God in Me has no problem raising my hands and worshiping and adoring and loving when I feel so low that I feel like God don't even know my name or address anybody ever been there sure you have but yet you love him so much it's in spite of you it's beyond you and you don't just love him that way right you love others now notice that you might be partakers of the divine nature so what's this again now Divine godhead spoken of of the only and true God whatever can in any respect be liken to God or resembles him in any way hebraic which is a word form of the Hebrew language God's Representatives or vice Regent magistrates and judges The Book of Daniel again divine nature fusus the force you've seen these license place tag and bumper cigar haven't you May the force be with you yeah well I'm not sure what force they're talking about but this is the force I'm talking about if the force is with you you'll love like God and you'll forgive like God oh my brother Donnie I'll tell you one thing it runs in my neighbor we hold grudges bad and we can never forgive boy if anybody ever does anything to us we can never forget them you need the force I said you need the force get rid of the Weber and get rid of the Reagan and get rid of the Philips and the Ys and come on somebody get rid of the Nome or whoever you are and love like God loves and forgive but I'll never be able to do it I understand there's things I've been through there ain't no way in the world I could ever forgive people for what they've done to me on my own but once I got the Holy Ghost I found the power of forgiveness was in my new nature the force was in me the force was with me it's not just a nice bumper sticker it's not just a nice license Port it is our Nature by the grace of God that's how we love I love deity from my deity I love God from my part of God the force laws order of nature as opposed to what is monstrous abnormal perverse the sum now watch the sum of innate properties and Powers by which one person differs from others that you might be partakers of the divine nature 1 John 4:16 and we have known and believe the love that God has to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwell Us in God you say I don't want love to be a summer Chalet in the mountains I don't want love to be a VRBO on the beach in late September I don't want love to be a visit to the Gatlinburg mountains when the snow is blowing I take a little break I want love to be my everyday place that I live I want you to notice friends there's very few differentiations in the scripture that will identify by a oneliner a real True Believer but this is one of them yeah so he that dwelleth in Love Not Human love now dwelleth in God and God in him so he's moved beond I got the love of God praise the Lord I got the love of God I got the love of God this man this woman has the god of love you have the source look at the word dwellers Mino abide remain continue not to depart to be held kept in reference to state or condition to remain as one not to become another or different you see this love keeps you when you're downen this love keeps you when people don't like you this love keeps you when church people hurt your feelings anybody ever been hurt by church people yeah if you've ever been around many you have this type of Love Will Keep you when everybody misunderstands you yeah oh my brother don't that's God that you're talking about God that can do that I am that's right am and I want every bride believer in this assembly to listen to this next quote as I'll close with it there's nothing else that you can do only believe and if you believe then them little immoral things will just drop off like that as you believe you become love so we are actually in the process of becoming what God wants us to be isn't it amazing so to become you know I love the scripture that that John said he came to his own and his own received him not but to as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God and that word is to come into view or it is a prophetic word that comes to pass so you were a prophetic word of a son or daughter of God and you're coming to pass you understand when the prophet goes beyond the curtain of time he loved people when he was here he loved people so much as far as human capability plus the Holy Ghost but once he moved Beyond the Veil and he moved into a realm that he had never been before then he began to describe what he felt and the people were there perfect Beyond perfect Sublime Beyond Sublime he said he knew no word in the English language that would describe it so he be to talk about what it was he was so inquisitive about what it was where I of all these Broms you these this is you're gathered to your people my people my my my people you all these brandom no these are your converts that you've led to Christ so here they come and women came first now it was thought that in the world that he was a woman hater but in the sixth Dimension you sisters got to hug him before us brothers did you proved he wasn't a woman hater he is a true woman lover but telling them the truth so he must put and differentiate between women hugging him in life so he said he never let a woman hug him come up close to him all that sort of thing CU it could cause a sens ation he said a man even hugging his own little daughter but him being male her being female it could cause a sensation isn't that strange how the human being that is that close to a perversion you understand so whenever our our our daughters grow up you fathers know as well as I do that you still hug your daughters you still put your arm around them but you hug them in a different way than when they were little girls is that true why C that Avenue that's there in this is so close to perversion that you hug your own little daughter in the wrong way and that quickly that easily the perversion can be be this is not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost praise the Lord so when they come up and they start hugging him he notices something different now the women in form and in shape and so on our precious brother our precious brother and then they begin to Enlighten him on where he is and what he's entered into this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost now you see a preacher can preach things sometimes that he himself has not yet entered into now I preach that same thing but I'm not interdom to what he ented to why my body's not yet been changed and he said lay thus saith the Lord lay aside everything until you get into that perfect love don't you understand our souls arrive in Eden first the whole thing is the restoration and bringing it back to the Garden of Eden our souls will get there before our bodies do by the New Birth the Breath of God the same God that breathes by his mouth the beginning of the rivers of life from the mouth of God that same God did that to you when you got the Holy Ghost on your soul and you became a living Soul then you start loving and loving man car was standing yesterday and we was washing dishes together well she was washing and I was drying and I told her I said you know and I'll close when we first give our hearts to God and we get saved and God lets Trials come against us and they're of a certain strength and of a certain measure yet as we grow in God if those trials didn't intensify and become harder and more difficult then the character in us would become stunted and would we would reach a certain level and that's as far as it would go so I told her I said you know it looks like to me that we must be getting closer and closer than ever before not just the signs of the times but the intensity with the Steve of the trials we're going through but if God allowed you and tried you with something that you overcome 50 years ago 40 years ago 10 years ago 12 years ago would that actually make more of Christ in your character but he must let them intensify don't be discouraged by the intensification of your storms and your trials but rather let the intensifying testify God can trust you with more now than ever before amen but also know that when he gets ready sis when he gets ready the wings of heaven will come by your way and bring the Deliverance that you need and then you can look look back and say well I could have never went through that 5 years ago I could have never went through this and that and the other don't you understand it means you're growing in God and your love Satan is always questioning you the question of your life about your Christianity is your love and his love and he'll tell you he don't love you he don't care for you he don't love you you don't love him you make don't you see his whole thing it's about your love life as you believe you become love and love is God and you begin to wind yourself into Christ and these other things you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves there's no desire to do it the worshipper having Purge no more conscience the desire of sin Hebrews 9 the worshipper once purged you see what I mean when the worshipper is purged when he's born again when he's old nature dies and a new nature sets in then he becomes a part of God a Son of God he gets new life and the Greek word Dar zoi which means the life of God and you become an offspring of God and God cannot hurt you without hurting himself you see what I mean let to stand together let me share this one with you that I read it to you last Sunday but it is just so powerful God is a lover God is love God so loved the world when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable here it is God wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking thirsting hungering trying to get to some of your starchy Hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law but a love it's all in love God so loved God is looking and trying and moving and begging and persuading to find a little heart that he can come into and coup and make love to him praise God can I read one more yes I have your permission you ain't goingon to get mad at me right Brothers Let's skip down to this next one I want you to notice the title of this sermon where I think Pentecost failed if it ever gets to a place that I couldn't put my arm around any brother that's working for the kingdom of God and recognize him as my brother I fear I'm backslid wow how sad it's becoming we're so divided and if we're not careful we'll disagree with this brother on that and that one on that and that one on that I'm cutting them off I ain't have nothing to do with them now that is that what brother Bram said well first cut them off from fellowship then we'll cut him off well he don't believe what the prophet said that's just the question about it he just don't believe what the prophet said he ain't no brother he ain't born of the [Music] word you see I asked y'all for your permission and you told me yeah it was a loaded gun right now you imagine brother Brenham saying that if he could not take a hold of a brother put his arm around him and recognize him as my brother I feel I'm backslid I'd be scared to stand on the platform and face evil spirits to know that I had Envy in my heart against any brother no matter who he is that's trying to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ or live a Christian Life if we disagree a million miles now think about how sensitive we are if we know somebody we're just two miles apart on theology we won't have nothing to do with them and if it was to go 10 miles I'm going to muster up all the grace I got I'm going to go 10 miles what about a million disagree a million miles upon theology if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother and it's my sister and we've draw those lines and if you can't love your brother who you've seen how can you love God you you've never seen old brother listen this church when love goes out God goes with it I want the correct theology don't you yeah I want the correct Doctrine but also want the right Spirit right and you can never get anywhere without Divine love and as You Love one another you love God and Word of Life Church said and Word of Life Church said help me Lord help me Lord God bless you let's bow our heads together thank you Lord Jesus thank thank you Lord for your word how many of you here today just by the raising of your hand no one looking around Lord I believe what I've heard is the truth but I need help with it father I need help what's becoming what your your word says I raise my hands Lord Jesus father we do love you today you know our hearts and I want Want to Love You Lord not as Donnie Reagan thinks you want to be loved when I married my wife over 51 years ago I wasn't a woman of course so I didn't think like a woman I didn't know how to love a woman so I made up in my mind as just a boy if I'm going to love her I'm going to have to understand her I'm going to have to listen when she doesn't know I'm listening I I want to have to listen to her wishes and her desires and what what she wants in life what she doesn't like in life I think you help me to do that Lord so I could be the right kind of a husband and as I look back I realize that's what you did to us so you had to become one of us to understand how could David forfeit a kingdom for adultery how could Moses be kept out of the land because of temper so you took on humanity and its Frailty and weakness to understand us the prophet gives us a little analogy of a of a story that a great king one day come to those in his court and said today you see me for your last time for quite a long time oh great king they said where will you go are you leaving us are you going somewhere else he said no no I I'll still be here but you just won't see me like this he said I want to understand my people better so I can serve them better so I want to chop wood with the wood Chopper want a plant with the planter and went through the list of things that he wanted to do so early the next morning they brought in these poppers G garments and the king the people watch as he lays aside his crown his Royal diadem and then watch him put on the clothes of a common man man and the prophet took that little analogy and said that was you you wanted to understand us so you become a man and you were tempted by women tempted by drinking tempted in all porns like we are even prayed in the garden father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me oh Jesus help us Lord I confess it before you and this people today it is not in my Humanity to love this way and I will say it about them it is not in their Humanity but that's the great thing you don't demand that we do it with our human love but with Theos and even when we receive Theos we must still die to our Humanity so the Theos can live out of us so Lord Lord God we're requesting now help us Lord no doubt many of these people have been born again they have the Holy Ghost Lord they may still battle with that old flesh but may Jesus live out of us as we get closer to the body change the prophet tells us in sort when he describes that translation he said I believe the people who go in the Rapture will be something like that before they go go Lord we got some moving up to do we got some dying to do help us Lord Jesus Oh Praise the Lord amen I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to is that your desire today there's just no more to give I want to love love to there's just no more love I could never ever out love [Music] maybe close our eyes raise our hands sing it together I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to kill I want to love let me love more till there's just no more love I could never ever out love the Lord once again I want to live the way Jesus would live out of my body live out of your body I want you until there's just no more to give I want to love love to this no more love I could never ever I love the Lord would you turn around shake hands with the person standing there by you and tell ask them would you pray for me I need more of that love would you pray for me brother Jackie will you pray for me my my brothers and sisters will you pray for me I need more of that love how many can say the same thing I need more of that love oh yeah I want more Supernatural I want more Revelation I want more understanding but with all my getting I want more love I want to love oh Hallelujah love the unlovable can't you say it's impossible for us to do that it's not in us it's not in us we love the lovable and we judge people well I can love them because and then we have the list but God looked at us and said I love you so much I want to make you lovable now that he's made us lovable the war begins on who gets our love read Ezekiel 16 see what God did to Israel you'll see a parallel of yourself you'll see a parallel to the church ages he found us we were unlovable we were wretched oh the temperament awful awful absolutely awful that we had and he made us lovable oh changed us and then the devil says oh she's very lovable now I would like to have her for my own but we say to Satan today no way devil he made us this way and he's going to get back the way he made us let's just worship him a little before we go shall we let's sing it together again oh I want to live the way he wants me to live close your eyes once more if you would l just meditate now it may be after one Sunday morning service like this that the Trump shall sound and our loved ones which have gone on Wow wouldn't it be awesome if they start joining back in church together with us and we're singing maybe a song and all of a sudden we go to hearing a multitude of voices and we're thinking where is that coming from and we look and see there's brother so and so their sister so and so and we know it won't be long will be changed I want to [Music] live the way he wants me or granted Lord was all my getting Lord let me get more love father not love the compromises not love oh Lord that let sin in cuz true love won't do that but real love real love may we be men and women of love may that be our Dwelling Place not a temporary visit to the Land of Love Not Just twice a week we dwell in love but may we live there on Monday and Tuesday every day out of the week oh I want to live the way he wants me to live God bless you Saints love you and the Lord go in the fear of God there just no more I can give I want to love love to there's just no no more love for I could never ever out love the Lord oh I want to live the way

praise the Lord we've got so much to thank him for don't we amen now made something I mention to you just a minute ago back on May the 5th of last year um many of you probably remember uh my niece's husband Dennis flynner they rolled him in here in a wheelchair how many of you remember that him coming in and prayer was made well he was he was a very rare case of some very bad sicknesses uh mop fibrosis I hope I got that that right I don't know if I did or not and vexus syndrome a very rare immune disease that affects the bone maror a stem cell transplant was decided that it was the best route for treatment Dennis received the transplant and the doctors deemed it a complete success now the they're going to show you a picture or two of Dennis when he was rolled in here and the prayer that was made so Brethren if you'll do that for me you can see the the pictures there on the screen very sick man he was deemed one in a million his survival chances were were just very very slim very slim and if you go to the prayer now that was prayed for him that day I me like to be remember today would you just raise your heads with me it's brother Dennis Fleer maybe some of y'all don't know him sister Sandy bag's brother-in-law he's been dealing with cancer and now he's got another situation going on in his body we're just asking God to be merciful to him today heavenly father it's written in your word they will lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover dear God you see the diagnosis of the doctors have given to him Lord they're doing everything they know to do to try to treat him then Lord these other places coming up on his body you see how it's affected him Lord something that the doctors have just recently diagnosed and even found out about we're told in the last days that there'd be such things released on the earth that cancer would look like a toach but Lord God no matter how many diseases they find your blood Lord Jesus atones in your stripes has already paid the price We join our faith together father in the name of Jesus would you be merciful to our brother today Father touch his body Lord in obedience to your word we lay our hands on him

up drunk Affairs fornication fils today they can't hard to get out of bed some of them won't get out of bed cuz he had an overdose went out into eternity to meet God but God has allowed us to fill a pull yes which seems crazy to the people who live in the natural world because what they're drawn to is things they can see and shoot up in their arm and drink and and we say we're in love with this being that none of us have ever even seen him I've never reached out and actually touched him like that and yet he has turned my world upside down oh yeah and if he's this good and visible I can't wait till I get to see him can you praise the Lord are there Zach and sister Susanna if they'll bring her little son Ezra will'll dedicate him to the Lord today praise the lording bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jes let's just B it together heavenly father is a whole little Ezra in my arms today I think of his nam's sake what a great man Ezra and the scripture turned out to be I pray father as my brother and sister bring their little Ezra into your presence Lord Jesus would you help him would you help them I know most of the time whenever I dedicate a baby I don't just pray for the baby but I pray for the parents because I realize a lot of what this child in my arms will become will be greatly to do with what they teach him not only by words but by actions Behavior attitude so father I ask you to be with them today Lord You've add added another one to their quiver another little boy I pray father that you'd give them wisdom and strength to be able to know how to raise him nurturing teaching in the ways of God may always have a longing to go to the house of God to clap his little hands and sing and worship you what a better way could there be to bring up our children singing loving worshiping Jesus when we see our nation how low it's gone that they're trying to change little boys into girls and little girls into boys and our government into the state that it's in the rotness how we're longing for a new kingdom to come upon the Earth Jesus but until that hour arrives we accept our challenge I dedicate little Ezra to you today Father watch over him keep him from the evils the sicknesses diseases of the day we dedicate his life to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus amen he woke [Applause] up God bless you let's Stand Together shall we be a trust trustee meeting after service today back at my office with the brothers if they would um also I want to mention something else to you before we read in the in the scripture today there's a little something that I'd like to do for our our U smaller children before we built this new facility here we had a playground and things out here on the grounds and of course we had to take it up whenever we did all the constru instruction and we haven't put anything back for our children and I'd like to um be able to put something back for them as you can tell I'm a little bit old to be slinging and sliding and all that sort of thing but we've got different things for different age categories and we've got different things over in the fellowship hall for some of the older ones so I just wanted to make mention that to you we might lift an offering in a couple of weeks or something I just wanted to make that known to you that before whenever we had had um other stuff that we had we built it out of treated lumber and um a lot of folks had to have splinters pull out their hands and their arms and the legs and this and that I can tell but looking some of them here today they've had them before so I don't want to do that this time I want to get something that'll be nice for them something that'll hold up for a long time um and my kids and my grandkids both are beyond the age of needing them so I'm not doing it for no personal reasons okay and I I can assure you the day you see Carol and I out there on them call 911 so I'm not doing it for me or doing it for my kids or grandkids but I would like for our smaller children to be able to have something so you just uh think about that in a couple weeks or so we will U we will lift an offering for that let's um turn to Second Peter chapter 1 again today if you would the right to be in divine order what a blessed thing it is Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue let me read again now the meaning of the word add because the King James version doesn't kind of render the right thought of it but it means Minister nourishment to supply furnish ministered unto or assisted so in the Greek it's in the possession of your faith Minister virtue so it's like each one of these virtues that are attained it becomes a stepping stone to another to another to another until we arrive to that image that God desires us to be verse 6 un to knowledge Temperance and Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity how may Lu to be remembered today as we pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your precious word I wonder how many sermons have been preached on these things over the years since Peter wrote it over 2,000 years ago inspired by the spirit of God yet I think I can say it without any hesitancy there was never a greater sermon preached on it than what you placed upon your prophet's heart in this end time that he would entitle it the stature of a perfect man Paul never mentioned these words in consecutive order that Peter did and as my studies of have led me down through different ministries of the church ages I've not found any others that dealt with it quite this way so we believe there must be something that you've reserved for a portion of this for our day with that comes great responsibility but we're not just going to stress out over the responsibility but we're going to focus on the responsibility but also the Fulfillment of it help us today I pray father speak to us the words of Life In The Name Of The Lord Jesus and the saints of God said amen amen God bless you I'm going to be praying wearing this prayer cost today so we keep that on our hearts for our brother Bernie as well God's plan is so simple and yet it can be so profound that the mind of man just simply misses it because of the way that God goes about bringing it and to think that God would even deal with us is overwhelming to me and all of our failures and all of our mistakes and shortcomings and yet to think that his greatest accomplishment and achievement Through the Ages I've often wondered as we gather around him in eternity and we're there praising and worshiping and adoring and we know that the prophet told us that heaven is actually going to be a continuation of this same life it was kind of a must have been a puzzling thing to to the people as they wondered what it would be and the prophet would drop statements for us here and there to let us know that you say brother Brandon will I love my wife and he said oh yes more than you do now and she will be something that was just be yours so it won't be like children and many people get the false false conception because the sixth Dimension and the way it was like when the prophet was there and he saw his wife come up to him and he said I'm going to see what she says and whenever she came up she said oh my precious brother and somehow people think in their mind oh so that's the way it's going to be for those that are Eternal mates it'll never be like like you were in this life that you were special but remember that's in the sixth Dimension but whenever he walked up before the Throne of God for rewards one wife slipped her hand in one side the other wife slipped her hand in the other side and they walked down together before the Throne of God to be able to get the reward of what they did so if Heaven is a continuation of this same life I don't think we'll be floating around on cloud CLS singing playing Harps and you know funny looking guitars and different things like that but we're going to live we're going to enjoy life it was astounding to me when I first heard the future home and question an 64 which followed it and then a couple more services thereafter that heaven will consist of parks and avenues and streams and fountains and trees and we will actually eat in that glorified body and the fruits and the leaves on the trees will be eaten by the inhabitants of the city so the fruits will actually change every 30 days and yet the leaves will be for the healings of the Nations so the people will come in and pull off a leaf from the tree of life and they will hand one another a leaf and say brother at one time we Ward against one another and we were we were enemies but God has restored peace so when we think that God's great achievement is not to turn us all into angels I was never made an angel I'll never be one now I have an angel but I will never become an angel you see my angel is my theophany and that theophany one day will become in me as the complete unit but I will never fly around with wings on my back I was not made to be an angel I was made to be a man but I have a sophony which is my Angelic representation of deity and when you think about what God is doing we look at it in this life and we see so much faults and so much imperfection all around us everywhere and you you realize that no matter how full of the Holy Ghost people are they still have their flaws and the Saints said and we still have people that let's be honest that we love and we go to church with and maybe even members of our family we may never totally like everything about everybody that we go to church with you can go ahead and say it that's all right it's just the way that it is it's just the facts but one day everything about each of us that are that is not very likable will be changed and it won't just be the other people that like should be you too because there's things about every one of us that just aren't very good they just aren't very likable and things that God wants to change and if we're not careful we get our focus on our spiritual walk with God just on those natural things and that becomes the measure by which we measure our Christianity so we hold up the spiritual measure in tape and we're measuring all these flaws and all these faults and all these mistakes and you are never going to get to a place in lifee where you're going to be free from them and the prophet even tells us about people that create a certain atmosphere and he said they're nice people they're good people but he said you just don't enjoy being around them because of that atmosphere that they create but can you imagine living in a world where there'd be Millions times millions of people and there will never be anyone that you'll ever shun there'll never be anyone that you'll kind of just walk real fast because they're coming in the entrance back there and you'll walk a little bit faster so you don't have to run into them now I'm just saying that you know just in case I'm just throwing that out in case anybody here does that I know you all are so sweet and such Little Darlings ain't nobody does that yeah right but you know it's all of us that there's something about us in our human makeup that will never reach that great place of compatibility until eternal life totally engulfs our humanity and our humanity is finally changed so when we're looking at the stature of a perfect man a son and daughter of God that is in a Rapture Ready condition or those that will go before the Rapture and go by the way of the grave now you may be wondering if you're following through some of these sermons and listening to them what about those that have already gone and those that we've had many in our church that have already went by the way of the Grave where will they fit brother Donnie did they arrived to that place yes the elect of God arrived at that place before they left this world but remember much of the preaching that will continue on years after they're gone is not just supplementing us in our spiritual walk with God but it's giving us the spiritual sust and strength that we need my daughter Erica no longer needs to hear sermons preached about faith and sermons about forgiveness sermons about love and sermons about things like that but I still meet them because I'm still dealing with human beings you all need them how many still needs to hear forgiveness preached how many needs more forgiveness in your heart so all of those Saints before the Lord takes them they arrive to that spot and then they're able to be sealed away into the kingdom of God but also into the church AGS that they live now remember the Lord will never take one of his elect seed from this Earth before they have arrived and the last few days of their life might be the finishing touches that they need or the last few weeks I've seen it so many times myself and watch as the children of God are are losing losing life and they're coming down to that spot and you just watch and as a pastor me knowing things about them and in my heart be troubled about certain things about them and be praying for them of course and if I feel in my heart to say something to him and watch God one after another after another take care of that little something that's lacking in their life and in their walk with God because he is not going to do a halfway job on any of his children you have that confidence in him I have it not on in it for me but I have it for you as well so he's going to do whatever we La so as we're looking at this don't look at it as it's absolutely totally impossible it's not and the hard part is being able to differentiate between us measuring the flawed human part and the Soul part which will be able to manifest every one of these attributes that God wants and I I find it amazing as the prophet would bring this that he would bring different parallels of the scripture and he would kind of cross the types back and forth and he would bring it as it was a body he would bring it as it was a natural body it's also a m mystical body and here in Statue of a perfect man he says this is the house that God dwells in not a body with a big Bell on the top of it and a high steeple but a body H has thou prepared me now in the natural sense we had all kinds of issues when we were building this building right here we had all types of stipulations and I honestly think the city made new laws is we was building this building because they made things made us do this and do that and the other and it seemed like every inspector that we dealt with had his own agenda against us and they made us do certain things that the Builders said they had never seen anybody else be required to do well if they made it hard on us because of who we were God will make them answer the day of judgment for that but I see that as also in the spiritual sense that there's certain things now before we could move in here and they would give us the final inspection and what is known as a certificate of occupancy and they gave that to I guess brother Michael was the one that got it he gave it to me laid it on my desk oh it was an absolute Victory whenever I walked in the office and I saw it laying there with our name on it and the date and so on and so on and they gave us the official certificate of occupancy and our building was rated to be able to seat 1,1 people now that was all wonderful and all but you know what it gave us a right to do to be able to no longer meet to work on it no long longer to meet and paint it and lay carpet and lay stone but it actually gave us the legal right to where we could meet hundreds of us at one time and that way the city would come by and they wouldn't throw us out and shut us down now this is what we're looking for and our certificate of occupancy from the presence of God now all along there have been brothers that was meeting all times of building contractors trainers electrician you know men doing different types of things in the screens and the audio and the video all kinds of people were coming and going so it wasn't like that there were not human beings that were in this building and some of us I can tell you it felt like we were living here because we were here from before daylight there was days I showed up here at 4:00 in the morning and I wouldn't leave till 600 or 7:00 at night and yet it felt like I was living here Carol felt like I was living here but it wasn't really my permanent residence but everything I was doing it was getting it closer to that day when we could open for the first time and we could invite the presence of God but we could also invite you to be able to come and we wouldn't be worried about somebody from the city showing up and say you all can't do this well you see that's where we are now we're in this stage to where God has started this work inside of us and many of you go back and listen to the Statue of a perfect man Blasphemous names a few excerpts from the ordination of the minister also why against organized religion some of the different places that the prophet would refer to this and it might make you wonder well where am I on this chart where am I on this statue of a perfect man and I don't mind telling you every time that I knew that the inspectors was going to come in it was a nervous day for me because it seemed like everything we'd take care of that'd always come back with something else and this needed to be done this way they come in and we thought we had all these panels just exactly right now you don't know it but run in behind all of these walls are all types of plumbing and all types of different things they were so nice but the city and Spectre come in and made us redo it so we had to cut holes in it you see this so Square panel right here got a little tiny piece of tape down on the bottom of it that was a code violation so we had to be able to redo it and then they would write off well then we'd meet their great specific desire and would come in and brother Phil and his crew did all the handrails and they come in and looked at them they done a tremendous job look beautiful they come in and look at them and say that won't work it's got to be done this way and this way and this way you don't what we had to do redo every one of them so they come in and we fix this and then they find something else and they fix that and they find something else that's the way it is in our lives you know so I said why don't they just come in and give us a list and we'll do it all at one time and be done but you know what I found out that ain't the way they do it they want you to fix this and then they come back you fix that you know as I've been looking at this I realize that God does us in a very similar way brother Rudy that we fix this in our life and then God come in and expecting said yeah you're looking good so here's another list and you say my Lord I thought I was expecting my certificate of occupant he said oh no no you're a good way from the capping it you're work in progress and you already have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's already immersed you into that m IAL part but these things are living out of you so it starts off of course with the the new birth and it begins then with the very first one that is there is Faith and you cannot believe in any of these things without faith being there and then one's Faith becomes a a dominant force and a dominant power in your life not only to save you but to heal you but to deliver you and this is the thing about faith that Faith's understand understands that God says yes and Faith also understands God says sometimes wait a while Faith also understands that God says no sometimes now emotional faith gets tore all to pieces When God says no emotional faith will absolutely destroy an individual whenever they are expecting a yes but God gives them a resounding no but real Faith believes him even when he says no because they know he knows more about it than they do and the church said now we've all had nose have we not and no doubt we'll get more of them and I've got to be honest you know I I don't like the nose as well initially whenever he gives them because we have anticipation for yeses and we're looking at yeses and thinking in our mind and our heart that the yes is always bringing more Glory but that's not necessarily the truth sometimes NOS will actually bring him more Glory because a no leads into many many weeks or months of Trials of misunderstandings and trying to you know figure it all out in our mind and when we're going through what seems like a rejection of a no because just be honest a no from God seems like a rejection but sometimes it's actually a greater display of his glory than had he brought it with a yes and the church said amen now if we start out with faith which comes from the spirit of God giving us the ability if any person comes to God they first must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now watch I I I've never found were brother brandom ever liken this again because it's quite astounding because he's quoting the scripture that referred to the Lord Jesus and it was of the prophet of the Old Testament where that he prophesied and said lo I come in the volume of the book and lo a body hast thou prepared me so he quotes this and he said a body has thou prepared me a body that God can dwell in so now he takes that Prophecy of the Lord Jesus and runs a parallel to his bride so as the Lord Jesus was the body the human body that God could walk in so this is what we call the son of God then God walked in the Son of God so God was made a son in the flesh of the Lord Jesus and then he applies this same scripture then on down to the extension of that which is the body of the Lord Jesus so now where is is the Corporal body of Jesus of course it's on the throne of God so you believe Jesus has eyes on the earth you believe Jesus has hands on the earth well where are they here's two of them there's two more there's two more there's two more you believe Jesus have has got mouths on the earth how many want your mouth to be his what about ears What About Eyes what about the ability maybe sometimes just to put your arms around a brother and just let him know that you love him and that you're praying for him you understand what that is that can be Jesus that can be Jesus I I'll never forget it there was a man that used to attend our church years and years ago and he he came into the office one day back at the old place and he he wanted to talk to me and uh you know the conversation that he and I had it didn't go really good because he he he believed some different types of things and kind of strange things but I I've sitting there praying and I said Lord please help me help me to have the right attitude help me to be able to to to let this man exceed the real love of God and as we finished our discussion and he didn't change me and it was eite I didn't change him but as we finish the discussion I said brother you mind if I shake your hand before you go and he said no no that's fine brother so I took him by the hand and as I did I was just praying God please help me emanate your presence in such a way that this man will feel enveloped in your being as I took him by the hand like this and I put my arm around him he was taller than me but I I pulled him kind of close to me and I just stood there with him you know with my arms around him and he he broke down and started crying and he he told someone else from the from our church sometime later he said I've been in the presence of God since I was a child I've shouted I've spoken tongues I've told all different manifestations of this that and the other but he said I have never and my entire walk with God felt such a presence and it was like it was coming from brother Donnie now you know I cannot do that you know no human being can do that but I saw in my heart once to come back to me uh quite sometime later what greater thing could you and I do as the people of God that for the Lord Jesus now Donnie Reagan don't have any presence aren't that I'm not a great person I don't have an aura about me that's really wonderful and fine and all that sort of thing but what I desire is that people can be able to know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and that though people might differ with you and I now you know I I guess for me looking at it I could have thought that it would have been a greater happening had it been a more pleasant type of conversation and it would have been something that would have just been rejoicing and fellowshipping but that wasn't really the way that it went no neither of us were argumented or anything like that but yet it just you know it just wasn't quite in the way that I wish it would have been but the Lord wanted to cap off a negative type of situation but he wanted to cap it off with his presence now I had the spirit of God and I believe that brother had the spirit of God but God wanted to cap off that meeting with something that would change that brother's life and I don't mind to be honest with you every time I talk about it and it's been years and years ago I still feel that's something inside of me I'm feeling it right now as I'm talking about it because it was a presence of God quite unlike anything I'd ever experienced before myself I've shouted and Run and Jump and dance and done all types of emotional Outburst but it was is as if though someone had embodied me for a few moments using my mouth using my arm my hand to embrace this brother and you know my my friends I desire more than anything in my life for for that to be something that is so prevalent in my life I've seen God heal the sick I've seen God perform Mighty Miracles and signs and wonders and I love every one of them and I thank God for that but to me there's something about his person that I value even more than I do those signs and wonders and miracles I love gifts I thank God for the gifts but yet I don't just want the gifts I want the life of the gifts as well because we've all seen people that would manifest gifts and then know what kind of life that they lived outside the word and that right that it wasn't even the spirit of God so sure let's have the gifts let's let's use the gifts that God gives us but let's not leave out the most important part which is the very life and essence of God's Own nature after all when we get to heaven when we go beyond the curtain of time for those of us who will go there before the Resurrection The Prophet never mentioned one person beyond the curtain of time that spoke in tongues he never mentioned one person that had a dream or a vision one person that interpreted one person that prophesied and all the references that I found and cross reference back back and forth he never mentioned anything about the display of the gifts why in the sixth Dimension they didn't need them but what was the predominant Factor Divine love perfect love oh now this is why I know it stumbles some people in the message it shouldn't really but brother brandham said that he he longed for the time when the gifts would be laid up on the shelf and the love of God would Comm in the church and just take the church over he was not against gifts my goodness he preached many many sermons after he said that in 1956 I believe it was about the necessity of the gifts in the church but yet he focused on what was the priority of getting Divine love then if we get Divine love then the gifts that'll flow through it to the Avenue of divine love how many want more that in your life now what God wants us to be is a body a body has thou prepared me a body that God can dwell in God can walk in God can see in God can talk in God can work in amen living instrumentality of God God walking on two feet in you the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of God God walking in you for ye are written Epistles read of all men and if the life that is if it's in Christ be in you it'll bear the life that Christ bore is that right notice again he said now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in notice what happens whenever we come to him now remember there's three step stages of the new birth that is justification by faith sanctification of the spirit and the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now I can become a little bit confusing now because there was a Pentecostal age before the token life now for those of you that were never there it might seem very unusual to you and you've heard me say it before that I believe I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost whenever I was a child many of you some of you I should say come from Pentecost and no doubt you received something from the presence of God when you were in Pentecost because our life changed but yet unlike others who've come to the message and believed all they needed was a change in their theology I believe that I needed a furthering of my experience in God to match the message I believe that I'm I was missing something in Pentecost and I found out what it was it was the token which is not exactly the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the true baptism in the Holy Ghost in the true realm which is the realm of the Soul now whenever brother brandham is laying this out remember that he starts out with the new birth what you also have to keep in mind now in this time frame in 1962 he's still believing and of the mindset that the new birth is you receiving Christ as your savior amen testing 1 2 3 1 2 3 come on friends let's let him advance in his understand let's let him advance in his Revelation before God now look I do not compare what the prophet said to what I believe I compare what the prophet said to what the prophet said okay okay not what I believe I'm not interested in your opinion I'm not interested in what you think I'm interested in what he said but I am going to compare what he said to what he said and if I see that he grew I have no problem what whatsoever and preaching that gross and I have no problem in preaching it to you and preaching it in the message I know people don't like it when you do it but I'm called to preach the message and if I can't preach it all I ain't going to preach none of it amen so I'm going to preach gross I'm going to preach it right there because he himself did now watch so whenever the new birth and reality comes to us now he says we put the blood of Jesus Christ that brings the face of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ so it's not my faith it's not your faith it's not your virtue but if we're not careful when we read this in Peter it will be like it's something that we actually do then I have to make myself have virtue and I'm the one who does it it's not mine it's his well if it is his how can I add in the way that King James says it how can I add which we would think something exterior of of oursel and we get it we work into it whatever it is we do and we get it and we physically add it to us and we do it ourself how can I add the faith of Jesus Christ how can I add the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge the temperance how can I do that I cannot but if I acknowledge my need of it and I see my need I open my life before him and say Lord I need more faith how many can say that today Lord I need more faith I need more virtue I need more knowledge I need more tempers well what are you doing you're coming to the first stage of God being able to step from Faith to Virtue to knowledge to Temperance to Godliness all these virtues that God himself wants to add an us now remember he says in this that there are some of these are nature given so there are some people that by Nature they just have an element of virtue and they could just help people you seen people like that and they they didn't even have the Holy Ghost but they had a feeling for Humanity and whenever they saw people in need whatever it was all their their heart their human heart it was just so so pulled upon and they would they would Minister to them whatever it is that they had what is that nature given virtue there could be a nature given knowledge a nature given Temperance but still I don't want nature given there's some people that's just nice you know they're just nice naturally and there's others they just don't have a good makeup but God wants to make them have a good makeup now you see that person who is nice naturally it'll be very easy for them to think they've got these when in reality they don't because they were born that way but this does not come by your first verse but rather your second one so the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ is allowing his faith his virtue his Temperance his knowledge his godliness his brotherly kindness to flow out of us and then he himself the person caps us off the Capstone is what himself after his virtues has manifested thems in us and they will become to where you said Brother Don what are they going to do control you control you so God will allow you in negative circumstances and when your faith runs to its end then the faith of Jesus Christ will step in and help you to believe what you didn't have faith enough to believe for and maybe your virtue would run out and yet something Beyond you would automatically step in and you would start ministering virtue and strength beyond your own capability oh oh my goodness some of you is going to realize it's already been happening to your Shores the world and where did you get it at not from you so it was oh I'm going to pray more I'm going to read my Bible more that's good you do need to do that but that's not the way you're going to get more virtue you're going to get it by seeing what it is and allowing your ability to see I'm short I'm I'm short of what I need oh God lord Jesus live your virtue out of me me live your godliness out of me get your eyes off of preachers get your eyes off of ministry and so well they're going to do it all no no listen some of you Ley you may never cast out a devil in your entire life you may never Lay Your Hands on a cancer Pati and curse that cancer and watch God heal them yeah you may never ever stand in a prayer line and pray for hundreds of people and watch God heal them but there's one thing every one of you can do and must do you must let the statue of a perfect man flow out of your life remember Sister Florence Shar she went to Brother Brenham and she said brother Brenham I fasted and prayed and fasted and prayed that God would let me cast out Devils he said sister you were not called to do this but you were called to fast and pray for those who's called to do it and you say well what can I do what can I do and and some of you think in your mind well it's not really that much are you kidding me I'm talking about you becoming a habitation for almighty God and you think that's not wonderful you think that is not one of the most tremendous mendous things that could ever oh but brother doy what about sign his wonders there will be people that will walk before him that day and say I cast out devils in your name I heal the sick I've done this and that and he'll turn and say to them depart from me you worker of ini nickle I never even knew you but there won't be one son or daughter of God that will stand before him that had these virtues in their life that will ever be turned away it's totally impossible Oh my he is the head that controls you your feet is the foundation face amen controll by the head you see it takes the people there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses Miracles when he possesses gifts shouting running oh I believe in all that don't you I love doing it when it comes here's the perfect man of God the one who possesses these virtues God represents his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to bring his son to go in that bride he's also brought the bride through these ages till he brings one complete Church into this now remember this is the the pyramid the stature of a perfect man my feet moves why because my head says so now it can't move like my hand because it's my feet lucer can't do the things that we did neither can the Methodist because they were something else see the feet moves because the head says so and the head never says now feet you become hands watch the spirit of God will never lead you and I into a place that we're not called and qualified to do that's the spirit of God will always lead you into your position and that is he will magnify the presence of God in your being to help you fulfill what you were called to be and don't you accept this today friends is something that's not very great I'm talking about something that the smallest portion of humanity that you can ever imagine will ever be able to attain to what you're hearing today and you think you're not doing much you think you're not called for much you're less than one in a million I guarantee you that for God to be able to manifest himself in this now once he said this being when it's completed is the Church of God going to the rapture and this being when completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the Rapture so his Focus oh my is building a house for God the being the individuals that come to this PO our bride material Rapture Ready amen word fed spirit filled so when you're surrendering notice now he doesn't put past tense that you surrendered one time as each one of these virtues becomes a stepping stone for the other you are actually giving more of yourself away the first stepping stone being face but that is altogether different than virtue so you surrender that element of yourself that tries to diagnose everything and try to figure it out from your mind and and make sense of it all oh you let that go and you let Faith his faith come in and it displaces all your intellect if it goes contrary to the word and then it gives you the energia which is the Greek word to be able to strengthen you as now okay you're doing doing good on faith now God wants you to take the next step all right so now here you are you moved up onto this step of virtue which is still very small very very tiny and you may not even know that it's there yet but God will arase opportunities by which you're able to minister virtue sometimes it might be in word form sometimes it might be by cooking a meal for somebody sometimes it might be by coming in and just putting your arm around them and praying for them brother sister I know you're through such a hard time I love you so much and just want you to know I'm standing with you and you don't even realize but from your being just left some of the strengths of Jesus Christ now I know it's hard for you to understand it I've told you about it before but whenever you're having a prayer line I know some of you have looked at me it's like what in the world you know you pray for four or five people and all of a sudden one comes soon it's they just knock your lights out and there'll be other times you'll pray for you know just all kinds of people and never do it you know and all you are is like a channel like this microphone this microphone could have wound up in a rock and roll concert it could have wound up in a symphony and be be used for whatever more the microphone ain't nothing but it's what the person that gets it and the words that are coming forth of this microphone demons have been cast out through this piece of metal right here Devils have been made to leave the children of God through this microphone this microphone itself it has no power it has no ability no more than I do but what are we were channels by which the supernatural God can manifest himself and one person come through happened you know a month and a half two months ago praying for someone in the church right there they walked up I laid my hands on them and started praying for them it's like they reached inside of my body and pulled every bit of the strength that I had out I wasn't even sure that I could even stand up as a matter of fact I fell sideways and some of the brothers see me car asked me sure she said Donnie what in the world happened I said I don't know I don't know I was doing great I was feeling good I was feeling fine and I said all of a sudden when that one person come up it's just right they reached in and pull that strength out of you oh but I'm glad there's strength there but you see God don't just want don't say oh brother Donnie ministers to the people no no don't think that oh well brother Donnie does brother Daryl does the ministers do God wants each of you Holy Ghost filled Christians God don't want me ministering to everybody God Wants You In Your Capacity whether by words as I said or by Deeds or you get up 3:00 in the morning you got a burden for brother Daryl or you got a burden for some Minister whoever it is and you're praying and praying and you get done and it feels like yours weak is a dish rag is we saying you say what in the world happened you broke into a realm with God and God took your fervency God took your faith and you gave your strengths in that moment of time to be able to minister prayer for someone in need oh tell what we want Saints notice this now he said this is the people that's going under Rapture so when you're surrendering your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues praise the Lord so every one of these wireless microphones that we have have to be set on a different frequency if not they will override one another they can produce static every one of these that you see are on a different frequency now whenever we order them we order them years ago and I'd order them I would order them on one frequency and get another and get another and try to keep up with all the different bands of it but now they've got them to where they're multiple bands and we can go in and select the frequency because sometimes the lights or maybe an amplifier or some type of electrical something will interfere with that frequency and I would get up to talk and there would be something in there and it wasn't a gargle in my throat it was something from the frequency but it doesn't mean the mic isn't working and it doesn't mean the batteries are dead and it doesn't mean it's not hooked up to the board back there but it simply means something got in the channel of the frequency and many of you are looking and think Lord do I have the Holy Ghost I don't know if I've got it or not oh no no it's not necessary that some of you do have the Holy Ghost you've just got too many things in the ways of your frequency oh my that's why the prophet tells us it's the father trying to make himself known to you but you let too many things in life get in the way now you see this is what God is Desiring for a bride and friends we're not just talking about us as our local assembly we're talking about God doing the same thing all over the entire Earth at the same time and at the same time when we come to this spot and we are kept off then God will call for the resurrection do you realize how imperative that this is there will be no Resurrection if God does not produce this in a body around the world right is anybody worried about it this morning you worried about it brother Philip what about brother Matthew you worried about that God ain't going to do it we get all uptight I ain't a bit more worried than a man in the moon my God said it my God will produce it oh but brother Donnie me that yeah me you I understand me you I ain't looking at me and you I ain't looking at our faults and our shortcomings I ain't looking at your temper I ain't looking at your lack of Brotherly kindness I'm looking at the promise of his word and his word says he's going to do it the word tells us through the message of the hour that there's going to be a people that's going to possess these things and I say Amen well I'm a long way from it well you may be but you ain't going to be because you're going to come to the promise of what God Said Hallelujah and if I got to get this measuring tape out every night for the next 57 years and preach on it every day and three times a week and start a 7-Day Revival once every three or four months we are going to arrive at this spot by the grace of God because God will not fail this word our Saints are waiting on us Paul is waiting on us Peter the man who wrote this in the Bible is waiting on [Applause] us when the Holy Spirit just pours through you oh Lord God maybe for those of you that have never experienced God using you you to pray over a person and then be healed some of them visibly right there in your eyes others Maybe by process of Divine Healing it's hard to explain what that does see and I've had God to do that for me brother John you other minister brother Joel Brown all you other brothers here whenever you you just know beyond a Shad of a doubt that work is done I mean it's so awesome whenever you stand there in that presence and you realize what God just did through your Humanity dust mere dust and you laid these dust fingers and dust muscles and dust Bones on a human body and God used your dust Mouse and you curse that demon and that demon leave it's so wonderful but I've seen some of them same people that that happened to get sick again so we're pointing to a direction in these virtues that are irreversible so a person can get their healing and lose it but Peter goes on to say about this if these things be in you you shall never fall you'll never fall short of the glory of God oh my goodness friends think how much greater in that sense to achieve these in our life sir then you're a living Tabernacle then people look out and say there's a man full of virtue knowledge believes the word Temperance patient godliness God brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian now this is common terms to us Christian we say it so much and we hear it on signs we see it everywhere Christian Christian Christian Christian you work with people that say they are Christians and they're devils and because it's so called to us it's not the value of it but whenever a person can say this about a real one there's nothing they could say any greater if you were a millionaire or a billionaire or a trillionaire if there was such a thing as that oh my oh my he's a billionaire you're might blow out your chest and say oh wow they're talking about me they're talking about me but depend depends on which way the stock market goes and what else Trump shuts down and whatever Doge does this and that and the other you may be rich today who knows what you going to be tomorrow but if you ever get this right here for 10,000 times 10,000 of years you'll still be going down the streets of Glory saying praise be to God every time you walk out that City and turn around and come back in you will see your own image and the reflection of the house you live in when you walk outside them City Gates and turn right back around and God sent you over to Afghanistan or aler or wherever he sends you on the king's business amen and you turn right around and come back into that City and there's the 12 foundation and there's that Great Pyramid City you know what you'll see you'll see your own life you'll see the grace of God because you're going to live in the same oh Hallelujah geometric design that God designed in your soul oh you say but how much perfect love do I need he'll give you just exactly the measure that you need for the glory of God oh my the thing of it is just let it start flowing yes sir my there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier person you're sealed and the seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming they'll see the seal just the same there you are what a man or woman possess this then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost and remember the Dynamics of this church will be the Capstone again which we've had in part while The Headstone has been descending a refilling I'm glad there's refilling aren't you now look the spirit of God is going to seal us into the economy of God thank you Lord Jesus watch this then the word coming from here manifest itself through each of these beings and makes it complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what Christ was these people are because his life is in here they are in Christ and their life is dead and hid in Christ to God sealed in there Glory by the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12 you reckon yourself dead then you're born of Faith then virtue and all these other things has added to you to you're a perfect living image of God thank you Lord you you don't want to be a replica of me I don't want to be a Rec of of brother Tim PR I love him me my brother with all my heart brother Ron Spencer many of these preacher brothers friends of mine all around the world I don't want to be a replica of brother Daryl I love brother darl I appreciate him but I would be settling for so much less than what God wants me to be me brother Daryl striving for the same image I don't want to be like brother darl brother darl don't want to be like me but we both want to be like Jesus and that's exactly the same thing that every one of you l ity we all stand on the same Plateau when it comes to this no doubt no doubt I will minister to Mo in virtue and brother Daryl and some of these other brothers but you can have your own dose of virtue isn't that wonderful then God through that has brought also seven Church agents to show the seven steps that he brought this building his individual Into His Image that's built a complete Church in His image at the resurrection this complete body will be raised up to live with him forever because it's a bride so that cuts in every age every age so there's things who could say about Paul's age who could to say about the second age and the third age and the fourth age so brother Donnie if I get saved and I start out being born again and I get Faith and that's everything I need faith will lead to Virtue because your faith alone needs the accompaniment of virtue to help you keep from being selfish the rest of your Christian Life and using your face for yourself sir thank we are a body as your virtues need each other to compliment you so do we need each other in the body thank God for pastors amen thank God for evangelists too is that right thank God for other aspects of the ministry we thank God for every one of them but where would we be today had God not sent a prophit in this age with some message don't we thank God for that as well thank God for pastors but what's real true pastors of the end time preaching the message of the hour brought by a Vindicated Prophet so the prophet would bring it in a certain way a pastor would bring it in another way you know an evangelist would bring it in another way but if they're all B with the spirit of God they're saying the exact same thing now watch he said so you get it these people who died in here millions of them they died under the virtue of faith in the first church age and then virtue knowledge Temperance godliness all these things but it wasn't like they was complete within thems did they have the spirit of God in each one yes how many knows L Luther had a portion of the spirit of God but he drank beer smoked a pipe well he said glory to God I can no you can't you're living in a different age you can't drink nothing stronger than Pepsi come on well glory to God lucier made it that was his age that was where he was at but as we climb up the pyramid it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller look Faith may not be in comparative size to what the Capstone will be and you're looking for bigger bigger bigger we're going the wrong way on the pyramid we've got it upside down Lance we've got it started off with a pinpoint at the bottom and we're trying to build it this way well there's going to be more of us more of us we're going to do this this this this we're going the wrong direction brother Jack the big wide Foundation is at the bottom as it comes up it's getting less and less and less and less oh my and you're looking glory to God when I get perfect love I'll be doing these great big things keep in mind the proportion of the building of God Divine perfect love may manifest itself out of you to 20 people and you will have achieved your portion in the body [Music] amen don't think everybody out here is going to know you're a son and daughter of God they never will but what you want to influence it goes that God has put in your paths yes sir let me close listen to how this whole thing these people died in you're depending the whole body now and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection Word of Life listen to your challenge today it's not to get more members sure Shine Your Light we want everybody in here that God wants there's more out here that needs to be brought in Shine Your Light witness to them we'll baptize him we'll do everything we can do to reach him for the Lord right Miracle signs wonders yes we believe in that but I don't want our church to turn into being known as a miracle church and a sign church and that's the only reason people come healing is the children's bread we need Miracles Our God does Miracles I don't want us to be known just as a miracle sign church we want to be known as a full born Word Church what we believe in miracles we believe in signs but we also believe in brother ly kindness and I've done found it out a long time ago sometimes signs and miracles are a whole lot easier to achieve than brotherly kindness is amen so notice in order to bring the resurrection God building building honing building honing building coming up to this finale they're they're under Souls under the alt waiting for this church my daughter is waiting on me brother Jimmy is waiting on us sister Linda brother Calvin's waiting on us brother Daniel Nunley brother Jean Leman brother Jean Litteton on and on and on we could go all those Saints they're waiting oh it Ain like they're sad where they are but they're in a temporary State they have no flesh they do not have a human body in the sense that we do they're longing they're Desiring they're happy yes but they're waiting they're waiting Lord God waiting for this church to come to its Perfection but when Christ does come and this church you see is getting smaller in the minority it's a whole lot sharper than that but just so write that across there it's come up to a needle point a needle point do you understand whenever he brings her to this last stage right before the headstone sits down on her which is rapturing Faith this is our Capstone that we're waiting on rapturing faith it will be honed and honed and honed hated people will come and leave come and go smaller smaller smaller smaller until it comes in The Headstone we just sit right down on the top of it and the world will never hear the but what is that him kissing the church oh my and they're waiting for Pride Revival that's going to shake the world we're going to go to the hospitals and empty them out Jesus never even done that I believe great times are ling in front of us if we'll get our priorities right the prophet said he believed that there'd be missing limbs that would be restored I believe the same thing but he ain't going to do it so people will come and follow us because the signs that's not what we want I've seen what that produces it produces many times puffed up men and they think they're so much greater than everybody else well how can one clot of dust brag to another clot of dust I'm a bigger claw than you are I'm a more a bit more Dusty than you are well well well you old red Alabama poo dirt you and you think because you're red you go sweet taters better than black Louisiana Dirt does you're still dirt dirt bag well Hallelujah it's only the grace of God that's why we need these virtues that's why we need him so when we run into our brothers and sister that we disagree with on theology that Jesus Christ brotherly kindness will treat them the way he treats us now listen what it's going to come to the church and the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of ministry that this left so Jesus started it off at the bottom with his ministry and whenever he comes back right up here at the top it'll be the same Ministry that started off at the bottom so it won't be a nickan thing it won't be a hierarchy of clergy praise the Lord but it will be a Ministry because when this headstone comes back it's got a pocket listen a pocket like here which's going to sit right there in the regular pyramid it isn't just a cap that sets across the top it's a little flange and it's got to sit there cuz it sheds the water so there's a little flange and whenever it comes down it locks all the sides and sets it and sheds the water and when it comes this church has got to be so honed all the rest of these stones in the pyramid laying so perfect till you can't run a razor blade between them how many's been to the pyramids of Egypt anybody with the tong sister Leman Carol myself it's absolutely phenomenal not only in Egypt but when we were in Israel and finding them stones and one particular Stone there that we saw longer than from this back wall to that back wall back there hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of tons and they still don't know how they made them and they even cut a diagram in that solid stone that looked like an elongated Roman ogi I have a hard enough time doing that with Hickory or black walnut and they cut that thing and I stood there with my eye brother skipped and looked at that that cut down to their perfect perfect boy what an achievement that was to cutting Rock but this is even a greater achievement to cut into hard-headed skin oh you're a greater achievement than than Pharaoh Pharaoh can say hell boys build my pyramid said well what about Lance I forget Lance can't do nothing that old boy forget Jonathan can't do nothing forget Dave Swanson he's too much of a European you know he's got this in him and that and forget Donnie Reagan Lord have mercy hard-headed stubborn oh you don't want to preach for me don't want to do this that other and God said what you call trash what you call impossible I will cut and shape and every stone will be mortared together so tightly when brother Dave and I laid this Stone right here and we had these lifts up in there we had them Stone L all around us upon the rails everywhere he had somebody down there beneath him I had somebody down there beneath me I'd measure the hole throw me a 3 by five throw me a 3 by six throw me a two by whatever and sometimes they'd throw it up and I'd catch it and I'd put it in there it's too big too big on this end they take a side cutter with a diamond bit and they knock a little of it off and then they if it needed to be if it's too long they would just cut it these stones are made whether or not solid color all the way through color is only so deep so when you cut it what you see is little tiny Pebbles on the inside so then the brothers would cut it and then they'd take a chisel or a small hammer and they'd Nick the ends of it so it would look like that it was molded to fit that certain spot God ain't just whacking and cutting and so well whatever works I don't care just throw it all together we'll use bubble gum to hold it together we're talking about a house of God that will live through eternity think of it sights of God when you leave this world in a Rapture you will be fit for eternity your character will be so molded through eternity you will be there in the great Paradise of God and when there is no more devil you still will be when there is no more time when there is no more sickness so God picks you up sometimes brother philli and hands the preacher the Mallet whack whack whack I got a text from one of the brothers of their church he said boy the Lord sure has been making a hard on me in the last few Services joined the crowd man alive a lot of us start out as a gigantic Boulder we weigh 385,000 lb we're 21 feet long four feet thick six feet tall and when God gets done with us you're the size of Kit candy all remember what the little kit candy was and you're glory to God lord you want me to fill up the whole wall he said no I had something about like this in mind now Lord God don't tell me you're going to put me underneath somebody don't tell me you're going to put me on the bottom now Lord I'm much better than that can't you see why we need more of these things in our lives and up here when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be honed the children I know cutting don't you know we don't like it but y ought to be so grateful to God that you've got a church that you can go to that's a honing Church a lot of folks in the Tri Cities ain't looking for a honing Church they looking for a bragging Church oh y'all are so good and y'all are so wonderful now don't worry about trying to be perfect and don't worry about all that stuff the Lord understands y'all can't overcome lust the Lord Lord understands some of you men want to become women and you know we we accept you here at the at our church well I do that's because of the kind of spirit that they're in there but in our church we want preachers that come through even visiting ones that have honing tools Lord if I need cutting cut me if I need chipping chip me I'd much rather be cut now than thrown into the furnace and be destroyed listen this quote I love this when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be H not only just some Creed or doctrine or something we've come through it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ till when he comes he and that Ministry so where do you figure then the people around the message that don't even believe in Ministry where they're going to fit when the Capstone comes what will it be the true Ministry of God will so match The Headstone he and the ministry will unite together what will it produce Believers that's what Ministry is for so perfectly like Christ that when he comes here in the ministry will fit right smack don't you love those theological terms write smack together then will come the Rapture the going home that's what I live for every day of my life how many wants to be ready for that hour can you see a lack in your walk walk can you see where you need to move up I certainly can but don't be discouraged now just take the tape and keep going but what you need to be in order to leave this world ready so much at his image that he would be able to say to you come away my love he will not say Come Away my flawed deficient Poor Pitiful bride that barely held on from day to day we are his victory praise the Lord let's B us together heavenly father I pray that you'd take this today Lord and make it real to each of our hearts begin with me my Lord I desire to see more of these things in my life I see them already father I believe I've received the true baptism of the Holy Ghost but I'm longing to come to that spot to where my life will add to all the rest of those lives around the world that will be able to call the dead Out of the Dust of the Earth we can pray for the sick and they can get healed and we can pray for the discouraged and they can become encouraged we we we see that happening among us but it's evident we're not yet not yet quite where we need to be because the dead have not raised yet so our crowning then is not going to be a Pentecostal explosion our crowning is not just going to be all of a sudden there will be such wonders and signs and Miracles and everybody will stop flocking to us no it's getting smaller as it goes to the top not bigger but whenever we arrive each of us Lord God I don't care if a lay person beats me to the top first Lord if it's one of these sisters so be it if it's one of these brothers so be it so the virtues of God are flowing out of them and you're daily living through their life and one one day they might have a greater need of Faith the next day they might have a greater need of virtue and the next it might be Temperance and the next it might be T knowledge whatever it is Lord we just want to live every day so when the circumstance would arise we have all that we need and we will not be short in any way there may be days we need so much brotherly kindness as we looked at it Wednesday night was Peter in the parable and how wonderfully you express that to us Lord in Matthew and then one man ow owed over $20 and something million dollar and the other man owed $7 Lord Jesus help us father sometimes we need more help with brotherly kindness all we're Pals and buddies as long as we agree doctor and go along with this and that and the other but just to sure as a little bit of difference comes between us we go to pull and off from one another forgive us Lord it shows even among Ministry it shows we need more brotherly kindness help us father not to emphasize on minorities and minimize majorities help us father that we will never ever lay aside these precious wonderful things we love you today Jesus I thank you I do not know how many from Word of Life Church will arrive at this spot but I believe there are some here today that are well on their Journey Hallelujah and they will receive that capping that rapturing face that body change thank you Lord Jesus because you have begun that work in them and you will complete it father my desire is that I'll just be one of them Lord help me Lord Jesus now if you don't mind I'll take a few moments Lord and ask you for myself spend so much of my time praying for others and listening to tapes for others now I'd like to ask you for me I've never asked you for money I've never asked you for fame for popularity in reality there's very few things I've ever asked you for from me most of them involve around the same thought I want to be what you want me to be I don't want to fail you I don't want to fail your people help me Lord that I can bring what is needful for this season may it be Anointed with your presence help me Lord God that I'll be able to be what you desire me to be your Prophet said you had virtue compassion mercy and so on so he said if we're going to be like Jesus we've got to have it help me Lord sometimes father I have so many phone calls and so many emails from people around the world with one question and another question and Lord WhatsApp and text and sometimes oh Lord it it just about becomes overwhelming the needs of your people are so so many and Carol and I will pray we' prayed in Walmart we've prayed in Lowe's we pulled over on the side of the road cuz when your children are in need it's desperate to them help me Jesus sometimes and I feel like I can't give no more may your virtue that Unlimited Supply flow through US Lord God I don't just pray that for me today but father I pray that for these brothers and sisters these mothers and they Wonder oh Lord what will I ever do I all I do is make food and change diapers and I raised my kids and Lord what have I ever done Lord God help them to realize she had been given a great special Title by the prophet of God as The Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John and mother she needs virtue to them little children she's going to need virtue when her husband comes in at night and he's wore out and had a bad day and she's had a bad day and well the devil do everything in the world try to come between them but help them Lord help us to realize the kingdom that some of us may conquer it may not be too much further beyond our front door our back door and our garage but if we can do that what a say we have done help us Lord Jesus can we just raise our hands this morning while in the presence of God may God take his great measuring tape of Christ Jesus and may He begin with me today may he measure me and see where I am and where I need to be and once I see what I'm showing up on the tape then I'll know what to ask for then my petition will be Lord help me I'm falling short help help me anybody else you're willing to do the same this morning don't let your neighbor take the tape and sometimes you can't even take it yourself cuz you'll never look at yourself quite right but may the Holy Ghost take that tape and measure you well you you're good on Fai and you're good on godliness you're you're good on that oh but your virture you still run a little bit short there son your brotherly it's a little bit short I I saw you got short with that brother there the other day and you just got a real attitude toward him you need to come on up a little higher son Lord God speak to the young people speak to the middleaged speak to the elders the seniors Lord those that are Homebound and can't even come to church father be mindful of them too would you Lord they'd love to be here because of sickness or whatever they can't Lord let them know you haven't forgot about them please father minister to us today Lord Jesus we may not be the noisiest Church in the message we certainly won't be the biggest one we may not be the richest one or really we're not interested in comparing to anyone else anyway but let our identity be a church that has so much of the love of God oh yeah we believe in gifts yes sir we believe in them with all of our hearts but the prophet of God told us he would rather have that love than every spiritual gift that you have to me that is quite phenomenal especially of a man who operated in the gifts probably nearly every day of his life after he entered into Ministry but he found the key and the key is love feel the housewives Jesus feel the little kids feel the teenagers those in college Lord God the deacons they have a tough job Lord sometimes the people might get aggravated on them because they have to speak to their kids and they have to deal with this issue and that issue I thank you for our Deacon Brothers Lord I pray that you'd strengthen them yes Lord help them father I pray for the other ministry here at the church I pray for the trustees Sunday school leaders Lord God I pray father for our brothers in the library father many times the hidden ones up there in the booth they run the sound part the ones in the upper part there they run the internet so people can be able to still stream the service and they sacrifice service after service would you be mindful of them up there today Lord Lord we don't want them to come here and try to take care of everybody else and fall short of the glory of God God themsel be mindful of each of us today Lord God I pray mold us Jesus hone us father shape us into that image Lord God I pray thank you Father we worship you today Lord this is your house Lord come and dwell father we want that certificate of occupancy when the Great inspector come inspects our faith our virtue our knowledge all these virtues and he says son you have arrived Lord we're longing for that hour when that refilling will be a the Dynamics of this church a refilling of the Holy Ghost which she's worked in part while our headstone has been descending I believe with all of my heart I have the Holy Ghost no doubt many of these people do but we just want more and more Jesus not only is this place your house but let my body be your house use my lips to curse demons use my mouth to speak the words of life help me to be so sensitive to the holy ghost that I can preach things from this Pulpit that will be so direct to what people are needing in their life that it's what they talked about coming to church it happens all the time that it'll be so direct it'll be what they prayed about because we believe the word is a discerner not a man the word Lord Jesus help me help the minister Brothers your lord help each of us here's my hands Lord here's my feet here's my mouth this is your house let's

platform we had to double ply the plywood cost us thousands of dollars but we would not have a certificate of occupancy today if those little tiny things were not put on the bottom of the panels I want wonder how close we are today to full occupancy some of you may be here some of you may be there some of you may be wherever you are and some of you may be that close right there oh you need just that little tiny thing print out and it's stuck to your life and your Rapture Ready thank you Lord don't you want to know brother Don where are you exactly I don't have a clue you me well I can see all all of them in my life but I believe there's got to be more of them I just want to see more John more so am I greater in faith sometimes I feel like I'm greater in faith the name in virtue you know know how it feels like whenever you pray for people and you lose all the strength that you have and there's hundreds of more people in the prayer line and you know that God is using you as a channel to flow through and they have to drag you off the platform and put you back around in the back hook you up to oxygen or IV or something like that that's terrible it's an absolute terrible feeling cuz you feel like somehow you fail the Lord so no matter what we ever do I don't think humanly we'll ever get to a spot to where we feel like in our own eyes we have arrived but I've learned what's more important than me thinking I have as him knowing where I am don't leave here today down don't leave disheartened as a matter of fact we're going to pray for each other before we go and I want you to be encouraged today we are in a great hour the pyramidal body of God has never been this close to the Capstone can we just pray for one another you just lay your hand on the person standing near there if you feel comfortable in doing so Heavenly Father we know that individually you will call your children through the channel of death all your children don't pass at one time one will pass then another then another but Lord for those of us who are here in this building today who will be alive we will not go one at a time we will leave this world together they may have their hand on a brother or a sister that will experience the change with them so Lord help help us to get off off the focus of we're we're so different and we have we're so far apart and why would we want to focus on that when we can focus on The God Who can bring us together and give us what we have need of we'll never be in the same human mind what will be in your mind Lord Jesus help our church help our people father to be more and more of what you want them to be began with the pastor father help me Lord Jesus help me that I can love the way you loved yes help me Lord that I can treat people who've treated me bad I'll do it in such a way that they'll never even know that that person has done it oh some saints saw me the other night shaking hands with somebody and smiling and treating them like there's a million dollars some saints from our church little did they know that individual had called me a Judas had called me all kinds of names said all kinds of things about me and told all kinds of lies on me Lord Jesus I don't want this to be a show I want it to be an action from the spirit of God I don't want it just to be in the life of the pastor you want it to be in every one of our lives but I want to see more Lord I want to see more more forgiveness in me more virtue when I can minister to your people help me Lord help me we worship you today Father God bless you Saints how

So, we certainly want to remember that need uh this morning, that young lady. Uh, Sister Sue Miller wants to remember her niece. She fell yesterday and now has no use of her right leg scheduled. She's in the hospital to see a neurosurgeon tomorrow. Uh please pray that something could be done to help her uh with the use of her leg again.

Many, many needs, but we serve a mighty God this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just real quick before we we pray. So thankful for Brother Matt. If you missed the word Friday night and yesterday, it would do you really good to go back and listen to it. Um the evidence of salvation. So um that being said, you know, we're going to have activities here. Well, food for everyone. Brother Tony McGraw and Sister Jennifer. Um we I was in here late last night and they were still in there cooking for today. So, make sure and thank them. Brother Matt Willis. Um and those that cooked um lunch for us yesterday. Um thank you so much for that. And all the sisters and help if you would give all them a hand for helping. [applause] [applause] But I want to say that what I'm really thankful for is our youth. Um, you know, there's a lot of places they could have been this weekend, but they chose to come to come sit around the word. And, you know, I'm so grateful for that. And if I don't mean to bore you, you can sit down if I'm boring you. But um when you look at the youth and and in and the way that the devil is is going against the youth nowadays, the things that Satan offers the youth, you know, Brother Donnie asked me about four years ago, pull me in the office and asked me if I would help with the youth. And I I told him I I said, \"I I'll not do it without brother Rob.\" And uh some of you parents that have kids my kids age of my kids when we didn't have all of this brother Rob two or three times a week would have the youth at his house singing doing games fellowshipping. I've often told him, \"Brother Rob, I have no idea where my kids would be. If it hadn't been for you and Sister Sarah, we understand God is the glue that holds these youth together, but God needs a little brush sometimes to put it on.\" Brother Rob's been that. He always preaches, \"Find a new friend, love somebody.\" And he don't always say it. Him and Sister Sarah have been that by example. And I don't I don't He's been a mentor to me. He's been around youth. He's not a minister. He don't claim to be, but he puts a lot of youth ministers to shame by the life he lives in front of our youth. And you know, Brother Donnie always says, \"Give them a rose while they're here.\" &gt;&gt; You know, so I I I I wouldn't be able to do this without him and without brother Donnie giving us the the leadership to do it. So, if you would give Brother Rob, sister Sarah a hand. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's take these needs before the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so grateful, Lord. Lord, where would we be if we didn't have the word of of this day, the message of the hour to come sit around, Lord, and lay our needs on top of it. Lord, as we've heard in the last week or two, Father, how your prophet said this was a sacred desk. If these needs, Lord, have been written down. They've been laid on this desk. Lord, we know this desk cannot heal them. This desk cannot meet those needs. But the anointing that you've placed in here because everyone here has brought that anointing with them. Father, you've sanctified this place. Lord, this is not a place to come in and criticize. It's not a place to come in and be bitter and hold grudges and not even a place to come in and think about what we're going to do when we get out of here. This is a place where we come, Lord, and we lay our needs at your feet and we re renew our strength for the days that lie ahead, Father. every need that's been written down, Lord. You're mindful of everyone. Not one is greater than the other. They're all great needs in your sight, Lord. So, we know that if we pull our faith together, if we believe, Father, in your word that you said, Lord, if we had faith the size of a grain of a mustard seed, we could say to this mountain, \"Be thou removed and cast into the sea, Father, and it would be done.\" But you also said, \"Sometimes you got to climb that mountain.\" So give us strength for one and faith for the other. Lord, we thank you for it. We're believing you for it. Pray, Lord, that the minister comes, Father, that you would anoint him as you have in the last two days. Meet every need with your word, Father. Bless the music that's played, Brother Aaron, Father, and all the songs that songs that are sung. We give you glory in Jesus name.

And for that sacred moment, [singing and music] no doubt can in [singing] her fear in the presence [singing] [music] of Jehovah.

The blind were carried into his presence and walked out with their sight. Church members walked into his presence, became sons and daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I guess the question today is for us. What do you have need of? &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. Don't you? &gt;&gt; He promised us whether it's two or three gathered together in my name, I'll be in his midst. We're so happy and grateful that all the visitors have been with us and our days has been set aside for these youth services and trust that something has been said or done that'll help you in your journey. We by no means have meetings like this to try to hinder or to hurt or to bring any type of thing in a negative way that would hinder your walk with God. I'm grateful that we still have men of God in this day who have given their life for the cause of Jesus Christ. Aren't you? Let's stand together. We'll invite brother Matt to come and just bring to us what what the Lord has placed upon his heart for today. Um we welcome each of you that are here in our gates with us and we trust that God will meet with us in a very special way. He's the only one that could be able to custom fit a service to where every hungry heart could have something. Amen. Sing something for us, Harry. [music] Let's just open our hearts together to the Lord now. And just whatever you have need now remember a minister studies and God gives him thoughts and scriptures and quotes and ideas and it goes to putting it together. And maybe your need lays outside the confines of what he's actually studied. But remember, you have the ability to pull on the gift. And the Holy Ghost can so come and minister to you in such a way. It may not be but two, three sentences or a paragraph. But those two, three sentences will change your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. woman [music] tried so many [singing] Jesus. Thank you, Father. Yet grew [singing and music] worse. So did Jesus. She came. [singing] [music] And when [singing] the unbelievers tried to frame her [singing] [music] she whispered these words [music] everybody together through her [singing] pain. This is what we [music] want to do. Oh, touching Jesus [singing] is all [music] that really matter. [music] And then [singing] your life will never be this. You believe that with all your [music] heart. Thank you, Lord, for there's only [singing] one way to touch. [music] You must [singing] believe when you [music] call on. Let's sing the chorus once together again, everybody. [music] Oh, touching Jesus [music] is all that really matters. [music] Thank you, Father. And [singing] then your [music] life will never [music] [singing] [music] [music] His name [music] is all [singing] that really matter. Then [music and singing] your life will never be [music] the same. For [singing] there's only [music] one way to touch him [music] and just believe when you call on his [music] name. [singing] My just a wonderful presence opportunity that we have to be gathered together. My I just feel the presence of the Lord is here. And as we're just singing this song, maybe they'll just keep playing that. We'll go into prayer. Touching Jesus. &gt;&gt; It It's all It's all that that matters. &gt;&gt; I mean, nothing else matters &gt;&gt; is touching Jesus. And when he comes by and he comes by your way and he starts to deal with your heart and and you know what I love about his presence and touching Jesus, it's it's not always words. It's not something that can be said. It's just his presence. &gt;&gt; And in his presence there's fullness of life and there's joy. There's there's peace. There's there's deliverance. There's there's comfort. It it seems like when he comes by, all the questions that you had, they kind of just melt away and the only thing that matters is him and him alone and and and you're with Jesus and you know, and the heartache and the pain and the struggle and all those things, you know, you start to understand it's going to be okay. It's going to be all right cuz I'm with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just go before our Lord, Lord Jesus, how we love you. And truly, Lord, as the song would sing, [music] touching Jesus is all that really matters. [snorts] Lord, how many of us here this morning could testify that you've come by and you've touched our heart and you touched our life, Lord? And Lord, we had the need of salvation and we had the need of deliverance and we were lost sinners and undone. Lord, your great love where in which you loved us, you saw fit to come and pluck us out of the muck and the mire and to let us know that you loved us and you forgave us of all of our sin and you've raised us up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Lord, what an hour, what an opportunity, what a privilege. Lord, we want to tell you we love you, &gt;&gt; Lord. Thank you for doing that, Lord. Thank you for Calvary, Lord. Thank you for shedding your blood that I could be forgiven and I could be free, Lord, from the things of this world and not in bondage, but have a real liberty, Lord, to serve you and to love you and to love this message of the hour that's called us out of the darkness of Lady Oilia, Lord, and it set us free to soar in heavenly places. Oh, how we thank you, Lord. Lord, as we just turn to the preaching of the word, Lord, I need you to come and just Lord, anoint myself to get out of the way. Anoint the ears of the hearer, Lord. And Lord, I always think of that that boy that had those fishes and loaves and there was the multitude and he didn't have enough to feed the people. But when he placed it into your hands, &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It was more than enough. &gt;&gt; They were taking up fragments and had leftovers, Lord. And I pray that, Lord, these scriptures and quotes that I have placed down, Lord, you'd just take it into your hands now. And you'll minister to the needs of your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of Romans chapter 8. uh Romans chapter 8, a very familiar scripture and uh verse 10. But I just want to thank uh brother Joe and brother Donnie for the opportunity to uh be in fellowship with you all and to speak to you. It's just been such a privilege uh to be here and an honor and and I started to realize and look out uh a lot of the young people that I've come to know and and see in different places and those from brother Josh Bennett and other uh churches uh am I just coming from Arizona and Oklahoma and certain places. I thought my goodness is this is wonderful to see all the saints of God. We just love each one of you and want you young people to know that we love you and cherish you and are proud of you. &gt;&gt; Really proud of you because you are the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And it's just a wonderful thing. And and while I have this uh opportunity, I I do want to let uh uh brother Donnie know how much I've appreciated him and his ministry and sister Carol and and my I I've over the years, you know, over the last 25 years of just being able to hear Brother Donnie minister, I I I when I I love a a ministry that it just pulls something out of you. It just identifies something in your soul. And and I just want to thank brother Donnie for your stand and unwavering compromise on the message of the hour. [applause] [applause] I I I've I've I've been a great beneficiary of the gift of God that he's placed in this body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, we do bring greetings from our pastor, brother David Mciri and the Saints in Bedford, Texas. and just want to move right into the word and see what God would have for us. Amen. Romans chapter 8 and verse 10, it would read, \"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you.\" Amen. You may be seated. And also just want to read a scripture we read on the opening night uh in Galatians 3 and verse 29. Galatians 3 and 29. It says, \"If ye be Christ, then are you Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise.\" And we read the uh this quote out of possessing all things as we ministered on the evidence of salvation. Uh, brother Brandham says just what Joshua did for the children of Israel. Joshua means savior. The word Joshua and that's the same thing Jesus done for the church when they killed him. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave. And he rose up again with the evidence, the baptism of the Holy Ghost that there is a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever. Amen. And he come back and brought us an evidence. What does it do, brother Brandham? It makes you stop your lying, stealing, drinking, cursing, immorals, everything. It makes us a new creature, a new creature out of you. I who were once dead in sin and trespasses. Nevertheless, I, not me, but Christ lives in me. I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. Heir to the promise. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That land belongs to us. How do you know it? Joshua rose from the dead, brought back the evidence, the Holy Ghost, and I got it. Amen. Glory. I'm an heir. Oh, a child of the king, a child of the king, heir to all things. The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we we ministered on the evidence of salvation, you know, the evidence, it's the proof, you know, I it's the Holy Ghost and how we are a possessor of all things. Uh we have been given a a promise. And you know, I was just thinking about the evidence and and and how the Lord would maybe lead in this service and you know, what we would minister on and and you know, he he said he brought back the evidence and the evidence is the Holy Ghost. And now the the Holy Ghost is in us. And and I was just even thinking about that, you know, that time there that those men went looking for the Welsh revival. They were maybe looking for some movement. They were looking for some gathering. and and and when they and when they saw uh uh that that officer there, you know, twirling the baton and directing traffic or whatnot, they came over there and asked him, they said, \"Sir, we want to see if you can help us, but but we're looking for something. We're looking for the Welsh revival.\" And he said, \"You're I am the Welsh revival. You're looking at it.\" And and what's on my heart to minister to to you this morning is is I am the evidence. &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by the help of God, we'll just move along these lines as the as we just went through some thoughts how, you know, Christ is the word and the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word and makes it alive. And and we ministered last night how an evil spirit will will will a spooky spirit will will raise up and just how Joshua and Caleb I they went over into the the the land of Israel and they came back with the very evidence and the fruit that it was everything that God said it was and they said, \"Let us go up at once.\" I mean, we are more than able. I I mean, it it's amazing to me what how how a believer looks at the promise and looks at the obstacle than than a skeptic or an unbeliever or a doubter because they were over there walking through the land and going, \"Oh my goodness, uh we can't take this and it's too much and my you know that maybe the food is good here, but I tell you what, we ain't got a chance.\" And Joshua and Caleb, they're walking around and and looking at the biggest giants of the land and going, \"Yep, we are more than able to do it.\" I tell you what, this is going to be a cakewalk because the same God that brought us out of Egypt, the same God that's been leading us through the wilderness, he's the same God that brought us through the Red Sea, he's the same God that's going to take us into the promised land. And he'll be the same God that'll annihilate and destroy all of our enemies. And because God gave us the promise, there is nothing that can stop us from going into our inheritance. I tell you, why not? Let's just go up at once. Let's take it all. Give me my mountain. There ain't no devil. There ain't no darkness. There ain't no demon that can stop me. We are well more able to take the land. Let us go up at once. [applause] And they got back over and Joshua and Caleb, they were all enthused about the evidence and they came here presented and say it's everything that God said it would be. Oh my, it just strikes me now. I want to tell you this message of the hour is everything that God said it was. It's my joy. It's my peace. It's my deliverance. It's my salvation. It's my reward. It's my glory. It's my all and all. It's everything that I ever wanted. And it's everything that I ever needed. It's more than enough. I want to say the message is more than enough. It'll save you. It'll deliver you. It'll fill you. It'll give you the joy. It'll give you the victory. It'll give you the peace. It'll take you to a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever forever. I tell you what, what a promise. What an inheritance that we have. I say we got something to be excited about. [applause] &gt;&gt; They come back excited and they come back enthused. &gt;&gt; We got the evidence &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden an evil report rose up. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a second, guys. How I mean, were we not in the same place? &gt;&gt; I mean, Lady Oia is a dark and wicked age. &gt;&gt; I mean, have you not seen the giants in the land and the lush devils and and all these these demons that were fighting that over there? There ain't no way we can take that land. There's no way a young person could live an overcoming life in Lady Osia. There's no way they can overcome all the strip teases and all the lust devils that walk around. There ain't no way we can go over there and take the land. And I tell you what, how in the world would we ever go into a body change? How in the world are we ever going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of the eye? See, they brought up all that doubt and all that wonder. But you know, Joshua and Caleb were over there saying, \"He's more than able to do it.\" Why? Because the same pillar of fire that brought us up out of Egypt. The same pillar of fire that led us through the wilderness. The same pillar of fire is the one that bringing us into the promised land. I want to tell you, it's the same pillar of fire that was with brother Brandham. is the same pillar of fire that is right here in the building right here this morning. He will give you the promise. He will take you into the land. He will help you defeat every devil and every demon. I don't care what it is, young people, that you're fighting. There's an anointing upon the word of the hour to bring you into the manifestation and the fulfilling of every single promise of God. You don't have to worry. You don't have to fear. You just got to say that God promised it and I'm more [screaming] than a conqueror through Jesus Christ that strengthens me. Hey, let us go up at once and take the land. There ain't no devil. There ain't no sickness. There ain't no trial that can stop me from walking into my divine promise of almighty God. It's a good land. The message is a good land. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. An evil report rose up. &gt;&gt; No, you can't do it. You You You can't take the land. But my prophet said he rose from the dead and brought back the evidence, the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And I got it. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm already feeling pretty good because I know what I had when I was out in the world. And it wasn't much. I had a bunch of fear. I had a bunch of anxiety. I had a bunch of bondage. I had a bunch of weight. I had a taskmaster that told me, \"Go here, do this, bow here, smoke that, drink that.\" But one day, I called on the name of the Lord and I got saved and I got filled with the Holy Ghost. And I'm here to tell you, I'm standing in 2025. I got the Holy Ghost. I got it. Is there are people here this morning that can say, \"I got the evidence. I'm the proof of his resurrection. I got the Holy Ghost. I got the message of the hour. I'm living it. I'm breathing it. I'm walking in it. I'm loving it. I got it. [screaming] Hallelujah. Is there a young people that can raise up in this generation of 2025 and say, \"I got it.\" Or are you still listening to that spooky spirit? &gt;&gt; No. No, you ain't got it. No. &gt;&gt; No. No, you ain't got it. &gt;&gt; No, that was just that was just emotion. &gt;&gt; That was just a workup, &gt;&gt; you know. That was just you were just getting excited because you're friends. [sighs] What? That's what chapter is that? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What? What? What? Oh, that's that spooky spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the How do you know when the devil's lying? When he's running his mouth. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes it's a good time and maybe the only time that you can use that word and say, \"Shut up. &gt;&gt; Shut up, you old dun devil. I've done heard from my theophony. I know where I came from and I know where I am going. I done got the evidence of the Holy Ghost shut up in my bones. So quit running your mouth. Is there a young people here that you just want to go ahead and testify the devil's been lying to me. He's been telling me I ain't got the Holy Ghost. Been telling me I ain't going to go in the rapture. Telling me I the message ain't for me. And you just want to shout out this morning and say I got [screaming] it. I got the revelation. I got the Holy Ghost. I got the evidence. A matter of fact, I am [screaming] the evidence. [applause] &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in a place he said, \"The spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you.\" I want to just read this quote out of wisdom versus faith. Brother Brandham says, \"The Bible said, \"Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. Not by wisdom, not by knowledge, not by nomination, but with my spirit, I will what? Energize my word.\" &gt;&gt; The disciples had it swed into them. Then the spirit come to energize the word. See, not by power, not by might, not by wisdom, not by understanding. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for that &gt;&gt; because I I really can't understand a lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, not by that, but by my spirit, I will energize &gt;&gt; my word. Amen. &gt;&gt; By my spirit, say the Lord. It's the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God and makes it work. So, I'm beginning to understand the promise isn't based on how I feel. The promise isn't based on what I can figure out. It It's not based on my ability. It's not even based on my good works. It's not based on something that I can do, but it's actually based on what he said. When God came to Abraham and he gave Abraham a promise and he said,\"Abraham, I will make you.\" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I will make you. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask Abraham, you know, uh, Abraham, do you think you can or or or would you would you do you think you can you can get good enough on your own? Or no, he come to him and he gave him a promise and said, Abraham, I will. &gt;&gt; And we know how the story goes. It was never based on Abraham's ability. It was always based on the promise. And it is no different because we are Abraham's seed. We are the the royal seed uh the elected of God. And it's not because of maybe what we can look at as our good works or our efforts. But it's always based upon the word. It's always based upon the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet would say this in end time signed seed. He said when the word come to Mary, she never doubted it. She said, \"Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word.\" See, she never said, \"Now, you wait till I feel life.\" &gt;&gt; And then I'll go testify. &gt;&gt; You wait till I'm positive. &gt;&gt; That's the way we so-called Christians do today. Wait till I'm positive. Wait till I begin to get better. and wait till I see something happen and then I'll do it. No sir, that's not the question. You believe first. &gt;&gt; So, we have been taught by a vindicated prophet that you can take God at his word and I want to tell you if something in your heart is believing and wanting the word. We heard brother Brandham said that is eternal life that's calling to you and he said you are an heir to that. And so if God is making a call upon your life, then you don't base it on how you're feeling. You don't base it on your circumstance. You say, \"That is the word of the Lord and I believe it.\" But many times when that happens, you know, the devil is always wanting to try to offer some type of emotion or some type of sensation and I'll just go launch right into it now because that's exactly what happened to me in in my conversion. And I got to a place, you know, where where uh uh you know, I needed help and and I I don't have time to go into all those things, but I I'd messed up my life pretty pretty bad and and I had an experience when I was 12 years old at at Louisiana camp, I knew God that was real, but but but I didn't feed that fire. I kept hanging out with the same kids in the neighborhood and and run around the neighborhood. And as they got older and started to do different things, you know, I I was around those influences and and and I held on for a while. And you know what? They actually even respected me and said, \"Oh, wow. You're a Christian. and you don't do this and you don't do that. Well, that's okay. We like Christians. Come on around, old buddy. You better watch out. Them friends you're hanging out with and oh, you're a Christian, mom. I'm being a light. You better watch out. You ain't got no business being on their grounds. [cheering] [applause] I held my testimony for a season. But you know what? Then I lost my reason. There's actually a quote on that. when you lose your reason, when you get between two opinions and and and for a while I I said, \"I didn't do this because of that. I'm a Christian. I don't I don't.\" And one day my friend said, \"Man, why don't you smoke?\" And I said, \"Well, it makes you cough.\" Wrong answer. I had lost my reason, Brother Donnie. I used to be. I'm a Christian. I don't go I don't watch movies because of this. I I don't get on them websites because of this. I don't do that because I'm a Christian. But somewhere along the line, I had been beguiled and I lost my reason of why I didn't do the things that I I wasn't supposed to be doing. And I gave the wrong answer. And when I gave the wrong answer, I didn't give a word answer. &gt;&gt; I said, \"It makes you cough.\" So guess what? Oh, just just a little. Just try a little. And and and right from that moment, I got pulled out into the world in a life of sin. I got myself into a lot of trouble. And I got to the place where I wanted the deliverance. And I remember making the decision in my heart and in my life that I'm never going to do these things again. I I really don't I I I well, I just go ahead and say it. I if if I didn't clean up my life, I was going to fail a drug test and I was going to go be in prison. &gt;&gt; That's just what it is. All right. And that's how Satan took me. And and I realized, man, if I don't clean up my life, I'm going to I'm going to fail these tests. And and I'm I started to think, man, I I need to clean up my act. I need to quit doing these things. And so I made a decision to quit doing those things. And and you want to know what? My decision didn't last long at all. &gt;&gt; There was some little old voice telling me, you got plenty of time. Just you got plenty of time. I tell you what, that same devil lives today. Don't give your heart to God Sunday morning. You just wait till Wednesday. Just wait till camp. Wait till your friends right here. Not this preacher. Not that preacher. Not brother D. Oh, there's always an excuse and a lying devil that wants you to put off the day of your salvation. But I want to tell you and declare to you, now is the time of salvation. Today is the salvation of the Lord. And I came to that moment and I had made the choice. I'm going to clean up my life. I'll never do these things anymore. I [laughter] I I I I can't risk ruining and throwing away my whole life. And I remember I made that decision and I came back in uh to the the you know, the officer that was going to test me for those things. And he said, \"Oh, I won't see you here uh for another test.\" and and and and 45 days. And right at that moment when he said that, it was something like something next to me was going, \"Hey, we got plenty of time. We we can do whatever we want to do.\" And in that moment, I realized that something else was making decisions for me. &gt;&gt; Ain't that strange? Something else was leading me. Something else was guiding me. Something else was pulling me into the lust and and telling me just one more time or just do that or just go down here. And I realized it was another nature. Actually, it was your first husband. uh uh the world that you're married to and you didn't realize that those thoughts that you've been having, that's the first nature of the devil that's leading you. Those ain't even your thoughts. And he told me, \"You got plenty of time on Matthew. It'll be okay.\" And in that moment, I realized whatever that was was not me. And whatever it is, it's bigger than me. And I said, \"God, I need your help.\" &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So I left and and I got into my car and you know I had called on the name of the Lord. Feels good to do that. &gt;&gt; And I got to driving down down down down the road and all of a sudden I don't know why but this voice this thing said we'll just get emotional and cry &gt;&gt; and I was like what? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, you've called on the name of the Lord. Now, just get emotional and cry. And I thought, get emotional and cry. And I thought, you know, I'd been raised, right? And I thought, well, it's not about getting emotional and crying. And then an old song came into my heart. I said, it's in the name of Jesus. I said, and I started singing that song. It's in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, we have the victory. And I started singing that song and and before you know it, I I didn't even realize that some guy pulled up next to me in what he thought was a fancy car. I thought maybe I had a fancy car and you know how ignorant people do. They pick fights with one another for no reason at all, you know. And he he pulled up beside me and and I I still my posture hadn't changed yet, you know. So I I'm I'm in there, you know, just kind of in my car and I look over there and I look at him, you know, and and all of a sudden he makes this big old face like this and goes and takes off and I'm like, \"Well, what in the world is he looking?\" I looked up in the mirror and before you know, I was crying and I was emotional. You know why? Because I put the word first. I I didn't I didn't say, \"Well, it's about my how emotional I get. It's about crying.\" But something in my heart rose up said, \"It's in the name of Jesus Christ that I had the victory.\" and oh then the spirit of God I I didn't realize it at the moment but he was moving upon my life but what was the what was the devil wanting to do? He was wanting to offer me some emotional &gt;&gt; as an evidence. &gt;&gt; But praise God, there was something in my heart. I needed more than an emotion. I needed more than just a shout. I needed more than just just just just some temporary moment. I needed something that could change my life. I needed the God of the Bible. I needed the God of Abraham. I needed the God of Isaac. I needed the God of Jacob. I needed the God of Paul and of John. I needed the God of William Brandom. I needed something to come down and energize my soul and change me. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, and since we're here, I'll just keep going. So, you know, I I'm I now I am I now I am getting a little emotional and I am crying. &gt;&gt; But I I I this is just a journey. It's a start. And I'm still in the journey. I ain't trying to say anything about about that. But so I got home and I was excited. I had called on the name of the Lord and you know and I I' I I'd been out pretty hard in the world and and my brothers, they were serving the Lord and but it just so happened it was a Friday night of my dad's anniversary meetings and there was believers in town and and people were out at the restaurant and and and I didn't have any dealings, you know, uh as far as maybe a a wave. you and I remember crawling out my window to avoid having to see folks and and uh but now you know I've called on the name of the Lord and and I'm feeling good and you know now I want to I want to I want to be with believers you know and so I get home I want to know where my brothers are. I said mom I said where where's where's everybody at? She's like well they're they're at the restaurant. You know she's kind of confused like why do why why do you care? And I said okay thanks. And I went out and I got back in my vehicle and I was about to about to just head to the restaurant in that same voice. Isn't it strange this this same thought that would come with just one more time, just one more moment, or or just maybe I'll put it in ways you can understand. Not this service, not not this morning, &gt;&gt; not not today. Just just put it off one more time. Or no, you're okay. And I got back in that car and and and and I and I was just about to go and and and and I heard that thought say, \"I'll get you right back out in the world with music and TV.\" And in that moment, you know, I didn't realize, but I found out uh I found a quote for it because uh brother Brandham talks about Shamgar, I believe it is. And he said, you know, Shamgar got angry. The spirit of the Lord moved upon Shamgar and he got angry. And I didn't realize it in that moment when I heard that thought. He said, I'll get you back out in the world with music TV. I said, \"Get me. You're you're going to get me.\" And I jumped out of my car and I I ran into the garage and I was looking all around in there and I found a big old pair of bolt cutters. You know, these big old eagle claw wire clippers. You know, they're uh cutters. I don't know. They're maybe 3 4t long. And I and I I didn't even know what I was doing. I found those things and I grabbed them and I ran back in the house and I started coming through the kitchen and I said, \"I'm going to get you. You're not going to get me. I'll show you.\" And my mom goes, \"Matthew, wait.\" Remember, I just asked her where my brothers were. She thought somebody was about to get it. &gt;&gt; Well, she wasn't wrong. &gt;&gt; And I remember in that moment, I I I rounded up the stairs and I flung open my door and there was a big old TV sitting there and I took them big old bunk bolt cutters and I swung them and I hit that TV and that thing exploded and I screamed out, \"How you like me now? [applause] And in that moment, [applause] in that moment when I screamed out, \"How you like me now?\" There came something pouring out of heaven that came upon my life. Oh, and it changed the way that I thought. It changed the way that I wanted to dress. It changed my actions. It changed my thinking. My soul had become energized to be what I was always predestinated to be. And that was a son of God. I was heir to all the promises. I was heir to salvation. I'm heir to the resurrection. I was heir to all these things, but I was out there living in sin. I want to tell you if there's a young person here this morning or old alike, I say, you know what it does? Sometimes you just got to get mad at the devil and say, \"Devil, I'm sick and tired of you robbing me of my joy, robbing me of my peace. I'm going to get you this morning. I'm coming after you. Take the word of God, which is the sword of the spirit. Look that devil right in the face and say, \"I'm coming for you.\" And hit him with the word. If he don't move, hit him again. Hit him again. Hit him again. And then scream out, \"How you like me now? [screaming] [applause] Where's the next one?\" [applause] Hallelujah. I say there's an experience here for you this morning, &gt;&gt; but you got to believe first. Oh, that came after believing. &gt;&gt; See, my my first nature, &gt;&gt; you know, and I used to always give this testimony uh that, you know, for years I heard the devil say and I heard the devil say and I heard the devil say and then I heard a testimony one time uh given uh I can't verify but it seemed credible source that said it and and it meant a lot to me so I'll take it for myself. And he he was testifying how brother Brandham, I believe, was uh uh talking to um I always forget the brother. He mentions him as a prophet in South Africa. And he was he was he was speaking to him and he said he was talking about that that picture where it looks like the pillar of fire is kind of swirling up around the around the pulpit. And he he he said to him, he said, \"You see that uh uh brethren right behind there? You see that image? That's an old Indian chief.\" He said he says, \"That's my old nature.\" And he said, \"It's always back there trying to\" He said, \"See what happens?\" He says, \"When the Holy Spirit comes in, it burns that nature out of you. &gt;&gt; And that old nature goes out behind you and it's always looking for an opportunity to come back into the seat of authority.\" &gt;&gt; Something along those lines. And when I heard that, all of a sudden, it struck me and I realized what I was calling the devil all those times was actually my first nature. It was my first husband that I was born with. And I caught the revelation. Oh, that was that first nature. That's why in Romans 7, Paul is telling the church, look, as long as as a woman's husband is alive, she's subject under the law. Has to has to live under that. And he brings down the type. And he's showing the only way that she can be free from that bondage is that first husband has to die and then he's free. And that's why Paul said, \"Then you can be married to another. Then you can be married to Jesus Christ.\" Look, a lot of us are trying to hang on to the world and hang on to the word at the same time. But I want to tell you, you got to die. That first nature gots to die. You got to repent of your sins. You got to call out say, \"Oh, God, help me. I want deliverance from the things. I don't want to listen to country music. I don't want to listen to the radio. I don't want to dress this way. I don't want to act this way. I don't want to watch these things.\" You got to realize there's another nature, a fierce nature. And that nature gots to die. And you got to call upon the name of the Lord with all your heart. Say, \"Lord, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm tired of the devil running me here and there and me never getting the victory and going through cycles of revival and death over and over from one camp to the next camp. I need to put a stake down. I need to be changed. I need to meet the pillar of fire and know that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that first man's got to die. [applause] &gt;&gt; And die. It did. [gasps] &gt;&gt; But you know, [sighs] you still got this little bag of bones. But you know, you realize that I' I've been given a promise to bring it under subjection. [gasps] &gt;&gt; My promised land might not be some boundaries set out there with with with landscape stakes, but I've been given this land. &gt;&gt; This is the place that I can express the evidence. This is where I can prove that he's the same yesterday, today, and the forever. And the things that come out of this mouth can declare he is risen. And the footsteps that I can take can show he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And my attitude and my joy can can show that he is not dead. &gt;&gt; He is alive. &gt;&gt; Where is the Welsh revival? Where is the bride's revival? &gt;&gt; You're looking at it. &gt;&gt; I'm the proof. &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence. I once was dead, &gt;&gt; but I have been made alive in Jesus Christ. I've been set free from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; How, Matthew? Well, I I believed. &gt;&gt; But you know, you can't even believe unless it's given to you to believe. You realize how rigged this thing is? &gt;&gt; And and and and I don't mind saying it because brother Donnie, I I needed that. &gt;&gt; I needed it to be rigged. &gt;&gt; And so I know that I make mistakes. Sure. I I I go through hard times and I fall down and and I realize I I'm being built up into the stature of a perfect man and coming into that place of of perfect love and and working out of those things and I realize there's there's still some some things in this pest house that that God is working on and and sometimes, you know, things can rub you a certain way and you don't have the right response. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, it starts first with taking God at his word. And I tell you what, we make salvation and we make the the baptism of the Holy Ghost complicated. &gt;&gt; It is not complicated. &gt;&gt; Are you tired of living the way you're living &gt;&gt; or I mean, if you're still enjoying it, look, I'll tell you this. This happened to me 6 months before my conversion. Because I tell you what, sin is a it's a it's a it's a hard taskmaster. I mean, them mud pits and them slaves that beat you in Egypt, I'm telling you what. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might enjoy it for a little while, but then you start to realize they'll start, you know, making you make bricks without straw. &gt;&gt; And you know that thing that used to get you high, it don't get you high anymore. &gt;&gt; And that thing you looked at that you like so much, it just don't do it for you anymore. &gt;&gt; And it ain't one movies, it's two movies. &gt;&gt; And it ain't 25 bucks an hour, it needs to be 30 bucks an hour. And it ain't 50 bucks an hour, it has to be 100. The things of the world, they'll never satisfy. never never never never never never never never satisfy &gt;&gt; the hunger and thirst of a true son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I got tired of of you know, living under that. And so I'll never forget I jumped out I I I was driving down the road and and I jumped out of my my my car and I ran down and I got in a ditch and and I I started talking to the Lord and and it's kind of funny looking back on it because I was tired of the bondage but I kind of still, you know, like doing it. &gt;&gt; But there came a day &gt;&gt; I was just tired of it all. I didn't want to do any of that stuff anymore. I &gt;&gt; I actually realized what it was doing to my life and how Satan was trying to rob me and I hated it. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. If if you're there, &gt;&gt; if you if it's in your heart and you keep want to run out with the things of the world, &gt;&gt; it'll be there for you. &gt;&gt; But I say if something in your heart say, you know what, that's right. It's such a late hour. I don't need to fool around. you start entertaining things of the world, it'll take you way further than you want to go. &gt;&gt; And I remember praying there and and uh you know, but I I I remember in my heart, you know, I I didn't I didn't really I didn't really want to give up those things. So, I'm fast forwarding and showing you that when that first initial cry of my heart came and I really meant business, but I just remember in my heart it was just calling upon the name of the Lord and you shall be saved. It first comes by believing. And and I was just in this as we as I it struck me, you know, that's the same thing that happened with John Ryan. You know, he come through the the the prayer line and and and he said, you know, God bless you. You're healed. And he went through and he said he come back through and said, I thought you said I was healed. He said, I thought you said you believed. &gt;&gt; I thought you said I had the Holy Ghost. I thought you said you had it. &gt;&gt; What are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; Are you waiting for a feeling? Are you waiting for I don't know why we're here, but we're here. Or are you looking by faith into the word of God and saying, \"God, you said if I repent of my sins and I'm baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall get the gift of the Holy Ghost.\" You know what brother Brandham told John Ryan? He said, \"If you believe it, then go out there and testify. Go into action.\" And you know what he did? He really believed. So he started going around town saying, \"I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed.\" And he actually had a testimony to go along with his faith. And you know the rest of the story that happened. He's sitting in that old barber chair and here they were making fun of him. and he went to testify. And once again, hey, God's healed me. And then his eyes come open. I want to tell you young people, if God give you a promise and you say, I got the Holy Ghost, don't let that old devil rob you of the Holy Ghost. You go feel free to testify, I've repented of my sins. I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and God give me the Holy Ghost. And if you've made a mistake or you've made a failure, get right back up and say, I plead the blood of Jesus Christ. God, give me the promise of the Holy Ghost. If I didn't overcome this time, I'll overcome the next time because God has given me a promise. And I'm heir to every single promise. And I got the faith to believe it. And there ain't no devil or spooky spirit that's going to rob me and take me away from my joy and my victory. Come on, people. Come on, young people. You got to testify about it. Brother Brandham goes on. He says, \"What what just in this this quote that we're reading, you got to believe first.\" Well, we just ask for the Lord to help us here. He said, 'What did Elijah tell the woman that he went to with nothing but a handful of milk? He said, 'Make me a cake first. The miracle will happen after you take God's word first. You begin to believe God's word and then the miracle takes place upon the word &gt;&gt; because the word is the seed that brings forth the miracle. Go to take the word first. The Holy Spirit gives it life like water falling from heaven. Jesus said the he said it is the spirit that quickenth the flesh that profitth you nothing. The words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life. He said in one place the seed word itself is what? The holy spirit energizes. &gt;&gt; Now I like that because when you think about something that's energized when something's energized it's stimulated. It's awakened. It's quickened. It's electrified. &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been electrified? &gt;&gt; I want to tell you it's a revelation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you when you get shocked and you get the revelation of of voltage, I want to tell you that type of revelation, you can't stand still. &gt;&gt; You're going to move. &gt;&gt; You're going to shout. You're going to do something. You're going to be do something like this. You're going to what? Wow. [screaming] Whoa. Wow. Good. Go. Woo. That that got some that got some electricity into it. I want to tell you that's the same thing with the message of the hour. When you get a revelation, look, it will move you. You can't stand still. You're going to shout. You're going to tell somebody. Somebody's going to look over you and say, say, \"Hey, why you acting like that? Hey, I've been electrified. I've been awakened. I've been stimulated. I got revelation.\" It'll put you into action. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's just like a seed with all the potential. It's just laying there, but it just needs to be energized. It just needs to be awakened. You know, it just reminds me as brother Brandon talks about how they everybody's saying, \"Hunger, fast, pray, hunger, fast, pray.\" He said, \"What are they doing?\" He said, \"They've missed the awakening of the bride.\" But God has sent a message by a vindicated prophet according to Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30. There has been a message that has come forth and the breaking of those seals to awaken the bride of Jesus Christ to all the potential that the word says that you are. Brother Brandham says it takes the spirit of God to bring life out of broken sisters. And the life must not come out of just an intellectual revival. It has to come out of the Bible, a word revival. And what that that word is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And when it falls today, and quickened, you get the same results you did in Acts 2. Exactly. It always had, it always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere. It takes the spirit. It takes atmosphere to do things. That's the reason you men are always taught to bring your children here. &gt;&gt; Here, &gt;&gt; here. &gt;&gt; Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together. Right? &gt;&gt; Because when we come together, there's an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; When we come together, we bring the licks of fire. When we come together, we know there's the pillar of fire. We know the angel of the Lord is here. He's present amongst us and we're taught to bring our kids here. Why? Because when we come together, there's an atmosphere and it takes atmosphere to do things. I pray there'd be such an atmosphere created here this morning. There'd be such an expectation. There be be people who are sick and tired of their task masters. There's people that want to get born again. There's people that want to get filled with the Holy Ghost. There's such an atmosphere fear here for salvation, an atmosphere here for uh for for healing. I tell you what, there could be an atmosphere created here that faith can rise up to believe all things. I want to tell you right now, this morning, we are se seated in the realms where all things are possible to them that believe right here in this atmosphere this morning in this church. The supernatural can take place. &gt;&gt; Why? because an atmosphere you know the prophet of God said down in your soul is a predestinated seed which is eternal life. &gt;&gt; It was always there &gt;&gt; and all the father has given me will come. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come. That means you're not going to just come halfway. &gt;&gt; You're not going to only come part of the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to come all the way because he said you're going to come all the way. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to maybe just move into some very familiar things. And maybe if we just need to act like we've never heard it before, &gt;&gt; but we've allowed things to become common to us. &gt;&gt; And and just what was on my heart is talking about the evidence of salvation and how a spooky spirit tries tries to to to rob you of it. My my heart for you young people I is is yes. Yes yes yes you are the bride of Jesus Christ. Yes, God has given you a promise and yes, God has promised you the Holy Ghost and and and maybe you're in a stage of justification or sanctification and you're believing for the the Holy Ghost. But I want to tell you I in in all of those stages, it's all the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's the word. It's the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's all a work of God in your life. And when God starts to move into your life, if if we start to doubt the word and doubt our experience and doubt our weapon, then the devil can corner you and he can start to discourage you and he can and you know what you instead of you going forward all a sudden you stop. And I can't tell you countless uh uh young people that that will come and and I'm not discouraging you to do that. You do that. I we we want to pray with you. We want you to come. You show who side that you're on. And many times they come for prayer and and what's on their heart is like I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost. I I you know I I might I want to tell you young people I I've come to the same conclusion after serving God for 101 15 years and knowing I got the Holy Ghost and knowing I've been changed and then I make some bad decision and do some things I shouldn't do and then I look into the word I'm like &gt;&gt; and then the prophet preach a message in such a way and I'm like man I brother Donnie I don't even know if I got it. Right? &gt;&gt; I mean, my goodness gracious, this is, &gt;&gt; wow, how could I ever be that? &gt;&gt; And then I go, &gt;&gt; okay, well, what what what happens if I don't got it? &gt;&gt; I mean, am I going to go back to the world? &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie, you know what? I realized I couldn't live it, so I'm just going to go down the Baptist church. &gt;&gt; Hey, what's your options? &gt;&gt; Like, really? &gt;&gt; What's your options? The problem is is we want the devil &gt;&gt; to give us options. &gt;&gt; Okay. What happens if I ain't got the Holy Ghost? Well, &gt;&gt; I'm going to repent of my sins. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say, Lord, you started the work. &gt;&gt; And you'll finish that work. &gt;&gt; And you said, if I repent of my sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And God is not a man that he shall lie. and Lord, if you never do another thing for me, you've already done enough for me. And then I start kind of feeling pretty good. And I realize, you know what? I maybe I messed up. But my Bible tells me my name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world. So whether I got it now or whether I get it tomorrow or whether I had it yesterday, it really don't matter because this thing is rigged. I am going in a rapture. I got a promise of the Holy Ghost. I got a promise of victory. Hallelujah. That old devil, you old spooky spirit trying to rob these young people of the evidence of salvation, of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Somebody here ought to just get mad and say, \"You old devil. You old spooky spirit. You've lied to me long enough. How you like me now? I got it. I got it. I got the evidence. Shut up in my bones. Glory. [applause] Now you can start walking &gt;&gt; because as soon as you listen to something that's not in the word, it stops your progress. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe I You know what? What? What's Nelly? Remember Nelly had a real experience? &gt;&gt; You know, she's walking down the road and all a sudden, oh, you know, &gt;&gt; high school prom, dance, friends, neighbor. &gt;&gt; Nowadays, it's all on your phone, Instagram, old friend went to school with. I'll see how they're doing. I'll like their profile. I'll just see what it's all about. I'll just stop for a moment. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you're pulled into some atmosphere. You're pulled into some temptation. And all of a sudden, you're in the arms of another man. And she came to herself. And I tell you what, people want to condemn Nelly Nelly Sanders. But you know what? She knew where to go. &gt;&gt; She didn't run down to the Baptist church. She didn't run down to this. You know, she said, \"I'm going to go to the prophet of God. She ran on down to the prophet and said, \"Oh, brother Brandon, brother Brandon, Brother Brandon, I messed up. I really made a mistake. I really messed up now. I've ruined it.\" Prophet took her. And he started to pray for her. And he started to rebuke that spirit. And you know what he said? He said, \"You old Satan, you old devil. She didn't mean to do it. Hey young people, a lot of you didn't mean to do it. You were trapped into it when you showed up here. You didn't mean to give into those lust devils and all those things. There was just a nature hanging on you. You didn't mean to do it. But a vindicated prophet said, \"Satan, you take your hands off of her. I claim her for the glory of Almighty God. And I will stand here this morning. I will claim every young person, every daughter and son of God for the glory of Almighty.\" Satan, you take your hands off these young people. They are free to serve God with all of their heart, with all of their life, with all of their soul. They've been pro promised the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They can put every devil, every demon, every suicide, every complex under their feet. Why? They've been predestinated to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, what about it, church? &gt;&gt; In an atmosphere like this, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Why wait any longer? &gt;&gt; We're more than able. &gt;&gt; I want to bring some evidence. [gasps] We listen to the devil so much. We listen to some spooky spirits and we've been ministering about the evidence of salvation, the Holy Ghost, and how Satan's always wanting to rob you of that. But what do you have to do first? You got to believe. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. The real invisible union, the real genuine eagles here. My sheep know my voice. A stranger they won't follow. Why? It was put in there by predestination. You were for ordained to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; You were in God before the foundation of the world. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I can still get excited. &gt;&gt; I can I can't even comprehend that, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; Call me a nut. Call me a lunatic. Call me a fanatic. I believe it. Something in here is more real than my five senses. It's more real than my emotions. It's more real than all of the other things. There's another uh sense, the sixth sense of faith that when I hear that, oh, glory to God, that's my reality. [applause] &gt;&gt; All right, all the young people in here, raise your hand. I mean, if the change is on, it's going the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I know time's speeding up, but come on. You walked in at 15 and now you're 50. &gt;&gt; Come on, all you young people, raise your hands. &gt;&gt; If you're 30 and under, raise your hand. We got some that are over and they're already claiming their promise. Glory, I haven't lost one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, God is speaking to you and and we we could go into it, but we take for granted that we live under the revelation of Malachi 4:5. &gt;&gt; I can't express enough of how privileged we are &gt;&gt; to hear a vindicated prophet. not not a gift of prophecy, &gt;&gt; but a very mouthpiece piece of God &gt;&gt; to tell you his thoughts of you. &gt;&gt; This is God's mind to you young people. &gt;&gt; And I want you to believe it &gt;&gt; because when we catch a revelation of these things, it it doesn't matter what comes or goes. You have an anchor. You have an absolute. &gt;&gt; And you're not subject to to trends and fashions and emotions. Yes, we're going to have hurt feelings. We're going to have broken hearts. There's a lot of things on this side that mold our character. You know, Brother Brandham said you, you know, it's it is joy. It is wonderful. But, you know, it's it's also a way of agony and suffering. So, we're not taking away from those things. You're going to have to go through hard times and through journey. But when you have a revelation in your soul to know God's thoughts towards you, it's the victory. &gt;&gt; All right, so some familiar things. We got some young people here. We'll try to move quickly. It is Sunday. We only got one service. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's all right, brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; You were fore orained to a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world. You're only manifested in this day for his honor and glory. How can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God? Yes, sir. Which you are a part of that word by predestination. Because look, the God God is the word. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Well, if he always was the word, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God, then you were in God. the word. The part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world. He seen you. He knew you. He predestinated you to it. &gt;&gt; The part that you're to play. &gt;&gt; You are actually playing out a part &gt;&gt; that was predestinated in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; He knew your stature. He knew how tall. He knew how short. He knew how wide. And I want to tell you, we might laugh and chuckle at those things, but Satan does a lot of damage with the characteristics. Look, I should have given up a long time ago with a nose this big, &gt;&gt; but God knew how I would show up. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we got to embrace that part of the revelation, too. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because we'll battle complexes, &gt;&gt; generational curses. Why does my family have to be this way? Why is this all God knew exactly how you would show up? Look, look, when you do a play, you pick people to fit the part, &gt;&gt; right? So, something was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. He knew, I'm going to pick you. I'm going to pick you. I'm going to pick you. You're exactly what I want to be in the end time. and Lady Oia to prove to the God of the evil age. You might have come into my Eden in the beginning, but I sent my pride into Satan's Eden and she's going to tear your kingdom down. He knew the way you would show up. He knew how tall. He knew how short you would be. He knew the generational curses. He knew the things that you would struggle. But he predestinated you. He wrote your name on the Lamb's book of life. And he said, \"Here she is, right on time, right on quue. Play your part, church. [cheering] Play your part. Play it with all [screaming] of your heart. With everything that's in you, play your part. [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when churches do plays, you know, they pick different people to do parts. &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember we did a church play one time and [sighs] we had a brother in our church named Brother Towanda. And I don't know how he got the part, but he got to be a palm tree. And you know, I'm kind of glad I didn't get that part. But some people want that part. Some people want the part behind the curtains. &gt;&gt; I'll do the sound. I'll I'll sew the things together, but I ain't getting out on that stage. But whatever part you're predestinated to play and you know, I I got I got to thinking about that when I read that quote. It said, \"The part you play.\" I started thinking about church plays. And I remember thinking about a play that was done at Louisiana camp maybe some 25 years ago or something like that. And I got the image in my head because, you know, they they picked Brother Eli Arbagast. If any of you know your big old tall brother, you know, we always knew who was playing Goliath. it was brother Eli, you know, so they picked him and then they picked some brothers, you know, to be David and and I was laughing about that and then it reminded me here not too long ago. I was having some fellowship with brother Matt Morris and and somehow that came up and he goes, \"You know what?\" He goes, \"I was the rock and I got to and I was in my study and I got to think about I started laughing it and I sent brother Matt I sent brother Matt the the the text. said, \"Man, I got to think in that play about and about, you know, about how how Goliath had to play his part and and and and you know, David had to play his part and how you played the rock.\" And he text me back and said, \"Somebody had to do it.\" I tell you what, I actually got a noise complaint from the office downstairs because I realized, \"Hey, somebody got to play the part. If I'm going to be the rock, I don't care what it is. Let me be a rock in his hand. Go ahead and put me in your sling, Lord. Throw me at every giant, every devil. I'll knock them out. I'll knock them down. As long as I'm on your hand. I don't care what part I play. As long as it's the part that the Lord Jesus wants me to play. &gt;&gt; Play your part, church. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You don't get all dressed up and memorize your lines and rehearse everything and then it comes time for your part. &gt;&gt; Oh no. We all go through it. I'm going to forget my lines. How many have ever got up to sing a song special and my goodness, your mind just goes blank. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we feel like that. We've we've gone to church. We've we've had the experience and everything and then in the moment or whatnot. Don't worry. He said, \"I'll be with you even in you. The conductors right there. If you lose your lines here, here's the sheet music. &gt;&gt; I got the sheet music right here. &gt;&gt; If you forgot, just get back. Turn on a tape. &gt;&gt; If you forget, get into your Bible. If you forget, get into prayer. He's right there. &gt;&gt; Good time. &gt;&gt; Look, dress rehearsal's over. &gt;&gt; Time of playing games is over. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; This is time to go home. &gt;&gt; I mean, we we are right on the cusp. Even brother Donnie shared this morning. And I think right now uh the pope made some allegiance with with with you know the ecumenical council. Everything's tightening up. It's all coming together. Look, Satan's getting his superman and the world and all the ecumenical councils and everything's you what it's a uniting time and sign. The world's uniting. Christianity is re uniting. Everything out there's uniting. The devil's reuniting. Everything's uniting. But oh, glory to God. There is a bride and she is uniting under the headship of the word, the Lord Jesus Christ. And what are we uniting with? We're uniting with the word. [screaming] What are we uniting for? The rapture. [applause] Oh, hallelujah. It's time to play your part. &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking about that. Here stoods David. You know, David had to play his part. And here's Goliath standing there making his boast. We'll try to just bring this towards a close by the help of God somehow. So, here's here's Goliath. He's making his boast. And to think that the armies of the living God, they they had forgot who they were. They were letting their own enemy, the the the the the devil, just stand there and defy the armies of the living God. But I love what the prophet of God said. He said, you know, his boast happen to fall on the wrong ears. &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. It's time to quit listening to that boast. And when he starts talking to do something about it, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, you're going to get me. I'm going to get you. &gt;&gt; And you take the sword of the word. So here them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them them that challenge came upon David's ears but you know what David was predestinated to meet the challenge &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; David had the victory before he even showed up &gt;&gt; what about you &gt;&gt; before you even showed up in Lady Oia the playwright was already written Your part was already chosen. It was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world world. You just showed up to manifest your part. And you are the victorious bride of Jesus Christ. There ain't no Goliath. There ain't no devil that can stop you. You already had the victory when you showed up. Look, that's what the prophet of God said about David. He already had the victory when he got there. So, he didn't come into the battle hanging his head. He come into that battle dancing and swinging that sling. He said, \"You come into and defy the name of the Lord with your gods and the Philistine armies, but I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.\" He went dancing right into that battle and he had that rock of faith and he slung that right out and knocked that devil down. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I said, \"What about you?\" The prophet of God said this, he knowed where he was at. Hallelujah. Everyone sitting here, you're person you, everyone sitting here tonight, you're positionally in Christ. God has confirmed it. election, calling, anointing, placing. &gt;&gt; He elected you and called you. He elected you and called you. &gt;&gt; Then he anointed you with the Holy Spirit. And now he's placed you in the body of Christ. Each one of you is David's. &gt;&gt; Where's the Goliath? Who's the Goliath, Brother Brandham? That cancer that's eating you up. That tumor that's hanging on you, them cataracts on your eyes, that crippled arm, every little thing looks at it and says it can't be done. The devil says you might as well quit believing. You might as well settle down because you never can no more get well. Your doctor said so. All of the rest of them said so. You can't get well. But the Christ that made you stop your drinking, your smoking, your lying, and stealing that saved you from a life of drunkenness, from riing, from a sin and a devil's grave is if God can do that for you, he can save you from your TV. He can save you from your cancer. He's the Goliath. Don't take his boast. Stand in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and challenge him to a showdown. Amen. I feel religious positionally. You are in Christ. If the believer knowed his position, he'd have it. God's great spirit is here. And his Holy Ghost is ready to fall on anybody that will believe. Do you believe? Do you believe? Hey church, play your part. You're anointed for the job. Hallelujah. [applause] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; I'm a winner and you're a loser. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to heaven and you're going to hell. Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Facts. &gt;&gt; Facts. predetermined. &gt;&gt; I'm just playing my part. &gt;&gt; So, don't mind me. &gt;&gt; I'm just happy about the part God gave me to play. &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a palm tree. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a sinner. &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a drunk. He didn't call you to be in bondage. He didn't call you to lust after those last devils. He called you to be an overcoming son and daughter of God to put every devil and every disease and every sickness under your feet. I say, \"Boo devil. I'm going to play my part and I'm going to believe [screaming] with all of my heart. I'm not basing it upon what I see. I'm not basing upon the past and I'm not basing on the future. I'm basing it on what he said. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; For my Bible tells me in Romans 8:28, \"And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, &gt;&gt; whom he did predestinate then he also called. Is anybody hearing the call of God? &gt;&gt; May maybe maybe you you maybe right now you feel like you don't got the Holy Ghost and there's no hope for you. But do you feel God pulling upon your heart? &gt;&gt; You feel the call of God on your life. Listen to this. This is powerful. &gt;&gt; This right here will give you victory. &gt;&gt; You can whoop the devil with this. &gt;&gt; Come on. Have we forgot &gt;&gt; how powerful this thing is? &gt;&gt; It's so powerful. When our Lord was here, &gt;&gt; he used it &gt;&gt; to whip the devil. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, I come from the same material. &gt;&gt; So then I'll just take the same old Bible, &gt;&gt; same word. God's called you. If there's a call of God upon your life, &gt;&gt; them he's also called. Them he's also justified. And them he's also Them he's also justified. Them he's also glorified. &gt;&gt; I told you it's rigged. &gt;&gt; David picking up out of Why Christ speak. David would say, \"The God that delivered me from the lion, the God that delivered me from the paws of that bear, he'll more than deliver me from that Philistine.\" Now, put whatever it is you're battling right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The God that justified me, the God that called me, he's the God that'll fill me with the Holy Ghost, he'll deliver me from that problem, here I come. I meet you in the name of the Lord, God of Israel. Amen. He prophet of God said he didn't pray through. He was already prayed through. God prayed him through before the foundation of the world. He was anointed for the job. He just had to speak and go forward. Glory to God. Hey, I might have messed up and forgot to pray this morning. But praise the name of the living God. He already prayed me through before the foundation of the world. So maybe I didn't dot all my eyes and cross all my tees and I walked into a problem and maybe I didn't get prayed up and I wasn't listening to tape. But you know what? It doesn't change that I'm a son of God. I can look that devil right in the face and say, \"You know what? I made a misstep. I made a mistake. But Jesus Christ prayed me through before the foundation of the world. And I'll still whip you, devil [applause] &gt;&gt; because the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said it's here and stronger I and greater than it ever was in the true word bride. &gt;&gt; He said hold on to that word. Fill your heart and your mouth with it. Just going to work towards a close quickly. We got to do weapons. We got to fight with this. &gt;&gt; Some some of the some of the greatest scriptures uh that have done me the most good is my Bible tells me there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So then we allow condemnation and we allow those things to paralyze us. &gt;&gt; I I I did it again. I &gt;&gt; I did it again. I I feel like I can't even sing. Second, you know what? All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; And if you made a mistake, then we need more of God to overcome it the next time. &gt;&gt; You repent and you get up and that feeling. Now, there's a difference between conviction and condemnation. &gt;&gt; And the devil's pretty sly. He'll try to make you mix up the two. &gt;&gt; Conviction will lead you to repentance. &gt;&gt; Condemnation will hold you in sin. Yes, sir, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You fall to a temptation, I just, you know, I'll make it right later. No, be quick to repent. &gt;&gt; Be zealous to repent. That's the That's what should be for the age. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said the the the zealous to say, I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Somehow that went out of the maybe went out of some of the churches a long time ago. They they &gt;&gt; I'm right. Everybody else is wrong. Some people, they're so right. No, we we need to be quick to repent, &gt;&gt; you know, and if you feel something condemning you and and it's it's keeping you from the promises of God, it's keeping you from wanting to pray. It's keeping you from wanting to re, you know, you know, you're like, what what is it? But but conviction should say, oh God, I'm so sorry. It should drive you to your knees in repentance. &gt;&gt; There's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin. Oh my, those are promises that bring you through hard times and trials as you're growing in the stature of a perfect man. And brother Bandham said this in the invisible union. He said, \"He, the bridegroom, took away your shame.\" &gt;&gt; Just a few more moments. And put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. That's what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Your first husband that you were married to the world, &gt;&gt; right? We don't have to go into that. We We got a picture, right? &gt;&gt; Young people, are you seeing that first nature that's been warning against you? &gt;&gt; Can you see it better now? &gt;&gt; Why Paul said you got to be married to another? That first husband that you were married to, the world, the anointed bridegroom, which for ordained you, has washed you by the washing of the water, by the church, &gt;&gt; by your good works, &gt;&gt; by your impeccable standing and your impeccable attendance to Word of Life Church. by your knowledge of the message. &gt;&gt; By how many tapes you've memorized, &gt;&gt; by how well you've been able to study out and explain the Bible. &gt;&gt; Oh, are the signs and wonders that you've performed or how powerful your gift is. &gt;&gt; No, that that no, that don't sound right. &gt;&gt; Remember, we already went through that on Friday. Salvation is of the Lord. It's not salvation plus your good works. &gt;&gt; It's not Christ plus. It's Christ alone. From start to finish, salvation is of the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, that that don't sound right, does it? You might find that in the Almanac, but it's not in God's Bible. By the washing of the water, by the word. In the word. And I want to tell you that's why God sent a vindicated prophet to restore the word and to restore the faith back to the original word. &gt;&gt; Because without the opening of the seals, it's a closed book. &gt;&gt; And it's the very revelation of the age, the word of our age that's washing you. &gt;&gt; Is that all right, brother Donnie? &gt;&gt; You You can't find it any other place. So listen now. He says, \"You are standing completely justified.\" That's right. &gt;&gt; As though you never did it at the beginning. Now I just asked the musicians to come to help me bring this towards a close. [snorts] I I I enjoyed that song, I've been changed. I believe it's even in the lyrics says no more shame. But think about this. I say, \"What a what what a message. What a word.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That could take a sinner. &gt;&gt; And pluck them out of the muck and mire and not only wash them up and and cleanse them up, but by the revelation of it, not a partial revelation under Luther. No, this is the full revelation of justification, &gt;&gt; which means you never did it in the first place. That ought to set somebody free here this morning. &gt;&gt; The devil's been trying to make you feel guilty. He's been trying to put condemnation on you. Maybe you feel like you lost your virtue and no one's ever going to love you right and you'll never be able to uh uh fit. And the devil's trying to rub your nose and all of your past and all your failures and all your mistakes. But if you're hearing the call of God, God is God is calling to you. And right now by the full revelation of justification, a vindicated prophet is telling you that you are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You are perfect. Oh, praise the wonderful name of the living God. It doesn't matter about my past. It doesn't matter about my sin. It doesn't matter about what that spooky spirit has tried to tell me. God has syndicate a vindicated word, a vindicated message to tell me you are perfect. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in perfect faith said then the only thing you have to do is believe what you are. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what you are. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what the word says you are. Play your part. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what the word says you are. &gt;&gt; You are standing completely justified as though you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Now, just picking this up out of Christ, the mystery of God revealed. Justified in his sight. Why are we justified? We are his victory. &gt;&gt; I'm the proof. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence &gt;&gt; justified. Why are why are we justified? We are his victory. The church is his victory. We come forth in the last days with the glorious gospel showing his victory. He died for this purpose. And we are proof of his victory. Amen. And when we see him coming down and living among the church, that's his victories shows that they couldn't keep him in the grave. Neither can they keep us. That's right. We're bound, right? And we're already potentially arised because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominations and creeds to an eternal word of the eternal God which is himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday, today and forever. [screaming] You are his victory. You are the proof of his resurrection. You are the very proof of the message of the hour. Where is the Welsh revival? Where is the bride revival? I am the bride. Where is the message of the hour? I am the message of the hour. I am the proof of Malachi 4:5. I am the proof of Revelations 10 1-7. Why? Because I'm the very spoken word that has taken on flesh in the evening time. I am the evidence. [applause] Hallelujah. Why don't you praise God? Praise God for the evidence. Praise God for the Holy Ghost. Praise God for the message. [applause] He sent back the evidence, the Holy Ghost, and I got it. &gt;&gt; We know that song. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I feel pretty good. &gt;&gt; Cuz I know what I used to be. But then I heard a message. &gt;&gt; It's not where you belong. &gt;&gt; It's not what you're here for. &gt;&gt; You're not here for a career. &gt;&gt; You're not here for some job. &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose &gt;&gt; because God thought of you &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And he loved you. And he thought of you and he said, \"You know what? &gt;&gt; I want to have a bride. And I'm going to I'm going to place her right at the very climax of my great play and great drama. &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, they played their part out in the beginning and on down through the patriarchs of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and on down through Elijah and Elisha and David and all the judges.

Please pray for Wanda Batman. She's in the ER with severe pain. Also, please pray for Josh and Megan Collins son Dawson. They ordered an echo tomorrow on his heart to check for any abnormalities. Every time you come off of seat pad, he struggles. Now, we believe the power of God that we've been feeling here ain't just good to make us feel good. &gt;&gt; It's not here just to stir our emotions. And it does stir our emotions. &gt;&gt; But we believe he ministers to the needy today. &gt;&gt; Can we pray together right now? And &gt;&gt; maybe somebody else didn't get personally ministered to today and you have a need. Just say, \"Lord, be mindful of me. Would you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for this wonderful time that we've had together, this visitation, Lord, of your presence here today. We thank you for these youth meetings. And we realize, Lord, it just wasn't for the youth, but we believe it's for all of us. Lord, you see, Lord Jesus, these needs that we've read. And Father, we're praying today that you'd move our sister Wanda Bman. You see the pain that she's dealing with and you know the cause of it. Lord, we pray, Father, for Dawson Collins and we're asking for your mercy for him. Dear Jesus, may your hand be extended, Lord. I know it's hundreds of miles away from us. They're in Ohio. But we know, dear God, there's no distance to you. Father, every individual here today that has a need in their home, their life, their family, would you move for them, Jesus? We pray that you'd restore our brother Matt's strength. Lord, we thank you, Father, for using him today to be a blessing to us Friday, yesterday as well. We're so grateful, Lord Jesus. We believe that we are living testimonies that Calvary was a success. &gt;&gt; May you go with us now, Lord. The food that's been prepared, may you bless it, nourish it our bodies. We ask, Lord God, in the name of Jesus. How many can say it's been really good to be in the house of the Lord? [applause] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God bless you. Thank you, brother Matt. God bless you. May God restore his strength. And you keep this in mind as you go today. Maybe you're a little bit weary, a little bit down. You've been through a lot of things and may have had mistakes and failures, but keep this in mind in the coming days, will you? Your name is already there. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your name &gt;&gt; is waiting on you &gt;&gt; to get there. &gt;&gt; And God don't make no mistakes. [applause] Your name is there. Amen. [applause] Bless you. Sing some. We'll be dismissed. God bless you.

why I'm happy [Music] brother oh can't you see why I'm so happy I've [Music] accepted the word of of the Lord the reve word that was spoken by the prophet of Mal oh can't you see [Applause] [Music] one I'm so happy I've accepted the word of the Lord aren't you glad Pro of can't you see why this little bride so happy we've accepted the word of Our Lord the reveal word that was SP by the prophet of Caroline and I were talking about it just this afternoon wondering where would we be if it was for this great message maybe I'd be a Pentecostal still a Pentecostal pastoring a Pentecostal church maybe an evangelist traveling around from Pentecostal Church to Pentecostal church maybe some of you had still been on a bar stool maybe you had been in a Baptist Church or some other type of church but God's grace God's grace amen I'm so grateful for it Joel 2 verse 23 Joel 2 verse 23 and then we'll skip down to verse 28 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former for rain and the latter rain in the first month verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and he believes in true prophecy amen your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days while I pour out my spirit now for us that are westerners and having been under the influence of Christianity most of our life if you would have been a Jew when this was prophesied by Joel it would have seemed seemed like absolute heresy to you because prophets were the ones of Sal Visions nobody else prophets were the ones that had God's spirit nobody else so you can imagine when they heard this prophecy in their day and they thought this man was out of his mind prophecy is tricky you see prophecy has a timeline on it now I know that some of you have probably seen some of the videos that have been put together and um I've gotten several different ones in the last few weeks and it's been people charismatic preachers and different types of preachers that have taken the things that brother brandham said about seeing a woman either being the president it would be a woman president or the Catholic Church put it on YouTube and lots of people of course have seen it and they themselves if they didn't cover exactly the way he said it now you know what that's going to do since Cala was not elected yesterday as president the danger with prophecy is that it can look like prophecy and yet not be now if Kamala Harris would have been voted in by the people of the United States it still would not mean she was the woman the prophet saw that's right right so it has to be the right person the right time so whenever we look at Joel's prophecy it was exactly the same way and yet the Fulfillment of it they probably looked for it for years and years but a man anointed by the Holy Ghost for the season when it fell said this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel so sometimes we look at prophecy and we're thinking is this it is that it could that be it could that be it could that be it I don't mind telling you some message preachers put some things together a while back and I mean just by reading it on a couple of chats that I'm on I thought woo better be careful your brother you're going to get you're going to get in hornet nest here you're going to lay it out here to where if you're not careful you're going to get yourself hemmed up in a box that's why you don't hear me doing that ignorant stuff if God's Prophet didn't know whether or not as a woman or a church who are we that we think we do come on come on now so the best thing for us to do is just say Lord help me to find what's going on where the time is what's right I'm so glad that we can have that attitude I me like to be remembered tonight as we pray have a prayer call here for our brother Tyler I see him back there in the back tonight he had some needs he wanted us to to remember him for also I heard from Brother Wade and sister Anna altland today and they're in the need of prayer we have several of course in our church family that's fighting some real tough times right now sickness and things let's just remember them and take them before the Lord today Heavenly Father we count it oh once again such a great honor that we can be here on Wednesday night what a privilege how we love church on Wednesday night it just seems like it's such a boost for us Lord to help us I'm so glad that we don't have to go just from Sunday to Sunday I know there's churches all over the world and that's that's the only time they can get buildings and so on but I'm so grateful that we can have a midweek service lord it's just like another Holy Ghost Shop full of Holy Ghost steroids for us we just love coming together and singing and praising and praying and hearing your word thank you for it Lord I pray it never becomes common place to us Lord Jesus now as we approach you father we're asking for the needs among your children all the requests that was signified by the raising of a hand and we pray father that you would just help each one we have several in our church Lord that's dealing with some real difficult times right now we pray that you'd be mindful of them father I pray for brother Wade and sister Anna Lord that's so looking forward to being church tonight dear God that just things worked out to where they couldn't be but we pray that you'd be mindful of them this prayer cloth that I have in my hand tonight father from my young brother I pray that you'd minister to him Lord dear God help me tonight as I try to bring forth the word what you placed upon my heart today Lord help me to get out of the way Lord we we realize that our nation has come through a a very difficult time time a time of great Division and a lot of trauma and a lot of things that's that's went on and Lord I know that no matter how an election goes there's always going to be people disappointed but Lord I pray there may be people that we would differ with as far as our political views and all that but Lord I happen to know of an individual that at the last presidential election his wife got so distraught because it didn't go the way she thought it would and should and she got under such stress and such pressure that she wind up taking her life so Lord some of our fellow Americans tonight they're crying they're sad oh we may laugh at them cuz we're of the opposite party but they're still part of our nation Lord so I pray you'd help them because I realize Satan loves these opportunities to make people so despondent that they just take their life we know it don't make no difference who's in there anyway as far as being peace and bringing all that to the Earth there's only one that can do that and that's you but Lord however long that we can live here and have peace we certainly desire it but be mindful of us Lord God help us not to bring politics so into our lives and into our church that we don't even speak to one another because we're of a different political party and we can see it happening inside our message ranks not So Much by politics but by division of doctrinal issues help us I pray father will we ever grow up it's no wonder the Rapture hasn't come yet Lord it's a it's evident we've not grown up enough we're still fighting like children fighting like babies but help us I pray father speak to us your word may we have an element tonight Lord where we can grow as we hear your word father in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated now just in case tonight some of y'all are Wonder wondering did I vote Yes I did and let me tell you how I voted because it was a three-way election that I voted in the prophet describes it this way God voted for me the devil voted against me and the outcome will depend upon which way I voted come on so you know who I voted for almighty God Amen so that way I win in every election it don't really matter thank you Lord aren't you glad that we're part of that tonight let us go immediately now into the resume of the church ages from the church age book page 377 and let's resume on what we've been looking about on the the latter rain the former and the latter rain truly this is part of the prophecy of this hour where we're living you know it's sort of like if you go into a mall and you could go this way or that way or that way or and and you don't know where where you're going um most generally when you walk in an entrance whether it's on the east side the West Side the north side South Side whatever it is whenever you walk into that and they're going to have this large kios type of thing there one of the first things that they're going to identify is you are here so you are here in front of Kirklands in front of you know bels or whatever it is but it just so happens you're not looking for that store you're looking for Sears or you're looking for whatever more but you can't get to the other place if you don't know where you are so you got to find out where you are and then find out okay ultimately what I'm wanting to do I'm wanting to get ready to get in the Rapture so I can leave this world is that what we want we want to be ready we believe we're in the age of the Rapture so we need to find out where we are so Satan doesn't always work only on trying to confuse the people of where they're going but try to confuse them of where they are now dis sensationally if he can confuse people and try to tell them that they're actually still under the third word or the third ray of light or they've not really moved into the fourth ray of light or the fourth word that God said would come in the last days then what they're going to do is there in proximity to where they need to go it's going to put them way off so they're trying to look and say okay so where are we where are we you see that's where with the majority of Christendom today they don't have no clue where we are prophetically so the Lutheran there's several dispensation behind the Methodist there's several dispensations behind the Pentecostals are behind for some of the message people that have gone no farther than just God Center Prophet they are behind also and why does Satan do that because he knows they'll never get to where they need to be if they don't know where they are it's one reason why that so many people constantly fight the thing do I have the Holy Ghost do I or don't I well sometimes I think I do sometimes I think I don't I believe I do after that service oh yes I know that I do and then a preacher will preach another service and it leaves you hanging well I'm not sure now I don't know where I'm at don't you understand why he does that it's to confuse you it's to confuse you with your walk with God you cannot have abundant growing revelatory Fai in your walk with God if you're still struggling am I Born Again or not am I just Justified or Sanctified I don't know I need to know where I'm at I mean those what I'm talking about now I believe with all of my heart that in this last days that God has given us a message that we can apply the token with but it is not just a message of the token it is a message of assurance that we can know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have passed from deaths unto life and then what does that do that helps us to be identified with where we are well if we know we're truly born again then we know when we hear messages preached that are calling us to a closer walk with God then by that being able to identify where we are then we know that message is not telling us that we need the Holy Ghost it's telling us we need to let the Holy Ghost we have mature itself and grow out of us and we're being corrected in that way but if a person is constantly going back and forth well I don't know if I got the holy ghost or or not I think I do I don't know if I do or not whenever they hear sermons they process it through that mixed state because they don't know where they are it's time for every person in this church to know where you are with God men women boys girls every one of us so we can know exactly where we are so we can go on from where we are and be what God has called us to be now let's watch this also then how that the church ages parallel the individual walk before God so watch this in page 377 paragraph 2 this age started just after the turn of the 20th century now notice the time frame where we are this is in the resume of the ages and it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost now remember this is the age when the true Brad is going to return to being the way she was at Pentecost not UA Street Pentecost but the original now remember what makes it so confusing sometimes is because we have two dispensations that are going to be called by similar names so the original was called the original Pentecost then another one happens in 1906 what do they call it Pentecostal so both of them now are going to have a move of God now watch this it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost no she's not returning to be the church but the bride we know there must be of necessity a return of dynamic power so it's not just intellectual it's not just reading it's not just knowledge it's not just quoting quotes quoting scriptures but there must be of necessity a return of dynamic power the Believers sense this in their spirits and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century now watch what's going going on the Believers sense this in their spirit so they're walking into the mall of God and they sense in their Spirit there's a promise there's a promise God God wants to restore God wants to send something back to us God wants to wants us to be on fire God wants us to have the manifestation of the gifts and the promised word and they begin to cry and they begin to pray now watch they're finding out where they are they're lacking something they need more now their Methodist grandmothers and grandfathers had shouted their mothers and fathers had become the Highway of Holiness people and some of the independent Pentecostals but it hasn't really yet merged so the Pentecostal is basically just a an upgrade on the the Nazarene and the Methodist but they still didn't have the restoration of gifts but they shouted and they more emotion was coming in the church services and they would pass out on the floor and they'd get fans and fan them and they' lay on the floor and theyd get water and pour it in their face I ain't talking about Pentecostals this was Methodist and Nazarene and hus people but now Watch What Happens what seemed to be the answer now you talking about tricky brother sister so genuine sincere people of God are seeking God's face they're sensing it in their Spirit they're looking at the mall directory as we would say and it's Sav you all are right here you need more than the methodus you need more than the nazarenes you need more and they began to pray and pray and what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit now remember the prophet said it seemed to be the answer so what did did they take this as oh my this is what they had on the day of Pentecost this is the original church it's happened again in California it's in Zeus the Street Revival this is it this is the original bride move come on now well it seemed that way I kind of figured y'all be quiet but I didn't think it'd be this soon it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration oh this is what we've waited for for years God said I'll restore sayith the Lord all the Canam all the Palmer worm the caterpillar I'll do it I'll do it now what's what's going on Satan is trying to confuse them on where they are and the prophecy at hand it all has to do with season and timing so they're convinced brother John this is acts two it's it's it's here it's on the earth now watch it was in believe that this this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not sir for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain amen the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come but as far as they were concerned they didn't need him anyway so instead of looking by the word and saying okay well we are part of it but it don't end here there there comes something greater than us this is the restoration of gifts but instead of leaving their message where God put it as the restoration of gifts they said this is the definite evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost now when they added those few words words the spirit of organization got in this move then everybody that spoke in tongues as far as the way they looked at it had the Holy Ghost we've been there done that ain't we Lance oh yeah well as soon as you spoke in tongues that was it you got the Holy Ghost now think what Satan had done sincere people crying praying seeking God looking in the Bible hungering and thirsting after God no wonder the prophet said if it's God you seek be sure it's God you get right good advice don't you think now what so they thought and taught that what happened in 190 six was the light of rain but they had it backwards the light of rain can only come after the former Reign comes first and the prophet had not even been born yet certainly had not come to his maturity in his message to bring the word now notice as he goes on he says that the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come but we've got this group then that was come out in 1906 and they made the claim we are the original Pentecostals we are the original it's been born just like it was and Acts 2 but when you go to reading Acts 2 compared to what they had it wasn't or acts 8:16 or acts 8 or any of them other places praise the Lord but yet they made the claim to originality to originality you see the Catholic Church does exactly the same thing and the bride makes the same claim that's the very claim of all the churches they are the original well I'll tell you how we're going to know who is come on the one who leaves the world in a body change that's right that will be the latter rain and the latter rain will anoint their former Reign you see only those who receive the former Reign under the prophet's Ministry of Malachi 4 will actually have seed life to be anointed for the latter rain so Pentecost then had it B backwards now did they have great manifestation of gifts yes there was great healing there was signs there was wonders there was Miracles my brother Jim Woodson was telling us whenever we went over into badine North Carolina making some deliveries over there and some of his family was over there and he was telling us about some of the people and they used to prophesy and have prophecies that was just unbelievable the prophecies that they give out absolutely incredible not some of this gener IC stuff that we hear today but you you'll be here and you'll go there and you'll do this and you'll do that and happen exactly to the letter didn't it brother Jim and you know some of the ones even that I saw in Pentecost Lance and his family also have seen and some of you with your backgr but yet making that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the denominational spirit that Satan wanted now notice what he said thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we've kept pointing out to you and it also was devil power so can you imagine in a church meeting the Holy Ghost is falling and people are being blessed and getting saved and my speaking in tongues and whatever more that they were doing and demons were moving right in that same service and people were becoming possessed by demons and it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences and this is what I say to us as message people if we are not careful we are heading to the same fulfillment of this quote right here we're going to make our own fences we're going to make our own this is what we believe and we don't believe nothing else but that period stop that's the end of it bless God I'll tell you one thing and if you don't see it the way we do you ain't going what what's the difference between us in any other organization when we do that my we can't even go to a to a Mee and because well I'll tell you one thing they don't believe this the way I do you know what if we're not careful we're going to get to a place we can't go nowhere we won't have no confidence in nobody but oursel and you get that away and you're losing fellowship with god well come on somebody say amen amen oh my notice they wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did look at all the fences friends that are around us look at the fences many of you that have been around the message for years and years you've been in one fence and into another and out of that one into another what's a fence for it's to group people or animals or something together and put a fence around them and keep them in there and not let nobody in or not let nobody out well bless God I'll tell you one thing you can't come to our church if you don't so and so we won't let you do who in the world gave you the keys to the kingdom who in the world made you the bishop over God's people and their souls to say you can't come boy if you don't have church the way we do at our church you ain't even having Church who made your church the example for everybody in the message well Hallelujah notice remember while Jesus was upon the Earth so was Judas each came from a different spirit spirit and upon death each went to his own place the spirit of Christ later came back upon the true church and the spirit of Judas came back upon the false church now do you understand there are people in our message ranks that are working under the spirit of Judas they will betray true men of God they will lie on them sell them out for money or whatever working under the spirit of Judas there will be some preachers that will be saved if no more for the reason that God can prove to the devil he can do it some of the greatest troublemakers I've ever met in my life are men who said they're preachers let me tell you something every a man that says he's a preacher don't mean he's a man of God that's right there's all kinds of men that are preachers but it don't mean they God call in come on now don't get quiet on me already how do you judge them by the word not by signs so watch the spirit of Christ came back upon his church the spirit of Judas came back upon the false church now watch what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age can't you see why the devil is trying to come in our own ranks I know friends you may wonder why is brother Donny keeps saying this why does brother Donnie keep going this way because whether or not you understand it more and more preachers around this message are not preaching the message at all some of them won't even stand and read quotes anymore they won't even stand and make references to what the prophet taught in this day well if that's what you want I'll tell you one thing it's time for you to leave or me one because as long as I'm going to be here at this church I'm not only going to preach the Bible I'm going to preach to you the message of this hour it's going to take the message of this hour to get us out of here we've heard the story of Jonah we've heard the story of uh of Noah we've heard all of that it's going to take more than that to get us out of here and a body change it's going to take the message of Malachi 4 so the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost but my question to you is which one the Acts 2 version or the isusa street one cuz they are not the same that's why I'm not interested friends in mixing ausa street with what we have I've done been there and done that if I wanted that why in the world was I hungering for something more I should have just stayed where was ain't that right brother Larry but it didn't satisfy me when I was in it it sure won't satisfy me now after I've eat the good food I've been eating now oh my in her will be the fullness of Pentecost how many believes this amen for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at beginning the beginning that is is thus sayith the Lord now watch again in page 379 and he reads these scriptures in Joel 2 that I read to you when we open the service now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran AIDS did not restore the church it started a Reformation the westan AIDS did not restore the Pentecostal age now notice the Pentecostal age did not restore so why would I want to point you back to what Pentecost had when it did not restore it was an added element do we need it yes do we need justification what about sanctification well if we need them to then wouldn't you say we also need the restoration of [Music] gifts oh my but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost of differentiation now the beginning notice in verse 25 Joel two the Locust cankerworm caterpillar Palmer worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all those insects are of one and the same in different stages they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages notice organization denomination and false Doctrine do you understand many of the message people that we're not an organization and they think they're exempt because they're preaching false Doctrine it's the same Antichrist Spirit you may not have the structure of an organization that your head is in Cleveland Tennessee or up in akan Ohio but when you deny the word of God for the hour you're anointed by Antichrist I love this and the poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but he's going to bring his original planting back to the original seed he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former Reign next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing facei but why is the Harvest rain going to fall on now you see whenever they would plant this and the prophecy that they gave he was taking the planting season as it would have been in the country of Israel and that part of the Mediterranean so they would get the early rains in the springtime and then they would break up the ground they would plant the seed in the ground wherever it was suitable depending on what type of product that they wanted and then the former rign they would sew that down and the seed would be planted and the latter rain would produce the crop so the latter rain depending on what it fell upon it would produce the crop look at our nation the state that it's in how do we get here because some of our fathers our grandfathers some of the Senate some of the Congress of years ago that started passing some of these liberal bills and these woke moves that's all around everywhere that's what's got us where we are now when a boy don't even know if he's a boy no more and a girl don't know if she's a girl no more come on Church what we've never thought would ever get to such a place my goodness that that our government would want to put tampons in a in a in a man's bathroom are you kidding me you mean we got men that are that insane yeah we do they are that insane and they want to run our government well praise the Lord and it's going to get worse and worse as we go in time oh but brother Donnie Donald Trump wanted he's going to take us back to God don't you believe that for one minute of your life there's only one way we're going back to God that is not by Donald Trump or the Republicans or the independent that's by the coming of the Lord Jesus I know a lot of people are making Donald Trump the Messiah he ain't my Messiah he is not my savior I'm looking for my Lord Jesus to come amen oh Hallelujah notice this my my next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing F so when the Harvest rain falls on the bride who's been feeding for years on this revealed word what will it produce in her it will turn her inside out she's feeding and storing that word up in her soul her soul will manifest that final attribute of God inside of her and it will start from the inside of her soul and come out to her body her eyes will change her hair will change her limbs will change and in a moment in a twinkling of an ey she will be chain why because she's been feeding on the anointed word of Malachi 4 and the light of rain which is rapturing Faith is going to fall on him what's it going to do to the World Council of churches head up in the person of the devil in the form of the Antichrist come on somebody what's he going to do to the nations of the world they're going to gather in the plains of the field Where I Stood many years ago in the valley of megiddo as I stood up there where Elijah had stood there near his cave and look to the left as far as you can see and look to the right as far as you can see and there in the valley of magto and they will gather together all the nations of the world and the L of rain's going to fault and what are they going to do try to kill the Jews and they're going to come against them and the Lord Jesus will come but you and I won't be there as far as down on the earth we're going to come back riding on white horses why we have been anointed to fly we have been anointed to feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man and when the Lord Jesus comes to fight the battle of Armageddon and he'll look around behind him and say come on children go with and there will come the Bride of the Ephesian age of the samna age of the Sardis age of the thyra age and there will be as that bride Hallelujah the resurrected dead anointed by the latter [Applause] rain Hallelujah notice this thus at this very moment moment we're in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and who is that that shall attempt to deceive the very elect while the spirit of the Antichrist in the false anointed ones of this last day these false ones have already come in jesus' name wow so you mean they're not just saying father son Holy Ghost they've updated they're saying in Jesus name claiming they have been anointed by God for the last day they are the false Messiahs anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but are they one with the word never they have added to it or taken from it now listen this is the tricky part no one denies that the spirit of God manifesting in gifts is upon them but like balum they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word or bypass it notice the difference now some of them will deny it others will just bypass It Go Around It Don't Preach anything don't say anything that's going to cause anybody any problems you jellyfish well we believe in Holiness here but we we we we ain't going to preach it for about 35 years we're going to see if we can win somebody in it might be that very thing they need deliver to their minis skirts well praise the Lord hallelujah notice but the deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain so whether it's monetary or following or numbers uhhuh so they just you know scur around certain things don't you understand every true man of God will be faced with that Temptation right there every one of them and he will know it and he will see it and he can look at one side and see if he just skirts around certain things Don't Preach this don't say that don't say that you'll be more liked you'll be more accepted you'll have a bigger following you'll have this and that and the other and then he'll see the other side the harder way the narrow way people will walk away from you they'll turn back from you they'll ridicule you they'll run you down they'll stab you in the back they'll do this that the other well what person as far as feelings wouldn't rather choose the easier way oh yeah sure everybody will like me man aive them and who wants you know who wants to be shot at and who wants this and that and the other who wants to do all that sort of thing so every servant of God will face that challenge every one of them and it's not like they'll face it once some some some of them will face it over and over again because God is using them to prove to the devil I've still got some boys down on the earth in the latest in age you compromise and you'll do everything you can devil but you can't get my boys cuz they're born of my jeans oh yeah watch this oh my they deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach listen salvation and deliverance through the power of God so they're not sing there offering you a rosary they're not telling you to pray to St Andrew for this and St Anthony for that and you know St Joseph for this and that and the other they are preaching Deliverance by the salvation of the Lord Jesus and preaching Deliverance by the power of God just like Judas was a Ministry imparted by Christ remember he tells us in the church age book that Judas did not have an inferior Ministry so un like the 11 they were all anointed and they casting out devils and you know doing all the supernatural things and Judas is just kind of carrying along nothing ever followed his ministry and he couldn't ready preach I imagine he is probably one of the most charismatic preachers in the whole bunch I imagine that dude had Miracles that was phenomenal makes you think no I Miracles that was so phenomenal you've heard me say it from years and years ago that when the Lord Jesus said one of you is going to betray me they questioned thems before they even questioned him when you look at the Last Supper and the way that they set they didn't set the way we set like this you're setting this way but they prostrated themselves on Long sofas and they would have been leaning back one against the other Judas was right by the Lord Jesus and when they look at him at the table they thought oh no he's fixing to take Jesus place he already had the money Jesus really trusted him even though he was a thief that's right when they said it's the last supper and they come in and sit down and they looked up there sitting at the table here's the center of the table arced sort of like this and they looked up there and there was Judas and he said oh dear God Judas must be going to take over Jesus had been telling us he's going to leave I knew Judas was a Preacher Man I knew that guy had Supernatural I didn't know he was going to take over well it wasn't actually that Judas was going to take over Judas was going to be taken over Satan having now entered into the heart of Judas Simon's son Jesus knowing all things have been given to him by the father oh Lord he was so close they looked right at him and didn't see it Jesus said have not I chose 12 of you and one of you is a devil not going to be but already is imagine Jesus having a devil in his ministry team wow notice oh my they preach out salvation and deliverance to the power of God just like Judas with a Ministry imparted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have a wrong Spirit motivating them religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and Zeal wow but it is leot toan not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them startling signs so not something that could be questioned but a sign that is so phenomenal it would be startling boy I got you thinking tonight ain't it yeah good deal startling signs among them they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger a so they preach the coming of Christ but they don't preach the bride coming of Christ and they don't preach the coming of Christ to reveal himself in profit form in the last days remember he tells us in sort 1965 the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ he will come according to Luke 1730 let me just tell you what God's given to us so there was a family that lost an 18-year-old son brother Welch Evans and his wife so they were tore a piece and brother Brandon was out of town they try to call get in touch with him they call Billy Paul brother Brandon returns to call he says brother wel the Lord hasn't showed me anything about your son I I I don't know he hasn't showed me you can find this in Sister Angel's book gener ations testimonies so he said let me let me see let me pray let me see if I can find something from the Lord so he told them he searched the regions the regions and couldn't find him nowhere so he went back to where the automobile that he was in hit a truck so he went back to that place and then he calls brother welz and tells him he must have been in the passenger seat up front because I saw the wreck so you imagine God lets him now see the wreck again in a vision and he said I saw the wreck and when the car hit the truck I saw a light go out of the passenger side in the front seat and it went up before the Throne of God brother Welch if you want to know where your son is right now he's talking to my daughter Sharon Rose glory to God and brother wch if we could ask him did he want to come back he would tell you Daddy I don't want to come back and he said when you see him again to him it will only seem like he's been gone from you for three [Music] minutes for three minutes why they've broke into eternity why would God save all these secrets of the sixth dimension for us in the last day because we had to find out where we were and where we're going when we leave here and where our loved ones are and they are not dead and there's something about hearing it preached and we're talking about it you notice that atmosphere as it started changing when I started talking about that what is it hearing that present day truth brings us closer to that dimension remember it's not but 20 ft from us for those of you that was here the other night and brother Lewis is and I I preached about changing his address and brother Lewis had signed a change of address notification and I gave his new address 20 6 and seven 20 ft from us sixth Dimension seventh Church age 26 and 7 amen hallelujah but remember we're not just going to 26 and 7 but we're going to wind up on 8 because 8 is a new beginning The Eighth Day speaks of Eternity why was it that God never allowed Paul to preach the message of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride why was it reserve for us in this last day why couldn't Peter preach things that are to be it was reserve for the bride at the end time those that are going to be a living Remnant Hallelujah when the lter rainfalls she'll already have them seeds in her heart she'll already have the future home she'll already have recognizing your day and the lighter rain will fall on that seed Oh Glory to God so you imagine Lance and you four girls the next time you see your mama to her alone to be like she's gone about 3 minutes Paul's been there for 2,000 years over 2,000 years but it's like you just arrived they ain't going nowhere they ain't got nothing to do they ain't got no times ain't got no clocks they ain't got no schedules they've just arrived they broke into eternity Hallelujah where was that oh let me find myself here they preached the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger though empowering signs and true Revelation he eclipses them all can anybody give me a big hearty Amen to [Applause] that ah yes this false spirit in the last day is so close to the real it can be distinguished distinguished only by its deviation from the word wow but he's already told us that they can have signs wonders Miracles right preach salvation preach Deliverance but wonder what they'll deviate from apparently they're not going to deviate from salvation not going to deviate from Supernatural come on well this is kind of one of them services that get you thinking don't it now watch and whenever it is caught and being anti- word it falls back on the one argument we have already shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God [Music] we're getting people saved people's getting healed we get results don't we we have to be of God ah what crucial times are these in which we live can everybody say Amen to that how careful we must be that we remain True to this word and not take from or add to it for he who would speak what God has not spoken makes him a liar so for some around the ranks of the message is simply taking away the need to assemble ourselves together we don't need to we've got the tapes we've turned our homes into churches there before we go to church every day cuz we play tapes every day in our home so we really don't need to go to church because our home is our church and we don't need one another and we don't uhuh so you just took away that's right from what your very Prophet said Christ The Mystery of God revealed that if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors back there to open to get in and fellowship with your brothers and sisters and if you don't feel like that I'll tell you it's time you got to praying but you see reason we say oh well Ephesians 4 says that he gave some Apostles and and some prophets and some pastors because some people need them your name was just took from the book of life you are twisting Ephesians 4 to match your own ideology reading the original Greek it does not even implied in such a way so some people need to go to church but we don't cuz we listen to tapes and we really don't need to yeah you just added to and took away think of it friends think of it oh Lord Jesus what I have particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the hunger for God that was generated in the Philadelphian age brought a cry for the spirit of God and when the cry was answered by God sending forth manifestation in tongues and interpretation and prophecy a group immediately and most contrary to the word Drew up a doctrine that tongues was the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost tongues was far from evidence they were manifestation but not evidence the falsity of the doctrine can all oh my not only be seen by lack of scripture to substantiate it but those who subscribed to the doctrine immediately organized on the basis of the doctrine proven they were not in the truth as they would have people believe oh it look good it look look like the return of Pentecost now you realize there some of the preachers in our message that's going around and preaching you know if you're not having meetings like this with them preaching of course in your church you better leave your church now they don't go ahead and tell you the rest of it but I'll go ahead and tell you the rest of it leave the church you're going to and move to their church cuz we're the one that's got the move of God now you see what that's doing it's making another denomination so then whoever believes like we believe we're the ones with the move of God well I wonder if we judge the Ephesian Church by your church or the Corinthian Church by your church one if to have the type of meetings you have in your church in Corinth so I don't understand why God didn't make your church one of the original 12 and instead of making them the original 12 and told you to be like them instead of them trying to be like you whoa we got a problem here Houston but you see what they do oh we're it we're it we've got it boy we've got the brides move how many brides revivals have we have and they put a fence around it and when you do you're cutting yourself off Word of Life Church please I beg you as a servant of God don't never do that to us amen we will cut ourselves off from God when we do it and it won't happen immediately it never does but in time we'll sever ourself from the rest of the body and then we are this Elite whatever we think we are and we look down our nose at everybody else and you know what God will do God will move right around us and reach out there and get grab a hold of alley rats if he has to he'll do whatever he's got to do don't think that we have any Monopoly on God don't think that you can say who can go to heaven and who can't go to heaven don't think that you can say well bless God I'll tell you one thing I don't this God ain't asking you God is telling you what his word says and expects you to do it is that right no it proved it wasn't it could not before for it organized that is death not life it looked so close to the real that multitudes were deceived now if it wasn't the genuine what was it it was the husk the CHF in the green soft sheath form it looked like it was the real thing but as you go into the field and see what looks exactly like wheat and yet it's only the husk for the wheat seed had not yet formed so this was but the soft shell that looked like the real grain Yet to Come the original wheat seed of Pentecost was to come back in the last age it had been buried at N Sea it sent up a shoot at Sardis it grew a tsel at Philadelphia it was a mature to look at leaa but it would not be back to the original until the word was restored the prophet had not yet yet come upon the scene but now according to the time wherein we stand in the Le of and age the prophet messenger of Revelation 10:7 must already be in the land praise the Lord once more thus saith the Lord must be here already oh Hallelujah to be manifested with infallible Vindication thus is the true seed already maturing and then the Harvest but what happened in every one of these ages they were living in a glare of the past age notice this an identified Christ what was the matter with the Lutheran living in the glare of the Lutheran age when John Wesley found the secret of sanctification they couldn't go they were living in the glare of Luther's age what happened to the Pentecost is why wesle was organized until he was living the glare of another age that was in Wesley's age when the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostals they were living in what Wesley said sanctification it was hard for them to believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the restoration of the gifts they was living in the glare of another age now we find out that now we find our Pentecostal Brethren are living in the glare of a Pentecostal age and they still miss it they're trying trying to interpret the Pentecostal age when we're Plum past that amen well tell me how can I be past it if I've got people trying to tell me I need to go back to it come on now brother Donnie are you saying well that we're past it we don't need it no no we took the truth out of that that's right and brought it with us God sent justification what they do they formed an organization out of it God called the elect out they pulled the truth of justification out with them and merg it into the new message sanctification is that right then what did they do sanctification they formed an organization around that and then God sent the restoration of the gifts over and over again the prophet calls it that for Pentecost restoration of the gifts and they took justification sanctification merged it right in with the restoration of gifts and then they could look back at the westl move and say we're beyond that it didn't mean they didn't believe in sanctification when the prophet said we're Beyond Pentecost it don't mean that we're beyond the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost but we're in another time frame and the church said so do we believe in justification if your bride you do do we believe believe in sanctification do we believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the message that Martin Luther brought of justification was all right for Luther's age but that's as far as it went sanctification was fine in Wesley's age that was as far as it went then we come into the Pentecostal age and the restoration of the gifts is a very fine thing it was fine in the age but we're going beyond that now we are beyond that now come on CH it's got to where that you can't even read quotes like this in certain message churches they will shut down on you when it gets to where I cannot preach the message of the hour it's time for me to stay home yep if I can't preach the message I'll stay at the house I mean until y'all want me to go somewhere else Do We Believe It or Not we've got to become Beyond this thing because we've done the same thing with it they did before make an idol amen out of it I belong to this order of it I belong to that order notice he doesn't call it denomination but he calls it order God will send somebody that'll smash that thing amen and tear it to Pieces praise the Lord and confirm his word the full word notice praise be to God now we see that's true God rich in his Mercy let us stand let me share one more with you tonight Luther went to husk with his first word that just shall live of Faith Wesley had two words sanctification second definite work of Grace Pentecost had the third word the restoration of the gifts remember the Pentecostal message is the restoration of the gifts the bride's message is more than restoration of the gifts praise the lord it's that plus Pentecost had the third word restoration of gifts but the entire seed has to come forth notice Luther had a word Wesley had a word Pentecost had a word but the fourth word is the entire seed no wonder Satan wants to keep people in a glare of the age behind them because they focus on one word or another one word or another one word why stop at restoration of gifts when we can get the entire seed which includes all the gifts amen I took her the other day after the service on Sunday was talking about receiving the love of God or the god of love and I told her I was sitting at the house Sunday afternoon and just going back through the service and the word and stuff and I said you know our daughters have a portion of your love our church has a portion of your love your mother your siblings your nieces your cousins but I have you you and I said it's the same with me people in our church have a portion of my love I said Harry my brother mention Justin my sister-in-laws and mention my grandchildren my my daughters but I said you have me and know me in a way unlike any of them do amen you know me when I'm down you know me when I'm low oh you just be around me and tell why cuz she has me I don't want just one word amen I don't want just two words I don't want just three words I want him and if I get him I get the gifts now if anybody tells you that brother Donnie don't believes the gifts you look them in the face and you tell them they are a liar I believe in the gifts and I want every one of them that God wants you in our church but I cannot produce them amen and neither can you amen oh my you see how they denominated on one word and another word and another word but there's got to be something that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life that's in there that has to produce itself again on a bride justification yes sanctification yes gifts yes but remember people focus so much on speaking in tongues and brother brim said speaking in tongues was the least of all the gifts and okay uh I'll admit it I am really weird okay you can you can nod your head that's okay not going to hurt my feelings I am weird I am strange I'm bizarre I have some very unusual thoughts I believe in all nine spiritual gifts instead of just three three was what I heard mainly talked about in Pentecost three is what mainly here and talked about in the message I wonder why we don't want the other six so when we pull up all these quotes about gifts of the Spirit do we not know there's six more included in that yes for our church I don't want just tongues interpretation or prophecy I want Discerning of spirits which will be two or three Witnesses that will discern when somebody's speaking in tongues and then they'll sign their name on it amen and say tell brother Dave tomorrow not to go to that certain job that he's got set because coming through there'll be a an American propane truck come through about 12:00 and if he's there it's going to blow up and it'll blow that whole house where he's at tell him not to go thus sayeth the Lord amen and then it's laid up on the platform here this way the prophet Tau it I know we don't want it wonder if that's one of them words wonder if that's one of them words that somehow we think we have a superior understanding to than our Prophet messenger brother sister when we head that way we're headed for trouble that's right I don't care how long you've preached how much you've sung shouted jumped jerked whatever you've done who in the world in this message thinks they have got more understanding than the prophet messenger that God sent to bring us this way m m let me close with this seeds on air with a shock once a carrier of a true word justification then it became a carrier of sanctification then it became a carrier of the baptism of the Holy Spirit restoration of the gifts but then when he goes on and keeps going back try to eat something Mana from another day it's rotten it's no good a genuine Eagle of this day knows that was all right but we got that plus amen I'm sorry well no I ain't sorry actually you're not keeping from me my pluses amen you're not going to hem me up on justification saying we ain't going no farther I've done been farther than that you ain't going to hem me up on sanctification and you certainly ain't going to H me up on gifts and say well this is the light of the day this is the bride's Revival I'm sorry I had that years ago amen amen I've got that already I've had gifts of the Spirit in my life since I was a kid amen God's given me many words from people amen God used me when I was a kid I go pray for people he put it on my heart Carol's been with me one to man at Uncle's house one time and I just a boy me and Carol just got married and I told him said I'm not sure why I'm here can I go in your bedroom I said sure I mean this acting real scared and I was too I didn't know what in the world was going on out I knew was the Lord had sent me up there so Carol stayed in the living room prayed with them I went in there I started praying praying praying come out in a few minutes the Holy Ghost all over me I couldn't hard him stand still shaking and quivering like a leaf so I said can I pray for you'all I said yeah yeah there's real scared I started praying God prayed out of me the very secret of their hearts God prayed out of me things they had discussed before I got there you believe God still does the same thing that's this man right here and this one right here when they were traveling the other day and they were delivering some disaster relief to the flood deal and all that come back to service the next day and they they they said it sound like brother donning was riding in the truck with us how in the world did he know that I didn't but God does why same Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost come on children he is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart the word is not a man come on I'm not looking for a man to tell me what my name is I've know that since I knee high to a grasshopper I'd rather have the word discern my very heart let that word discern you what does it do it brings his presence right down where we are do we believe in that that's the kind of gifts I want in our church yes we got that plus until Jesus Christ is Manifest in the fullness of his power I'll get to you I'm on a detour I know you don't know it but I'm on a detour but where the Prophet said that the fullness of the son of man will be among his people in the last day deity the fullness of the godhead bodily on the earth in the form of a bread so no I'm not stopping at justification I'm not stopping at the restoration of gifts I want the giver amen I've got to go further back than isusa Street I've experienced ausa Street and I wasn't satisfied I've shouted I've run I've danced brother Chuck Dixon and I were sitting in a location a certain night under a tent a very strange presence come on the platform everybody else was gone remember brother Chuck was sitting there I seen an angel of the Lord walk around the outside perimeter of the tent tent was rolled up my hair stood upon the back of my neck like that and I seen him standing out there the spirit of God spoke to me and said go meet him I said Lord I'm afraid I said brother Chuck I just seen an angel of the Lord I've got to go out and pray brother Chuck said Lord have mercy brother Donnie he got down on the platform hit his face like this on out found a solitary place where the presence of God come I was a Pentecostal he told me something about my Ministry and things that would happen I've experienced that but why did it leave me hungry why did it leave me searching I saw a little Carside boy one time come up for prayer I laid my hands on him I watched almighty God straighten his eyes out straight as they could be I did it leave be Hunger for More don't just give me one word two words three words give me the volume of the book amen Lord Jesus help us to that father Lord God God we we thank you for what what we've experienced and what we've had Lord we don't want to stop with one word or two words oh those experiences that I've had and some of them I've had Lord I'll never repeat because they're just meant for me and you to know but yeah Lord the ones I've had have been wonderful but Jesus Jesus I still crave a hunger a thirst and I read a statement the other day where your Prophet said what we need so much in the church is a Revival of love I've thought oh my goodness is this part of that Capstone a Revival of Love setting down on the bride right before she goes away help us Jesus add to our justification add to our sanctification add to our restoration of gifts word upon top of word on top of word justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the bap baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself it's amazing that the prophet said there was something more that he had to preach to his church he preached many them great sermons The Seals and Christ of mystery warning then judgment all that and he said now there's something more there's another step for this church and that was the token oh Jesus we love your signs we love your Miracles oh God I long to see more of them but Lord God I not going to Major on just healings and deliverances and signs and wonders God I want people that are so in love with you and so in love with each other Lord God that people can talk about them and run them down and whatever and they're so full of the love of God that they're praying for forgiveness let's talk about being like Jesus then Judas could heal like you but he couldn't love like you oh Jesus help me to love like you help me to forgive like you help me Lord to draw a bigger Circle it seems that as we go on in time let's message people are getting better and better and better at drawing smaller circles instead of bigger ones and we sure didn't get that from our Prophet messenger cuz men told him they were drawing him out and he said whenever you do Brothers I'll just draw you right back in people don't have to draw us out anymore we'll draw them out and throw them out forgive us God help us to get out from under this sectarian anointing in the last days Lord Jesus help us God lord I've been wondering and thinking about all this flood relief and I've heard so many different testimonies of people in our community and people from Elizabeth and Johnson City and different ones I heard another one yesterday people that had heard all kinds of things about us criticized us and said this and that even one man said the Lord rebuked him for things that he had said about us cuz he found out what he had said and what he had heard wasn't even the truth some of the finest people ever met in his life he said so Lord let our light shine let them see Jesus let them Feel Jesus when around Lord oh hallelujah we're not handing out Church age books and seal books we don't have message water we don't have message Cheerios it's just plain old Cheerios but it's bride delivering Cheerios and the bride delivering poptarts and crackers and baby Dippers Hallelujah let them sense it Lord Jesus Jesus let our light so shine father I pray we worship you tonight Lord you didn't say by this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you cast out Devils because you have Miracles because you said in Matthew 24 they'll come before you in that day and say they've done all that and I'll say to them depart from me I never knew you but you said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you have such love it's recorded by some of Nero's historians and some of those and the other Emperors that when they would bring the Christians to burn them to kill them they kept commenting about the love they had not only for each other but for their enemies so before before they would light the Torches and set some of our brothers and sisters on fire our brothers and sisters would bow their heads and pray for their forgiveness they would put sheep scans on their children and turn them loose in the Coliseum and turn the dogs the leopards the Lions loose on their little children dressed up like sheep and make them parents stand there and watch it and then parents would bow their heads and pray for their forgiveness and we wonder why we're not any closer to you if somebody does something to us we'll never forgive them we'll hold a grudge against him the rest of our life and say we're restored I wonder Jesus help us God we hold things against people and get bitter and then say we're bright and our brothers and sisters had to watch their babies brains be beat out wives watch their husband's guts be tore from their bodies and pray for their enemies and we say we've got the same Holy Ghost and if people people cross us we cut them off won't have nothing to do with them forgive us Lord forgive us Lord anybody willing to say that with me tonight forgive us Lord for us forgive us teach us how to love Jesus we worship you father we bless your name Lord oh Hallelujah can we just raise our hands in the presence of the God who is love thank you Lord teach us how to live in love and dwell in the land of love oh we'd rather dwell in the land of the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders or the financial blessings and live in the land of the material live in the land of Lea as Carol and I saw a video on YouTube the other day of Russia's new bomb called Satan to they can send it from Russia to any place around the world in 30 minutes and under it can have multiple Warheads up to 15 Warheads on one missile 500 times the power that was on the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Hypersonic and so far we have nothing to catch it or stop it and they can control each of those Warheads so they send it up above the Earth's atmosphere in an arc way above her radar can read it and then they bring it straight down and when they come down so far say over Central States they can designate one head to go War of the Warhead to go to New York another of remember all nuclear one to go to Los Angeles one to go to Colorado one to go here one to go there and there we look up and there they are well I say we we're not going to be here and they called the name of that missile Satan to and they're new super Hypersonic plane that's going to carry it it's called Spirit messenger but don't look for me cuz I'll be gone cuz I've done got under another Spirit messenger praise God that's why you ain't taking this message Away From Me Brother Don ain't you tired of it are you kidding me I get hung up on tapes I've been listening to spoken words original seed for the last month and a half so I bounce from it to end time seed sign preach the next day and then I go from that to Pirate transformation then I go back to spoken words original S I think Lord Is this never going to end we've broke into eternity don't you love him oh how many wants to live and dwell in the Land of Love let's just open our hearts tonight before we go I know you got to work you got school tomorrow I know all that I hate to I hate to hold you on Wednesday night but boy when we get here in this presence I hate to let you go too I'd rather spend a little extra time here and less time out there well we'll spend a little more worship time in here and they'll go straight to your car and go to the house let's just love him a little he's come tonight to tell us where we are and he's come to show us the journey and he's come to tell his children don't stop at one word or two words or three words but take the entirety of it bring Discerning of spirits with it bring tongues with it bring interpretation but don't major on a minor don't let all your studying being on the gifts of the Spirit my goodness I've done just out of curios this week I I studied the words looked at the words gifts of the Spirit and put in quotation marks so it would only pull up those words from 1947 to 1965 our Prophet mentioned those words 73 times through a span of 1947 to 1965 and some preachers are mentioning it every service you say what's wrong with us and you go to looking at love and you go to look at at forgiveness and you go to look at some of these other things thousands of times are we balanced or all way off somewhere may God help us har sing something let's let's worship Him can we can we just close our eyes now and just for a few moments we're going to leave this we're going to leave this building here in Rapture we're going to just try to lay our burdens aside and your workload of tomorrow and your test and whatever you have to do you're troubled about your math and your biology and maybe some of your brothers have got a business transaction or whatever but just let tomorrow's evil take care of itself let's just get called up into his presence now this a name of this series I've been preaching to you now for several years getting in the spirit let's get in the spirit again of Malachi 4 Luke 1730 Revelation 10 not just 107 but 1 to 7 you see the prophet preached Revelation 10:7 for years something happened to him and he started included verses 1 to six so he started preaching Revelation 10 1- 7 I don't want to just preach Revelation 107 I want to include verses one to six I don't want just healing I don't want just signs I want to be a preacher that can forgive I want to be a preacher that can be talked about run down lied on stabbed in the back by message prates used abused lied on everything that you can imagine some things you can't even imagine believe it or not friends I'm a miracle before you tonight if it was not for the holy ghost in my soul I would be one of the most bitter resentful human beings you had ever meet you know what would have made me that way Christian people a lot of them preachers but the difference is I got the Holy Ghost yes and the Holy Ghost helps you through all those things there's certain people God chooses for that walk in life yes sir let's worship Him shall we sing to us we dedicate our Temple to you

have a testimony from a brother John Taylor word of this is to the Word of Life Church all is well with us our daughter Emily for whom we have asked for prayer for a year ago following the death of her husband has come all the way back praising God all the way she has learned to turn things over to God to call on him frequently and to trust him to take care of it and to thank him constantly the physical and emotional toll of the preceding three years have been huge and we have been very concerned at the time prayer was answered somebody say praise the Lord amen thank you Lord Sister Laura wo wants to thank uh God for being able to be back in the house of the Lord today thank you for your prayers cards messages I'm getting stronger and have a doctor appointment this week for followup appreciate your continued prayers God bless my precious church family we love you all so much well we like the wo family pretty decent too don't we amen Ed jablonski who is having surgery for an aneurism and needs prayer that's brother Eddie's father so he certainly want to pray for that need this morning want remember brother Joe Green and his assembly brother Jean Gordon passed away a a longtime Deacon and family members so we want to remember those folks that as we pray today thank you for your prayers my first two weeks of chemo treatments went well and uh with almost no reaction to the medication I have two weeks off then we do this again two weeks on two weeks off in that cycle please continue to pray that the chemo treatments are doing their job against the intruded uh sales in my body your prayers mean so much to me again thank you God bless you and praise the Lord Brother Glenn tamlins somebody say thank you Lord praise God just for his uh continued recovery and ask God to just be with him during his uh his ongoing treatments brother Keith Phillips is very sick this morning with the GI virus he's had for the last three days he wanted to be in the service today but just was not able so we want to certainly continue to remember brother Keith brother Bert sister barbar we want to thank the Lord for his goodness for all he's done for them and they're streaming the service and we just would dedicate this service to them this morning uh brother Chris connley and sister Sharon many of you know them the couple that's been coming over from over in Hendersonville North Carolina V being a part of our assembly his father passed away suddenly I believe on Thursday or Friday and they're just uh just very very very shocked by this and they're asking that we would remember those folks in prayer as we pray today also Fred Jones a good friend of ours is going to be having surgery on Tuesday Morning asking that we would remember him in prayer so let's remember that sister Bonnie Potter s to please pray for my daughter Leah and her family urgent unspoken prayer requests the Lord knows all about also we wants to want us remember her son Davey he's asked for us to pray for his boss's son Jared Pritchard he has cancer so we want to remember that prayer request today as we pray all the unspoken prayer request I know there's many needs in our assembly but let's come all these things unto the Lord Brother Joel if you take us to the Lord in prayer this morning buddy B hearts and heads Heavenly Father what a friend we have in you and when we go through these things and we hear of these circumstances among others Lord we know that we have confidence in our friend and I love how the prophet places it Lord he makes it such that our relationship with you is even closer than friendship he says that God wants to come down and be buddies and so father we can share things with buddies not that we wouldn't necessarily with friends so much but Lord we bring these needs unto you and we just know that you will meet them Father according to your will and purpose and when we don't understand father when we have to scratch our heads when the doctor turns and walks the other way and says there's nothing more that can be done and even when it seems like even within ourselves there there's no more that we can pray and we don't even know how to pray at times Lord you come on the scene and you move and these are not just words that we speak these are not just fairy tales that we read about but we serve a true and the Living God and that same God you yourself came and began to dwell in this Humanity these old frangible Dusty devilish frames in which we live father you chose to live in these bodies and so father May the words that you've spoken Lord may we take them Upon Our Hearts and speak to these needs Lord if we know these individuals may we find an opportunity in place that we can go lay our hands upon them or speak a word to them Father that would bring encouragement and even healing bring Victory and bring deliverance and bring encouragement father this this is what we've called been called to do in this age not just to come to church and hear words father from a man that's preaching but Lord we're to take these words that's our identification and these things are real to us and so father may we be put on display and may we have these opportunities father we look for what you're going to do in this service today may all thoughts that are unlike you be moved out of the way may all purposes all plans Lord we don't even know if we'll walk out of the building today so while we're here we're going to glorify you we're going to extol you we're going to magnify your name on high father that's why we are here this place may you come and fill it father with your presence and may we be receptive when you come by and may it be like the the Saints as they were walking that day father May our hearts burn within us by the things that we'll hear today everything may it be anointed and submitted to you and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord ushers if you want to come

I'm so glad he's been faithful when I've not he's been faithful when you have not but he cannot deny himself so that's what we're grateful for he cannot deny himself so if he puts a deposit of himself in us he cannot deny that we greet you today in the name of the Lord certainly welcome you to the house of God the visitors that are here with us we welcome you into our gates let's turn to the Book of Revelation if you would Today Chapter 1 verse4 read a couple of places in the in the scripture I've been speaking about the bride's Bill of Rights and I I'd like to pick up again today by the help of the Lord on the right to a spiritual priesthood as the elect of God Revelation 1 ver4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins I love this in his own blood and has made us Kings and Priests now remember we don't deserve it there's nothing we could do to ever gain it but he has made us this himself made us Kings and and priest unto our God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen Revelation 5 verse 9 as John picks up again about the priest and this is after the lamb now has opened the book after The Lamb opens the book tears the seals off then this is what takes place in heaven and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth God hasten the day that'll happen how may like to be remembered today as we pray God bless you let's hold our request in our hearts before the Lord Lord Jesus we count it such a privilege that we could be gathered here today already sensed your presence and for that we're so thankful we realize Lord that as Mortals one day we're going to have to stand before you we're have to give an account for our life every day every hour every moment that we've lived help us I pray father that we will realize when we stand before for you that day many of the things now that take up so much of our time will be absolutely worthless we would have will wished so desperately we would have taken more time for the things that really matter for those that stand before the white Throne every thought every wrongdoing every evil will Flash before them by then there'll be no mercy so while there is Mercy now father we want to ask you forgive us forgive us of our failures forgive us of our shortcomings help us that we can be more in love with you than we've ever been in our entire lives help me today Jesus to get out of the way speak the word to our hearts we present our needs to you now father we commit the service to you in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may be seated it was actually God who instituted the priesthood in the Old Testament to give his people a goet the priesthood would bring sacrifices from the people into God's presence because every Jew was not allowed to go directly into the presence of God God allowed them to build a tabernacle and then a temple God's presence came and Sanctified those two places and made their sacrifices and their offerings acceptable the people would stand on the outside while the priest was on the inside doing this work of reconciliation and Redemption for them but the priests themselves were not any more qualified than the people were unless they came through a process to make them fit to stand in the presence of God they were first called by God the tribe of Levi and then they were also anointed by Moses at the time and they were sanctified IED or set apart for a man to walk in there even though he was a levite without being anointed he would die without being set apart Sanctified he would die so when we come to the New Testament and then we look at What the Lord Has Done to start a church a bride a new kingdom a new order of a different type of priesthood a priesthood that will not offer Pascal Lambs or a bulock or an incense or trespass offering but we will offer ourselves we will offer the fruit of our lips we will raise our hands and offer that to God we will bring him so many things but none of them are for sin or for atonement but unless we also are anointed Ed and consecrated our offerings are not received so it's not like that we just bring it to God and God is so desperate that God will just take anything and everything that people give him no he won't either he will only take that which meets his strict requirement and that is it must come from priests that have been set apart and set aside and Sanctified but they also need to be anointed but how do they become anointed well he crushes the lily of the valley and the rose of Sharon and he releases the perfume out of the life of the only sinless one that ever lived on the earth after the fall he sends that back upon us and anoints our lives to where that what we do is mixed with the fragrance of the Pascal lamb even our prayers uh I know you Bible readers know this that our our prayers have to be mixed with incense in order for him to receive them it has been said that prayers are like little children going out into the flower garden or the wild flowers and they pick the yellow and they pick the red and the white and the pink and maybe the fuchsia but at the same time they'll pick some weeds because weeds also will flower their mother meets them at the door and whenever they bring these flowers to their mother and their mother being wiser than they are able to look and see but this is poison and this is not really acceptable and the mother sorts through the flowers as they bring them and she separates them you understand that our prayers Before the Throne of God many times when we pray we have selfishness we have arrogance we have pride we have an objective that isn't quite right before the Lord how is it that God accepts our prayers they are mixed with incense and the incense goes in with our prayers and blends the aroma to where the weeds of selfishness and self-pity and all of that we pray don't sit there and look at me and tell me you don't do that and how in the world can God then receive our prayers and our prayers be as if it was the Lord Jesus himself praying it's the incense that makes up for what we lack and our temporary understanding aren't you grateful for that watch's this in the Messiah the prophet said God called Messias God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God like Jesus was God's high priest and we become a lesser priest Jesus was God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some Messiahs amen Messiahs oh my do you see it the same things he did in his church the same power he had in his church his church becomes his Dominion he is King over his dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering listen to this now spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name oh my amen there you are Messiahs Messiahs little Messiahs little anointed ones anointed off of what the main one anointed off of the great one so if we're not Anointed God cannot hear our prayers if we're not Anointed God will not receive our worship we could say the name of Jesus and oh Lord I worship you I praise you I adore you I exalt your name but if we're not Anointed with the anointing of the day you see Jesus said in Mark chapter 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men so you can imagine millions of people have gathered today in churches all around the world and they've worshiped and they've sung and they believe with all of their heart they they have worshiped and praised God and God has received that worship but he has not unless they're preaching the right thing cuz you said Jesus said how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men so you mean our worship is either accepted or rejected based upon the doctrine that we believe and teach so when we teach for Doctrine the Commandments of men our worship is a complete waste of time you might as well be singing jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way oh but we say the name of Jesus I don't care if you do say the name of Jesus it's only accepted when it's revealed it's accepted through the revealed word of the hour you see that is the name of God the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God for the word name in the Old Testament actually is shim which means reputation traits characteristics of the person you're identify amen so God then has him a church as he did 2,000 years ago he has one today and they are anointed to be able to not only carry out his work cast out Devils heal the sick do all the great things that he did but they're anointed to worship him to praise him they will worship Him in spirit and in truth read with me in Exodus 28:41 and thou shalt put upon the them upon Aaron thy brother and his sons with him now he talking about the Holy garments that only the priests could wear and thou shalt anoint them and consecrate them and sanctify them that they may Minister unto me in the priest's office now look what happens they are anointed they are consecrated and they are Sanctified so they couldn't just walk in with any type of clothes that they wanted they couldn't just pick out their favorite perfume that they wanted they had to be Anointed with a special concoction that was made by the Apothecary that had five different elements given by Divine proportions by which they were anointed in other words we'd say it like this in this day the fivefold ministry five aspects of the oil so much of Cal so much of this so much of myrr they couldn't pick even their own concoction it had to be exactly the way God described it a fifth of this two fifths of that one tenth of that a fifth of this put it all together and then mix all that together and it produced this phenomenal type of aroma so you had no no question about knowing when a man was a priest because when he come out from the presence of God even without his miter and the heod and all that on him he had a smell about him that you knew he'd been in the presence of God you see we don't want to just have enough religion that makes us feel good when we're here on Sunday morning we want to be able to walk out these doors and have the smell of Jesus Christ on our lives that people will know there's something different about them people if we don't have that we're not a success notice now in Leviticus 8 verse 10 and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was therein and Sanctified them how can wood and gold now remember a lot of the wood was chatim wood there was gold which represented deity silver which represented silver blue which represented the Heavenly there was a color from the mollusk there was all these different colors that were Blended together so it was elements of the Earth the metallurgical value the gold the silver the brass and all that the copper come from the Earth part of it come from the sea part of it come from trees part of it come from insects what was God doing pulling from botony Life pulling from all these Elements of Life to give a place to worship him so how could a little a silicus which was a little tiny bug that lived on the oak tree very very rare and they would catch this only the female could do this and they would take the body of the female and they would squeeze this out of her body and it would produce one drop of this dye this dye then in turn was used to be able to dye part of the garments and part of the color of the Tabernacle so God would allow them to take an insect there was a mollusk which came from the Mediterranean and they would take it and grind the shell and be able to mix another color so what's God doing pulling from botney Life pulling from Oceanic life pulling from human life taking the badger which is a very rotten mean animal and God pulling from all these different Avenues and bring it all together and you've still got all this element that is not holy how's a holy God ever going to get in that place cuz he had to Sanctified amen with with what with what part with blood part with oil and the rest Spirit there's two types of sanctification deity type and human type now watch in Leviticus 8:10 and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was there in and Sanctified them and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar notice how many times seven times and Anointed The Altar and his vessels notice now the gender that he gives to the Tabernacle it was a hymn his vessels both the labor and and the labor also identified his foot to sanctify them so what are they doing consecrating sanctifying how can you take take gold and make it holy for God there's a process now how are we then ever going to be able to present our bodies since our bodies are unregenerate now no matter how much Holy Ghost you've got in your soul your body is still according to what the prophet taught us whenever you see a man priest potent a prophet he said he's born between Satan and Eve Satan and Eve so our bodies are hybrid is that right yet Paul tells us in Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you would present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable before the Lord which is only your reasonable service how can my flesh ever be considered to be holy how could your flesh brother Joel ever consider to be holy that God himself would look at it cuz my body don't have the Holy Ghost my soul does my soul has been redeemed but how can my flesh when Paul goes on to say that we would lift up holy hands but how how can I ever reach a state of Hol and sanctification in my body that my body will be holy to God I've got the answer in front of me you want to know it might take me a little while to get to it notice again in Leviticus 8:12 and he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him so he's pouring this anointing on now remember specific oil specific elements specific measurement word word word commandment commandment command commandment obedience obedience obedience and then when the obedience is rendered it produces a product which can actually take a mortal man and he walk in there and become Anointed with this oil and it transforms him into a holy priest amen amen glory to God than I told you the other morning the Lord I got up out of bed and I was fixing to start the day and the Lord spoke to me and gave me something this is it so you see there's a sanctification that the Lord does and then there's actually one that we do now it takes both actually to make us acceptable and the one that God does we can't and the one we're supposed to he won't the one that he's supposed to do we cannot do and the one we're supposed to do he will not do you read with me in Exodus 29:42 this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your Generations at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto thee and there I will meet with the children of Israel and the Tabernacle shall be Sanctified by my glory amen now watch it was Moses that anointed the priest and they were Sanctified by an order of obedience to the Commandments of God but it was them that Sanctified them but what's going to sanctify now the building and the Tabernacle it's actually going to be Sanctified by the shakan glory of God so you mean then God could come in a building say like this this sheet rock come from the same place that other buildings were made out of so it could be a honky tonk or a bar or a you know a school building or whatever so this this sheetrock didn't come from some Holy Ghost fil place where all holy ghost fil people made it and all holy ghost fill people worked on this building there's some that did and these panels here they come from a place where uh they manufacture panels for auditoriums and all types of things and this carpet was made in the same place these W these trees this all these different things it's here so what we say this is a holy Place well what makes it holy it's not the stone the piano made by Yamaha that that one there we didn't order a particular holy Yamaha piano and a particular Fender holy guitar and a particular holy apartment for Rolland only makes holy drums for Holy Rollers that set of drums could wound up playing rock and roll music same with that piano but we say but this is a holy place so what makes it holy His Glory Hallelujah and the Tabernacle shall be Sanctified by my glory look at the word Sanctified to consecrate prepare dedicate be Hallowed be holy be separate to be set apart be treated as sacred so how many of you would bring your biscuits and gravy and your sausage and your bacon and your cup of coffee and your hot chocolate and your donuts and all that in here to church with you this morning and set there and eat it anybody well you have no problem doing that at home right you could sit outside in your car and do that you you'd be okay with that and then you go walk right out of these doors go through the hallway that come out on the other side into the fellowship hall and we sat right there yesterday we ate food we talked we drank we had Fellowship why that is built for a separate purpose this is hallowed for the preaching of the word for the sick being healed for the Lost being saved praise the lord it's the way we consecrated the building it's the way we dedicated it and the purpose we consecrated it for for us to just come a a a little distance and bring that same food out of that building and to bring it in here why we would feel terrible we would feel awful in doing so why because of the way we built it of the way we consecrated it and the purpose of is don't you understand your flesh is no different than your brothers your sisters your mam your daddies that don't even believe this word but yours is consecrated for a special service to almighty God hallelujah you come from the same lump of humanity that your father and your mother and your siblings and your aunts and uncles but you brought your body to the house of God to dedicate it to the service of Adonai amen now notice what God said that he would do Exodus 2944 and I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons now Moses and God both must perform an act of sanctification on the priesthood God will do his part but he wasn't going to do Moses part so Moses had to anoint them actually Moses based the priests before Moses would dress them he bathed them can you imagine how humiliating for them priests they said Moses we've been taking bath since we were little guys but they needed to be bathed under the administration of the Prophet that's why some of the message preachers stink real bad they refuse to be Washed by the Water of Malachi 4 and when a message preacher gets to the spot he thinks he don't need the message message no more you watch him start preaching stinky doctrines you watch him turn into a stinky preacher and have a stinky Church come on somebody I don't know about every other man of God here in this place today I still need to be washed by the purity of the teachings of Malachi 4 I hope I never get so big in my own mind that I think I don't need it I've lost my mind when I do so Moses then would bathe him brother Joel then Moses would close them and put the garments on them again how humiliating that they they themselves had bathed himself and dress himself for years and years but this was God's instruction God was making the priesthood and in one sense of the word bow to humility to the higher office above them I know some of our preachers are ashamed to quote the prophet anymore but you're looking this morning at one that is not ashamed of the message of Malachi 4 I'm not ashamed to tell you where I get it from I'm not ashamed to tell you I am anointed with the anointing of the last day years ago I was a Pentecostal preacher and that's the anointing I had on me but I've got a different anointing on me now it's a Rapture anointing it's an Elijah anointing it's a translation anointing it's a Rapture Revelation oh Hal Hallelujah Revelation 10 anointing anybody here with me today now notice God says I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I will sanctify both Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's office the garments they could have them on that was not enough they could have the oil on that was not enough don't you understand what one of the things that separates the bride from the church that the church can have anointing of blessings oh the Lord blesses us and we've got this and we've got that and we're growing and we're doing this that and other sure that comes from just having part of the blessings of the Lord but we don't want just blessings we want life I don't want just the gifts I want the giver my focus give me the giver and I get every gift he's got come on somebody give me the giver I get everything I have need of Hallelujah notice now number again chter 8:1 17 for all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine both man and beast on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I Sanctified them for myself now watch what God did while death is striking all the land of Egypt God is performing a work of sanctification and the firstborn are being sanctified ified by the smearing of the blood over the door the token of course and then going through the rituals of eating the lamb and the bitter herbs so while people are dying people are being Sanctified while people are being killed the firstborn of all the land of Egypt but God said now this is what I'm going to do from this day forward the firstborn of all of Israel belong to me and I sanctify them to myself so then you could either take your son to the Tabernacle and give him a service to the Lord or you could redeem your son that also transferred over uh to your animals and you could redeem them animals or you could bring them to the priesthood so God had a set value on a donkey you remember the prophet talking about that little donkey and she give birth uh to a little old ugly thing and that little old thing come out of there standing there bowlegged standing there and his ears all flopped down but he said that Mama was really taught in the word and she would look at that little donkey of hers and say son you are my firstborn oh but mama my legs are bowlegged and my my ears is all hang down don't worry the priests will never see you because there will be a lamb offered for you Hallelujah God redeemed them all under one spoken word of sanctification now remember just by God speaking this it brought it to pass over the entirety of all the firstborn that was alive and all of those thereafter by the spoken word of God praise the Lord Jesus notice then God said what he done I Sanctified them for myself Jeremiah 1:5 before I form thee in the belly I knew thee before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nation you mean before Jeremiah even got to exercise his free moral agency well some of you Baptists that have a hard time with that wouldn't you God chose Jeremiah before Jeremiah could even know anything about a choice well hang tight he done the bride the same way so God Sanctified Sanctified now I know you're going through your mind right now you're thinking sanctification sanctification you're thinking about the modern term of the way that we look at it and you're thinking about people getting rid of cigarettes and people getting rid of rock and roll music and people cleaning their closet out no no no no that that's what Come Along on down in time but this is the original application of sanctification in the Old Testament that it was something that was hallowed or set apart for the the service of God now remember that God himself is the only one that can sanctify people well enough for the Divine approach remember to approach him we must be accepted and we cannot sanctify ourselves in this sense to a clear enough stage before God that we could walk in there the way we want to well God hey I'm Donny rean I just come to talk to you today I want you to know I want to pray to you a little while no man can come to mees Jesus said except my father draws him first is that your Bible now watch in St John 177 Jesus praying sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth sanctify them set them apart consecrate them Father as thou H has sent me into the world even so have I sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself now does that mean Jesus was sneaking around smoking was Jesus sneaking around drinking a little wine on the side and Jesus was sneaking around doing some things that was wrong no but Jesus was a man and Jesus as a man could have had a wife I'm going to stagger some of you no doubt Jesus as a man could have physically fathered children but it does not mean those offspring would have been literally Sons and Daughters of God but he knew it would stumble some of you if Jesus would have got married and had a wife and had relations with a wife and had a family and all of that some of his people it would have stumbled them they' never been able to understood it so he said I set myself apart if he hadn't already done it enough Oh Praise You Lord Jesus and for their sakes notice now he's praying and he does not say father for your sake I won't do this or I won't do that but I won't for their sakes amen I'll tell you what friends you watch how people relate relate rather to other people and see how they use their cloak of Liberty in things and their attitude toward offending others and you'll be get a pretty good idea if they have eternal life or not how much say jump and scream and shout that don't really that don't really cut it and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth so here there is an element of sanctification that must come from the ministry in order to greatly affect the ministered to watch in Ephesians 5: 25 Paul's speaking husbands love your wives him as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word this is hegeso which is a little different word than what we just read a while ago it means to be hallow be holy separate from profane things dedicate to God to consecrate now this type of sanctification we cannot do ourself he has to do it amen he has to do it we could never separate ourselves from that sinful nature we were born with only God can kill that nature Hebrews chapter 13 verse 12 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered with out the gate so he goes beyond the gate as it was the day that they released the goat when the sins were transferred upon the head of the goat and he went out into the Wilderness so the Lord Jesus suffered without the gate outside of Jerusalem so whether you believe in Gordon's calvary or the original one both of them are outside the wall so it doesn't really matter so he went outside the gate in order to suffer for the people a reject for the rejected notice now man also though has a part in sanctification Exodus 29:37 7 days shall thou make an atonement for the Altar and Sanctified and it shall be an altar Most Holy whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy so when Moses done his part and he went through this this ritual of seven days to sanctify the altar then whenever they would bring a lamb just a regular lamb out on the field a bulock a ram whatever it was and they would place that sacrifice on this holy altar oh instead of this natural sacrifice transforming The Altar and making the altar unclean it had the exact opposite effect so you take this regular bulock this regular lamb this regular turtle dove this pigeon whatever it was and you lay it on the Altar and by simply touching the altar God looked at that and said I accept that Holy Lamb amen amen thank you Lord praise be to God 1 Chronicles 15:14 so the priest and the Levites Sanctified themselves so you mean God wouldn't do this no you see when people come to the Lord God will take many things from them there's people sitting right here today that I know by personal testimony that God took marijuana from them God took cigarettes from them God took drinking from them God took pills from them God took all types of things and there's other things they have battled and struggled and fought with to sanctify themselves through why God wants both efforts of sanctification to be manifested in us as his children children we're already lazy enough us bunch of sorry no good no count for nothing Leo to sins we're rotten we're spoiled we no good come on somebody say at least ouch if you can't say amen and if God done the whole thing would' be worse than what we are so God will do what we cannot do and then God says now I want you to sanctify yourself so the priests and the Levites Sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel 2 Chronicles 29:15 and they gathered them their Brethren and Sanctified themselves and came according to the Commandment of the King by the words of the Lord to cleanse the house of the Lord now notice it's them so they're sanctifying they're laying aside habits they're laying aside things that they know is not right you know the way we do it today for many of us we're waiting on God to take him away from us and God is waiting on us to lay them down I wonder how many years some of you all have lost waiting on God to do something for you that he will never ever do sir praise the Lord y'all still with Me 2 Chronicles Chronicles 2934 but the priests were too few now this is the rededication of course so they could not Flay all the burnt offerings now here's all this levitical order and God would always keep the even the natural reproduction of the Levites to where it would be able to compensate with the growth of the tribes of Israel think of that even naturally you've got all these other 11 tribes that's living out here and as they grow and multiply and multiply if God don't let the priesthood multiply and be able to provide for himself there'll never be enough to be able to take care of all the needs now here it wasn't that there wasn't enough a number that there wasn't enough preachers as we'd say that were in a Sanctified state to where they could take care of the needs of the people so people were bringing offerings and bringing offerings and they were just piling up they were just piling up because there were not enough consecrated priest to be able to fle which means to take the meat off the bone and bring it as the acceptable approach into God's presence notice and they could not Flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their Brethren the Levites did help them till the work was ended until the other priests had Sanctified themselves for the Levites were more upright in their heart to sanctify themselves than the priest oh brother so now remember the Levites it was a whole tribe of Levi Levi but part of them carried the tent part of them washed the pots part of them supplied the oil they were not called to go in as priests so here was the called out of the called out the priesthood was called out of the levitical tribe as the bride is called out of the church so the some of the priests had got so cold and so indifferent on the Commandment of God and the Levites had more of a desire to be holy how sad amen I said how sad oh my 2 Chronicles 31:18 and to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters to all the congregation for in their set off office they Sanctified themselves in Holiness am so in their set office they Sanctified themselves in Holiness now this is not just of course now speaking to the preachers alone every one of you whether you're a singer whether you're a musician whether you're just a member of the Ley you have a position in the body of Christ and nobody can take your place but brother Donnie I'm just a lay member what what what can I do you are to sanctify yourself in your position as Ley you're to pray for those that are the leaders you're to pray and petition as priests and pray for the leadership of God in the ministry not only in our church but around the world that God will get every predestinated seed so we can leave this mess that we're in y'all want to go home I'm tired of this world I'm sick and tired of the sin and the debauchery of evil that we're living in and putting up with every day let's get out of here children but we cannot do it until everyone whose name is on the Book of Life is called chosen Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and in their position watch Paul carry over this in the New Testament 2 Timothy chapter 2: 20 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and you see this also of course in the Tabernacle there were vessels of gold vessels of silver vessels of wood and vessels which were actually clay Earth pottery notice how he Likens this he said and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use you mean that Paul lays a lot of this responsibility on us as individuals yes sir that if a man looks at and it said if I'm no more than a lady or a woman I'm going to be the best that I can be for the kingdom of God I'm going to pray I'm going to read my Bible if they need anything done around the church I'm going to do what I can do I'm going to pray for the ministry I'm going to take the Sunday School teachers on my heart I'm going to take the leaders of the church on my heart that God will help them and lead them I'm going to pray for brother Donnie the way I ain't never prayed for him in my life because brother Donnie needs prayer Amen brother Donnie can tell you that I need prayer yes why I'm trying to to lead you out of this world into a body change look friends the men of God in this age are trying to preach their sheep to a level that no other age has ever done Paul never had to preach his people into a level of a body change Luther never had to preach his people to a level of a body change don't you understand the men of God in this hour are going to accomplish something that has never been done on the face of the Earth they will preach the living bride into a state of a body chain that death will give way hallelujah oh do we need to be Sanctified do we need to present ourself in the presence of God that he can use us not just me you I find this statement in 1 Peter 3:15 very unusual and Peter says but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that askthe of the reason of the hope that is within you with meekness and fear so you s ify the Lord God in your hearts and you're just thinking he's going to say well you go to church and you know you get down on your knees no actually you sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and then you share with others the reason of the hope that's on the inside of you on oh and then some of you all are wondering what can I do what can I do you've got so much to do my goodness we'll never get it done will we watch this if was ever a call to the church to sanctify ourselves and get away from the things of the world we're ready to cross over my goodness friends if you say this 1955 what about now are you ready tonight to throw aside and sanctify yourself from all your unbelief anybody Now watch how this sanctification for self will come into Ed Ying the body I love the way brother Ram deals with this in the adoption series I was talking to a little preacher yesterday going to preach for him and if you Nots up here on the highway and I asked him about a certain thing and he said yes brother Brenham but the most of my people doesn't believe in that I said most of them are legalist and he said yes brother doesn't believe that but he said for their sake you see this puts a pastor in a very odd and unusual State sometimes amen so here this man brother BR was going up to preach for him and of course the doctrine that brother BR was talking about was predestination election for knowledge and all that and many of this Brothers people come from the Pentecostal background which believed in legalism some were Methodist so whenever brother brandham asked him about that and he said yes brother brandham but a lot of my people don't believe that now some of yall know the rest of this quote but some of you I wonder what would be your idea to advise this brother to do I notice he quotes the scripture of the Lord Jesus I sanctify myself for their sake Jesus was training 12 men that through those 12 was to take the gospel to the world it said for their sake I sanctify myself make yourself for for your neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake so don't use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do so if you meet your enemy then what would the natural reaction for a lot of us be it would be get upset at our enemy you know say something or give him that look you know that he knows uh that look of disapproval but when you really learn to sanctify yourself more and more in a deeper consecration you start sanctifying yourself from within now notice he's not saying the spirit of God's going to do this but this is something we're supposed to do we're to sanctify oursel from within and by doing so we are expressing the greater work of God from within our soul I realize friends this is not very deep this morning but I'm actually preaching bride material so for those of you that are interested in going home there you go so if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for San not knowing what what you not knowing what you might do and you're want to be a little Messiah here's your chance sanctify your temper sanctify your arrogance that also carries over on Tik Tok flipflop Instagram and all the rest is social media trash even some of our sisters I understand take the social media and preach a little bit sisters you ain't supposed to be handling the word either behind the pull pit or on Instagram Amen Brother D Amen brother Preacher Brother Donnie I'm with you brother glory to God well thank ke I'm glad y'all are back here cuz they sure ain't many I'm back here I think the sweetest scripture there is in all the Bible it's this scripture father I sanctify myself because of them the SC sweetest scripture in all the Bible he was a man he could have had a wife you say I was making that up a while ago he could have had a home place to lay his head he had rights to that he was a man he could have had good clothes but what did he say father I sanctify myself for their sake what was he doing he was training up 12 disciples that were going to preach the gospel in all the world he put an example and Brethren as ministers I'll tell you it pays us not to get too much of this world's goods and things hanging around us you preachers I'm talking to you you sanctify yourself from them that you're going to lead for them that you're going to lead that's what we need today is a complete consecrated Sanctified life of ministers amen you can go ahead and say Amen it ain't going to make me mad I'm going to say Amen with you hey this is part of the message I know we don't hear preachers read this very much but it's still the truth if we add more Sanctified preachers in the Pulpit but have more sanctified people in the pews notice he said Sanctified life of ministers that walk upright before God does not entangle with the things of the world keep from it father I sanctify myself for their sake for not because he had to but he did it for their sake Romans 12:1 that us change a bit I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of god notice he makes those mercies plural I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living s sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service amen I read that the I thought how is that even possible this was born between Dawn and Betty Reagan I was conceived in sin come to the world speaking lies give my heart to the Lord as a young boy been preaching since I was 18 be 50 years in a few months and yet this ain't got the Holy Ghost a bit more today than it haveen I give my heart to God years ago the flesh I'm talking about so how can I present this as a holy sacrifice so the difference between us now in the New Testament in the Old Testament was they presented dead sacrifices but Paul specifies I beseech you therefore brother by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice so instead of me just killing it one time laying it on the ah there you go God do whatever you want to it well bury that old thing God don't want that God don't want your old dead hide God don't want your dead carcass got your God wants your old live carcass you you could only offer it once if you present it to him as a dead sacrifice but if you give it to him a Living Sacrifice you can do it every day oh glory to God you can do it every day day after day days lead to week weeks weeks lead to months months lead to years and years lead to decades and before long you've dedicated the rest of your entire life to him instead of bringing a dead carcass and laying it on an altar you sanctify yourself for your neighbor's sake you sanctify yourself for your enemy sake you sanctify yourself or maybe a brother in the church that there's something come between you but you sanctify yourself and try to make peace even though in reality he was the one that wronged you thank you Lord but remember even when we come to church sometimes we're not always dealing with sanctified people some people are Sanctified by God but they've never yet learned the latter part of that half of the equation and that is to sanctify themselves so that's why we have gossip in the church now we got visitors here today and I'll just preach our church here because I'm sure they don't have none of it where they go I know brother Jason's church and brother Luke Gibson church and my everybody there just just as sweet as honey I'm telling you what they ain't nothing but Angels them kind of ride motorcycles and we think because well I man I got sanctifying yours aone you know what love the message folks have done they think that sanctification is a one-time thing oh I got San I before got the Holy Ghost so I'll be sanctify the rest of my life you will be sanctifying that mouth of yours just about every time you open it up come on somebody you going to have to sanctify your thoughts you're going to have to sanctify when you go to the house of God somebody will get your parking spot somebody will get your favorite spot in the Pew we'll have to sanctify ourself when we come to the Lord when we come to service the devil will put that old thing in your mind oh I forgot to turn off the curling AR at home I forgot to turn off the crockpot I forgot to do this don't you understand what it is the devil trying to grab a hold of your mind but you sat there and say Satan in the name of Jesus I've come to Worship the Lord I've come to praise God my hands are Sanctified my feet are Sanctified my voice is Sanctified I set them aside for Jesus Christ Hallelujah [Applause] can I have a few more minutes so God's presence in the Tabernacle and in the temple made them holy watch in Matthew 23:16 woe unto you you blind Gods which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the Temple he is a deor you fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold and whosoever shall SAR by the altar it is nothing but whosoever swears by the gift look how backwards they had it the gift that is upon it he is guilty you fools don't you love Jesus gentle mannerism you fools and blind for whether is the greater the gift or the altar so they were magnifying the gift when the gift itself had not the altar Sanctified it could not even be accepted and look how they had changed oh children I'm afraid now that was the end of the Jewish ages and now we are the end of the Gentile ages and if we're not careful the same thing is happening again we're going to magnify the gift over the giver we're going to magnify the gifts come on I believe in the gifts but I do not believe gifts take precedent over the word of God every gift should be subject to God's word and God's message for the hour and the word and the message will sanctify our gifts if we will allow it if not they will be rampant and reproduction of 1906 Aza street so you bring your Al your gift to The Altar and the way they looked at it the gift was greater than the Altar and the gift ofin itself had no ability to transform or change but you placed the gift on the altar it leaves my hands and God changes it it's now accepted so if a consecrated piece of chatim wood overlaid in Gold a little bit of silver if that could transform a normal sacrifice I wonder what God in my soul and God in your soul would be able to do to our body brother Harold we would just allow it to be so and see this is what and you feel you feel so terrible said well this so stinking thing about me I'm so rotten I'm no good I'm this that why should I even worship God this old body of mine we need to move up I hope you understand what this morning is this morning is a call for us to come higher was a higher understanding that oh glory to God that the Eternal himself that lives in our soul wants to San sanctify our body and make the uplifting of our hands as Holiness unto the Lord and the sacrifice of our lips acceptable in the presence of God it is not coming out of a sinner's mouth these are not Sinners hands I don't smoke I don't drink I don't run around but my body is Sanctified by the Living God which is deity inside of my soul there for I can lift holy hands I can lift holy hands at the Corinthian Church remember a lot of Gentiles there mainly Greeks mixed in with Jews some of them that had gotten saved and a question began to raise up among them should the saved wife leave the unsaved husband or should the saved husband leave the unsaved wife because Judaism basically taught the same thing that if a Jew to marry a gentile their children were not holy they were illegitimate same with the Romans which is hard to believe as vile as they were yet they T that if another person if you want your husband or your wife accepted some sort of other religion that you should actually divorce them because your house is not clean your house is divided but watch Paul yes amen and the woman which ha a husband that believeth not if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him am would you notice that it doesn't say let her put him away cuz that wasn't the way he believed it let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband yes amen is Sanctified GL I about had me a spell the other day and the Lord was putting this together I'm telling you the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife can you imagine for the sake of the righteous daughter of God that God will accept her husband as being set apart and Sanctified unto her and because she has found favor Oh Glory in the eyes of God God oh hallelujah hallelujah God looks at them as different what's this the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife you better thank God for this part of this because there's been so many times we have not believed his word we have doubted him we have questioned him oh glory to God but the Fai of our Lord Jesus has Sanctified us brother Paul the face of Abraham Sanctified Sarah remember the prophet of God said Sarah never did believe it was not Sarah's Fai so much it was the fa of Abraham and his facei Sanctified his household glory and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean amen but now are they holy thank you Lord now of course verse 14 does not mean that our children are saved from this but God acknowledges and recogniz us that Christian mate it may be a Godly little woman and maybe every child she's got don't serve God and her husband don't serve God but God sets apart that whole situation amen for that daughter don't give up on your children hallelujah hallelujah don't give up on your grandchildren don't give up on your husband your wife hallelujah look at how powerful the life of one believer and a home [Applause] isall that Christian mate sets apart that home for God's blessing Hallelujah there's many a sinner man that's been blessed by his wife being a child of God there's many a sinner woman there's many a sinner child that's been blessed by being set apart well you say Brother Don there's people that come to our church and ain't right of course they ain't but I figure if they can come long enough they might get around where there's enough of us at they might get a good ghost of the Holy Ghost himself I'd much rather be in here well what if they drink what if they lie what if they run around come on you Liars come on you Jezebels come on you whatever you are come right here this is like a hospital we're here to minister to the sick we're here to minister to the lost we're here to minister to L the SE and wash them by the water of the word and close them with holy garments so they can be set aside for a Rapture so God blesses the lost for the sake of the saved amen amen thank you Lord you parents that have got children that's getting old enough to go out on their own I would keep them in my house as long as I could am I know they're going to get old enough and they're going to make up their mind what they're going to do but you want to hold them under this atmosphere as long as you can amen God in the soul sanctifies this body 1 Timothy 2:8 I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up what kind of hands amen holy hands without WRA and doubting Hebrews 13:15 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God when everything is going good and all your bills are paid and at least once months whether you think he needs it or not you want to know how much you're supposed to praise him you say the word you say it come on don't nod your head I want to hear you say it say it tell yourself this is how much you're supposed to praise God self Donnie you hear that this is how much you're supposed to praise God well I do it I do it three times a day brother Donnie that ain't near [Applause] [Music] enough the SA rice of praise to God continually that is the fruit remember fruit is progeny mixing together two things upper and lower lip new births inside the soul produce mixed together with a Sanctified body what does it produce a sacrifice of praise a sacrifice of praise notice the prophet said the Bible said you're a royal priesthood A peculiar people offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of your lips giving praise unto him oh my the fruits of your lips pouring up praise daily before the people what a high priest we have what a high priest or priesthood that we're in oh come on now don't you love that he didn't just stop with Jesus what a high priest we have and what a priesthood we are in in the priesthood of the circumcision not of the flesh but of the heart amen the heart circumcised by the Holy Ghost that's right then you can offer praise and adoration to God the spiritual sacrifice your lips pouring out praise unto him again they are peculiar people of royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifice giving praise to God listen to these next words whether they feel like it or not Hallelujah whether they feel like it or not that's when it really becomes a sacrifice stand spiritual Amnesia God's church and his people has always been a separated people a called out people A peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name God called his church and separated it from the world for that very purpose God didn't just save you to save you he saved you to love him he saved you to praise him to worship Him I got to read one more is it okay we'll pick it up again but notice this about worship I hope this transforms the way you think about worship we should not Worship the Lord just after we get through preaching the word as we usually do just worship him that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our life when we're at work we should worship him but now notice what he says this is every time the opportunity presents itself Worship the Lord by testifying of him so it's not just you standing be your machine that you work at at work or you driving down the road but worship is also reaching out to others amen watch if you see some of you ladies see a woman in the wrong Worship the Lord by taking her and saying sister there's a better life than this amen wow you mean that is worshiping God worshiping God you man at your work when you hear a man using the name of the Lord in vain and you get a chance to one side and slip over and take it by the hand and say Amen there's a better life than this you shouldn't use those words and tell him in a Meek and GLE way all those things is a worship and when you see someone sick and the doctor says there's no more that can be done we ought to worship God by telling them there's a God in heaven that answers prayer [Music] now let's be honest would we have ever thought that would be worship so you mean by sharing that the Lord Jesus Is A Healer a savior a redeemer you are worshiping God and your you thought it was just about this true divine worship is coming out of your regenerate Soul pouring through lips of a Sanctified Tabernacle Hallelujah I said one more it keeps growing I'm sorry I love this listen to this I'm going to close for sure I believe that Christian Life is a continual sacrifice he that will come after to me let him deny himself daily every day not 46 days of course he's speaking about Linton let every day take up his cross and follow me said Jesus not just 46 but every day Jesus actually spoke about your cross more than he spoke about his own look how many times in the gospels he mentioned you taking up your cross and see how many times he talked about himself taking up his he knew the harder battle wouldn't be himself it'd be us oh how the Christian loves to to it he doesn't do it with a grudge he doesn't oh he he does it with a a feeling that he loves God and he's glad he can do it it's a joy to serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to Worship the Lord It's a joy to be called a fanatic for the kingdom of God's sake praise the Lord some of y'all said praise God for the first time so I ask you Priests of God in a little bit you'll be walking out them doors what till we going to do but Brother Don I've wasted so many years forget all the waste what are you going to do from today forward don't do a bit of good to spend all of our time Walling on our mistakes and we've all done all that but what are we going to do from this day forward as Priests of the most high God we have been Anointed with an anointing the eagle anointing of the last days to loose the seals to release the Thunders the voice of God to release a building of a body of God on the earth that would actually come to such a state of maturity their completion and Perfection will call for the rest of the dead I'm not just waiting to see my little girl I'm wanting to see Paul and Peter amen James and John when the resurrection happens it's going to be all of them it ain't going to just be those from our church those from our age they are all waiting on us Hallelujah Jesus if God can sanctify us on his part and then us sanctify us the rest rest of the way and lay aside our you our differences and our doctrines and sure we're always going to have things and there there's certain stands we have to take that we cannot compromise on no but I'm talking about things many things that we argue and fuss about it don't even pertain to Salvation in the first place and if we can go to loving one another and praying for one another even though we don't agree with one another my goodness how many people agreed with Jesus and they prayed for all of them look at the prophet of God what an attitude look at the spirit I don't just study this message I study the spirit this message was delivered in you know I find that messenger saying people throw him out he just draw a Bricker circle they' throw him out that Circle he draw a bigger one they throw out that she kept on drawing a bigger one well come on somebody boy if anybody throws us out of the circle GL to God I'm turn them over to the devil Hallelujah they repat their serpent seat now show me where the prophet of God or the Lord Jesus had that attitude he kept praying for him father forgive them for they don't know what they do and I don't mind telling you I'm going to go ahead and say it I don't figure there's anybody here today that don't need a closer walk with God I don't fig there's none of us here today that ain't messed up and messed up and scrupled up and all kinds of mess ever was if it ain't for the grace of God there won't be none of us go noow if it's going to take Grace for me why not give Grace to somebody else and Grace to somebody else and Grace to somebody else Remember The Headstone is not coming crying Doctrine Doctrine Doctrine The Headstone is not coming crying gifts gifts gifts but the headstone is coming crying Grace Gra why because that's what we need it's going to take the rapturing grace of almighty God to get this bride together but he will do it it will be a miracle for him to get her together but listen out devil let me tell you right now the Lord God will get his bride together from around the world in every nation every tongue every Kindred they will come to that place of rapturing faith and all hell will not be able to stop him Hallelujah par it Lord God what an awesome day to be living dear Jesus I come before you today as a priest of God my brothers and sisters also come I don't come as their priest necessarily and that I'm above them and greater than them and have a greater position than them I come with them every daughter of God standing here today Born Again filled with the Holy Ghost is part of the priesthood of of God I remember that day when that little woman had that baby and it was crying and crying little sister satting there in a chair felt so sorry for her gave her her seat she had a prayer card and she said honey God just keep putting it on my heart to pray for you old baby I know brother Ram's going to pray for it but would you just let me pray for it just kind of get this out why sure dear go ahead that little sister laid her hands on that baby the woman come in the prayer line God shows the Prophet The Vision he does not rebuke that woman for praying for her but he said God healed her whenever the woman prayed for her but brother Randon was not after arrogance and pride well glory to God I prayed for him so that puts another feather in my hat he didn't have feathers in his hat he wanted all the glory to go to you and he said the reason was that little mother could have a Fe feeling that maybe he couldn't have the same way father whenever they'd bring a cross-eyed child across the platform there wasn't a one of them not a one of them that ever walked off that wasn't healed why recalling his little Sharon rose laying there eyes crossed with the pain it puts such a feeling in the heart of this priest many of us can share with those things Lord may we walk out of here today brothers sisters ministers non- ministers alike and realize we are called to intercede we are called to pray we are called to sanctify ourselves we're called To Worship we're called to present sacrifices one of the greatest we can ever give you is to place our bodies on your altar as a living sacrifice Lord God I don't know how many more years or months or weeks or whatever that I have I live in a few months I'll be 68 years old I'm an old man wow it's hard for me to Fathom sometimes I don't know how much more time I've got I don't know how many more sermons I get to preach but how much ever life I have left I want to give it all to you Lord I want want to be sensitive so if your Holy Spirit comes upon me it lows which it does and Home Depot and it does I want to be so sensitive that I can stop whatever I'm doing whatever I've got planned for the day other people say oh yeah that's wonderful thank God we have a pastor like that but help them to realize I want sheep like that and that's the kind of sheep you want where you can deal with this and maybe they're fixing breakfast so they're at the grocery store and the Lord puts brother Daryl on a sister's heart to pray for him and she just pulls a little basket of groceries over to one side and Bows her head Lord God I don't know why but I pray for brother Daryl today that you'd help him she may not know he's just left a meetting over mour Arkansas and his back went out this morning when he got up at 4:00 to head home or something like that and she's praying for him he's going along in pain and Agony and the spirit of God comes in his car where he's at and touches our brother why cuz a daughter of God obeyed the Holy Ghost and Sanctified her time praise the Lord oh Jesus I wonder how much you want to do Among Us not just from the pulpit out but in the body you didn't just save me sanctify me Sanctified the preachers you've Sanctified a wife is I accorded to him the other the other night that for many thousands of years the Jewish vows of a man taking a wife would be thou sanctify thee unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel what I've heard today is you saying to your bride my wife my spouse my beloved be thou Sanctified unto me for I am the god the god of Israel Lord Jesus we worship you father and many but just just like to take a few moments and maybe just have a rededication service this morning it ain't been that long since we dedicated this building but maybe we could just rededicate ourselves our praise our time our thoughts you know it already I don't need to tell you but one of the greatest shortages that we have in this day is time remember that message I preached to you years ago the bondage of time never enough time are they Satan's got more and more and more things to occupy our time than ever before and the difficult part about it is many of those things are not sinful they are not wrong but we just give so much time to this and time to that the prophet said as far as he knew he never stole anything in his life but he had stole time from God maybe many of you have not stole one thing since you've got saved but I wonder how many of us have stole time time that he wants oh Hallelujah Lord God I bless your name Jesus please forgive me please forgive me Lord hallelujah hallelujah many wants to just rededicate your life with me today deacons trustees ministers sisters brothers young people those of you that are streaming the service at the archive it may you pull

So may they use that faith and that passion and pray for that family. Dear heavenly father, and all these other needs, Lord, I can't remember them, but you see them, Lord.

And we like that, don't we? Yes, we do. Amen. Sing it, buddy. [Music] When all foundations have been shaken. When I'm left standing in the dark. When I'm in the pillow, heart is breaking. You still rain and you're still God. And when it feels all hope is gone, heavy questions so hard. And though my soul may feel forsaken, you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, [Music] I know that you can trust your heart. [Music] And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] I will declare you with my faith. Though voices whisper that you're not, you'll never leave me nor forsake me. But you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, [Music] I know I can trust you with your heart. And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] And though I can't see what's before me, I know I can trust you with my heart. And this one truth will be my story. [Music] You still reign and you're still God. [Music] And when my enemy surrounds me, I trust the victory of your cross and fix my eyes upon you, Jesus. For you are God and I am not. [Music] And though I can't see what's before me, I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. [Music] You still reign and you still God. You are good and you are faithful as you have been from the start. You work in all things for your glory. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] Yes, this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Ask the brothers to put this on the screen. I I really didn't want to sing this by myself. Um, last time I sung his song, it was during the prayer line and I battled singing it cuz I stood there and I was like, \"This is not a congregational song. This is not a congregational song.\" And then Aaron, he looked at me and he's like, \"All right, it's your time to I was like, this is not a congregational song.\" And then everybody proved me wrong and said, \"This was this is a very good congregational song. So, if you'll help me sing it. If you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles. If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies. If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside, there's a better life. There's a better life. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. If you need freom, save it. He's a prison shaking savior. If you got chains, he's a chain breaker. [Music] We've all searched for the light of day in the dead of night. And we've all found ourselves worn out from the same old fire. And we've all run to things we know just ain't right. But there's a better life. There's a better life. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. If you need freedom, save it. He's a prison shaking savior. If you got change, he's a chain breaker. [Music] If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it, somebody testify. If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it. Somebody testify. Testify. If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it, somebody testify you got pain. He's a pain. If you feel lost, he's a way. And you need freedom for savior. He's a prison shaking savior. You got change. He's a chain breaker. Sing that course again. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. You need freedom, a savior. He's a prison shaking savior. God change. He's a change of beauty, freedom, a s. He's a prison shaking savior. Got chains. He's a chain breaker. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is he your chain breaker? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here. I just pray that you come expecting. &gt;&gt; You know, I've said it before. Not too high. I can't do this. He can. &gt;&gt; It's like you can't sit there, but he can. &gt;&gt; Right. You're not going to get anything if you just sit there. You come expecting. What am I doing? Uh if you don't come expecting, you're just come to a building. But if you come expecting, then he's going to speak to you. Amen. God bless you. If you would turn with me to Genesis, Genesis 12. We're going to read several places, Lord willing. Verses 1 and three. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful to you, Lord. We love you so much and we thank you, Lord Jesus, that you've called us. And Lord, not only did you call us, Lord, but you give us the grace to respond to that call, Father. And Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to you, Lord. We see you in every avenue of our lives, Lord. Lord, even when we're doing wrong, we we've got the grace to have you, Lord, tell us that we're wrong. We're so thankful for that, Lord. There's many people that do wrong and don't even know it, Father. Lord, as the bride of Christ, we're so blessed, Father. And Lord Jesus, tonight we're here, Lord, not to see one another. Although it's nice to see everybody, Lord, but we've come to see you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we have to look past the veil many times, Lord. And tonight is is another night that we're we're asking that you would help not only myself look past the veil, Lord, and help me to understand that I'm speaking to God in flesh, but I'm asking that they would look past this veil and understand that God in flesh is speaking to them. Father, I pray that you would just take control of this service, Lord. You know what's on my heart. You know, Lord Jesus, that I've studied and I've looked at this, Lord. And well, to be honest, Lord, if my thoughts are here, I I don't want them. I just want you to have your way, Lord. I I pray that you would take these things and just make them and custom fit each and every individual. Lord, we love you and we thank you for it, Lord. We ask it in your name. Amen. Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord willing, I'm going to speak on destroying all hope. Um destroying all hope. Um I know hope is faced, little sister, and it's important, but I I think sometimes that God wants us to destroy the hope and get to faith. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hope waivers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We've hoped for a lot of things in our lives, but when you have that faith that comes from God, it don't waver. &gt;&gt; It don't waver. And and another thing about hope, and I was just praying and thinking about this, you know, a Christian's faith doesn't determine the outcome. A real Christian's faith doesn't determine God's will. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? So, we can have all the faith in the world and we can really believe and we we've seen it even here in this church. We've really believed for Sister Erica. That didn't that didn't waver what God's will was. &gt;&gt; We were following general orders, right? &gt;&gt; We were doing exactly what God called us to do. just believe because there's nowhere in the scripture that says have faith and so and so is going to pass away. That's that's not what's in the scripture this have faith. &gt;&gt; But as a Christian, we have faith in God that his will will be done. as a real Christian. The ones that that fall away from from from God and Christianity are the ones that that say they have faith and they might actually have faith, but they don't have faith that God is going to do his perfect will. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just keep that in mind. if we're going to I I I preached this in in Monosel a couple weeks ago, but the Lord's kind of turned it and we'll see how far he turned it. You know what I'm saying? Amen. Now the Lord said had said unto Abram, \"Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee, and I will make thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will make thee a great nation.\" Now, this is Abram, still not father of nations. This is just Abram. So, he's putting that promise forth, right? &gt;&gt; Believe it, receive it. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Uh he will heal the sick. He will, you know, you I I've called you to prosper and be in good health. All those promises. There's a promise right here. &gt;&gt; And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that cursth thee. And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. Man, that's a lot of that's a lot of promises right there. That's a lot of things. That's that's God putting his for his word forth. He's sewing forth. I don't want to wear you out. Go ahead and be seated. Let me stand for a little while. You go ahead. Now, we're going to turn to to Genesis 13 uh 14- 16. And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place with thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward. So we see here that God has he he made the promise. He made the promise and it's out there, but he's still not the father of nations. &gt;&gt; And there was things that he had to do. Now, now Abram believed God, right? &gt;&gt; He believed God. He was there. The faith was there. He had a supernatural interaction with God. &gt;&gt; Just like every one of you, if you're real Christians, you've had a supernatural interaction with God with your salvation. That's something supernatural. Logically, humanity doesn't see this unknown being, right? &gt;&gt; And he doesn't see how in the world that he could save us &gt;&gt; naturally. But you've had a super something supernatural happen to you that you believe in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have a supernatural interaction with God. So, we're we're we're believing. That's faith. We believe in that. That's faith. But Abram had to separate from Lot. He had to start getting things out of his life that were interfering. Right. And so he's moved from justification, being called &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; into sanctification, getting cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Right. But it still doesn't make him a father of nations. &gt;&gt; It's still not producing the seed. &gt;&gt; Right. justification, sanctification. For all the land which thou seeest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that the man so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. So here he is repeating again. That's why we come to church. This ain't nothing new, brothers and sisters. I'm not here to surprise you with with new word. That's if I am, then you need to get me out of here because there ain't you know that's not right. This this is not new. I'm just maybe bringing in a different way or or I can express it in a way in in a moment in your life right now that you'll see it better. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not bringing anything new. &gt;&gt; So Abram is God is dealing with Abram the same way. He's telling him over and over again, your seed. You'll be blessed. You're the father of nations, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Abram's like, \"Okay, all right. I I'm seeing it.\" And as now, Abram, sanctify yourself. All right. I can do that. I'm going to separate myself. Now, I'm a little hard-headed. It's going to take me a while. We can't go through the whole whole scripture. And I don't know anybody else like that. But old Abram, bless his heart, he was a little hard-headed. It took him a while. We know the story. I We don't have time to to rehash all that, but you understand where I'm coming from. And this these are not the these are just a couple points that that I picked up. Now, let's go to Genesis 18 verse 10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. So, here's that promise all those years ago and it's been repeated and it's been told and Abram was still believing &gt;&gt; but he had somebody very close to him &gt;&gt; that their faith had kind of fallen off. &gt;&gt; It kind of fell off. &gt;&gt; She's like, \"Well, that was nice.\" &gt;&gt; Oh, Abram, bless his heart. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's kind of it's kind of shaken a little bit. &gt;&gt; We all have those &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; We all have those that we we go through the we we believe and we have this faith and we get sanctified and then we think we come across old friends or our family and they're saying, \"Is that message really &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; necessary? Is holiness really necessary?\" That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you really have to live that way? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Was a prophet really necessary? I mean, there's plenty of Baptist churches that that have a lot to offer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If if you don't want to go to the Baptist, you can go to the Methodist or the the Pentecostals. Pentecostals. Shout. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and and work it out. I'm a good Christian. I don't know how many times I've heard that. I don't have to believe like that. &gt;&gt; I love God. They have faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They have faith. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; They had to. They believe in Jesus Christ. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But here they are. And those those things whisper in ear. We've had a great falling away from the message. Did they ever have really have faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, they really had faith, but it only come to a spot. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Any anybody that can talk you into something can also talk you out of it. Right. &gt;&gt; There's something in me that I don't care that crazy. I don't I don't understand why in the world people would walk away from this. &gt;&gt; I just don't get it. &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to comprehend. And then I see the ones that have walked away and most of them their lives went &gt;&gt; they lost everything. &gt;&gt; Their dignity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Used to have a standard. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now there's no standard. &gt;&gt; Huh. But they had faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't the faith of God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And they went ahead and took God's permissive will. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, \"After I am waxed old, shall I have pleasure with my Lord also?\" or being old also doesn't make sense. This don't this don't line up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everybody in the world is is is doing this. I can come in and I can worship God and I can at any old church. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; he did. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. They had faith in that. And the Lord said unto Abram, Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of shy bear a child which I am old? And I meant to mention this. It's Sarah and Abraham at this point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; let's just stop right there just for a second. At this point, he's the father of nations. &gt;&gt; And he's got one son, Ishmael, &gt;&gt; it's not the promised son, &gt;&gt; and it's not certainly not of nations, right? &gt;&gt; It's not what God has is has really called him to. He knew that it was supposed to come through Sarah. And Sarah said, \"Let me help you out, God.\" Oh, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; I wish that I could take back all those times that I helped God out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be awesome? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'd be a whole lot further down the road. &gt;&gt; If I would stop helping God out and if I could take back the times that I did help God out, &gt;&gt; preach now, &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir. Oh, the mighty John. Let me help you out, God. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I got this. &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. To take those away. &gt;&gt; And to never do it again. Let's be honest, &gt;&gt; cuz every one of us here, the Lord Terries, is going to try and help him out again cuz we just we're hard-headed and we still got flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Is anything too hard for the Lord? Back in church again. at the appointed time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son. Uh that the one who doubted the one who questioned the one who shook on her faith in what God really told them or and and and told Sarah you're going to have this child and she laughed at him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And God looked past her ignorance &gt;&gt; because his will will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Children of God can only fall into permissive will for so long. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's been times I've been in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; There's been too many times I've been in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; However, because I am a son of God, because you are sons and daughters of God and you're the bride of Christ, &gt;&gt; your final act will not be his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It will be his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let that soak in just a minute. &gt;&gt; There's plenty of people out there that are falling into his permissive will time and time and time again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they'll end up in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But we have real faith. We have something anchored and solid, something that that's going to hold us and keep us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And when all the dust settles and everything shakes out from our hearts, it's going to be yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not my way, Lord. It's your way. &gt;&gt; It's not my will, Lord. It's your will. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it takes, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to take control of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at Genesis 22 verses 1. I got a lot to cover, so we're going to have to verses one through. We're going to try. And it came to pass after the these things that God did did tempt Abraham. What? &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. The devil is the tempter. Not according to this right here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God did tempt Abraham. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Why would God do that? Cuz we need faith at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we need unshakable, unquestioning faith at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; That's why God will tempt us. &gt;&gt; He will shake us. He will question us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. People don't just pick up a basketball and are able to play basketball or baseball or sewing or whatever cooking. Lord, please help us. They don't just go in a kitchen and just make this meal that's just fantastic. Takes practice. Right. &gt;&gt; Takes years of practice. &gt;&gt; Well, what makes you think it that we're just going to step into this faith? &gt;&gt; If God don't have us practice believing what God has for us, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are we just supposed to step into this and say, \"Well, I'm here, God. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; I hear your call.\" &gt;&gt; Wow. True. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a rude awakening when God tempt us. &gt;&gt; It's hard. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And some of those those things go back to that that wanting God's will more than we want our own way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's so easy to pout on God. &gt;&gt; That's good. We all have that lip that can roll right on out. &gt;&gt; We just push that thing out there. You You said you were going to heal me and I had to wait three weeks. &gt;&gt; You said you'd provide my every need. And &gt;&gt; I had to go to the food stamp office. &gt;&gt; Guess what? He did provide your need. Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; Just not the way you wanted, &gt;&gt; right? But we get this attitude against God saying, \"Hey, this is the way it should be.\" &gt;&gt; It's truth. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; But we have to practice that. We have to get into that mode where we struggle sometimes &gt;&gt; and we believe. We really believe. We're taking the word and we're taking it. We're eating it and we're believing saying, \"God, you'll provide my every need.\" And I have to ask somebody for $10 for gas or whatever it might be. &gt;&gt; It's getting tight in here. &gt;&gt; Some of us don't like it. I don't I don't like it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Humble thyself. Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to heal me. Yeah. Go to the doctor. Right. There's all kinds of variation of this the same mindset, the same thing that we've had on God because we expect God to do things a certain way because we wanted the miraculous. We wanted the the the spiritual, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We want to hear it from the pulpit and embrace it and and just take it. &gt;&gt; Well, you got to embrace and take this part, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, \"Take now thy son, thine only son.\" Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Didn't we say Ishmael was here? &gt;&gt; All those things that we helped with, &gt;&gt; he don't even recognize. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Chalk that up to stupidity. &gt;&gt; I'm not even going to recognize that. That's good. &gt;&gt; And Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and claved the wood, the burnt offerings, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. So Abram, Abraham is making preparation to do exactly what God said. We're walking. He's walking in the word. And every day Abraham has those scriptures. I'll make thy seed as the sands of the sea. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's got those. They're they're tucked away in his heart. He's got those promises &gt;&gt; and he's waiting at any moment for God to intervene because he knows that's what the promise is. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's real faith. &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting God to intervene at any moment. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't waver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith from God wanting his will doesn't shake from one side or the other. But but every step we're saying, \"Okay, God, you're leading me this direction. I'm going to go this direction.\" &gt;&gt; And at any moment, you could step on the scene and change this situation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he says, \"Yes, yes, I can.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do next? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says he didn't tell Syria, Sarah, his wife. &gt;&gt; No, he did &gt;&gt; cuz he was afraid that she was going to knock him down. Hm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got two servants and his son and his animal and the wood and he said, \"We'll be back in a few days.\" \"Where are you going?\" Oh, it's a surprise. He didn't lie and he took off. And at first Abraham said, \"Well, maybe if I get everything ready, God will stop me.\" &gt;&gt; And then God didn't stop him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then he said, \"Well, maybe if we head down the road, we start out, then God will have me just turn around. He knew the promise. &gt;&gt; Maybe you woke up with a head cold and and first thing in the morning you said, \"Well, Lord, you're my healer. At any moment you could take it away at any time. I'm believing. I'm going to praise you for it.\" Ah, and you're doing exactly what the word says. Exactly what the word says. I'm going to praise you for it. I'm going to believe for it. By this afternoon, that head coat will be gone. Afternoon comes and goes. Well, I'll believe for it. I'm going to take some nightquil. I'm going to get a good night's sleep. Lord, is it okay if I take nightquil? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My face not shaking. I just I just need to get some sleep, Lord. You wake up in the morning and it's worse. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? This is this is in everything in our lives. We we we I wake up in the morning say, \"Lord, come quickly.\" &gt;&gt; And I have to go through my whole day. This is what's expected of us. We had to go through our whole day expecting him to come in a twinkling in an eye, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What's What's the difference? &gt;&gt; What's the difference between that and what Abraham had to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting. We're supposed to be anticipating his coming and living &gt;&gt; like he can come any moment. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we have to go put our work boots on. &gt;&gt; I wish we could skip that part. &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly, Lord. &gt;&gt; If that's what it takes to get you in that mindset of of even so, come quickly. &gt;&gt; We got to plant our potatoes, too. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. He's called us that. &gt;&gt; Some of them crazy people that that believed that God was coming back in 77 or what it was, went out and got loans and all that and and went into debt and they left the message because he didn't come the way that he &gt;&gt; that that they thought he should come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; man. There's plenty of loonies out there. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about out there. I'm talking about in the message ranks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Some of these people are crazy. &gt;&gt; But even so, come quickly. But Lord, I I'm going to have to save up for a car in case mine breaks down or whatever more. &gt;&gt; That's real faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's expecting the best. and planning for the worst. &gt;&gt; Nobody likes that side of it. &gt;&gt; I don't like that side of it. I wish it was all gumb gumballs and lollipops and rainbows and whatever else, &gt;&gt; but it's not. Reality is he's called us to a faith. Lord, I want your perfect will. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. And if it's your perfect will for me to go through this trial, this struggle, this low valley, &gt;&gt; even so come quickly. &gt;&gt; Circumstance does not change the bride's outcome. Then on the third day, day three, Abraham so showed him or God showed Abraham where he was supposed to go. It wasn't a quick trip. Three days he started heading in a direction. &gt;&gt; It sounds like life. &gt;&gt; Just heading in a direction. Now, our goal is to get where God called us to be. &gt;&gt; And day by day, &gt;&gt; moment by moment, we're progressing along. We have that faith that God is going to move for us. We have that faith that God is doing something in our lives. And we also have that faith knowing that he's called us to do something that's uncomfortable sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. Can you imagine in I don't know about you, but in with me in my heart when I know I have something that I have to do that I don't like. &gt;&gt; Lord, please help me. Lord, I I don't Lord, you know this is this is not what I had in mind. &gt;&gt; Lord, this is uncomfortable for me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to work with that person again. Lord, I know that you're molding me and making me and you're using that guy and I'm not supposed to ball up my fist. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hey, you're never going to get anything else but brother John up here. I'm sorry. This is just me. I'm not trying to be nothing. I'm not trying to hide from from me. Unfortunately, you can see it. &gt;&gt; Three days, Abraham. Oh, Lord, please help me. I don't know what I don't know what you're doing, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's those times and and Abraham felt like his prayers didn't even get up past the ceiling. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He'd lay there and he's asking, \"God, please. I know what you promised. I know what you said. I know that I'm going to be the father of nations.\" And you said the seed would come through Sarah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you said that it was going to be Isaac. &gt;&gt; And you've called me to go sacrifice him. I I I don't I don't understand. Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe I'm the only one who's ever had the I don't understand thoughts. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't get it. &gt;&gt; And it's human nature to want to understand what's going on. We want to be in control. If we understand it, we can control it a little better. Some of you have been praying for deliverance for years and years from a certain habit, a certain thing. &gt;&gt; Let's just get down to where it is. &gt;&gt; We know in the word it's against his word the the the besetting sin that's hanging on us. We know it's against his word to have this attitude towards somebody or an attitude at all in a certain way. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we're walking along and we struggle with it and we say, \"Lord, you said that you deliver me from this and I'm fighting it still.\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's against your word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not your will for me to be having this. Some of you it's it's it's doubt that you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's things that you hide. Some of you it's things that are very apparent. An attitude. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a habit. &gt;&gt; It's all these things. You know what your yours is. I know what mine is. &gt;&gt; And we know it's God's will that it's not supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; And we go day by day and we're under we're we're we're we're questioning and we don't understand. We've got these questions. God, why? Why am I here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know I can't serve you the right way with this guilt hanging on me. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I told you it might go in a different direction. Let me tell you, this is a different direction. &gt;&gt; I know this isn't your perfect will. And I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. And yet I still have this thing. &gt;&gt; That's a hard way to be. It's a hard way to live. &gt;&gt; Guilt is an awful thing. And for a Christian that's falling short of the glory of God, that guilt is very prevalent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it should be. &gt;&gt; It should bother you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that Holy Ghost saying, \"Hey, you're better than this.\" &gt;&gt; It's that Holy Ghost saying, \"Hey, you're better than this. You mean the Holy Ghost would tempt us?\" &gt;&gt; And God did tempt Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He didn't say he was wasn't going to deliver him. Now, Abraham was in the midst of the trial. He didn't know the end. We're we we have the luxury of knowing the end of Abraham's story. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. We have the luxury of knowing the end of your story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's rapture, right? &gt;&gt; It's that perfect word living in us. &gt;&gt; But in the middle of it, what does it feel like? It's so heavy. I don't understand God. Right? &gt;&gt; Why can't I overcome this? God, why are you tempting me this way? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This ain't in my notes. And we know what his perfect will is this in this situation. Just like Abraham knew what his the perfect will was in his situation. &gt;&gt; But it don't always make it easy. &gt;&gt; Guilt don't go away because you know you're not supposed to &gt;&gt; and that you will overcome it. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have faith that you will. &gt;&gt; That's that's right. But it don't make it easier to deal with. &gt;&gt; Not as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Three days journey. He's still waiting. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's been 10 years journey. You're still waiting. That's tight. &gt;&gt; Come on. Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off. Oh, it was like I was telling my son Ben on the way over here. I said, \"This is the worst part of the service.\" I get up here and I I I've been preaching long enough and I've done it enough that I know that if I submit and get out of the way, then he'll take over. This part's easy right now. Now the pre and the post not so fun. The pre you're thinking, \"Oh, am I really finding the mind of God?\" And then afterwards like, \"Boy, you really miss God. It's miserable.\" &gt;&gt; So Abraham was preparing to take off and he knew that he was going to have to face Sarah and have have to ask her some questions, maybe skirt around a few questions. And then when he saw that a far off, he knew, \"Oh, it's coming. It's coming.\" And Abraham said unto his young men, \"Abide here with the ass, and I will and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you.\" Abra Abraham was tempted of God. Abraham understood the promise. He's still waiting for God to intervene at this moment. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Still waiting for God to intervene. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But he knew the promise and he quoted the promise and he stayed with the promise. I and the lad will return. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen. I don't know when God's going to step in here, but I know what the promise is. Right, &gt;&gt; brother and sister. Are you glad you know what the promise is? &gt;&gt; Thank God. I'd go crazy if I didn't know the promise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be able to make it if I didn't know what the promise is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He kept quoting the promise. His testimony was positive. &gt;&gt; Should we stop there for just a minute? His brother Joel Forny says, \"Wowy, wowy woo.\" We get those wowsy wowsy woo moments. Poor me. I can't believe I'm going through this. God, why are you doing this to me? God, you said I was an overcomer. I'm not an overcomer because I'm still dealing. And a testimony and the confession is not what it should be. If you're in the midst of that besetting sin, if you're in the midst of that problem, in that situation, God's still your deliverer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still the one who made the promise, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Circumstance doesn't change. Jonah and the whale, right? Surrounded by b whale belly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; His circumstance didn't dictate the outcome. &gt;&gt; Right. Sure did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The promise was he was going to preach in Nineveh. &gt;&gt; He didn't like it. He didn't want to do it. &gt;&gt; He ran from it. God said, \"Guess what? You're going through a pipe, old boy, or a fish in this circumstance. &gt;&gt; Not going to be fun. &gt;&gt; Circumstance didn't change the outcome. Your circumstance, brothers and sisters, will not will not change your outcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; His will is what determines where we end up. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Not our circumstance. &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Not our issues, not our our attitudes, but his will will determine our outcome. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; and Abraham took the the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and a knife. And they went both of of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, \"My father.\" And he said, \"Here am I, my son.\" And he said, \"Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\" &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb for the burnt offering? Lord, you said you were my deliverer. &gt;&gt; You said you were my healer. &gt;&gt; You said I was an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb? &gt;&gt; Where's the sacrifice? By your stripes, I am healed. &gt;&gt; I can't heal you anymore. He can't heal you anymore than he did on the cross. There's a promise. The work was performed. It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Where's my burnt offering, Lord? And Abraham said, \"My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.\" So they both for So they went both of them together right up on the hill. Now Isaac was scratching his head too, &gt;&gt; still questioning. And they came to the place where God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there. And he laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. Following through, following through. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's not going to act ask us to sacrifice our son, &gt;&gt; but he might ask us to sacrifice our pride. &gt;&gt; It's hard to say God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the doctor. God's a healer. Right. It's his word. &gt;&gt; It's his word. &gt;&gt; Abraham knew what he was promised. Brothers and sisters, we get so much going on and we've got so much of life happening. &gt;&gt; Life life isn't chaotic anymore. It just happens. &gt;&gt; I'm past the chaos. I'm used to the chaos. Maybe I'm the only one, but I'm used to the chaos. &gt;&gt; It just happens &gt;&gt; and we have to deal with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God expects us and not only does he expect us to to deal with it, but he expects us to do it well. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I have I've I've I've asked all my kids. This is one of my rules growing up in my house. They don't like it when I preach. It's nothing bad. Don't worry, boys. You need to work in the in the food service or um what's the other thing? Retail. So, you know how to treat somebody when you order food and they get it wrong. Boy, that's hard. Boy, that's hard to do. But if you ever been on the other side of it and guess what? You know how to treat somebody. I can tell the ones that worked in retail, they're all no joke &gt;&gt; cuz we've all had those customers &gt;&gt; and they're always right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you feel like they're just right for knocking out. But we need to be able to treat people with kindness in spite of the problems that we have. And it's frustrating &gt;&gt; and it's hard. &gt;&gt; But we need to learn how to deal with stuff. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; We need to learn how to treat people that aren't Christians. &gt;&gt; Because just because they're not treating you like a Christian would treat you doesn't mean that you shouldn't treat them like a Christian should treat them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be the only Jesus they see &gt;&gt; all day long. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Have you seen some of them characters working in that fast food joint? They ain't seen G Jesus and a lot of them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You might be the only ones. That was free. That wasn't in my notes either. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,\"Abraham, Abraham.\" And he said, \"Here am I.\" Ah. And he said, \"Lay not thine hand upon thy lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearst God.\" Fearst God. How fierest God. I'm going to keep believing and I'm going to keep trusting. If it's it's so important that we keep the mindset God's knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; But I'm lonely. God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. H. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been sick for this long. God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this besetting sin. I'm an overcomer. It's going to happen. The promise is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that you should just embrace that besetting sense of, \"Oh, God's using it. Oh, I No. No. Quite the opposite. You push that thing away and you stomp it and you kick it and you tell it, \"I will not. This is not me. &gt;&gt; This is not me.\" &gt;&gt; I'm not catering to this. &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You ever been in such a place in your life and you've been fighting with something for so long and it seems like and your prayers turn from even so come quickly to Lord, can you wait till I overcome this? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; There won't be a lot of people that admit that, Brother Freddy. But I've been in that place where I've said, \"Oh Lord, you're going to have to hold on a couple days till I overcome this cuz I know this ain't right.\" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's where we are, brothers and sisters. It it it's not supposed to shake us. It's not going to shake us. We're sons and daughters of God. He knows what's best for us. &gt;&gt; We are overcomers. &gt;&gt; We're not always overcomers on our time because our strength is nothing. We can't do it on our own. &gt;&gt; And maybe that's the very point that he's trying to get across to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That might be the whole reason why you're struggling with this thing, whatever it might be, because he wants you to settle in and know that you are nothing &gt;&gt; without him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't overcome anything without him. And maybe he wants you to settle in and say, \"God, I give up.\" &gt;&gt; I'm done. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've had a demon cast out of me by a look of a man of God cuz I was at that point. I was praying about something and struggled and struggled and struggled. And this brother just looked at me. He was under the anointing. He was in a place. He didn't even pray for me. He didn't lay his hands on me. And I knew at that very moment that I was delivered. &gt;&gt; How's that possible? &gt;&gt; I finally said, \"God, I've been trying for years. I can't do it. &gt;&gt; Here's a man of God. Here's an opportunity. I I'm giving it to you.\" Amazing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We've got to get to the place, brothers and sisters, where we realize that it's God and only God. All he wants us to do is believe. &gt;&gt; See the promise and walk towards it. Keep going towards it. Keep going towards it. Keep moving towards it. But I got this circumstance don't matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says in Jehovah Gyra. Now what if Abraham says now wait was that vision true? Let me study now. Was that vision true? Brother Ram saying, is Abraham going to question his experience with God? Something that's settled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's where the devil wants to get you. &gt;&gt; Now, God said for me to take my boy and kill him. Now, how am I ever going to to be the father of nations? And that's my seed. And that's a promise seed. Now, how am I ever going to be the father of nations when God is destroying the only hope I have? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Destroying the only hope that I have. &gt;&gt; Is that the hope? Only hope that I have. No, I still have I still got his word. He promised me back there that he'd do it. And through Isaac, all the world would would be blessed. Through Isaac, all the world would be blessed. &gt;&gt; Through you, all the world will be blessed. The bride is what's holding back &gt;&gt; those demons. &gt;&gt; So he said, listen to Abraham now. I received him as one from the dead. I'm persuaded that God is able to raise him up from the dead. Oh my, even with a a horse throat, I feel religious. So brother Brandham's got a horse throat. If I receive received him as one from the dead, what? Guess what? The garden made us dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we've received him as one from the dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We've received his promise. Don't matter the circumstance. Don't matter how how are we going to make this happen? We're not. &gt;&gt; We're not. God's going to make it happen. &gt;&gt; The seed in his own body was dead at 100 years old. The deadness of Sarah's womb, they were both sterile to being with. And then God performed a miracle and put his germ of life in there. He received him from the dead as one being dead. Then God's able to raise him up from the dead. Perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh my. If that wouldn't make a Presbyterian shout. Think of that. &gt;&gt; So here he is. That's what I That's what I'm We're building our experience through our trials. And God's tempting us. We're building these experiences. &gt;&gt; All these trials. Look, I'm going through some hard stuff. Harder than I've ever had to go through. And as a Christian, you could all say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Going through some hard stuff, and it's harder now than it ever has been. &gt;&gt; But you know what the difference is? I'm not near as worried as I used to be about it. &gt;&gt; I'm not near as concerned about how the outcome's going to be as I used to be. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God tempted me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he followed through with his word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And after every victory, my faith got bigger. &gt;&gt; After every victory, I come back and said, \"Well, God, you did this for me. Is it too hard for God?\" My &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to his name. I'm going to switch gears a little bit and and just look at Philippians 2. Verse one. Now I got to make it fast. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, any if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels of mercy, fulfill ye my joy, that ye may be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, one mind. So what's God's mind for you? What is if if we're called to have the same mind of Christ, what is his goal? What is his purpose? What is his whole what is he waiting for us to get his mind? And we know that the prophet said he's under greater anticipation to call us home than we are &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to go home. That's his mindset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he's called us to have that mindset. We're going home. &gt;&gt; Well, brother John, what? We can't go with all these circumstances. No, we're going home. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how we get there. what we have to overcome to get there. We're going to get there. &gt;&gt; That's that's God's mindset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's what he sees. Does he see me fall short? Yes. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Does he see you fall short? &gt;&gt; Has he thrown you out? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, forget it. That guy, I'm telling you, I have worked on him and worked on him and worked on him. You know, we'll just start over with somebody else. No, he has that image in his mind that he had of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, \"I'm going to fill out that per that that picture album and you're going to be there &gt;&gt; in spite of you.\" &gt;&gt; Watch how I could sing, \"My God is an awesome God.\" Why? Because I know &gt;&gt; that he's put up with me. How awesome is that? &gt;&gt; My wife and kids don't even want to do that sometimes. But he keeps putting up with me. &gt;&gt; And we've all had those moments where we're saying, \"God, why do you put up with me? I'm just going to take this and just because it's encouraging. I just want to I want to take this little I don't this is the way the Lord's leading me. So, we're going to I put it in here and I didn't understand why, but we're just going to do it. It's a I perceive that thou art a prophet. It's 53. Brother Brown says, \"And coming down through the people.\" Now, now you all heard this before. I'm not telling you anything new, but I I want to stir it up, make you understand. Coming down through the people. Now, down in the south, they have the the Jim Crow law. That is colored and white can't mix together. So here come a a a colored girl about 17 18 years old and oh she was in her this her her eyes was white with cataract as my shirt and she was coming pressing through the crowds somebody please help me daddy and I thought why don't some of these people help that poor girl so I thought while he wasn't looking I'd move along a little so I got over there and I kept getting right in her way and watching ing these men to come. And she came right up and I stood like that and she bumped into me. She her hands tugged me. She said, \"Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.\" Said, \"Daddy.\" I thought I said, \"What are you looking for?\" She said, \"Sir, I've lost my daddy. I'm blind.\" She said, \"I can't find him. I don't know what to do.\" Said, \"Nobody will help me.\" Will you help me, kind sir? H &gt;&gt; will you help me con sir? &gt;&gt; So this is a a black girl and it was okay back then. It wasn't that's what black folks want to be called was colored. So don't get all crazy with that. That's what they maybe they didn't want to but that's what they were called. She's in a group of white people, blind, and lost her only way home, her daddy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Tough circumstances. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I said, \"Well, I don't see no more color people around here.\" Said, \"Where are you from?\" She said, \"Memphis.\" &gt;&gt; So, he's bringing forth. He said, \"Look, you're in a you're in a dangerous spot right now. You're a black girl in a white crowd. This is not a nice place. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz cuz a lot of them racist claim Christianity, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And shame on them, &gt;&gt; back then and now. Let's go ahead and say it. &gt;&gt; And I looked and there was a bunch of charter buses sitting there and I knowed one of them was from Memphis. And that's how I said, \"What are you doing over here?\" She said, \"I listening to the radio this morning.\" She said, \"I heard about all those deaf and dumb people they had up there that was deaf and dumb last night speaking on the radio.\" And I said, \"And you're blind?\" See? I said, \"What'd you come over here for?\" She said, \"I come to see the healer.\" I said, \"The what?\" She said, \"The healer.\" And I said, \"You don't believe that, do you?\" &gt;&gt; Hm. Sounds like she's tempting. You're getting tempted. The prophet is tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; This is God called man tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that? &gt;&gt; H Yeah. He says, \"Now that looked like a hypocrite, too, taking advantage of a blind woman.\" See, but I wanted to see whether she really believed it. Do you believe that's the truth? She said, \"Yes, sir.\" And I I began to feel it and she said, \"Yes, sir. I believe it.\" And I said, \"Why don't you believe that God would do something like that? As far advanced as med medical science is h science can't do nothing for you, why would you believe something supernatural would? Yeah. &gt;&gt; H. She said, \"Sir,\" and said, \"When I was a little girl, I got cataracts on my eyes. The doctor told me when they got ripe, I don't know what that means, but when it got ripe, they'd take them off.\" And said, \"Now they're ripe.\" And said, \"They say if they take them out, they pull the optical nerves right out of my eyes.\" Said, \"I can't see.\" And the only hope I got is to get in there. And this is the man last the this is the man's last night here. And they tell me I can't even get near the building. I've lost my daddy. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do. I've had those moments. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I said, \"Do you believe if you'd get in there, you'd be healed?\" She said, \"Well, I heard of a man on the radio this morning from up at Connect Ket, Missouri. Had been blind for 10 years and he received his sight.\" So said, \"Well, couldn't I be healed too?\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can't you overcome, too? &gt;&gt; Can't you be healed, too? &gt;&gt; Can't God take care of your problems, too? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many's had something miraculous happen? Raise your hands. Get them up there. &gt;&gt; Look around. Whatever your situation is, if he did it for brother Harry, can he do it for me? &gt;&gt; If he did it for brother Rob, &gt;&gt; can he do it for me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to stop looking within ourselves and say, \"I'm a son of do son or daughter of God.\" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I have just as much right to your healing, your deliverance, your overcoming as anybody else here. &gt;&gt; Sure. His word is not a respector of persons. &gt;&gt; I said, \"Do you believe that?\" She said, \"Sir, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you'll just get me into where that man's at, I'll be able to find my daddy after that.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; I'll be able to find my daddy. She had a tiepole. She had something to anchor her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, we know it wasn't brother Brandham. It was Jesus Christ. But he was a channel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; She held on to that. &gt;&gt; All these problems are going to go away if I can just get to that place. &gt;&gt; I'll find my own daddy. I'll get my own way home. I felt my heart drop right away from from me. I thought, poor old blind thing. I said, \"Look, lady, do you mean that?\" Still tempting her. &gt;&gt; Still tempting her. Do you mean that? &gt;&gt; She said, \"Yes.\" Oh, I said, \"Maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see.\" And she grabbed me up like that. She said, \"Is you the healer?\" And I said, \"No, ma'am.\" I said, \"I'm Brother Brandham. Jesus is the healer.\" &gt;&gt; And she grabbed me. She said, \"Oh, Brother Brandham, have mercy on me. Have mercy on me.\" And I thought of poor old blind Fanny Crosby. &gt;&gt; Fanny Crosby never did get her sight. Never did. &gt;&gt; She never did. And I'm I'm going for memory, but if memory serves her, right, Brother Random said that if she would have got her healing, she wouldn't have been able to write those songs that she wrote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, God's a healer. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But as a son and daughter of God, he heals within the bounds of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you're casting a death. No, she never did quit praying for healing. Brother Brand doesn't say that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But she kept believing. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's called us to do, to keep believing, to keep having that faith that he's called us to as sons and daughters of God. He's called us to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't call us just to believe because of the results because we don't like the results sometimes. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean he's not God. And it doesn't mean that his will hasn't been done. &gt;&gt; General orders by his stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer. &gt;&gt; You are more than a conqueror. All these things and we hold on to those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we'll know when God says that's my will and then we won't have to ask anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But until that's settled in your heart, just like that faith is settled in your heart, you keep believing for his promises. Right. &gt;&gt; And I looked and I thought her only hope, Christ. I said, \"Now, I don't want to be recognized in the crowd. Lady, you bow your head and we'll have a word of prayer.\" Said, \"First, I want to hold your hand while I'm praying.\" I couldn't get her hand off my coat. She wasn't going to let me go. &gt;&gt; Pass me not, oh gentle savior. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will wrestle with you. &gt;&gt; I will hold on to you, God. &gt;&gt; I'm not letting go. &gt;&gt; I'm not stopping. I'm going to keep believing. You're my deliverer. You're my my overcomer. You're my healer. And I said, \"Now let me have your hand.\" She said, \"Don't pass me.\" And I took hold of her hand and pulled it off and held her hand. And while I was praying, now you can mark this is fanaticism if you want to. That would be between you and God. See, I could only tell the truth. Something happened. I knew the woman was healed. I was waiting for the shrinkage of that cataract. I said, \"Now keep your lids closed over your eyes.\" I said, \"Now you raise your head just about to where you think my voice is coming and I'll tell you what to do.\" She said, \"Yes, sir.\" Said something cold went over me. I said, \"Just raise your head.\" And I said, \"Now open your eyes, for thus saith the Holy Spirit, you've received your sight.\" And she opened her eyes and she said, \"Is that light?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Is them black dots there? Is that people?\" Her eyesight was not clear. &gt;&gt; It wasn't It wasn't all the way there. &gt;&gt; This is another point where God is tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many times did brother Random say, \"Go confessing. Go believing.\" &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your symptoms are, you keep confessing your healing. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your your your your uh besetting sin is. You keep confessing your healing. &gt;&gt; You keep going. Keep marching towards that thing. &gt;&gt; Don't settle for it. Well, I can see white lights and shapes of people. That's good enough. Oh Lord, she says, \"Oh Lord, I who was once blind can now see.\" She let out a big scream. And then they've been some people standing there and watching and here they come. My you talk about and I happened to look now he's trying to get out of a meeting and he's supposed to meet these brothers that are supposed to escort him to a car and he snuck out a back door but there was this mass of people he couldn't get through and this is when he ran into this just in case you uh and I happened to look and there was an old man standing there with a cane an old club in his hand his leg was twisted sideways said brother Brandham I know you. He said, \"I've been standing in the rain for eight or 10 days here.\" Eight or 10 days in the rain. Why? &gt;&gt; God was tempting him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Said, \"You wouldn't pass me, would you, Brother Brandon?\" Said, \"I got a bunch of kitties at home.\" Said, \"They need me.\" said, \"A woman going to run over me and I'm twisted my leg like this.\" I said, \"Do you believe?\" He said, \"With all my heart and I said of in the name of the Lord Jesus, give me your cane.\" &gt;&gt; It didn't say his foot straightened out first. &gt;&gt; It didn't say he was healed and jumped around and handed him the cane. &gt;&gt; He said, \"Give me that cane.\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know. Aa Allen used to have an anvil on the platform, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And what would he do? I need healing for my eyes. Give me your glasses. &gt;&gt; He set them on the anvil and crush them with a hammer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't no turning back. Ain't no turning back. And the Lord who is my sovereign judge when that man in the act of faith handed his cane his leg come straight and he jumped into the air and screamed to the top of his voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; What are you in need of? How has God been tempting you? Where are you at in your walk? Are you questioning? Do you not understand? You wouldn't be the only one. This message, have you read some stuff online and it's in your mind? Sometimes God opens portals to hell to get your attention. What are you made of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where are you at in your experience? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wants all your hope hope destroyed. We don't need hope in the last days. It starts with hope. A lot of times, a lot of things start with hope, don't get me wrong, but hope is shaky. &gt;&gt; We have to be established in faith, brothers. Come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's your walk? It's time to self-examine. Say, \"Brother John, I I believe I believe. But man, I'm really struggling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've been in a circumstance for so long. I've dealt with a besetting sin for so long. &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this struggle or that struggle. Does your circumstance change who God is? &gt;&gt; No. Does your problem change who God is? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Be sure that your call is sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're going through, brothers and sisters. Stand with me if you would. I don't care how bad that you feel tempted. Sometimes that tempted temptation is of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to make sure that you know that you know. And the and the closer we get to home, the more important it is that we're sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So things are going to get tighter. Things are going to get harder. We're not going to have this this instant success, if I could put it that way. This get-richqu scheme that that the devil's trying to feed people. He's trying to to to smooth over this this well, that's good enough. Nobody else is living like that. Nobody's still, you know, even the message churches, they're they're bickering. Some of them are bickering back and forth and we've got those that that believe in emotion and and those that believe that you have emotion. You're Let me tell you something. I've never seen nor has brother Harry or anybody else. Nobody's ever seen emotion heal the sick. Nope. So we shouldn't get emotional. No. I said emotion doesn't heal the sick. Emotion doesn't deliver. But I tell you what, if you get delivered, you're gonna have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you get if you get healed, you're going to have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. That's where the balance is, brothers and sisters. We're not focusing on one side or the other. We know that they're both united in the fact that he's my deliverer, and I'm happy about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I and and I'm going to express that happiness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father, Lord, I believe with all my heart, Lord Jesus, that you have spoke, Lord, if to no one else but myself, Lord. It seems so hard in lessa these days, Lord, this this old flesh. And it seems ironic, Lord, that we've got all these temptations around us. And we find that you yourself tempt us to see where our faith is, to see if we really believe. And Lord, you're not doing it out of meanness. You're conditioning us, Lord. And we can go home, Lord. I know there's people here, Lord, that are facing impossible situations. Lord, maybe it's their in their own life. Maybe it's with a sickness. Maybe it's with overcoming. Maybe Lord Jesus, they see in your word where you said raise them up in the way that they should go and when they get older they will not depart. And Lord, they're they seem so far away from where you called them in the way that we raised them. But Lord, is there anything too hard for God?

Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know, I got lots of pictures of my kids all over the house. Not so many of me. There's a reason for that.

Brother Harry pulls out that picture of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; This is it. This is you. &gt;&gt; You see it in my word. This is you. &gt;&gt; He ain't never going to forget. &gt;&gt; And that's what he sees. He always sweet sees that. Cuz when they get bigger, they ain't always so sweet. &gt;&gt; I wasn't either. And neither were you. &gt;&gt; But every now and then, it's good to remember what they were before the foundation of the world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he just pulls out that picture. I open up that word and I say, \"Oh, mama, that's me. &gt;&gt; Mama, that's me.\" &gt;&gt; I see myself in that word. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have any faults? No. That's when I need it the most is when I'm falling short and I'm I'm failing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I need to look into his promise and see that he sees me the same way he and and he's wanting me to see who I am. Amen. God bless you, brother Justin. I appreciate you all. God bless. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many you can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord this evening. Amen. We'll sing this song as we get ready to go. Let's just stay stay in worship just for a couple more minutes. I know it's late and kids getting back to school, but let's just sing. He didn't throw the clay away. You know, Brother John's talking about he every time you stumble and fall and that's the only song I could really think of. So, let's sing a song. He is the potter. I am the clay molded in his image is how he wants me to stay. But I stumble and I fall and my vessel breaks. He just picks up all the broken pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. And over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the way I am today. And it's all because Jesus did all the clay. empty and broken. I came back to him, a vessel unworthy. I've been so scared by sin. But he did not despair. He started over again. Oh, and I'm so eating the road clay. [Music] Now, he knows me and makes me into his lik of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus in the clear way. Now over and over. He holds me and makes me into his likess. He fashions the clay of the soul of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus didn't throw the clay away. [Music] He is the potter and I am the clay. Molded in his image is how he wants me to stay. But when I stumble and I fall and my vessel breaks, he just picks up all the broken pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. [Music] Now over and over. He holds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the That's all of our earth. That's what I am today. And is all because Jesus didn't throw a clear away. [Music] Now over and over.

through trials wouldn't it be awesome would you stand up and just Let Her Fly most of us sit around like this why me Lord wowzy wowzy hmm but God's merciful to us in him one well to be thanking him every day for all the good that he's done every day we just kind of think well Lord when you're going to do this and when you're going to do that I've been waiting now for about 45 minutes I mean I prayed that prayer a while ago how long does it take you from the sound of us it's going to take a lot longer let us take a trip today what do you say let us walk into a room that is very very hot a room that is the temperature will be so excruciating that it'll be hard for you to breathe but what is going on in this room is going to be very essential and necessary for us to be what God wants us to be we're going to be looking into a great cauldron or a vat if you wish to call it that the temperature must be at least two thousand and twelve degrees for the process to begin go and go or is this getting too hot for you first Peter chapter 1 verse 6. we're in you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptations that the trial of your face being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire may be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now listen what a compliment that Peter pays to those of us who've never seen him whom having not seen yet love in whom though now you see him not yet yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls praise God I may let you be remembered today as we pray heavenly father as we have our heads bowed in your presence Lord thank you for the service thus farther singing and the praise and the worship now we come to the breaking of the bread Lord we're praying that once again you would pass by this way and we would be able to see but the way the bread is broken that it was you who did it you have a marvelous way of doing that whether it's an African brother preaching or an Indian brother or whether it would be a brother from Europe different parts of the world but when the bread is broke it always has the signature about it if it's broken by you so we pray today that you take your word and break the bread of life to us that we can be helped by our gathering today Father I'm holding these prayer calls in my hands Lord and you see the needs your God desperate needs we're asking you that should move form father Lord I pray for Lance today you see dear God in the home in the bed and can't hardly move because of his back been bothering him for several days I pray in the name of Jesus that should move for him today father I want to thank you for giving Erica a good day yesterday she was able to get up and cook and clean some and do some things around the house we're just so grateful Lord God I told her last night this is only going to be one of many we're believing Lord God that you're going to completely turn it around and restore her father speak to us today Lord God In The Name of Jesus we ask and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated we certainly welcome each of you here today to the house of the Lord and let me call your attention back to verse 7. when Peter writes this and he says that the trial of your face being much more precious than gold now Peter didn't say that actually your face was more precious than God read it there if you'd like but he says the trial of your face isn't it amazing now we know that Faith there's no question about it but faith is more precious than gold but this is not the emphasis that Peter is placing on in this verse but he's making the comparison of faith and comparing it to Gold well how could that be well it's not just that Faith itself is compared to Gold but it's the transforming or the changing of the gold that Peter is comparing Faith to read it again with me that the trial of your face the trial of your face being much more precious than that of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire that it might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the peering of Jesus Christ so the testing of our faith is worth more than gold but also worth more than the testing of gold now we know that there's been many many gold rushes down through time and there's something about gold man absolutely loves it no question about it he loves it and it is caused so many deaths and so much suffering and so many hardships if you've ever really looked at many of the gold rushes that have been down through time and you realize it was very few that ever got rich well who got rich in some cases more than anybody else was the guy who owned the general store because he jacked up everything that he had and a lot of people went there and they thought they was going to get rich and they left worse off than there were before they ever went and yet we know there's something about gold still to this day a lot of our Market is based upon the precious metals of the earth gold silver brass all kinds of things that are there and God puts him there he knew that man would use them but he also knew that man would abuse them so Peter is comparing and he wants the Saints then and us as well to see that as as worthy as gold was and during this time frame when Peter writes this uh gold was a great great thing and it's always been we know since man founded even the Book of Genesis before man ever started started mining gold the Bible mentions and God had Moses to write it down when he talked about the four rivers that come out of the Garden of Eden and he began to write to this one particular area and he mentioned it by name and he said the gold is great there so God even himself took note of this of what gold would actually be but when we're talking about spiritual goal of course it's a different thing it's not something you can go to a jewelry store and buy it's not something that you and I can mind it's not something that we can make but it's something that God starts molding in us and of course before it can be refined you first have to have something thing to begin with so when people find the ore and I've seen a little bit of it and and see little specks and little small pieces you know where they get it but yet it's not in its purest form whenever they go to digging it out now depending on how pure that you want to make it you can make it more pure and more pure but what actually does it is fire and temperature so you've got to run it through one process and then you let it cool and then you take it back again and then you're emptying more off and more on so Peter found a great parallel between gold and our face that is compared to it now ultimately says whenever you look at the natural gold of the earth it is absolutely and will one day be destroyed it will be annihilated all the metals of the earth that have such precious value now will one day one day rather be destroyed when the atomic bomb arms will bring this place almost to Total Annihilation there won't hardly be anything left but the Lord God will keep the frame and the frame will be refurbished now notice he says that gold no matter how valuable that it is that the trying of our face is even greater because gold can perish now you can bring it to a spot to where it can be destroyed it can be absolutely annihilating and gold being refined by fire is whenever the dross begins to rise now say it like this several years ago Carol and I stood in South Africa and we went to a gold mine and it was one that that pretty much mined everything out and what they were still doing is they was taking the the trailings of the of the great big piles of dirt now years and years ago they was only able to take out so much of the gold out of the trailings as they call it and but here's these humongous mounds of dirt and crushed up Stone but they found out that his man began to understand more about it that he could run that same dirt through another chemical process which has been highly refined and they were able to get more gold out of that pile of dirt they'd been Landing there some of it for a hundred years some of it for 110 years but yet running it through a different process they was able to take more and more gold so they had this pot of gold and it was setting over a molten fire it was fire that was so hot and the God that was standing there doing it there was a couple of them and they had to have these heat resistant suits in order to be able to work it because it would have burned their flesh totally off of their skeleton it was so hot so they had to be dressed in a certain way and then they would take and pour it inside of this pot now this particular gold had been used over and over and over and over and over again weeks on end and they bring people to that mine and show them the same thing over and over again and this particular Ore had been used multiple times and by the time we saw it it was about 99.9 percent pure but each time it was run through the process it was making it more pure more pure now it's beautiful as it was when it was taken out of the Earth but yet it had pyrite in it it had dirt in it it had other chemicals that had fool's gold which is pyrite and it had different things in it and in order to be able to bring the Purity out of the gold what they had to do was bring the temperature up higher and higher and higher in order to separate the impure from the pure so when the fire would get hot it would cause the impurities to begin to rise to the top now they would take then a little scoop of a thing I look like a little coupon of a thing and with a long on a Long Rod where it wouldn't burn them up and it would begin to rise to the top and they could take that off well then they would bring it a little bit higher and it would become more would come out and more would come out each one of those those dips was taking the impurities from the gold now the gold is able to take that type of heat but it takes that type of temperature to be able to separate the impure from the pure are you hearing me today now if God requires and God wants us to be broken as our brothers so beautifully sung the song if that's what it requires to make us to be like he wants us to be is it that really what we want in the bottom line now if if God could get us then and truly we have value in his eyes when he finds this as we are he found us lost he found us all muddled up in the sins of the world we had Fool's Gold we had dirt we had the office mess and stuff probably have very little goal in reality but we had enough that was worth running through the smelting process so God began to allow trials to happen now the dirt it doesn't take near as much heat near as much temperature so when we first got saved God started letting us be tried God turned the temperature up to about 50 degrees and boy we thought man alive I'm doing so good I'll tell you what I'm a sweating like I don't know what and I'm going through the test and the trial praise God and God reached down on there and got a little something out of you and said it over on the on the side and you said praise the Lord I'm on my way to canaan's land and God puts you in the furnace neck the week after that God to turn the temperature up to about a hundred and you sought glory to God I'm twice as strong as I was last week and truly you were and week after week trial after trial test after test God kept turning the temperature up it kept going higher and higher and your thoughts and your shortcomings and your impurities kept floating to the top now it takes the rising of the temperature in order to separate these things from yourself but you see those things are actually in the ground and molded in the ground but the gold was created now with iron ore with silver with many of the precious metals of the earth they've got a smelting process for each one it differs one to the other because of the chemical breakdown and the type the temperature that it takes to break it down but whenever it comes into the gold of God it's refined when the draw is removed now as I stood there and I looked at that and I watched that part of gold and whatever they'd put it over there and it was so hot and I moved as close as I could without being in danger because I've got boundaries around it because they don't want you to get hurt but as I looked at it myself I thought I've been there I've been there every child of God's been there and yet some of you maybe you're there today and maybe some of you just got out and God's got you over here in in the cooling Avenue of your walk as God now and God's given you a little bit of rest and he's kind of giving you a breather and he's helping you with good things I aren't we glad he does that to us we couldn't take it if you did in France but the mercy of God knows exactly where the breaking point is for each one of us and that's the way out of his Sovereign Grace that he does so then whenever a person's face now remember it's not you're shouting that's going to the fire and it's not even your emotion or you're jumping and we believe in all that do we not but yet it's not any of that that is actually being tried it's not even your ability to sing or not to sing it's not even your ability to memorize the word to quote the word no what Peter is focusing on is the trying or the testing of your faith now what's it for brother Donnie it's to prove to you and not so much to God because God done knows what you'll be when you come out but it's to prove to you the faith that you have now you see God will allow stress and pressure to come our way he will allow sometimes relationships things with people friends family church people God will allow a stirring of our relationships in order to let a little bit of unforgiveness or bitterness that we did not realize we had and God will turn that temperature up just a little bit in order to bring that out and you know what that'll do that will cause that unforgiving spirit that you have within you to rise to the top of your gold now I'll tell you one thing if you've never had any stress uh things to go along with relationships God bless you I'm praying for you because you're going to eventually like whether it's your mama and you or your daddy and you or your brothers and sisters or people you go to church with or your best friend or whoever we're going to have them that's just part of it does God keep those from us as his people he does not as a matter of fact God will let you go through more than anybody else in the world so stress will be able to deepen actually and strengthen a Christian's walk I know we don't want to hear these words but but it's the truth so in the words of job job said it this way in job 23 when he has tried me or tested me then I will come forth as gold now I'll put this up and I want you to read this with me on the process of how to refine gold so to refine gold he must be applied to force the impurities to the surface the impurities are called dross the temperature must reach 2 thousand one hundred and two degrees Fahrenheit oh Jesus now the sad part about it is God won't allow us to take this fireproof suit into the smelter so it's the people on the outside I mean that's the way it is the preachers sometimes they're standing up there with that fireproof suit on and they're burning you up ain't they I mean they are setting you on fire and they're smiling and laughing and having the biggest time ever was well he better not laugh much because he's fixing to go through the same thing so you see it's the people standing on the outside of that are the ones that are administering and they're doing the goal the very best thing that can be done for them so the temperature must reach 2102 degrees fahrenheit as the dross or the impurities rise they are removed and more heat is supplied now watch what happens whenever dirt will be able to be released I I didn't go into an in-depth study to find out the metallurgical value and what temperature that each thing can be released but let's just look at it this way and say that dirt can be released at say 750 degrees Fahrenheit so whenever seven if the goal reaches 750 degrees Fahrenheit and then the dirt comes out and said man I'm getting out of here whoa I can't take this no more I know if I'll go up to the top I know they'll set me free I know if I'll go to the top I'll get out of here do you realize that's the way a lot of folks do God and that's the way they do Church whenever difficulties come around the church what do some people do the first little trial they bail on you they jump out the first little test comes through and the church goes through a trying time and a testing time and people say I'm about ready to look for me in the other Church go ahead dirt go ahead you dirt bag go ahead you dross come on now somebody preach with me I don't know about you when it's all said and done I want to be left in the pot amen if God's got to keep cranking it up and cranking it up Lord you ain't running me off I've got good goals amen so we'll say them that the dirt begins to this metallurgical reaction begins to happen and the goal starts you know the goal is the gold is good now believe it or not the gold is good it says I like this I really enjoy this this is my spot this is where I am this is where I'm brought to my very best Clarity this is where I'm brought to what I really want to be now this is why our Humanity our makeup does not like trials because your flesh ain't gold Jesus Christ will never see himself in your human body right now the only way he will ever see himself when you are in a human body is the new one you get on the day of the change is that right now notice in when the temperature rises then we'll say the dirt releases first and the dirt will come up from the pot wherever it's coming from each one of those little things that sell inside the go it begins to release the dirt release the dirt release the dirt and the dirt will begin to come up to the top then the individual standing out there and it's got that little thing and you'll dip it over like this like a Little Dipper and you'll go to skimming around the top and he pours that dirt on the outside then no more is coming out because it's reached the max so they've got to crank it up a little more and then they'll they'll find floating up the top oh my goodness what's I see there oh wow what that looks like temper now I know there ain't nobody here ever been through that but I'll say for these sorry centers that stream these services so there comes a little temper up to the top of it and the man reaches in there and he grabs a hold to that he begins to skim that right off the top well they let it sit for a few more minutes no more temper raises so what do they do crank the temperature they go to crank and the temperature and then they let us sit there and sit there and have remember it's boiling it's a cooking it's a cooking that gold is just a cooking and ever to ever degree that they add to it that goal says come on I can take some more come on I can take some more the whole Glory but yet every impurity inside of there is screaming to get out the dirt wants out the temper wants out the intolerance the unforgiving spirit whatever it is it wants out and that ain't but half the story God wants it out now notice the process continues and continues and continuous heat is supplied and reapplied until the gold is pure the refiner knows the gold is pure when he looks into the gold and sees his clear reflection so then here the refiner is standing there and he got some dirt off the top it got some ironpara at all he got this all temper off anxiety stress worry materialism he began to keep on doing it over and over and then the man reaches over and he looks inside of there and he can see his own image in this pot of gold here it is it's now reached over 2 000 degrees and the gold is not screaming for Mercy the gold is not safe let me out let me out turn it down turn it down I can't take it no more the gold is in its Glory why because the refiner can see himself in the goal I wonder how clear you and I are reflecting the Lord Jesus today I wonder when he looks at us does he see just a very vague image not no doubt he sees a part of himself because he's done a great work in many of our Lives has he not so we don't want to belittle that but I wonder then by looking if he would be able to look at Donnie Reagan today and he would look at you and look at you and he would bend over into the pot would he see what would he see what do you see himself as such Clarity that he'd be able to see not my eyes but his would he be able to see not my facial features but his isn't that what we want more than anything in the world now you remember in the Bible when the Lord Jesus prayed for a man and he was actually blind and he prays for this man and whenever he does the man his eyes are partially touched and he says I see men as trees I see men as truth now it is strange that the Lord Jesus would have to pray for this man twice was it just that the man didn't have enough Faith to release it all at once or what was there a Divine Purpose to be honest with you I'm not sure but we can see that the work of God is a process so here the man he was not able to see men as they are but he looked out there brother Taylor and he saw men and they they looked real vague like he said man looked like trees sorta I I ca I can't make it out well I wonder if the Lord Jesus would be able to look in the vat of our life or the cupola of our life would he see us as people that love him people that want to go to heaven people that want to be right but that's not what he's looking for you see you'd be able to look in nearly every Church in this area today and he would find people that don't want to be lost he would be able to look and not say almost every Church in the whole state of Tennessee as far as even in the United States they was none of them probably went there today and so I'm going to church so I can go to hell I'm going to church so I can be deceived because I want to be lost nobody in the right mind would want that so they're going to church because they feel like they're going to get something there that will help them be ready for heaven probably everybody who doesn't go for that reason but we'll say the majority of them do so but he's not looking for those who just want to go to heaven because that's the old song says everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die and that's what we got to do is die to ourselves so if he was looking for that then he would look in the in the cupola of gold and he would say oh yes everybody in there nobody wants to be lost everybody in there wants to go to heaven everybody in there wants me to bless them oh they're wanting new cars they're wanting new homes and then preachers keep giving them the 13 principles of how to be a blessed man and the 14 principles of how to do this and the 19 principles on how to do that but he ain't just looking in the vet for that what he's looking for is to see himself himself and what every aspect of our life so when he was here he not only healed the sick and raised the dead but he also faced persecution he wants to see that in our lives so we are going to be persecuted that's part of being a child of God but what he wants to see is his image of behavior reflecting itself through us and our Behavior oh I heard the voice of God say an amazing thing this week absolutely overwhelmed me I was just alone praying talking to the Lord and I heard him say these three things walk like a prince roar like a lion and fight like a king wow walk like a prince roar like a lion and fight like a king so guess what that's what I'm going to do so God wants to see himself when we fight he wants to see himself whenever we're being under oppression of the enemy and persecuted so he's looking for himself in every aspect of our life and that is what this separates of course the bride from the church because the church wants simply a ticket to Heaven no requirement you don't have to do anything you don't have to dress a certain way behave a certain way and do whatever you want to do oh sure that's what they think Heaven's all about it's just to get everybody out of this place it fits that way in six weeks heaven will be turned back into a shape like Johnson City in no time won't it it won't be a fit place for a child of God to live so the refiner wants to be able to look over into the cupola of gold and to be able to see his own reflection now Malachi 3 tells us this but who may have died in the day of his coming who shall stand when he appears for he is like a Refiner's Fire a refiners fire like Fuller's Soap he shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness so God works a similar process in the life of his people that a man would in refining go now you see what this goal will do is when the temperature begins to rise and it begins to release things that's actually become a part of it through the process of Creation in the earth now the gold didn't ask for the dirt the gold didn't ask for the Fool's Gold but it was actually formed there in the creation of the world the earth and the temperature begins to rise and it forces the gold to release this part that is not itself listen to me if you're a child of God adultery is not who you are if you're a child of God pornography is not who you are lying cheating drinking so on and so on that is not who you are somebody say Amen so what does God want God wants to be able to release that out of you so the real you can shine through so it will it will expose our weaknesses it will expose our faults oh goodness we none of us like that do we you're like yeah brother Brown told us he said the reason we go to church is to see our faults oh my goodness how many goals to church they can be preached on why did y'all even come today we go through trials so we can see what we are lacking what we need oh my notices so it exposes our weaknesses our faults our struggles our impurities do that when the heed is turned up and when the heat gets hot it is very uncomfortable in it oh my goodness I'll see some of y'all saying here and I know what phase of life you're in according to kind of how you're reacting in the service some of you is wrapped up in thermal blankets some of you are sitting there sweating which lets me know where you are in the cycle of life and so each one of us were able to go through these different things but myself I I can be able to tolerate heat better than I can cold now I've been to Canada and it's 40 minus 40. and whenever I get done preaching I was soaking wet and they would pull the the vehicle right up to the door I basically stepped out of the church door and the car was right there because there's a freedom that's afraid I'd freeze to death because of being so cold and yet then people stand outside with a long sister stand there with a long sweater hanging down like this minus 40 standing out there talking like you folks here would in 70 or 75. yeah their blood is like molasses so they're used to it they're used to it they can stand there and do it I don't like that kind of weather God never made that place for me polar bears and all that sort of thing they can have it as far as I'm concerned I can deal with heat a lot better but it's the same way when it comes to our flesh and our soul whenever the pressure goes to be turned on our flesh oh we'll cry and belly ache oh I didn't think Christianity is going to be like this I didn't know it was going to be so hard to go through that and the flesh will go on and on and on and the soul is saying Lord Purify Me Lord cleanse me Lord sanctify me and if your body could hear your soul you talking about getting into an argument they'd go back and believe you please shut up your ass can God to turn up the temperature and I'm about to die this heat is absolutely killing me exactly the idea exactly the idea that God wants to do so the process our process you say when will this ever end I'll tell you when it ends this process will end when we meet Jesus face to face now think of this every one of us are going to see him you're either going to be ready or not ready it's up to you but the process for the bride will end when we meet him face to face and he will be able to look directly in our face for the first time without a veil or a covering of the blood and when he looks in our face we will be so much like him he will be able to see himself in US it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him is that right is that what the word says for we shall see him as he is I don't want to add to what John said but there's also another side to that and he will see us as we is that's exactly right we're going to see him as he is and he's going to see us as he has processed us to be through all these things of life oh you know in one way I'm so glad that God hasn't made it to where that it didn't require a real difficult type of process I'm glad that he's made it this way because it truly separates those that really want to go from those that really don't want to go so you see purification may sound harsh and the process may seem very difficult he said well brother Donnie how long does this take depends on you it depends on how much junk you got in you it depends on how much trash how much Fool's Gold how much dirt how much Humanity well thank you Jesus it all depends on you and I and how quick we will allow God to take it out of our lives so without this process we will be left with our impurities we will be left you see this is why that they cannot make out that number that goes through the tribulation period now if these people are actually under the blood how in the world could they ever go into a tribulation period for purification but they think they're under the blood but in reality they are not they refuse the process to be cleansed ready for the Rapture now we know that's being saved and the Rapture is not the same thing she'll be gets saved by accepting him as our savior but in order to go on the body change we've got to be called out separated called out away from the world and this process is part of it and many people simply do not want it they don't not want to be told they have to separate from the world well you can't do this and you can't do that no more and you can't I ain't no purchase are telling me what to do bless God it ain't the preacher telling you no way it's the preacher only repeating the requirement for the Rapture I thought you wanted to go so you see the process takes out all of these impurities and the dross that's inside of us so you know God may allow them a a relationship a friend of yours or or a brother even in the flesh or a sister in the flesh and struggles May raise up and what will it do it will try you in a way that you've never been tried before and then if you've got the least bit of bitterness or an unforgiving Spirit down inside mixed with your gold and now of course every one of us are totally convinced that we are 14 karat through and through from the toenail to the top of our last little head right up on our head we are all 14 karat gold there's no question about that right I'm talking about our character our makeup by even our family is 14 karat that's why some of you think your kids are a bunch of angels around here and you don't even correct them well praise the Lord Brother Donnie you don't pass the new birth on to your kids well they don't pass a new birth on our kids by having Sunday school class or by preaching is that right they've got to get it theirself and they've got to be purified just like you and I are purified but we want to wind up the goals of God he's going to gather his treasures one day you see he's gone there to prepare a great beautiful place now those of you especially you sisters and you're saying you you think about getting engaged or some of you sisters that's already engaged and married and you get your eyes on a new ring and you go say well glory to God my husband's making more money now than he's ever made before and he got me this little ring whenever we got married and I love this little thing I really do but I wouldn't care to have something a little bit bigger say three-quarter or 1.1 or 1.3 or something like that and I wouldn't mind you know having the clarity a little bit better the four C's I wouldn't care to have the color just a little bit brighter mine is a j and I'd rather have something a little bit brighter I'd rather have the clarity a little bit and I'd rather have not any inclusion something but Diamonds the way they chart diamonds you understand that mine is an s i one and I'd rather not have that I'd rather just have you know just no inclusions and all to and I I'm not you know and whenever you go to the jewelry store and you talk to your husband said honey let's go into the mall and let's get one of them pretzels you like them pretzels don't you down there tomorrow oh I like them pretzels well let's go down there and he's just as gullible as he can be poor old Feller he don't realize that the jewelry stores right across the hallway there from the Pretzel store hey you ain't got no pretzels on your mind sister you got that big rock playing inside of that have you ever noticed and them jewelry case us how they've got them all lit up have you ever noticed whenever you walk in there I mean ever Sparkle is there I see some of y'all smiling you've done been there done that ain't you and they've got that thing laid up and as soon as they take it out and you put it on your finger but they also got some behind you but I'll tell you what you do you walk out of there into the mall itself and just get under the regular lights and what you're going to notice is a lot of that sparkle is no longer there now the Sparkle is still there but the light is not hitting it in the right way so myself whenever I bought a few of those things in the past and I go in there if I don't happen to have one in my pocket which I don't carry one around I will ask for a Jeweler's loop I mean that's what that is some of y'all know what it is I won't ask for a Jeweler's loot or whenever you do that always impresses them and say oh this old boy knows what he's talking about so I get a Jeweler's Loop and I put it up on my eye like this and I'll start doing the ring this way or whatever it is I'm looking at but calls us a certain distance that you want to get it from the loop to be able to bring out everything that's in it the fire well you see the the natural eye looks at him there's oh it's got maybe it's got two or three inclusions and the color is a is a g and it looks pretty pretty nice but when you go to pulling that Loop up and you go to looking at that ring this way and you find exactly the distance then you say oh my goodness there's that inclusion how is that well that was formed when God made it in the beginning it's carbon is all it is and it's a little bitty thing that's hidden until you get this little Jeweler's Loop now we love preaching long distance don't we preacher preach on me tell me tell me how good I am some of y'all rather I'd be plumbed back younger with you you'd rather I'd be way back maybe he'd rather I was out on the parking lot and preach to you but the Lord by the Holy Ghost will have a man of God anointed by the spirit of God and he's got a Jeweler's Loop and another and then another Lord have Mercy's got a pair of binocular it looks like and say Lord how'd that man know what we was talking about this morning at The Breakfast Table he didn't but the master does so what does it do it brings out our flaws it brings out our carbon our humanity and then God does it not to shame us God does that not to humiliate us God does that to bring it out so we can see what's there and then we can say okay I understand Lord while the temperature's been going up has the temperature been going up on any on your trials and your test of Life I'll tell you one thing it seems like every way you look and everybody you talk to has gone through something is that right and it seemed like the closer we get to the end of the way the more it is it must be going home time it must be going home time and he's cranking and cranking and cranking in order to let all the impurities to be able to boil to the top oh my goodness well I know we ain't going to be standing in line today to see who can be able to be cranked up first but I do want to be in line I don't want God to have to Baby me I don't want God to have to treat me like I'm a little old pansy sort of a fellow well I can't let Donnie go through much poor little Feller he's so weak you know he'll just get all broke down and everything that ain't what I want my reputation to be I'm not the first one today look and be thrown in the fire guarantee you that but if God in his wisdom allows me to go there I'm going to act like a prince I'm going to roar like a lion and I'm going to fight like a king oh man you see God wants us to be able to have peace in the time of such trials when they're going on so God is refining and removing the dross in our lives so we can be vassals for his glory now listen what the prophet said I was standing here not long ago by a big smelter and I noticed how hot that fire was and it just cooked and cooked and cooked now you can tell this is not smells or language what he's talking about but this is the best way he knew to describe it so we're standing there looking at that smelter and and it was just boiling apparently some bubbling and stuff coming out of it like that it cooked and cooked and cooked as a hotter it got and the dross and the metals and the gold he said to come to the top and they skimmed it off and that heat the fire a little hotter in this smelter and then they would make it boil more now a lot of us boil as a matter of fact some of us boil over but it's the kind that don't do us no good we get all anger and all upset and bowl over and lose our temper and then you got to go back and repent for something that you said you shouldn't have said preach brother Donnie but this ain't the kind of boiling that God does when God boils you he does a good job that's right that heat the fire a little hotter in the smelter and then it would boil more and that gets some more different stuff pyrite stuff out of it the first come up was the dirt like dirt and mud the necks come up and say oh I don't know something some quick notice what he calls this some quick silver quick silver that's what a lot of folks want man and they want to get saved tonight they want to preach tomorrow they're ready to pasture Church in three weeks they're ready to go on a singing to her Evangelistic touring missionary tour in about a month they want Quicksilver that only worked for Tom Toad and The Lone Ranger it won't work for you as a child of God God wants rid of quicksilver God wants rid of dirt oh my they come up and skim that off what it went right on down and the last thing they took out of it was pyrite that's Fool's Gold you know there's a lot of things in people that try to fool one another ah now we're coming to Fool's goal there's a lot of things in people that try to fool one another when you're a Christian or acting like it anyhow but you let that Holy Ghost go to Boiling everything out and it takes all the fool's gold out of you you see there's no room for foolish virgin gold and the bride I don't want no Fool's Gold any y'all ever seen pyrite so many of you have so your wives you know what it is and yet there's been many a person that thought they struck it rich when they were digging in the hills of Arizona or Nevada or Utah or California or even in Alaska and they thought they had hit the mother lode but what they got was absolutely worthless notice he said you let the Holy Ghost go to Boiling everything out and takes all the fools gold out of you fools go many people go out west and they find some of it and they think they struck a gold mine it shines better than gold does but it's Fool's goal hasn't got no value to it look for him this is where a Leo to see is hidden laodicea is full of Fool's Gold and they look at their lives and they look at their churches and they look at their jobs and this and that and the other God blesses us don't boy that means he approves of us no it does no such a thing it does no such a thing the children of Israel they have been judged by God and said you'll not go into the land yet they never had to provide their food they never had to buy another pair of shoes never had to buy another change of clothes God blessed them so much and there was already pronounced they was lost don't judge blessings and say well that's God's approval here's God's approval of you God tries you and tests you oh God gives me a new car every now and then God does this God does that well he gives the Sinners their breasts he gives infidels they woke up today and say there is no God and God gave them the Breath of Life God gave them the right mind God gave them food to eat though they never thank him but the whole earth is living under the blessing of God is that right I don't want just His blessings I want this oh my notice dear Jesus it shines better than gold does but it's Fool's Gold hasn't gotten no value to it and now they cook that and they skim it all off and they just keep cooking and cooking it until it's pure gold boil down to nothing but 100 goal and that's the way God does in his church he pours the holy spirit in it and Cooks down here we go Church how many is ready for a cookout y'all invited to Word of Life Church every service we plan on having a cut down well you're serving brother Donnie elk bison you you're what's on the Fire and I'm on the fire with you oh my goodness well praise the lord well that's a sure way to build up her church right we will gain all kinds of people yeah you got to be kidding me people don't want to be cut down notice he says oh Lord till it throws all the worldliness and the differences and selfishness till it just boils it out of every individual that will come to him look at this on the latest in church but there is a gold of God First Peter 1 7 but there is this goal watch this goal now that he's going to parallel it to the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of God is a christ-like character so the gold of God is not working signs the gold of God is Not performing Miracles we believe in that our God is moving Among Us brother Daryl and I have met with the youth here uh the other night on Thursday night David was able to stream the service while they were streaming the service somebody got healed somebody else got healed just by hearing testimonies of healing I love it don't you but that within itself will not get us through the gate if we don't have this kind of goal but never fear the bride will have this God the gold of God is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of flexion you see genuine faith is not just a value to you and I in this life but one day you will trade it for a Visage likened to the Son of God himself notice this Peter says it again and I'll repeat in reading it to you that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory so the trying of your face transfers and changes you and allows you to stand before the Lord Jesus when he comes at his appearing and you won't run you won't be afraid you won't be scared unlike his appearing that when you and I come back with him at the end of the Thousand Years and they will run and scream and holler for the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them but you and I will not run and scream why because we've done been cooked and re-cooked and re-cooked and boiled oh my until the dross of our Humanity our failures our our insignificant vanity that we all have so much of has been cooked to the very top and God allowed the skimmers to come and skim it off and when we stand there we will be a hundred percent pure gold deity deity whom having not seen you love and whom though you have not seen him yet believe him you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith notice this is when Faith Comes to its end when you receive the end of your face even the salvation of your souls notice the prophet he said so he told Abraham he's going to try him and give him trials and every Christian has to be tried Peter said thinking not strange beloved one fiery Trials come upon you for it's only done to prove your face that's more precious to you than gold now we realize people can say oh I believe God why sure I believe every word in that Bible until they're Tried by it how many people around our message have said that absolutely I believe I have a word of that until you preach something they didn't know he said or it don't apply to their situation then they don't believe it no more it's amazing how many preachers I'm finding friends it would shock you it would shock you how many preachers that I'm dealing with around the message that you sent them quote after quote after quote after quote I have to quote I have to quote scripture after scripture at the scripture I description and they won't even acknowledge them and say the word is right and I am wrong that's where we are I'm telling you you better get the good stuff you better get the good gold we don't want pyrite we don't want to stand in front of the light and Sparkle and turn around and act like but if it's not real gold it is worthless amen oh but I can sing I can jump I can preach that's good that's wonderful I'm glad you can but I want something inside of you that'll keep you that you'll look at this word remember the Holy Ghost will never lead you or I contrary to his word and if you or I do something wrong and a man of God shows us the word then the Holy Ghost in you or I will make us admit that word is right I did wrong I'm sorry I apologize and if what you've got don't make you do that you ain't got the Holy Ghost oh my listen to this look when you're sick sometime how is it that the righteous suffer wish we had a night to preach on it that how God does it for his own Glory and turns right back around and heals that I don't know if you caught the words in that verse brother Joe Harris sent me that song the other day that Harry and another Caleb just sung and our sanitary because I thought it's a beautiful song but I don't know if you caught the words just hearing at one time but it says if my story is For Your Glory if my story is For Your Glory and somehow it will please you for me to be broken then Lord that's what I want to be how many believe your story is for His glory well your story will contain all types of things ups and downs and ins and outs and you've got draws in you today no doubt your pastor still has dross in him no doubt every preacher sitting here today every Deacon every good sincere saint of God we still have dross but the difference between us and others is we say God get it out of me Lord get it out of me whatever he got to do God if I have to go through the fire and you got to crank her up get it out of me if you've got to keep cranking it up after that and you give me a little bit of a rest and you throw me back in so be it Lord let me be a strong servant of God let me be one that can be a soldier that will stand before the people of God in this last day the children of God don't need to see weak leaders they don't need to see weaklings in the Pulpit ready to quit and ready to give up I'll tell you the kind of man they need to see holy ghost film men that will still preach the word without compromise and say brother sister we can face it no matter what you're going through today I'm here to tell you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world darkness is under your feet cancer is under your fear cigarettes can be put under your feet alcohol can be put under your fear you are more than conquerors foreign that's how God does it for his own Glory turns it right back around and heals that and starts a testimony so God will allow something to come your way and it seems awful it seems so terrible and God will turn right around and heal you and bring the testimony out of that that can affect hundreds of people to God notice God takes his holy spirit takes the Christian the church and beats it with the gospel so let me tell you this today if you're a visitor you go to a church where they're not beating you you better change my brother don't I go I've been for years and years they don't never whoop me you're sitting under a false prophet no one hurt your feelings but I want to tell you the truth a preacher that ain't beating you don't love you the only beings in this building today that don't need to be beat are the babies that don't don't understand yet and the angels of God that are here all the rest of us need to Target out of us so notice it beats it with the gospel back and forth back and forth until it reflects Jesus and the Holy Spirit can see the works of Jesus going on in the church then things begin to go fine but there's too much Dross in the church today can anybody say Amen Lord I've got too much Dross too much Jaws in the church today too much now we're fine people we're the best in the world we're the cream of the crop but the church needs to make herself ready get ready let me knows it we need to make ourselves ready again how can overcome he that cometh to God must first be tested that only shows a true child then say he's tested when the test comes on you listen you can't overcome unless there's a test give to you wow how many wants a great testimony let's break down the word testimony t e s t i m o n y test I'm only and groanie and complaining oh that's that's what you all do too I say we want a great testimony do we know it do we want a testimony that we come out of this world Lord by your grace and we walk into heaven and them saints are saying where'd you come from I lived in the latest said they say Lord have mercy you mean you lived in that that worse there the worst day it's the worst day that ever human beings ever lived on the earth you live during that time frame I sure did how did you do it brother sister how did you do it by the grace of God oh Mom when we walk in there we don't want no T-shirt we don't want no T-shirt I survive Leo to see it we want to walk in our Overcomers do we not we want to walk in with a testimony by his grace we overcome the worst age that human beings ever lived on the earth we lived in the day can you imagine if some of our forefathers would have heard about television and Internet and pornography and all that stuff on a smartphone where all of that sin would be accessible just at the push of a button can you imagine some of our forefathers said Lord don't let me live in that age I wouldn't want to live in that age but God's got some young people God's got some young men some young women come on somebody preach with me God's got some people on the face of the Earth today are living in the middle of Hell itself there's Darkness all around us friends there's chaos everywhere we are not living in a paradise we are living in the middle of hell but by the grace of God we will overcome every devil the people of God will overcome every evil you young people can overcome you middle-aged people you can overcome us older people we can overcome not only can we shall how cook cook and more cook but brother Donnie I've been cooked my whole life I understand I was 12 when I got saved and I'm 67. you figure the mass I've been cooked my whole Christian Life especially since I come to the message and I'm enjoying it more than I've ever enjoyed it before praise God you know what it gets sweeter I'm getting closer the days are getting closer everyone will be look after there's no hope for this world the No Redemption for this world only the coming of the Lord Jesus where would we be was it not for him was our only hope what can they offer you what can they produce to you that will help you lay down at night and have peace nothing listen this and of course when the test is given it's given to see whether you can overcome or not Jesus said to him that overcometh the test everybody look this way please I want you to see one of the greatest things next to Salvation that is given to any of us the test is the greatest thing that has that ever happened to you can anybody say Amen yet or do you need to grow into that a little bit it don't seem like it does it it don't seem like it you say so because we don't understand how to make good gold we don't understand the process but God understands the process of making 100 percent called so he says I'm going to give Larry one of the best things I could get that boy can play at piano he can tickle them ivories I'm telling you what you don't have to even look at him he he cannot even hear a song before and go down there and play that thing I give him a great talent when I bless him be able to do that but I'm going to give him the greatest thing I could give him for than salvation I'm going to test him I'm going to let him have issues with his heart I'm gonna let the doctors even tell him I didn't hear him you're you're pretty close to dying you realize you could die when he had his episode here not long ago and they said you you could have died no he couldn't God wasn't done with him yet praise the Lord so what did God do that God gave him the test and God let him come on the other side of the test and then God turned the test into a testimony but he wouldn't had that testimony today could you see him sit there and raise his hand and give praise to God he would not have that testimony if the test had not come first don't lose strength Church don't lose your faith in the middle of the test know that God's given it to you so he can have honor and Glory out of your life your story is written for his glory your story has been lived out in this day for the glory of God it's not for us our story is not about us how people can read about our life and think boy they done this or that or the other no it ain't about that our story is written for his glory oh my let my story and your story be written for the glory and mercy of God the sand let me finish this quote Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time it's one good evidence to us that God is with us listen now when we're tested you see people that aren't being tried and tested there's something wrong our church never has no trouble well we're so happy God bless you enjoy it while you can because if you're a Church of the Living God it won't stay that way I don't care who your pastor is Jesus was the pastor of the 12 disciples he had the office church ever was they had troubles that arguing they had fuss and they had fight it's just goes with having churches and God is going to allow your church to be tested if it's a true church now if it's not if it's a shock church if it's just that type of church he don't even worry about it but if it's a True Church of the Living God he's going to let it be tested it's one good evidence to see that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God or tested and tried let me read the scripture to you and Peter beloved beloved think it not strange concerning what fiery not ashy not ashy fiery look at the meaning of the word a burning the burning by which meddles what a strange meaning of the word are roasted roasted and reduced by a figure drawn from a Refiner's Fire calamities or trials that test praise God praise God I want to be true you only true call me true do we want to be true because we know he and his wisdom will never allow more to come upon us the one he gives us strength to bear it maybe you find yourself there today and I know some of you do because I'm your pastor so I know some of the things that you're going through got a text Carol did yesterday from one of the families in our church and they're dealing with this certain issue and another issue with her son another issue with health and another issue with this and that so sent him a quote that's one of my favorites when I'm going through things it's from invisible Union the prophet said with the law of contrast he talks about how that we go through times in our life and it's seemed like it's a daytime then he said it'll switch on you and it'll be a night time and he said like we say it down south when it rains it pours how many said them days like that and you just say Lord I I can't take another day I don't know what to do Lord what in the world what is going on but remember Noah when it seemed like it couldn't go a day further put a rainbow in the cloud I don't mind telling you it makes me mad I'm so mad right now I could buy the Snicker bar right in the half that's how mad it makes me that the devil and his crowd stole our rainbow side huh and it we're that we're ashamed even refer to the rainbow we're afraid to even have one anywhere because we'll think people will think we're like them and the devil hijacked it he done the same thing to shouting he'd done the same thing about dancing the devil never started dancing the devil never started dancing God told Joe where was you when the morning stars sing together and the sons of God shouted for Joy the prophet said this up for a dancing in heaven before the foundation of the world dancing didn't start with the devil it started with God well come on somebody worshiping and loving and adoring that didn't start for the devil that's the way they do it concerts you probably read it the other day on your smartphone or your newspaper or whatever a Taylor Swift concert was being held out west they got so loud the people now the people got so loud and clapping their hands and screaming and hollering at her concert they caused an earthquake it showed up on the seismograph an earthquake well the devil ain't the originator of that Paul and Silas were Glory we ought not to get in our mind well these people I hear dance we came I'll tell you one thing well I danced out there in the world we'll get saved filled with the Holy Ghost change Partners keep right on Dancing keep right on dancing but you dance to different music now brother sister if anybody ought to have the joy of the Lord it ought to be the people of God it's just about going home time our troubles are almost over our burdens are almost passive oh Hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready the sparrow heads [Music] Heavenly Father you're the only one today who can look down on every individual heart see how much draws how much dirt how much pyrite is still mixed in with the gold may they not leave here today with the wrong picture in their mind it's not like you're trying our flesh and trying to get all the flesh out of our flesh there ain't no hope for our flesh it ain't redeemed it ain't saved it ain't never had the Holy Ghost not one day there's only one hope for our flesh and that is to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye or if we go by the way of the Grave we will raise up with a brand new flesh body what you're trying to separate from is the gold which is our character it's the way we treat people the way we treat your word the way we deal with one another that's our character it's our character I remember when I first come here years ago and I've been here for a couple years and the Lord you remember you placed it on my heart to preach character I don't think I'll ever forget it as long as I live brother Bill Hudson I thought I'd preach that and I was sitting with him and brother Calvin Brother JD some of the brothers he said brother Donnie I don't think I've ever heard that like that before that character as he called it that character of God every time after that if I get to be around him very long he'd bring that up again Lord we know it's an important thing so what you want to do is heat up in order to get flaws out of our character so if people treat us bad then how do we treat them if they're not nice to us how do we treat them back when the word is put to us and we show that we have been behaving wrong or believing wrong will we correct and say God forgive me I'm sorry I didn't know the word said that that's our character or will we just say well I feel that anyway which we know is the direction a lot of people go in this day you can show them what the prophet said show them what the scripture said well I feel led to go this way oh the dross in such a character Lord would you search each of us today and we're not trying to take a pitch for today Lord and say boy I wish so and so had been there today they sure needed to hear that I always so and so was there but Lord God we want to open our hearts and say Lord I was here I heard what was preached father I preached it and I'm opening my heart I want you to look at me Jesus I want you to look at me and see if there's anything in me that displeases you I don't care what it is I've been serving you most of my life preaching most of my life I don't want to miss it Lord I don't want to labor in vain till God look at me today search me help me father if there's any draws any power right any dirt not in my Humanity but in my character oh Jesus cleanse me cleanse me anybody here with me today you want God to do the same thing for you just raise your hand and open your heart to him now Lord help me maybe it's the way you treat your wife maybe it's the way it treats your husband maybe it's the way you treat your neighbor live behind beside you around you in your subdivision and a little loud or whatever mourn boy you just have a real attitude toward them each of us know we know what our weaknesses are our faults don't jump out of the pot friends don't jump out of the kettle when God cranks it up but just say God give me more grace share the other words to this verse of this song God instead of giving healing you gave her it Grace so the author of the song was referring to Saint Paul of course when Paul asks for healing but God didn't give him healing but he said my grace is sufficient so sometimes you ask God for healing and God gives healing other times you ask God for healing and God gives Grace at least for a month or two or six months Maybe and then the healing will come after a while but aren't you glad that he knows exactly what we need and if he's got a prolonged reason for where you are don't lose your face he's testing you he's done testified no doubt to the devil about you you and God's been fellowshipping God's got confidence in you praise the Lord help me Lord that all not falter or fail Lord Jesus help me father Lord God In The Name of Jesus would you move across this building today help each of us Lord May the gold of God be so purified in our lives whatever's lacking in me Lord whatever's lacking in these people some of the Home Folks some visitors Lord would you deal with us help us oh Lord when the temperature increases increases and it becomes hot and we become weary help us not to lose faith oh Grant it Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus May our character please your father hallelujah hallelujah we worship you today Lord God would you just lift your hands with me and just open your heart to him just let him search him praise the Lord praise the Lord we bless your name Lord God we worship you Jesus we don't want to be drunk on the things of the world father sometimes you might let a little financial crisis strike us so it will force materialism to the top of the pot so we can see I didn't realize how much I loved this world and it's things until I got that crunch maybe you'll let something really hit us maybe a cancer maybe a terrible sickness a disease that the doctor sets incurable and once it strikes us fear begins to come to the top of the pot we didn't even realize that fear was there until the doctor gave us that report and then all of a sudden we got afraid you allowed that test to come so it would force the Fear To The Top so you could Deliver Us from the fear oh we love you Lord I mean once after that look at me would you for today brother look at me you want that with all your heart let me tell you what faith for an individual can do also if you know as far as Erica's situation the doctors say they've got maybe one more thing they can try on her as far as they think she's in the last stages no hope this that the other but she told her mama this the other day she said Mama she said I I worry about myself sometimes she said why honey she said I worry because I'm not afraid and I wonder should I worry more because I ain't worried glory to God that's faith brother that's Faith sister so it does so something like with you brother there's something so to you and so changes you and makes you different why aren't we terrified do you understand that Russia has moved nuclear bombs to Belarus do you understand that Russia sent out four of their super bombers su-35s on Friday night the size equivalent to our B-52s which only carry nuclear warheads do you realize we sent one of our nuclear class submarines to South Korea look at Iran look at Israel Hezbollah fixing to attack from the north I like looking at Israel I got the Jerusalem Post app and I look at it every day about because what I see of Israel is they're like us so Israel has Egypt to the bottom they got Jordan over here they got Iraq over here they got Lebanon up here they got the Mediterranean over there they're totally surrounded totally completely surrounded and their estate about the size of New Jersey but do you believe that Israel will be destroyed you don't and why don't you believe that because God's word said it won't but if you've got that much faith for Israel you ought to have that much and more for yourself if God will not allow Israel to be destroyed what about his bride no matter what Satan does he cannot take you under God's purpose is finished Hallelujah what was you playing there singing let's just worship him a little bit can we I hate to take care of this service straight into the kettle so let's just get a little bit of worship in our hearts if you're there today don't be discouraged he loves you he loves you brother Eddie he loves you buddy God knows what you're going through brother Josh he knows what you're going through Lance Michael yes I forgot maybe just some more drugs Hallelujah Hallelujah let's just worship just a little bit changed my heart oh God [Music] let's make it a

be to be at these meetings to be here with you amen and I'm so grateful you know we've have all the the the work that's went into services like these the the the musicians the sound tech the parking crew even parts that are unseen I know it from running Services you have so many moving parts and so I just want to say thank you Amen to all the people that made this meeting possible and I'm so glad that you're here so glad I'm here but most of importantly I'm so glad the Lord Jesus is here amen the Bible says he inhabits you say how do you know brother math that he's here cuz I brought him with me amen he inhabits the Praises of his people and I just want to worship Him how many want to just Worship the Lord amen in spirit and in truth we just want to say Lord have your way amen from the beginning to the end from the front to the back lord I don't want to restrict you any way I just want the Holy Spirit to move freely you believe the Lord H is my mindful of you in your need amen I'm I I'm so aware of that even the the the the holy spirit that is just the the presence of the Lord you feel here the presence of the Lord I felt even before I arrived and I just believe the Lord has something special there's something so special about special meetings and it ain't because of who's there ain't because of who's preaching as good preachers but you know what makes a special meeting special one thing expectation and when you get a lot of Believers in the same room and you have faith and the word of the message of the hour is preached let me tell you friends nothing is impossible nothing's too hard for the Lord put all those licks of fire put them in one big old room amen and everybody pulling on the word of God when Jesus is on the scene nothing is too hard there's no case too hard for him so you just put your faith and confidence in him tonight I believe that he'll speak something special for you amen if you have your Bible let's turn to 2 Kings chapter 2 2 Kings chapter 2 amen I just love the presence of the Lord I realize when I'm in that kind of presence you know this is what I was this is where I was made to be amen I don't fit in out there in the world this is right where I fit in prophet of God said you know you get to church sometimes and you get in the atmosphere and he said you know sometimes you want to cry sometimes you want to shout other times you just want to be quiet he said and he you don't really know what's happening prophet of God said I tell you what's happening you're bumping into another dimension and I say Lord I want to bump into that Dimension tonight let Angels let me bump into an angel a minister in spirit tonight amen we can move from this natural into the supernatural amen from this Dimension to a Heavenly Dimension 2 Kings chapter 2 I want to minister to you and I'm going to title this transferring the Baton and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah Elisha from gilgal and Elijah said unto Elisha D here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to bethl and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethl verse four says and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho verse 6 says and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on the prophet of God actually says that the cities of bethl and Jericho and Jordan represented the church moving through the Lutheran age the Methodist age through John Wesley and then Pentecost would represent that Jordan River but notice Elisha it was important to go to justification but he couldn't stay there yeah it was important for him to go to sanctification that was an important step but you can't stay there come on somebody you got to stay with the word where the word moves if you want to cross Jordan you got to come through all three and Elisha says I'm not going to leave you Elijah I'm staying right beside you notice what he says here in verse 8 Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoke the waters and were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee what a powerful thing another word sister Hattie whatever you say whatever you say notice brother bham says Jehovah Gyra he says that when hadie said those words not when she thought those words not when she had it in her heart but when she let what was in her heart come out into her mouth you see your words have the power to change your atmosphere you think it's not important for you to say Amen to the word of God when the word's being preached you got fear swirling around you speak the word of God and watch those words disturb the atmosphere in your life oh Hallelujah brother bham says in another place when she spoke those words and says that's nothing but the truth brother bham amen the prophet said it felt like the room was about to come apart the Bible says he says ask what I shall do for thee now notice this here and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked hard thing now notice it wasn't going to be hard for Elijah he was going home it's surely not hard for God then who is the hard thing for brother bham as Janny Henry says the prophet prophecy says uh you didn't choose this you you I didn't force you I didn't choose this for you but it's your choice because you chose a harder way there's a great portion of Heaven that's awaiting for you nevertheless notice this I want you to notice something so powerful here in your Bible that maybe you've never caught before notice when Elijah says to Elijah he gives them the condition of this double portion and it's actually amazing because he says to him if thou see me when I'm taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so do you know when you actually transliterate what Elijah said is he's actually saying Elijah Elisha I'm going to go and when I go you have to see me as taken from you because if you're standing here still waiting for Elijah to come back and you're still focused on Elijah in other words Elisha you got to see Elijah that he's gone home onto his reward but there's still a work to do there's still a commission that's on the job is still incompleted Elisha you've got to Elijah is gone notice what he says here in the next verse verse 11 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirl went into heaven Elijah Elisha saw it said my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and ripped them into pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smokee the water and said not where is Elijah but where is the Lord God of Elijah Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your divine presence Lord Lord greater than the anything Lord Jesus more father important than how well I speak how Lord the thoughts that I have before me the notes I've laid before me but Lord the most important thing is that we touch Jesus I pray that you would just move by your Holy Spirit God lord I consider myself just the least of anyone to be able to speak Lord but I just pray that you'd come and speak a word may you take control of every Spirit here tonight God and may you send a refreshing from the presence of God grant it Lord Jesus we ask in your name we ask it and the church said it amen amen you can be seated tonight thank you brother Elijah is going home and this is some of the last words God's about to take him I fully believe with all my heart that Elijah knows what's about to take place Elijah is going home and the mantle is about to be passed the Baton is going to be transferred to the Next Generation and notice here that there was a great burden upon Elijah's heart you know the burden that comes upon every generation to the success or the pre preceding generation as they know that they have to transfer the right things to the Next Generation and so he has the burden of moving or transferring this burden to Elisha you're reading some of the last words some of the last things as Elijah's going home God has already told him that as Ministry and that that phase of that Ministry is coming to a to an end and he's going to go home by a whirlwind I fully believe that the prophet of God knew that the Lord was about to take him home that's my own opinion I believe that you could see that in some of the later messages that brother Bron preaches as that God even I believe it dawned on him what was about to take place as he says things and what house will you build me and you come to the last later messages that he preaches and he he says I'm so glad for men like your pastor your young Pastor here who will take these truths and and will sweep it on to the coming of the Lord he he listen friends let me just go ahead and say this now that it was never brother bram's desire to bottle up all of the gifts of God and all of the power of God in his own Ministry but in fact it was his desire to transfer and to move that same Supernatural expectation not just in one many but one member but throughout the entire body there would be gifts and Ministries that would operate and so he comes down to some of the last things these are some of the last things that he's going to say he knows the commission as some of the last words and he takes him very specifically to the these three cities and you're reading what you're reading when you're reading here in 2 Kings chapter 2 is some of the last things he would say these are some of the last moments before he goes home to his reward at some of the last burdens you know you can read the last words of powerful men you can go and read and get books about the last words of Abraham Lincoln and and different men that have lived through time you could read the last words actually in your Bible of David as David begins to bring Solomon into the room and and he begins to say some of his last intent and some of the burdens I I believe it's a very special moment it's a very critical moment as the prophet of God would call it a junction of time where that there was something that was ending but there was something about to begin you know often times things can't begin until things end in fact sometimes God is waiting to pour something out but until there's the end of something the beginning can't start and so now notice as Elisha this is that moment that critical moment and you're reading some of the last words you can go and read the last words of Jacob as he tells them don't leave my bones here and Joseph comes to his end of his life and he's repeating the same words that Jacob mentions and says don't leave my bones here and Egypt these were some of the last desires some of the last moments some of the things that were the most dear to his heart and I believe it's it's so powerful because Elijah felt the burden of this he feels the weight of this moment he knows he can't transfer the wrong things and he knows as in any race when the runner is finishing his course there's no danger of dropping The Paton while the runner is running but the danger comes at the transfer you see more can go wrong at that moment of that transfer of that baton it's not the danger when he's running but when the hand reaches out to take the Baton it's got to be a strong hand of Faith it's got to have a confidence not a it's got to have the right expectation it's got to have the same Faith the same trust the same ver ver fervor the same passion listen friends we're not going to pick up the race the prophet left going slower or or falling behind or or retreating and going the other way and we need to be more intense about the things of God more passionate this isn't a time to go backwards it's a time to go forward in [Applause] Jesus Elisha Elijah knows the moment the critical Junction of this next generation and Elisha prays and Elijah says ask ask me what do you want Elisha and he says that I would take a double portion of your spirit would come upon me now Elisha you know no doubt he's all struck you could imagine he's just all struck by the ministry of this man he knew there was something very special about this Elijah anointing in fact it was so special that Elisha wasn't going to leave him and there was the school of the prophets but notice where Elisha was standing listen friends there was a lot of other Ministries but there was only one Elijah to this generation let me just say it this way there's only one message there's only one message that will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers thankful for Godly Ministry thankful for God gifts that God uh places into the body but there's one Elijah but let me say there's one people who can receive that Elijah message and I'm so glad that I'm one of them I'm so glad I'm identified by that Elijah anointing and so Elisha says there's something you could imagine he's enamored by this the ministry the Miracles the signs the Wonders the great gifts the great things that he did through that prophet and you can imagine the in insufficiency the inade inadequacy that Elisha could feel about the man to the Baton being passed to him let me just say something here Elisha was not going to be El like part two well Elijah was not just going to replace Elijah Elisha was not going to replace Elijah in the sense that he was just going to do the same things or the same Miracles or hold the same uh you know kind of things listen friends there was one Ministry that fa that came in this generation that was an Elijah and we're not to try to repeat or try to manufacture something you got to realize Elisha you've got challenges that you've got to face and let me say that the the challenge that Elisha faced was very different than Elijah's in fact these three cities that he takes him to bethl Jericho and Jordan at the time of Elijah's Ministry were but bursting with Revival Jericho we know the supernatural Miracles that took place in the city of Jericho with Rahab the Harlot and salmon and the journey of Joshua it was a great Revival it was a great a city of great Revival bethl was the place where Jacob lays down and he sees a vision of a of a ladder going from Heaven to Earth and and he wakes up from that dream and he says surely the Lord was in this place and I knew it not and he names the name of that stone bethl the house of God it was a was a place Jordan where Joshua crosses Jericho AC crosses the Jordan and takes those memorial stones and and memorializes what God didn't notice I want you to notice that these cities that Elijah took Elisha to were not just random but but they were all Supernatural cities notice he's wanting to pass down the right thing he's wanting to pass down the right expectation he's wanting to make sure that Elisha I trusted in Jehovah and you can too he never failed me and he'll never fail you Elijah oh he's always faithful Elijah could say to Elisha the same God that that moved in my uh in my Ministry is going to move in your ministry Elish bethl Jordan and Jericho cities of Revival but oh how different are those cities from the beginning of Elijah's Ministry to the end of his ministry now those same cities that were in Revival now at the end of his ministry now there's young people who are mocking the prophet very different it was in brother brenham's Ministry from the beginning of his ministry till when he came to his I'll say it this way his real Ministry and at first everybody wants him at his church at first everybody's inviting him come preach our meetings come over and preach in my tent I'll hold a Revival and everybody all the doors are open and everybody listen friends Miracles will attract anybody that's right Miracles will attract anybody it'll attract uh uh Christians it'll attract non-christians it'll trct Hollywood everybody loves a miracle but the word brings the [Applause] difference and notice here these were great miraculous cities but now when he comes to his true Ministry now he comes to Tucson and he says I I never wanted to start a church here I I sat here for three years and you never invited me to your church I sat in the de I never wanted to have a church here I just wanted you know be part of your your your your meetings and brother Brandon was always about that but that the doors had closed you never invited me you you never you never you never brought I made an invitation what was it now at the end of his ministry when he comes into his true Ministry now the doors are closing nobody wanting didn't it happen the same way in the ministry of Jesus happened in the same Ministry of Jesus and he says that you know that unless you eat the Flesh and the son of man drink his blood you no part with him and even the disciples said this the the the the the the the multitude said this is a hard saying who can bear it listen friends let me just say this with you without the baptism of the Holy Ghost this message is a hard message without the true nature change by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the message is just dos and don'ts and what you can do what you can wear what you can't wear where you can go where you cannot go it's a hard thing oh but when you have the spirit of the message in your heart it's the passion of your life it's victory it's not defeat it's Freedom it's not changed Hallelujah and he says this is a hearted who can bear it disciples my Jesus looks at the disciples after that they had left and says what where you what are you doing here will you go also no Lord for you alone have the words of eternal life let me say it this way you alone have the words that make my life make sense you alone have the word that makes this entire world make sense and I've searched for it out there and I'm not found it you're the only one that makes my life worth living Lord this message is the only thing that makes the world make sense it makes economies make sense it makes sorrow make sense Elisha you got to Terry Elijah says just stay here you know Elijah Elisha you know just stay just stay you know make it you'd make a good pastor you know plan a plan a you know build a home here and put your family here Elijah you know you know this is where you could just stay right here he was testing him and Elisha says as my as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I will not believe you Elijah there may be a lot of people getting up and walking out there may be a lot of people walking away there may be a lot of people that might find something out there but I want you to know I'm staying right beside the Elijah Ministry listen friends this ain't a time to walk away it's a time to preach it like never before the rest of the world might go but I say to whom would I go Lord for you alone have the words of eternal life there may be a lot of people walking away but I'm not going to walk away there may be a lot of people ashamed of it but I'm not ashamed of it as Paul said I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of Salvation listen friends let me just preach to you for a can I preach here for a moment this ain't the time to try to padic cake around people's feelings and try to modernize the message of the hour this ain't a Time time to try to doctor it up and paint it up and make it more palpable and make it more acceptable socially I say preach the word of God declare the word of God say it like a prophet said it and I believe there's a generation who says give me the message give me the word of God just the way the prophet said it you don't need to doctor it you don't need to dress it up Hallelujah Glory these cities were on fire now from the beginning now to the end down to the end of his ministry and doors are closing now Elisha knew there's something very special there's something very unique about this ministry it's like nothing else I have ever ever seen it's a ministry that's unparalleled it's a Ministry that has no [Music] match you know I think it's so incredible to me how people want to come 30 40 years later and start questioning the ministry of God's Prophet people want to come years later after he's gone and begin to bring up questions well I have this doubt over here and I have this question over here about this and and you know want to say this about this you know it's so amazing because let me tell you let me just read you Lord I'm going to do it let me read you some of what some of the witnesses of that Ministry said Gordon Lindsay said never had we known any preacher calling deaf mutes and blind people to pray for and then to see those people delivered on the spot a Ministry that was beyond any that we had ever before witness James Morris said it was brandom more than any other evangelist who started the postor War 2 fundamentalist hilling Revival falling the counter with an angel on May 7th 1946 word radiated in every direction that all manner of disease and afflictions were healed instantly by the little Indiana preacher even cases of raising the dead were published TL osbor says God has chosen diverse and mysterious ways to reveal himself to his servants especially those called for dispensational purposes and was branham's call in short the man we know is William brandham was sent to demonstrate God in flesh again FF Bosworth said when the gift is operating brother bam is the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the Holy Ghost into spiritual realities of any person I have ever known Morris cell says God called this humble man and anointed his ministry with a degree that within a few short years his name was known in the most remote jungle out station wherever you would go in the world you would find the name of this messenger has preceded your arrival The Voice Gospel of the voice of healing gospel magazine says in Bible days there were men of God who were prophets and seers but in all those sacred records none of these had a greater Ministry than that of William brandom a prophet and seer of God whose photograph appears on the front cover of the issue of this issue of full go El men's uh Full Gospel men's voice brandom listen to this has been used by God In The Name of Jesus to raise the dead but it's funny how people want to come later you know it sort of be like me saying about Mike Tyson you know brother Donnie brother Mike you know Mike Mike Tyson was nothing I could have took Mike I mean I know you got you know I I know y'all talk about how great he was and you know the take TKO and the punch that he that he that he had and how you know how fast his jab was but you know what I I'll be honest here I don't know that I believe all the hype and the hoopla over that all those you know everybody you know I think I could have took you know you know what the problem is is that we have I won't call them uh opponents I'll call them victims we have the victims of Mike Tyson and I guarantee you put one of those victims up here behind this pull pit and they would shut up the mouth of any dummy that wanted to say Mike Tyson's punch was it all that well I got news for the devil why don't you put all these people who want to question the ministry of William Bram I promise you put the victim of cancer and give him a mic put the put the demon of blindness and deafness and give him a mic and I'll tell you what he testify of the same God and Jesus that with me is the same God in the ministry of that Prophet Hallelujah and I'm here to say he's the same God tonight he's that the same power tonight Hallelujah Glory notice this was the ministry he knew there was nothing else quite like it yes sir and so Elisha you can imagine is enamored by the ministry of this man he comes back to these last moments and he's reading some of the last words and he knows the anointing of the supernatural must be passed down he can't pass down the wrong things he can't pass down the wrong type of Faith the wrong expectation but it's got to be the right expectation the right burden the right things he feels the weight of this moment and he knows he's got a said his hope listen friends it was the very same thing the Apostle Paul said when he talked to the Galatians and he says oh fullest Galatians who hath Bewitched you having begun notice having begun in the spirit in other words how did this revival start with the supernatural how did this revival start with the spirit of God listen friends you take the spirit of God out of this message [Applause] if we if we just deduce this thing to good Theology and good doctrines and good stories I'm thankful for all of that I tell you what a prophet said he said you take God out of Israel and they were like any other Nation you take Samson's anointing out of his life and cut his hair he was just any other boy and he said in the church when you take the leading of the Holy Ghost the church is just the the the world with the name of God attached to it but it's the spirit that makes the difference I say more than ever before we need the spirit to make the difference having begun in the spirit are you now Glory are are you now perfected by the Flesh in other words do you think that this changing of your body is going to be by some kind of effort on your part you think that after begun in the Supernatural how did Brother Bam's Ministry begin think about it friends it began with an angel sir breaching the gap between the dimension of the the supernatural into the natural and I say to you if it began in the Supernatural it will finish in the Supernatural Elisha you got to trust the same God you got to trust the same God that was with me and Elijah you got to have your miracles on now you can't depend upon Elijah you've got your Goliath that you've got to slay now all right somebody with me he cannot live under the same stories he cannot live under the past reputation or the memories you know how easy it would have been for Elisha just to say stay here Elijah don't leave okay friends I'll be honest and tell you right now if I was there I would I would be begging God to Lord don't take brother brandham don't take him Lord we need him hear God it had been easy for Elisha to look at Elijah that way but Elijah had to Elisha had to recognize he's got his own battles he's got to face he's got his own challenges and they're actually much worse you say brother Matt Elisha is going to need to have the same Faith as Elijah no he's going to need double I said he's going to need that double portion tell you what a prophet of God said he T that taught that double portion was the was the former and the latter rign and let me tell you what Pentecost ofus in 1906 was not it was not the return of Pentecost can I preach to you here for a moment brother bham said it in the church age book he said at the turn of the 20th century men began to cry out for the spirit of God to move and God poured out his Spirit now that was a part of the restoration but I tell you what a prophet said that was not the return of Pentecost because the former Reign had not even came yet what was that former rain brother Matt the message of the hour it was the teach Mora you get what brother rham says it was Mora the teaching rain the former rain The Barley harvest the spring Harvest you ever notice who caught that and brother Ram types that in the Feast of the trumpets the Feast of Passover the Feast of of of 11 bread the feast the first fruits was fulfilled in the ministry of Jesus do you realize that as the Jews were going into the temple to sacrifice the Passover the Lamb of God was hanging on a cross wow and then the week they they go and offer the F the unleavened bread and as they're offering the unleavened bread Jesus is in the Tomb oh Hallelujah and then there's Jews come and they offer the the fruit of the first fruits and as they're offering in their rituals by their Traditions by the denominations they didn't recognize that at the moment they were trying to make a sacrifice the Lamb of God was coming up on Easter morning amen and they kept on going to church as brother bham said they would they'll keep going to church she'll singing songs not realizing the coming of the Lord has already taken place the prophet of God said in the ministry of Jesus he fulfilled all three of those feasts but then you have the feast seven weeks later seven weeks seven sabbaths plus one day there was coming a sound of a rushing might wind in the upper room when all of God's family was gathered there you know what brother brandham said brother Bram says they were all in one place and one mind and one Accord and they started praising the Lord for something that had not even been sent yet oh did you hear me church I said they were praising God for something you mean you can start praising God before your Miracle shows up you can start worshiping God before he ever shows up in your life and brother bam says when they started doing that the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind filled the house the prophet of God says that that Pentecostal week goes all the way to the Rapture through seven weeks seven Church ages but then in that Feast of trumpets it was not the barley Harvest it was the wheat Harvest Hallelujah I don't know where I'm at but I'm somewhere and brother R says what notice what the Bible says it says that was the that was the latter rain it was the Harvest it was the fall Feast you say then brother Matt if ausa was not Pentecost then what do we have did you hear me friends I said if that wasn't Pentecost then I say this must be oh Hallelujah you're not going to get away from it you're not going to get away from Pentecost the brother ROM says that it was the pattern it is the standard there is no other standard there is only one true church and that true church is identified not with 1906 but with ad33 when God poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh Hallelujah but Hosea I think it's chapter 6 I'll be the as to you as the rain the former and the latter rain now notice this here as we go this a little bit further he notice notice he says you've got to have twice the seal twice the passion twice twice it Elijah brother Brandon's standing there and he wakes up from a dream and he says he sees the Jordan River and the voice says you're 2third of the way there representing that second pool and brother bham crosses going to cross the Jordan River he wakes goes to wakes up goes back out and then he sees that vision of that great mamba snake trying to attack that brother and brother's moving back and forth and and brother bham says a voice says you have power to bind him and power to loose him and then you notice I'm not preaching on that here tonight but the voice as brother Bram begins to describe it there The Voice speaks and brother bham says Lord I want to bind him in Jesus name and and and the voice spoke to brother bandam says You must be more sincere you must be more sincere you say brother Matt are we going to need twice the Zeal twice the passion twice listen friends God has no gear of reverse God is not going backwards he has one gear and it's not staying still either it's Onward Christian Soldiers listen friends this isn't the time to go backwards it's not the time for Less can I say it this way it's the time for more of the spirit of God more of Revival more of the love of God in our in our family it's not time for less it's a time for more and notice here is Elijah's ministry as I fully believe with all my heart what you witnessed in God's Prophet was great miraculous I preached on it Great Signs great wonders great Miracles but I I love the Miracles I love the Miracles but let me just say something to you here tonight I believe that there's more than just Miracles I believe that there's more than just the I'm thankful for the miraculous and I believe we need more of it come on somebody and I believe God wants to do more of it but there was more to that son of man Ministry than just the Messiah sign to discern Hearts friends I'll just tell you and and you can you can take it or leave it but I'll tell you what I believe I believe in God's Prophet we witnessed the very nature of the lamb as the token life was to be the literal life of Jesus Christ Prophet says in one place the very human life of Jesus is to come back on the worshiper and friends can I just say I'm thankful for miracles but if I never see another one in my life but the nature of my lamb comes back upon my life that'll be the greatest Miracle God could ever do in my life is to give me the love of Jesus give me the kindness of Jesus give me the grace of Jesus Oh does somebody feel that way here tonight let the nature of the Lamb come back on the worshiper everybody loves his miracles I do too that loves The Sensational and brother Bram fought against it as I know I've preached this here before fought against it his entire Ministry you'll find it him fighting in one ditch of Armenian ISM and and then one ditches over here in Calvinism you know brother Ram said he said I'm a calvinist as long as Calvin's in the Bible I'm an armenius as long as it's in the Bible brother ROM says but there's always two ditches there's always one side or the other side isn't that amazing how people are there's always us or them or they I'd hide behind this pull pit but there ain't nowhere to hide you can see right through it and brother BR dealt with this listen brother bam can I just preach here for a moment prophet of God dealt with this entire Ministry two sides there's always a ditch on the left and there's always a ditch on the right and he says one side you got the fundamentalist Baptist who's cold and starchy and debt let me tell you how he said in one place he said one's got money in the bank but ain't got the ain't got the faith to sign his name to it the other one has all the faith in the world but he ain't got no money in the bank if you could ever get the two groups together I'm just preaching to what a prophet said and he says notice but the true bride goes down the middle of the rad drawing from both ditches hello hello I notice it's all amazing to me because it's the nature of people everybody loves to emphasize one thing to deemphasize another thing everybody loves to make something pop something up great over here only to lessen you know the fruits of the spirit were just denominational and oh really I'll tell you what a prophet said you might speak in tongues you might not but here's one thing you will have you will have the fruit evident fruits of the spirit in your life says the evidence of the Holy Ghost no brother and thought it was thought it was love the angel told him it wasn't neither is it speaking in tongues you said brother M do you believe in speaking in Tong absolutely I believe anybody who doesn't has never spoken tongues anybody who doesn't love the sensation and the feeling listen friends I love to F the Holy Ghost anybody who don't is just cuz you ain't never felt him before cuz if you ever felt him something in you says I want to feel more of that I want more and more and more and more and more fill my cup Lord but everybody loves to cut one thing out to to raise something else up it's always been that way it's always amazing I've always always found in people that with the message of the hour you'll find people will either deify the prophet or they'll deemphasize the prophet and say you know that's just his opinion brother Amos you know just what a just what brother bam says you know just you know I think brother B wasn't thus say the Lord of here and they always try to split this up and split the listen friends you can't take the messenger away from his message but they want to cut one thing out to cut it to to to to raise something I've some cut out emotion and say it's the word and the word only we don't need any of the gifts of the Spirit in operation anymore then others say we don't need teachers we don't need to teach the word of God it's not important well really that's the Ephesians Ministry pastors prophets teachers evangelists some cut out dancing and say oh that's all Pentecostal well I beg your pardon David danced before the [Applause] Lord what do you think happened on the day of Pentecost was the Fulfillment of everything David prayed for who were in The Upper Room was Jews they don't some say we don't need to dance some say we don't need brotherly love doesn't matter how I treat my brother all right some say we don't need the tapes we got our Bibles other says we don't need our Bible we got the tapes some says we just need tapes we don't need preachers all right somebody help me preach here don't leave me out here hanging on a limb some cut out the message said just give me my Bible others say I don't need my Bible amazing isn't it amazing don't you realize it is the tactic of the devil to kick us into ditches so that he can draw circles and create groups here and groups there groups here and groups there and listen friends I I remind you the prophet of God never drew a circle he only drew the circle bigger see brother the matter you preaching tolerance and and you know just just compromise that ain't what I'm preaching the word will make the separating the word will cut the difference out say well then brother Matt what is it what is it brother Paul what do we need you're confusing me brother Matt do we need the tapes is it not our tapes is it the Bible is it preachers is it t is it EV is it dancing is it emotion is it the word you say which is it brother Matt all of it all of it and I'm here to say give me all of it Lord I need the pastors I need the Evangelist I need a prophet give me my Bible give me the tapes give me the books give me the gifts give me the fruits give me the nature oh do you want to hear tonight church say I want all that God that's given can we go a little further notice this as he comes back to the expectation and he says I want you to make sure that you understand Elisha knew the mantle is nice but it wasn't the stitching it wasn't the Garment it wasn't what it was made of it wasn't the material though the material was very nice but what was special about the mantle was the promis that the mantle carried it was saturated with the anointing the purpose you see that's what an anointing is you ever look up that word it's cha which means to be Oily to smear with oil it's what they would do with the prophet at he was going to be king over Nations they would take that oil and they would break it over that man and pour it down his head as David says that's how well it is to dwell with brethren in in in in in in love it's like the the oil that ran from Aaron's beard it's that oil but what is that oil the purpose of the oil is not so you can get oily people love to get oily but the oil is only representing a purpose and God used that oil to symbolize the trout you realize when we pray for the sick we are taking the words of Jesus and that anointing oil we put upon you is so that the promises of Jesus can come off of this Bible and go into your body and heal you of all manner of diseases it is the transfer of that promise and so he would anoint a man he' take a man like jerem IA and he literally baptize him with his burden and God would have something to say to his people and so God would take a mouthpiece and he would begin to put his thoughts and his words notice friends the words of Jeremiah were not Jeremiah's words the words of Ezekiel it wasn't ezekiel's message it was only a message from the throne Ezekiel was just the Mailman for the message that's why the prophet of God said it wasn't me who appeared there on the Ohio River I was only standing nearby when he appeared you say brother M what does that mean that means you could mock Jeremiah you could laugh at Jeremiah you could ridicule him question his credibility but you weren't mocking Jeremiah you were mocking Jehovah hello somebody brother bam says oh you say I would have defended Jesus in those days oh if I would have just been there you know I would have stood for him I wouldn't allowed those Roman soldiers I'll tell you what a prophet said a prophet said what you do with the message for your day proves what you would have did back there in the days of [Music] Jesus and when you walk away from this message you're not leaving the message of a Kentucky hillbilly you are rejecting the message from the throne but when you're accepting the message brother Donnie you're not AC accepting the message of a Kentucky hillbilly you're accepting the message from the [Applause] throne oh I'm so glad I could receive the word how many's glad with me I can receive the word from my generation it wasn't his message it wasn't his prise thas the mantle was not about Elijah it was the purpose that God was transferring off of the mantle into the life of Elisha it was the promises it was the faith these are some of the last things I've been scouring the message just scouring thinking what was upon brother brenham's heart before he left the the scene what was what was upon his heart what was so close to him as he's going to go off the scene what is some of the last words if I could just put myself there what is the what is the climate there what is the feeling what is what is he wanting to pass down what is he wanting to transfer I come to what house will you build me in 1965 in November just a month before he goes off the scene and I can hear the words of brother bandam say it brother br says oh if you feel notice that the first slide there brother he says I know that each of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it oh I don't know if that resonates with you but it resonates with me oh I want to say I am so hungry for the super Supernatural oh brother I've had enough of this world I've had enough of its depression I've had enough of its anxiety I've had enough of its politics and it's presidents and it's Nations and it's Wars I am so hungry to see the spirit of God move I just can't hardly stand it brother Bron says I get to the place come to a place we sit and see it among us that we're trying sit here in the desert I get to my brethren brother brandom says as it was to see the condition of that brother notice this what he says here go to the next slide brother just if you could brother bam says here in in the token I am looking what were you looking for brother Brandon before you left the scene 1963 I am looking for a time of a breakforth of the spirit of God how many here tonight to say I am looking for a time of the Break [Applause] Forth for another surge so you had surges brother Matt I have but I'm looking for another one tonight another surge of the Holy Ghost into the church for a rapturing faith just before it comes and I say even so come Lord Jesus even so come the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the the holy ghost that we've worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down I say God while The Headstone is coming down to the body send the Dynamics back into the church listen friends don't you realize you live in the most bold age there ever was where the lid of hell has been ripped off and Satan doesn't hide in the closet he's not over in a corner somewhere subliminally I tell you what the devil is he's right out in your face amen he's not running he's right there out in the open Spirits manifesting thems themselves well I just happen to believe that if the devil is manifesting himself right out in the open I just happen to believe that the spirit of God wants to manifest itself I say angels I say Angels If Heaven wants to open then I got a church that says open heaven open Heaven open Let it Rain Lord God brother bham says when all hell Cuts loose all Heaven Cuts loose oh how many want to say cut loose Cut Loose angels of God it comes to the this message can I go just a few more minutes I usually have this little button on my watch and it sets a 1 hour timer my church at home church at home loves this little one hour timer it off take it off I forgot to start it what I tell them when the timer goes off we've stepped into [Applause] eternity very funny brother bam says this here I love this we realize if he should anoint us Slide Five if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts and understanding be open Lord Brother R goes to this message and I'm just going to skip on down some of these brothers and brother brandom says just as we know in ver in slide 11 just as We Know as a man asked me a few moments ago this is why Christ speak I love this message about the coming notice and the Rapture and we know we've lived the time out my goodness could we ever say that again no one would have ever imagined that we'd still be here no one what have you imagine even brother bham seen it and ending in in 77 it could can't go much further you say brother matth then what what what's been the what's been the what is God doing I tell you what he's doing he's not doing anything by mistake he's not making any bad choices he's not just up there dding his thumbs he's working something out just as we know we've lived the time up and the time of the Rapture the hope hope of my heart the hope of the nations of the of the ages it's been the hope of every generation oh is it your hope here tonight friend we know we've lived the time up and the time of the Rapture is at hand notice in your Bible you always find that the spirit of God has coming behold I cometh but then when it says it's at hand it means it's within your reach the Baton is within your grasp just as we know the time of the Rapture is at hand and what were you looking for brother brandham and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and get give it some intellectual faith more mechanics more doctrines eighth Messengers come on somebody to give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies and my body said amen amen listen friends you might be young here today and that's wonderful I'm not saying I'm old let me get that straight first but I'm not as young as I used to be and the older you get the older that you get the more that you realize how true how much you need this promise right here the older you get you realize this world is just a world of suffering I'm talking about the world I'm not talking about his promise listen his promises far his his his blessings far outweigh his crosses David said forget not his benefits but listen friends as he says can give it some Supernatural faith when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who could take a cancer that's ate a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that that that what's that something that that man could not do hopeless he says that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people you know that just happened here just a year ago year and a half ago or so back in our hometown and my brother Travis one of my closest friends he he he he he was searching even from the days he was a boy from just a little boy he was searching for the Lord went into his mom and dad raised in the buur Baptist Church had left the church became disillusioned by it his dad was a deacon there the deacons would go out and take a smoke break and his dad left the church but

healthy guy and real comes from a real healthy family and he's and he's there and and I'm I'm speaking to him and meeting him greeting him and so months go by I forget how many it was 6 eight months later and and I get a call and brother Travis says brother Matt he says I I need your help he says I got a terrible word Mary his wife just Marcus you remember the man that you met I said yes he says Mary just called me and Mary said he's he's been diagnosed with stage 4 Hoskins lymphoma and there's no hope for him at all and doctors have given up on him I said you mean you mean the man I just met he says yeah he says he says brother Matt will you go I was the only preacher there all the other Ministry my dad everybody was gone he says will you go and will you lay I want to lay hands on him and I want to pray for him that God will heal him of this and and and and and just so happens I had been studying to preach the next day and I'd been studying all day on the sermon what cancer is healing just so happens so I go to that room go to that that house there not knowing what to expect and I walk in there and there's Marcus and he's there and and he's sitting there in my just a different shell of a man that I had seen is is crippled up there on the couch he's got a man and woman there from his church and they're there you know it's I just there was just just death you could just feel it in the room that he had he had resigned to this and he and he you know he just you could just feel it right when I walked in the room and and he's sitting there and I could see the tumor just about big as a grapefruit just off of his neck and I and I'll never forget this so vivid in my mind and I remember as as as we sat there and he begins to explain and he says well you know this is this is you know this is the end of my road and didn't want to go this way Travis and what did the doctor saying the doctor saying it's hopeless and there's nothing that could be done and it's you know stage four that tried chemo eight times it failed all eight times go home and he says you know this is this is this is it and this is you know just resign you know sometimes it's very easy to have faith for other people and sometimes it's very hard to have faith for yourself and he had just lost all hope and I sat there and I I never forget as Travis begin to say well Marcus he says I just got to tell you you know Travis is real bold he's a sweetheart but he's got a real tender heart but he's he's real bold when it's when it comes to the word and he says he says Marcus he says I got to tell you he says you know when I came to your church he says I was looking for the Living God the god I read about in the book of Acts Supernatural God he says when I came to your church he says I was looking for him and he says Marcus I want to tell you I found that God and that God's Not Dead that God's still alive he's Jesus the same yesterday today and forever and he's the god of Miracles he can still heal you Marcus and you could see the look in that man and Mary his wife there and she's listening and he says I want to tell you he says I want to tell you Marcus that God is Not in your denominations he's not in your Trinity of gods and and the denominations are condemned and and and and and The Trinity is condemned and and he's and Travis goes on this thing and you know that it's you know you're part I'm not telling you you're bad people but I'm telling you that denominations are of the devil and and and I'm thinking oh my goodness don't Travis afterward of wherever in a fox ho I want to be right behind you buddy he didn't shun to Clare and then Travis got to the end of it and Travis just bowed his head he said Marcus he said I hope I didn't offend you he says I hope I I didn't mean to he said I didn't mean to say anything to you he said I just figured that you know it's very Bleak and it's hopeless I just needed to be honest I never forget Marcus man stood there and he sat there and he bowed his head and he said no no Travis He said you didn't offend me he said in fact when you and your friend knocked on the door a voice spoke to me and said these are men sent from the Lord listen to what they have to say friends you may not realize it but God's always working take no thought for what you'll say for in that moment Jesus said said a voice spoke to him and said these are men sent from the Lord listen to what they have to say he said so I was prepared to hear anything you've got to say so I be begin to talk and I said Marcus all I did was take that book healing everything brother bham taught in there and I said Marcus I I want you to know that that that that that that tumor that you have is just a life doctors have given in the name it's cancer and the non Hotchkins L foman they've named it and I said but I want to tell you that that that that that that's a life that's living off of your life it's a demon spirit in Mark n when Jesus prays for the blind man Jesus didn't say death you know give it the doctor's name Jesus says Thou deaf Spirit a living organism living life come out of the man and do not enter him again and I said that life that's living on your life can kill you if the doctors can do everything they can to take it out of your body and that's good that's praise God but listen Marcus that that life wants to kill you and I said I want to tell you today I don't have any bag of doctors tools but I've got a book full of promises in God's word [Applause] and you could feel just the atmosphere of Faith beginning to raise in that b in that little living room you can feel the atmosphere change and I begin to testify to them I said I want to tell you about a little woman if you go to slide 13 I said this little woman I know personally her name is Elena but she lives in Louisiana I said she also was diagnosed with stage four non- Hoskins lymphoma and I said that that little woman I said was diagnosed with the same exact thing and you could see Mary as Mary Mary uh just perked up real quick and I said that little woman was diagnosed with the same exact thing that you've got and I said but I want to tell you a little bit about her testimonial can I read this to you here tonight I found this here sister Elena says it and and she says a week before Christmas I was diagnosed with stage four non- hodkin lyoma two days after Christmas I started the first of 12 chemo treatments they told me that after four treatments they would do a pet scan to see how my body's responding I believe God's A Healer I've told that to anyone who asks what I'm how I'm doing I told them I was looking to him and believe he would heal me on Sunday I leaped and danced before the Lord with joy and victory notice because I realized it was already a finished work you see sometimes you got to do something naturally in order to move something supernaturally oh come on somebody sometimes you got to do something physically naturally to get a supernatural reaction why did nonon have to dip seven times why did Jesus when he prayed for a little blind man didn't just say you're healed he spits on the ground he rolls up some mud what is it the physical brother Bandon would say it this way the natural always runs with the spiritual why did is he standing there with banks woods and he throws a rock up into the air and brother says that Disturbed the atmosphere oh my brother my sister I say it's time if you want to say Amen to the word of God let that word change the atmosphere brother vom said it Disturbed the atmosphere and when it landed it was a tornado our earthquake that almost suck Alaska why did Haddie have to say the right words whatever you say Sister hadie Sister Elena begins to run and dance before the Lord she says I knew it was a finished work even though I didn't know how or when even though there was no proof yet they were singing what have I to dread what have I to fear leaning on the Everlasting sister l begins to say oh I have blessedness with my Lord so near that sounds strange to many but in the Bible maram danced for Joy when she crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians who had plagued her and enslaved her and bothered her and tormented her when she seen her enemy was dead in the river she began to shout oh my brother my sister when I see the enemy I fought my whole life and when he's cast into the Lake of Fire I believe I'll be dancing and shouting and singing on The Hills of Glory Hallelujah it's a sign and expression of extreme joy and victory I knew my healing would come sooner or later because the Jesus of the Bible the great healer is the same Jesus I served for 27 years yesterday I had my pet scan and today I met my doctor for my fourth treatment go to that next slide he informed me that the cancer is already gone on the left is the cancer on the right is a body that is cancer that's my God that's my Jesus Hallelujah tears begin to well up in Mary she said oh I've always believed in a supernatural God like that I've seen him as a little girl I've seen the supernatural work of God the man put the woman over there say does that mean that God has the H him I said no that's not what it means God has a Divine will it's a sovereign will I don't mean that for a moment but let me tell you what God can do sir God can heal God can save God can set free there's nothing too hard for my God we begin to sit there and i' begin to begin to say just you could see the tears welling up in Mary you could see the atmosphere entire atmosphere change I begin to pray IID never forget that moment as I laid my hands on Marcus here he's full of cancer you could see him in that slide there you can see the cancer just going through his body there he is is with this tumor you can go to the next one the tumor that's about the size of a grapefruit on his neck he had it all down his body down his calves go to the next slide is pet scan full of cancer in the normal pet scan you can see a black spot here for the liver and the in the heart you can't even see anything he's covered he had on his calf he had he had tumors the size of apples ate up and I begin to never forget laying my hands on him I begin to to pray and I said God I'd be reminded of that man in the Bible who couldn't get to Jesus and his condition he had gotten so bad he couldn't get to him you might know somebody like that here tonight that Satan is so tangled up and messed up and you realize they'd never be in a church like this I how God how could you even save my my my child he's so lost and at never even be in a church like this never never even be a meeting like this maybe they're so so torn up with some disease or something in their body and my mind just begin to think of that little man on that bed brother the Daryl and he couldn't get to the Lord but my Bible says that his friends picked up his [Music] bed and they begin to take his body to Jesus and the Bible says that when they got to Jesus he was surrounded by people in a little Hut but that wasn't going to stop the faith of that mother or that father or that Pastor it wasn't going to stop the faith of those friends my Bible says they climbed up on the roof and they ripped the roof off and they lowered him down to Jesus Jesus and Jesus said by your faith this man is made he they may not be here tonight they may be a million miles away but I challenge you to rip the roof off tonight and say God I am lowering them down I'm lowering them down to you Lord Jesus let me give you what the words of the lord gave me just a day before before I came here and God reminded me supernaturally of this God gave me the words and I'll take them I'll give them to you just the way he gave to me I want to tell somebody don't give up on your Miracle you take that from the Lord don't give up on your miracle I don't care if they're not here tonight I don't care if they're in a barroom somewhere where I don't care how lost and how many years it has been don't you let the devil rearrange it and try to rearr it and say it'll be this way and God must have been it this way you hold on to that promise God Made [Applause] You Don't abort it don't abort it I began to pray I said Lord just as Hezekiah asked for years who's going to give a death sentence and ask for years I pray for this man who stood for you he's a preacher God he's he's preached from your Bible he's spoken about you Lord if he was if he was not ashamed of you then God don't be ashamed of him Lord would you heal this man you know what we did after we prayed that prayer you say brother Matt did the room shake no could have I'd have loved it handwriting on the wall could have didn't you know what we did we took our burdens to the Lord and we left them there and that's all you can do and we walked out months go by forget how many months it was months go by Brother Travis just so happens to be in my living room sitting there talking to me where is talking about things you know nothing really important Travis is just in the middle of a sentence I never forget he pulls out his phone and Matt Mary begins to read the text praise God Marcus has been supernaturally healed of stage four non hosin lymphoma he is cancer Hallelujah that's my God I said that's Jehovah Gyra he is still Jehovah Rafa Marcus was supernaturally healed of cancer and I say whatever you need tonight he's the same God in the room what you're looking for ain't down the road it's right here right now whatever you need Reach Out Reach Out say God I accept it in the name of the Lord I accept it in the name of the Lord musicians could you come hallu I accept it in the name of the Lord could you do that here tonight friends don't give up on your miracle thank you Lord he is still Jehovah Gyra he is still Jehovah Raa and he is more than ever before wanting to pour out the supernatural oh thank you Lord God I think of many needs her tonight I think of how many needs we have in this body I think of my brother Ron Spencer there in Virginia and let me tell you something the doctors might say one thing but drct Jesus says another whose report will you believe I said whose report will you believe the report of cancer the the report of what the naysayers say and the doubter I say I choose to believe the words of the Lord that they are yay and amen they are thus saith the Lord it is God's promise not my promise wonder if you take that need raise it up as you byow your heads and say Lord I'm representing behind my hand all the needs in our body the needs of this church those listening online I bring those needs up I believe my Bible told me to to speak them to bring those needs before the Lord it's not just one it's many there's not just one or two friends I know the needs of the body are many many many but I've got a go God who says it's never too late don't you give up on your miracle I don't care how lost I don't care how far away I don't care how distant it looks I don't care how many years it's been don't you give up on that Supernatural God friends if we lose that Supernatural God we are doomed it will take a supernatural Miracle to change your body one day and I say Lord let me not restrict you let me not hinder you let me not hamper you let me say God I give you freedom I give you Reign I give you full control Lord to move to speak to to operate I give it to you God I'm going to lay aside all my ideas I'm just going to come before you nothing in my hands I bring simply to thy cross I clean I give it to God now whatever that need is I wonder if you'd put your hand over on that person beside you I wonder if you'd bind your faith together you call out you call out to God for whatever your need is I believe this church could call the name of a mighty warrior brother Ron Spencer who's Faithfully stood and preached this message in country after country brother man who in in great need stands for the message of the hour not just brother Ron but many names we can name here tonight whatever that need is I wonder if this church would just begin to call on God and say God we've heard about it we've spoken about it we've preached about it but now we're Believers we're going to believe about it God we're going to stand upon the promises the unfailing promises of almighty God I don't care if it's that boy or that girl or that mother who's walked away or that father who's walked away nothing is too late nothing is too hard nothing is too far gone as long as there's breath in the body there's a miracle waiting to happen oh God we raise up our voices here tonight Lord in this room we feel your presence God that Supernatural angel is moving through this building right now wanting to touch lives he's wanting to kill Hearts he's wanting to mend Brokenness he's wanting to restore homes may you move oh God your Prophet told us anybody who's Born Again by the spirit of God is a candidate for the supernatural power anybody who's born of the spirit I say I am a candidate for angels of God to move upon my heart and my life oh let's start this meeting out with a move say God I got I unrestrict you tonight move Holy Ghost move in every heart oh God move in every life Lord Jesus you're still the same yesterday today and forever there is nothing too hard for you God there's nothing

So then back in June, I ended back up in the hospital, my colon acting up. The nurse practitioner said, \"You just had an angry colon.\" And they tested me for uh ulcerated colitis, IBS, and uh Crohn's. And so he was thinking I had Crohn's and everything, but they said I had 10 inches of my colon had come out. So back in uh July, he took 10 inches out. But you know what? I'm still here today and I thank God. And I had another colonoscopy. I had four of them this year. I tell you, I don't wish that on nobody. But anyway, uh had another one just last Friday and he had said, \"I got good news.\" He said, \"I don't have to see you again for a year.\" And I said, \"Well,\" I said, \"Thank God.\" He said, \"Yes.\" I praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I know that God can answer each and every one of these. Amen. It don't matter. Just take him at his word. He said he's a healer. And I believe him. Don't you? Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we come to you tonight realizing, Father, that you're still Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, Father.

Oh, God. How we so feel humbled and small in your presence when you come among us, Lord, and make your way known, your will known to us. And then to see that you have included us in your great program. Father, we just want you to know that we love you and we adore you. We magnify you. &gt;&gt; We cannot wait to finally be able to see you. Lord, we're just happy that it's Wednesday again. I told Carol before church, I said, \"I'm just so glad to be able to be in church again.\" Oh, Father, it's such an honor and a privilege. What a great privilege it is, Jesus. We love you. Help us tonight. Father, speak to us from your word. Father, you see this request that was just turned in. Dear God, Brother Marty McMord and Lord, pastored a little church there in Arkansas. Pray that you'd be with them as well. Granted, dear Father, anoint us tonight, Lord, as we look into your word in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, there was a wasp that flew on my nose and stung me on the hand. So, I say we go ahead and have church while y'all say. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Genesis 24:1. Praise the Lord. And Abraham was old and wellstricken in age. And the Lord blessed Abraham and all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, \"Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son, of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom among whom among whom I dwell. But it didn't say he was one of them. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he was just in the same culde-sac &gt;&gt; or the same vicinity. That's the way we are. We are not of this world. &gt;&gt; But thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. And the servant said unto him, Perventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must thy needs bring thy son again unto the land from which thou camest? And Abraham said unto him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again. the Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, which spake unto me, that swear unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He shall send his angel before thee. He shall send his angel, not a host, not angels and plural, but his angel before thee. and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. May the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. The first time that we actually can see that angels appeared in the Old Testament in the relation to man in the scripture is the very last verse of Genesis chapter 3. But it's not a very good setting for the Bible tells us that God drove the man out of the Garden of Eden and that he put cherubams on the east side outside of Eden. And they had a flaming sword and they was turning every way to protect the way back to the tree of life. That's right. And then we go for many years before we see an angelic visitation again that God is bringing down heaven to the constituents of the earth and helping them to be reconciled back. Part of our dowy is going to be our heavenly identification that will strengthen us. Sometimes they will also bring healing. They will bring encouragement. &gt;&gt; They will bring all different kinds of things to us on our journey. And it is a witness to us that we have a heavenly identification that goes beyond just this mortal life. Now, of course, angels appeared many times in the Old Testament. In retrospect, as we we read the New Testament and we start in the Gospels and we can see Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And for us looking at it backwards, it makes the picture so clear. But had we lived in that first century, four, five, 6 AD, something like that, for us to have been there, no doubt we would have not known the great things that were transpiring because there was no social media. There was no printed New Testament for about 50 to 60 years after the Lord Jesus had left from the earth or it would have been probably actually 25 leaving 33 and the first one was around 56. So it would have been 20 20 something years before they had apprented New Testament. So by word of mouth, there might have been a few people that would have heard some talk that angels had been appearing on the earth and there was certain people that these angels was coming to and making things known to them. Now no doubt it would have been very odd and very strange because the angels had not appeared like this at all in this consequence even in the Old Testament. Now they would appear and it would go years before anybody would see another one. And then one would appear again. It would go years. It might be hundreds of years before anyone would see another angel of God. And then it would be restricted many times to prophets that God would send his mighty angels to the common average person. Very very few instances in the scripture. But yet when we look at the New Testament, it was a breaking of what God was fixing to do because the son of man, the ladder from heaven, was fixing to anchor down on the earth and latch a hold of the throne of God in heaven. and the angels would start ascending and descending on the son of man. So before he actually is ever born and brought to the earth, this angelic appearance starts happening. It's phenomenal really. Let's read Luke 1 verse 5. Now, I want you to notice that I I checked it before I came out there just a bit ago that the angel Gabriel, his name is mentioned four times in the Bible. The first time is in the book of Daniel. The second time is the book of Daniel. But the third time is what we're going to read right now in the book of Luke. So, the first two times made known to a prophet. But now God is going to break that pattern that it's not going to be a prophet. It's going to actually be a priest. And the next time it'll be a woman. Luke chapter 1 verse 5. There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea a certain priest named Zacharias and of the course of Abia. And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth. and they both were righteous before God. Now, I want you to remember these portions of this verse. So, they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless. So, they are walking before God perfect. But notice what they're walking in. And they're in this stage of what God call righteous and blameless. So both were righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and the ordinances which was thou shalt, thou shalt not, thou shalt, thou shalt not. You can't go here. You cannot mix in your garment woolen and lenon. Don't s sew diverse seed in your garden. Don't do this. Don't do that. And they were blameless when it come to that. But now watch how people can be blameless when it comes to commandments and ordinances and miss it when God does a new thing. &gt;&gt; They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless. They had no child because Elizabeth was barren and they both were now wellstricken in years. And it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course. Now notice everything is exact. He would have been a punctual sort of a guy. He would have been a guy that was right on time, everything dressed exactly, pomegranates, garments clean, hands washed, feet washed, everything would been perfect to the dot. According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. Isn't it strange how God picks certain sides to do certain things? I'm sure you've noticed it that brother Brandon would bring the prayer line from the right side. The right side so much in the scripture was pointed out. Now watch. So the angel appears on the right side of the altar of incense and he appeared at a certain place. Why? Why the altar of incense? Why not the manora, the seven brain candlestick? Why not the ark of the covenant? dispensationally. He appeared at the right place. Why? The people on the outside are praying. What's Zachcharias doing? Offering incense. He appears exactly in the right season. Had he been beyond the veil, Zachcharias would have never seen him. &gt;&gt; So the angel of God, which is Gabriel, came exactly to where he was. And the people couldn't come into there, but they were paralleled that on the outside. They were all praying together. Oh, I wonder what could happen right here tonight if we'd all get in that same attitude. &gt;&gt; And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, \"Fear not, Zachcharias, for thy &gt;&gt; prayer.\" So he appears at the altar of s incense. Remember when the great ornament of furniture that was seen there in heaven and what was it? The prayers of the saints. For thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John, and thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. Now, I want you to notice how the angel of the Lord, Gabriel, is going to place John and divide the Elijah mantle of Malachi 4 in two parts. Now, watch what he tells him. many of the children of Israel. He shall turn to the Lord their God. For he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. But Malachi 4 says, \"Turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers.\" wonder why the angel of God didn't quote that latter part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, for those of those who have left this message and try to say John the Baptist fulfilled the same thing, you're lying. &gt;&gt; I said you are lying. &gt;&gt; Gabriel said he would fulfill the first part. I'm going to take Gabriel over some beardrinking, shortwearing, backsliding man that's walked away from the end time message &gt;&gt; or some preacher standing up that thinks he knows more about it than a God called prophet and word of life said &gt;&gt; you want to take this one's idea that's idea go ahead and do what you want to do. I'm going to take Gabriel's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to take what Gabriel said over some theologian that thinks he knows more about it. No, I figure Gabriel knows much more about it than I do &gt;&gt; or any of you. &gt;&gt; Now notice, he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just and leaves out with divine intent and purpose that he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. So he slices that prophecy right in half. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And divided Isaiah 61 by 2,000 years of a prophetic timeline. [crying] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know how blessed you are to see that tonight &gt;&gt; to make uh ready [laughter] a people prepared for the Lord. And Zachchariah said unto the angel, \"Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the angel said unto him, I am &gt;&gt; Gabriel. that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these glad tidings, and behold, thou shalt be dumb. Tell me how a sinless, blameless, perfect man. Come on, brother &gt;&gt; could not see such a thing. Can't you see how good people can be totally blind &gt;&gt; as God changes from one dispensation to another? &gt;&gt; Now, this is in your Bible. This man was blameless until this. &gt;&gt; Now, he's no longer blameless. Brother Daryl, the angel of God tells him who he is and tells him because of what you have said. Now, it was not just that he asked a question. It's the attitude he asked it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. All right. &gt;&gt; And Zachariah said unto the angel, \"Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\" And the angel answered and said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee to show thee these glad tidings, and behold, thou shalt be dumb. [clears throat] Well, I'll tell you one thing. It's probably a good thing that Gabriel ain't here today striking everybody that has questions and doubts about the message of the hour. Cuz probably beginning at the pull pit to the back, none of us will be talking for a long time. &gt;&gt; I don't know that might be a good thing sometimes as much as we rattle in much trash as we talk. &gt;&gt; A blameless, perfect man that obeyed the commandments and the ordinances. And thou shalt, and thou shalt not, and thou shalt have this, and thou shalt, and thou shalt. And now God was doing something like he had never done before. And the man missed the present tense angelic visitation. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Behold, thou shalt be done and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed. Now I want you to listen to this. Because thou believest not &gt;&gt; my words. &gt;&gt; Now if Zacharias said I'll tell you what I want a scripture. &gt;&gt; I want you to show me a scripture where it mentioned my name and my wife's name and I'll believe it. You ain't got no word where I can trace it back to the Old Testament and prove it. Where is there even a John in the prophecy? &gt;&gt; There ain't no such a name. I I I I'm challenging you by the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Watch it know it all. &gt;&gt; Cuz you'll find out you don't know it all. &gt;&gt; And not only that, you may not be able to speak what you do know. &gt;&gt; The same angel that can open your mouth can shut it, &gt;&gt; can't he? Now watch. Because thou believest not &gt;&gt; whose words? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; So when God sends an angel &gt;&gt; and people refuse &gt;&gt; to accept that angel's message, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Dangerous thing, friends. because thou believest not my words. Now I want you to listen to the perfection of God's word which shall be fulfilled in their season. Now I'm going to say something right now that's going to blow some of you away. There are words that God has allocated in his people's lives that he knew must be on divine sovereign promise whether or not you even believe it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sarah never did believe. The prophet said she never did believe it. If it was left up to us, us and our weak measly faith, we still wouldn't get off the ground. There ain't no way in the world. You know how there's going to be a bride there? Divine sovereignty of God has already spoke. There is a bride and nothing, including herself, will ever stop her from being here. Because you and I would look at this, well, I don't understand. We have this question. Well, what about that? What about that? What about that? But God says, \"My word will be fulfilled.\" And there ain't nothing going to stop it. Time ain't going to stop it. The world ain't going to stop it. Our fears ain't going to stop it. Our anxiety ain't going to stop it. And that's the way with the allocation of certain divine promises. There ain't enough devils in hell. There ain't enough preachers in the pull pit. There ain't enough unbelievers in the world. His word will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. I thought that if we didn't believe certain things said about us, it couldn't happen. &gt;&gt; Well, that's true to a degree, &gt;&gt; but there's certain things that God knows how we are, &gt;&gt; and there's certain things that he gives to you, and if you don't believe them, they won't happen. But when it comes to your destiny, it's already been predetermined. For those whom he did forno, he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son. And the original digot says it this way, for whom he did forno, he did previously mark out copies of the likeness of the son of himself. previous mark out copies of the likeness of the son of himself. He could not leave my destiny up to my free moral agency. Oh, I know some of us are free will Baptist, but it comes right down to it. Boy, my free will. Glory to God. I went down to the altar and I grabbed a hold of the horns. No, you didn't. God grabbed a hold of your horns and shook the devil out of you and absolutely converted you and smacked you up the side of the head and said, \"You're a son of God. You're a daughter of God. You're not going back to the world, but Lord, I want to.\" He said, \"I said you're not going back no more, but God, I can't do it.\" Yes, you can. But God, I'm too weak. No, you're not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the way [screaming] our God does it. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled. And yet part of those words were words about him, brother Daryl. And he didn't even believe what the angel said about him. How you know that, brother Donnie? That's the very thing that he threw back in the angel's face. I'm [screaming] old. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I can't do this. There's no way. He was doubting God's word about him and about his wife that it couldn't happen. The angel of God said, \"All right, boy. You're going to be dumb.\" &gt;&gt; There's a lot of dumb folks in the world we're living in. &gt;&gt; And it ain't their tongue. &gt;&gt; It's her supernatural intelligence. Huh? You're going to be dumb because of this. But the word [screaming] I spoke &gt;&gt; shall be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now let us move from Elizabeth and Zachcharias to Luke chapter 1 26. I find this amazing because Luke remember was not actually in the message as we'd say at that time. So Luke was a Jew, but he was raised and cultured in the gentile ways. Speak many, many languages, educated, doctor. So Luke didn't come around till sometime later. Now, according to the Bible, we're not supposed to accept anything without two or three witnesses. &gt;&gt; So I'd like the second and third witness &gt;&gt; that Gabriel came to Zacharias. Come on. &gt;&gt; I love it when the Lord does that. I mean, it just I just love it. He loves to fry that devil's hide. I want to know who else said this happened beside Luke. Do y'all believe this is the Bible? &gt;&gt; Do you accept it as holy scripture? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But we've only got one man's word for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that one man wasn't even there. &gt;&gt; So y'all accept it? &gt;&gt; All right, I'll go ahead and read the rest of it then cuz he's also the only one that says this one this way. &gt;&gt; That's why I have no problem when God sends a prophet messenger to the earth and he preaches the seals and says all kinds of things that other people didn't say. I have no problem accepting that myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, notice Luke 1:26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, and to a city in Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin espouseed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou art highly favored, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what matter of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, \"Fear not, Mary.\" Oh, so this angel knew people's names. &gt;&gt; He did not have to ask them their name, did he? &gt;&gt; He could tell them their name. &gt;&gt; Yes, he could. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I've been sharing some this week of some discernments that I found. I'd sure like to share them with the rest of you sometime, too. When God's prophet would call people out, tell them their first name, middle name sometimes and last name. Tell them what was wrong with them. Tell them what their house number was, what street they lived on, what city they were from. And in one of them that I'd sent around, he told them the area because he was singing it in a vision where they were coming from and it was a lake or a body of water and described how it was coming into this country and it was Paduca, Kentucky. Another one was a small place in Missouri and he calls the name of that place Kennet, Missouri. Well, I can tell you even to this day, if you blink your eyes and you go through Kennet, you ain't even going to see it. I can't imagine what it was. Right, brother Daryl. Brother Daryl's been through there many, many times. Uh, but yet God was so particular and the way that he would have Why was this done, friends? So we could recognize the Lord Jesus was here, not William Brandham. the Lord Jesus, it was his ministry on the earth that had come to call out a bride. &gt;&gt; Now, had it been only the signs and the wonders, then we would have known right then there was something wrong. God never sends that type of phenomenon without bringing a message. The phenomenon will come first and the phenomenal events will start happening. It's in order to get the attention of the people and the messenger is baiting the hook. So the hook is hanging there. It's hanging there bare and it's hanging there exposed. And God will send a sign and he will send a miraculous and the supernatural and he will cover the hook so the fish will not see it. And then the spirit of God will launch it out into the water and he'll go to reeling in. Now what's he looking for? a rainbow trout. A rainbow trout. But you see that rainbow trout will run away from a bare hook. So you've got to have bait on that hook. [clears throat] What does the devil try to do? Try to impersonate that supernatural phenomena in order to take away and make the real look smaller. Oh hallelujah. Now watch the angel Gabriel how he deals with a woman. Not a preacher, not an evangelist, not a teacher, but a woman. Oh my. Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David. He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever. And his kingdom of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then Mary said unto the angel, Mary, you're going to question. Now, Zacharias raised a question &gt;&gt; and got in big trouble. That's right. &gt;&gt; But Mary's going to ask a question and ain't going to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonder what the difference is. Attitude. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She's being honest. She's not asking that question out of unbelief. &gt;&gt; You see, that's what Satan loves to do when people go to question the message. Well, I don't understand this. How come that? I can't put that together. and they go to web pages and websites and they go to talking to a bunch of unbelieving devils and won't even talk to their pastor, won't even talk to godly men of God, but they hang around that bunch of garbage out there that's as polluted and hellbound as they can be. Come on, somebody. Let's have church tonight. You're not even doing something sainely by asking men of God who've given their entire life for this message, for this word. and you'll go to websites and go to read this book and that book. Why don't you come and talk to men of God that you've seen God heal the sick through their hands and seen God raise the dead right in this very church building and you'll talk to unbelievers and infidels and agnostics. Come on children. I said come on children. If you're going to have something there and you got a question, come to men of God that God can help lead you in the right way. Mary was not smitten because you had a question because she was asking in sincerity, not in doubt. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when Judas saw the high expensive perfume that was poured on Jesus head and on his feet &gt;&gt; and he looked at it and said, \"How come this waste? This could have been sold for, you know, how muchever it was. It could have been sold and given to the poor.\" And John knew him well by this time. And he said, \"Not that he cared for the poor, but he was a thief.\" So Judas asks his questions too. I like to look at where the question is coming from. A sincere heart that's trying to understand or the heart of an unbeliever, an infidel that only wants to argue and debate. I'm not going to spend too much time answering them kind of questions cuz it's basically a waste of time. &gt;&gt; I'll spend day and night. God knows it's the truth. I have spent hours and hours and hours trying to find answers to people's questions. If I feel it's sincere, but if I feel it's not sincere and I pray over them and God just pulls it away from me, I'm not going to waste hardly no time at all. Why should I? I get that one answer, they'll give me another. And I get that one answer, they'll give me another. And I become so consumed and trying to answer the questions of people that don't believe in the first place, I take away from those who really do believe, and I could help them. I'm not going to cast my pearls before swine. So go on, Sue. Stay away from me. I'm not interested in feeding hogs. I want to feed sheep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then said Mary unto the angel, how how shall this be seeing? &gt;&gt; I know not a man. Now look at what Zachcharias said. How can this be? I I'm older. My wife is old. And what's Mary doing coming right back? How can this be? I've never known a man. She's going to the flesh just like Zacharias did. But there was a difference in the heart. And the an angel answered and said unto her, \"Thou shalt be dumb. Two people asked two questions. Neither one of them understood. One of them got smoked dumb for nine months. The other one received the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And the angel answered and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month was her who was called barren. For with God nothing &gt;&gt; shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; And Mary said, &gt;&gt; \"Behold the handmade of the Lord. be it unto me. The Bible did not give us her name in Isaiah that she would have to receive by an angelic message and hear her name called through that angel's &gt;&gt; message. Oh yeah. G. &gt;&gt; Now notice, it was not the mighty Elohim himself that come down and call Mary, &gt;&gt; but he sent an angel messenger. &gt;&gt; And the angel messenger called her by name. &gt;&gt; You know, in other words, saying something like this, I'll no longer call you church, &gt;&gt; but I'll call you bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when them word, that seals comes open, then you're hearing your name. Am I hearing Donnie Reagan? Are you hearing Rob Weber? Are you hearing Lance Parker? Harry Reagan, Karen Reagan. Is that what you're hearing? You're hearing your word name. When that word speaks to something that you finally found your true identity, maybe she's always an odd girl, 16 years old. Maybe she's always different and unusual and she didn't know what it was. But when she heard that prophecy, there was something about it. and through that angel's message. Hallelujah. And he told her, \"This is the way it's going to be, Mary. You're not going to work your way into it. You're not going to pray your way into it. You're not going to fast your way into it. The Holy Ghost will come upon you.\" Let me tell you something, little bride. Yes. Pray. Read your Bible. God lays it on your heart to fast. Fast. But you're not going to get it by your works. You know how we're going to leave this world? The Holy Ghost is going to come upon us. The spirit of God will bring the power of the rapture. And it's been given to us by an angel's message. [applause] &gt;&gt; And Mary said, \"Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word.\" She trusts him so much. Notice she didn't say the Torah. She didn't even quote Isaiah and say according to the book of Isaiah because Isaiah never personally identified her by name. Jenny, can you see it? &gt;&gt; Can't you see what God has done for you &gt;&gt; by sending you a message in [screaming] the last day that would be so personal to you, you'll never get away from it. I don't care what you do, wherever you ever go. &gt;&gt; It's so personally to you. There's nothing. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. The real bride in this age has it just as powerful as Mary had it then. Brother Daryl, you'll never talk them out of it. You'll never threaten them out of it. You'll never buy them out of it. They can't get out of it. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. [applause] Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word. And they see all these lights and these saucers, flying saucers they call them, and they wonder what it is. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, little children. One of these days, one of them will drop right down into that &gt;&gt; and change it. It won't be hide or hair nor bones left behind. &gt;&gt; You'll be changed in a moment. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, look with me again in Matthew 1:18. This is after the immaculate conception. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the with this wise one as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together and was she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. That's what I'm wanting everybody in this church this same portion of the word right here can be said about you &gt;&gt; that you're found with child &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man, not willing to make her a public example, but was minded to put her away private. Now remember, they were just engaged, betrothed, but the betroal was law-abbbinding. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream. I want you to notice how different that God comes to him than he did to Zachcharias or to Mary. He still sends an angel, but now it's an angel in a dream. And it's not a dream that needs interpretation. So, we don't look over here and there's three stars over there and there's four donkeys over there and there's five moon pies over here and six RC's and then there's a, you know, a little table that's got Tonka toys and and it's got all these symbols and all that. What did you eat for supper? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You can't believe some of the dreams that people send me sometime and they just know it means something. I know it means something, too. But it ain't got nothing to do with God. Come on, somebody. I know there's some of the people in the message just simply don't believe it. And the further we go, the more I I realize even some of the preachers in the message don't believe what the prophet said. That if it is a dream from God in this day, there is no prophet in the land to interpret it. So it will be a dream like Joseph had. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary, thy wife. &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. They're just engaged. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They've not even met under the tent yet. They've not even drank the last cup of wine. They She's not even been sent for to go to the house that he's built her. But the angel of God recognized betroal on that engagement. Binding? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what Joseph is going to do? Divorce her? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife of that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And then Joseph wakes up and said, \"Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. What she's been telling me is the truth. &gt;&gt; I was having a hard time believing. I I just I just couldn't hardly believe.\" So the angel appeared to a bride. &gt;&gt; He did. And the bride conceived of the word and the bride was telling people about it, but a lot of the people was having a hard time believing it. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; That the bride had actually become pregnantated by the Holy Ghost. Praise the Lord, somebody. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe the last call before the birth of the word in flesh will be some of those who struggling and the final voice to the final age will be the bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know some of our message folks don't like that quote. None. I love it myself cuz it reads me and you in the script. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we're the last actors on the scene. Now watch verse 23. Quoting the scripture, behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and called his name Jesus. So God appeared to him in this angel had formed and it was so real to Joseph. He done exactly what the angel said. Now watch in Matthew chapter 2 11. And when they were come, we're talking about the magi now. And they're coming after Jesus has been born. Actually a little while after Jesus had been born. That's right. &gt;&gt; And when they were come into the house, &gt;&gt; not into the cavemen &gt;&gt; where he was born, &gt;&gt; they come into the house, &gt;&gt; they saw the young child, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; not a newborn baby. &gt;&gt; This is what your Bible says. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; They saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincense and myrr. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And if you ever meet Jesus right and give him the proper gifts, you'll go back to your country another way than when the way you come to him. You come to him lost. You come to him wretched. You come to him in a mess. But when you meet him, oh, glory to God. I feel like preaching a little bit right now. And you give the Lord Jesus your gifts. Amen. He will send you back to your country another way than the way you come. Aren't you glad you're different, friends? You've been changed by the power of God. He's sending us another way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appearth to Joseph in a dream, saying, \"Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt. and be thou there until I bring thee word. So you imagine now an angel of God is bringing a message for him to flee. But the same angel ain't going to leave him there. The same angel will be sent back from the throne of God to tell him it's time to come back home &gt;&gt; and there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. Now notice after Herod was dead Matthew 21:19. But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appearth in a dream. Ain't this something? Joseph has three visitations in his dream. His subconscience and it was an angel every time. We have no record that an angel actually appeared in a visible form. Now, some of you may be terrified of these things I've been preaching on Wednesday night thinking that an angel of God is going to appear before you. Don't worry. God knows exactly how to deal with each one of us. And God knows exactly how to make us. So, we're able to correspond to the supernatural. But this was just as much God as the other instances that happened. But this is the way God called Joseph. And this was his divine channel of communication by which God could speak to him. Praise the Lord. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph and Egypt, saying, \"Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead, which sought the young child's life.\" Now, let's move from from this to Luke 2:8. Look at all the angelic visitations that we've seen in a period of 6 months, a year, a year and a half, two years, one after another after another after another. It's a sign something's fixing to happen at the birth of Jesus. And they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel [sighs] of the Lord came upon them. Now remember what these guys were. Humble, poor peasant shepherds. There was the kings, the potentates, the great high priest, the great holy s Sanhedrin. And God sent an angelic choir in order to sing to humble shepherds. Why? It had to be shepherds. And the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them. Can you imagine these guys? Nobody's, brother Darl. Absolute nobodies. And yet the angel of the Lord come upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, \"Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you.\" Oh, you mean so an angel can tell you things that are to be &gt;&gt; an angel can bring you things that are prophetic. &gt;&gt; This shall be a sign, oh hallelujah, unto you. You shall find the babe. Notice the difference of the terminology here, babe, versus the term in Matthew, child. Look at it in the Greek and you'll find out that the other one is an infant. It's not a baby. So, it's several years old. This shall be a sign unto you, and you'll find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. It don't say about the magi finding him in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. I know, I know, I know this is not tradition. I ain't worried about tradition. I want truth. You ain't going to find this in the manger scene. I've said it many years ago. You know, if I was going to have a modern-day major scene in front of my house, you know what I'd do? I'd get me a blowup mattress and go out there and lay in the yard and say, \"Here it is. Right here is the current manger scene.\" Because deity ain't in heaven. It's in me. Deity ain't in heaven. It's in you. Jesus is no longer in a manger. I'm telling you, he's here in the bride's body. He's here in the blind flesh. But, brother Donnie, we're weak human beings. Yes, we are. And that's what makes it so awesome. That's what makes it so glorious. &gt;&gt; And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the babe wrapped in swirling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host. &gt;&gt; Praising God. Can you imagine them old boys looking around? Now keep in mind when they would go into town, everybody knew what these guys done cuz they smelled like sheep. They say that them shepherds was around the sheep so much that even when they laughed that their laugh was like a sheep. [laughter] [clears throat] Oh Lord God, can't you see why Jesus come to the earth? He wanted to learn to laugh like him. &gt;&gt; And them shepherds smelled like sheep. &gt;&gt; God in heaven in spirit form did not smell like a sheep. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But Jesus wanted to come down to the earth and learn to laugh like us, but also learn to cry like us. Did the world need another carpenter? He who made the worlds? &gt;&gt; Did the world [screaming] need another fisherman? &gt;&gt; Him that would go out and cast a net into the sea and all he would had to have done was spoke to the sea and say, \"Empty out.\" I'm talking about our father that could have put a patent on the seven colors in the rainbow. He could put a copyright on the Robin song. He could put a copyright on the cardinal song. He could put a patent and ownership on this and that and the other cuz it all belongs to him. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. And yet he come down to the earth and didn't even have a place to lay his sin. Had to borrow a womb to be born in. Had to borrow a grave to be buried in. But he ain't having to borrow nothing tonight. We give it to him. Hallelujah. [screaming] We will not make him beg for our heart. We will not make him beg for room. &gt;&gt; We say, \"Come in, Lord Jesus.\" Listen what they were singing now. Glory to God in the highest. On earth peace, good will toward men. It came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, \"Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass.\" Notice how they say it. Is come to pass. It's present tense. It's unfolding. &gt;&gt; It's coming to pass. &gt;&gt; They realized they were part of what was coming to pass. Oh Lord God, may I may we look tonight, Brother Joe, and see we are part of what is coming to pass. Yes, we are part of the past and we're part of the future, but we are part of the present. This is our time. We are the actors on the scene. Friends, &gt;&gt; listen to this. Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. Listen to this. And there's a man can turn on the light. You know, when a king is born, they have seen great carrying on. When the king is born, &gt;&gt; he was so secretly born, born in a stable in a manger where the cattle and the horses were eaten. But yet he was a king. And the angels came down and sang the hymns to the shepherds. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So they didn't go to the temple and to sing to Annus and Capus, Pontius Pilate or Herod or whoever all the great people were of that day, but they went to shepherds. You see, God still believes in shepherds. &gt;&gt; And the angels came down and sang the hymns. I'm sorry. I know I think different, but as I was reading this, I thought, what hymns would it have been? &gt;&gt; You imagine them poor guys that the rich wouldn't even speak to them. They would have nothing to do with them. And they're they're setting being entertained by angels. They were the audience to hear the songs at the king's birth. &gt;&gt; So if there's a choir director in the angelic band and him getting his stick or whatever they did and him said, \"All right, ready everybody ready on a capella now.\" Or they might have harps and horns. I'm not sure. Oh Lord have mercy. That'd kill a church of Christ, wouldn't it? Dear God, to think that instruments up in heaven. But there they say the the the shepherds around said, \"Where's the audience?\" You all are. &gt;&gt; But we've never even been to a concert. Most of the time we're not allowed to go in church cuz we we ain't got very good clothes. But today you are going to be serenated by the angelic host and you will hear hymns which have never been sang before. You imagine I'm just sitting there looking one said ain't this something? Can you believe this? Who we going to tell this to? Who in the world are we going to Nobody ever believe this is happening to us? I kind of feel the same way. Sometimes they'll choose that. Who in the world we going to tell this to? We trying to tell them. They look at us and think, \"Yeah, right.\" You know, like he got five heads. What in the world? You people think y'all Yeah, right. Uh-huh. You know what? What you been drinking? Better watch that guy. He's got that blue Kool-Aid. Oh, no. This is kind of purple. You better watch him. He'll be handing that Kool-Aid. I'm the only one that drinks here. &gt;&gt; Okay. We don't hand out this cup. So, if it's going to kill anybody, it's going to kill me. But they look at us and think, \"Oh, come on now.\" You imagine them guys think, \"Is this happening?\" Right. &gt;&gt; Are are we really invited into the presence of angels? &gt;&gt; Could it be true since it's the very day you took your first breath of life on the earth? God had an angel assigned to you. &gt;&gt; And another one which looks like you before the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Remember when Peter was in jail and wrote and went to the door, they prayed that God would set him free and God set him free and then they didn't believe God answered their prayers. &gt;&gt; Remember that in the book of Acts? &gt;&gt; So poor Roa goes to the door and Peter knocks on the door and I mean she just about has a spell. She goes back to town. Peter's at the door. They said, \"You're crazy.\" &gt;&gt; She's telling them their prayers are answered. Said, \"God ain't answering our prayers already. Don't tell us that girl.\" But you know what they said? &gt;&gt; It is his angel. &gt;&gt; Because they believed each person had an angel that looked like them. &gt;&gt; Yes. So they thought Peter had died and it was his angel. Listen to this. The angels themselves were lights that had showed the word of God. They had the word of God and told them, \"Today in the city of David in Bethlehem is born Christ the Savior.\" The angels had the word and the word came by light to guide. They followed the word of the angels to eternal life. And I say I may I say unto you tonight, we're getting closer to the Christmas time so-called. And we know the scripture says that they come and said we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him. But let me update that. &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the west. And we have come to worship him, &gt;&gt; not the star. &gt;&gt; Anybody that says we worship William Brandham is a liar &gt;&gt; and will go to hell &gt;&gt; if they do not repent of such nonsense. &gt;&gt; We pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. We worship the Lord Jesus. You're fixing to see me in a little bit. Baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus. He is our God. But we have seen his star in the west and we come to worship him, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus, not the messenger. [applause] Let me close. You haven't listened to this one in a while. You ought to listen to it. Why it had to be shepherds. Notice God is fixing to make another creation. He's creating mortal earth, mortal life. Angels sing in heaven. But here he's creating a new life, eternal life for man. [laughter] And he's singing to his subjects through angels. Did not the prophet of the Old Testament say, \"I will sing unto you.\" &gt;&gt; Here was God singing to shepherds, through angels. He's singing to his subjects through angels on the earth, not in heaven. Heaven had eternal life. And he's saying, they sang to the heavens. And here the immortal creation is coming in. And now they're singing to earthly people the first time to shepherds. Striking, isn't it? &gt;&gt; He had started a new creation. What was it? A creation of himself. &gt;&gt; God was made flesh and dwelt among us. The Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God, God was created in human form and Jesus Christ his son. God dwelt. He built his tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle. God, Emmanuel, God with us. He built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that. You know what God is when you see Christ. &gt;&gt; Stand up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] One of these days he'll probably let us look back and see your mother was carrying you in the womb. The doctor said he or she will never live or never survive. There's something going on this is that and the other. You might as well get ready for it. But God had ordained you to be on this earth to express his love. Elelliana sent here tonight when Erica was carrying her and Emma. The doctor gave us all kinds of bad reports. Wasn't sure that Ellie would ever live. the way they were conceived and the way their mama was carrying them. Emma was pulling a lot of the nutrients and things away from Ellie. Wasn't your fault, honey. You wasn't doing it on purpose. But we prayed and we believed and we trusted. No doubt the angel of the god of God come in. How many of you almost had a car wreck? You was heading so and so and something happened in the house and you was delayed five minutes and you got down the road and there was a tractor and trailer and people sprawled all over the road and the angel of God got in your way. &gt;&gt; All of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He sends his angels to prepare the way before us. Hallelujah. Remember this is your identity of who you are. You're more than a carnal man or woman. That's only this part. all night and all day. They watch over you. They care for you. That care doesn't mean they keep you from all trouble. But sometimes that care means they help you through the deepest and darkest trials of life. And in the middle of it, you look at it and think, I'll never be able to get through it. And you are actually talking the truth. But God gives you an angelic visitation. We'll get to it. But I found in setting more on on angels this week that the prophet says that there was actually angels of healing. Angels of healing. And he describes the angel that was sent down to the pool of Saleom. They would go there to the pool and the angel would get down in the water and he would trouble the water. And the word trouble there is bubble. So there's all kind of people laying around it and God would send this maybe the same angel in this certain season. We don't know how often and the first person inside that water would be healed. Aren't you glad we don't have to wait for the seasons to come? Hell &gt;&gt; remember the prophet talking about the two women that come to his meeting &gt;&gt; one of them had a real bad stomach trouble couldn't eat the other one had a tumor both of them was prayed for left off believed God kept having same old symptoms same old symptoms kept confessing the word by a strip some healed &gt;&gt; the one sister got up fixed the breakfast for her kids little oatmeal left over and she just felt She just felt a little something nudge her. Uhhuh. That's what I'm talking about. Eat that oatmeal. She thought if I do, it'll make me sick. It always burn my stomach. But she ate that oatmeal. Give it a little bit of time. Oh, now I It'll probably make me sick again just in a few minutes. It didn't do it. She ate a little more. She had a piece of toast and prophet said she got some eggs and did this and had a gastronomical jubilee. Her sister friend lived right down the road. They live in the same neighborhood. &gt;&gt; She had a tumor. So she went down to tell her sister friend about it. She knocked on the door and she heard that sister screaming and shouting and hollering. She just opened the door and went on in. She said, \"What's wrong? What's going on?\" She said that tumor fell off &gt;&gt; and she was shaking the sheets looking for it. &gt;&gt; And a man who had dealt with angels since he was a boy said the angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; was just able to pass through their community that morning. And he said, \"Now what if they would have give up the night before? &gt;&gt; Then the angel would have went somewhere else.\" &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the angel of God having such a busy schedule? That's a faith church. You understand? For some churches, he's got plenty of time. &gt;&gt; They don't believe in miracles. They don't believe God can do that. We want to be the kind of church that we make our angels work overtime. &gt;&gt; They got to work on Sunday. They got to work on New Year's. They got to work on Christmas. They don't never get a holiday. [laughter] They don't never get a day off because we believe God. [screaming] We believe our God does the same thing that he's already done. He can never change. So the angel of the Lord passed by her house, healed her, passed by the other, and healed her, and kept right on going where going where? from one house to another to another looking for faith people, looking for Rahab people, looking for token people, looking for people that had their faith anointed by the spirit of God. And he had to make a stop. Make a stop. Make a stop. Make a stop. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love him, children? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Let's bow our heads together. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, thank you for allowing us, Lord, to live in this last day. It would have been an awesome time to live in the days of Noah. And if I'd been one of his sons, I'd have packed the pitch. and I like doing woodworking. So, no doubt I'd been in there working this and cutting that and sharpening that and doing something else. If I'd have lived in the days of Enoch, I'd have no doubt I'd been inside the pyramids and doing something else. And if I'd have lived in the days of Nehemiah, I'd been building the stones and reshaping this and that and the other. But you let me live in this day. I'm still a builder. &gt;&gt; I'm doing the best that I know to try to take your word and help build a character in your people. Lord God, those that you've given to my charge to try to help build them into a stature of a perfect man, Lord. And many of these sons and daughters lived in the days of Noah that had got on board the ark. In the days of Nehemiah, they'd been right there helping. In the days of Luther, they'd believe justification. Days of Wesley, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the days of the Pentecostals. Because no matter what age you would have put us, we'd been believers. No question about it. Because that's who we were before the foundation of the world. Lord God, I pray you'd make us more conscious on the level, Father, that were called to walk into it. I'm not made to be able to deal in that realm that your prophet did. There may be men on the earth today that are called and privileged by you to deal in a realm with the angels of God and the supernatural and that sort of thing that I'll never be able to, Lord. But I want all that I can. I want everything that's in my ordained capacity. Oh Jesus, we worship you tonight, Father. We bless your name tonight, Father. Hallelujah. May the angels of God spread their wings over this place tonight and distill drops of salvation, if there's any that's lost. May those distilled drops of purity and holiness fall upon a heart. Lord, if there's any that's sick, may the heal the healing angels pass by this way tonight. Lord, I know there's so many needs among your children anymore. It becomes overwhelming and it may overwhelm me. It may overwhelm Brother Daryl. It may overwhelm us as mortals, but it don't overwhelm them angels if we'll just be patient. they will show up and they're looking for faith. Lord God, we want to live in the right community. I ain't talking about a certain subdivision here in this life in Johnson City. I'm talking about the community of the saints of God, seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. There's many sick among our people, Lord. Different ones fighting different things. Father, I'm asking you that you'll just be mindful of every one of them. Some streaming tonight, no doubt, have different needs in their body. May the angel of God pass by. Those that are sick at home, couldn't be in service. May the angels of God come this way tonight, Father. That one who troubled the water there that day, no doubt he's still troubling the water and troubling the devil, too, cuz he passes by and makes the tumors fall off. Hallelujah. He passes by and cures that stomach trouble. He takes care of the blood pressure. Whether it's high or low, makes him no difference. We're needy tonight, Father. May the angels of the Lord, I know they're here. It's your promise. It's your promise, Lord. Your prophet said there was something sacred about a church. As a matter of fact, he said it was his favorite place to preach. He preferred preaching in churches because he said around them auditoriums there was wicked angels. Wicked angels that hung around them auditoriums. But he said there was something special about a church. And he said it was his favorite place to be in church. Well, Lord, it's ours, too. &gt;&gt; It's ours, too. Oh, sure. You met us at Walmart. Oh, yeah. You You met us at Lowe's. You met me this morning, Lord. I want to thank you for it. You seen that text I got last night, Lord. And I was so troubled about it, and I didn't know how to answer it, Lord. It's just been weighing on me and weighing on me and I didn't know what to say exactly, but you visited me, Lord, and I thank you for it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Help the people to see this is not just a preacher privilege. You want to visit them as they're driving to work. The sisters as they're making beds and fixing breakfast. It ain't just the preachers that are loved. May each one of them be able to see tonight. The same angel could speak to every child of God here in this place and say, \"You are highly favored. You have found favor with God. We worship you tonight, Jesus. Oh, bless your name, Father. Sing a little something for us, Harris. We worship the Lord. We have a baptism tonight if they'll come and prepare for that. Brother Daryl, maybe you can come, brother, while they sing. And just give me a little bit of time to prepare. Ain't it been good to be in the house of God? [applause] &gt;&gt; How many of me wants to be more conscious of that world around you? Brother Donnie, I I couldn't stand an angel. I couldn't. Don't worry, friends. &gt;&gt; Mary probably thought the same thing. She had to be told, \"Fear not.\" And for most of us, we'll never have that happen to us. And a lot of your angelic visitations, more than likely, they will be invisible. They will come, they will do their work, and they will pull out of your sphere, and you'll be better, and you'll never see them. But I think I think why God is saying these things to us is that he wants us to know what's around us. But brother Donnie, we're no good and we're we're poor and we're Yeah, I understand why it had to be shepherds. We're not rich. We're [clears throat] not famous. We're not No. But you reckon they let that whole thing interrupt that singing? Oh, I'm not good enough. I'm not good enough. I I I can't I can't listen to this. My ears ain't holy enough. No, my hands ain't holy enough. No. No. But they had to accept what the angel said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he went to that cross, somehow God made me pay for my sins in his body. Then that's what your prophet said. Demonology part two, paragraph 199. And I think of how that when Jesus died, God sent him to hell because of his sins. But he never had any &gt;&gt; of his own. &gt;&gt; But he took yours &gt;&gt; and he took mine. And he took them so completely God judged him guilty of them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The second Adam come to stand in proxy. The first Adam forfeited your eternal life. The second Adam brought it back to you. Don't you love him? Let's just worship it beloved together. Here we are [music] in your presence. [singing] [music] Lifting holy [singing] hands [music] to you. [music] Here [singing] we are [music] praising [singing] Jesus. [music] for [singing] the things [music] he's brought us through. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [music] Well, let's just worship you. Here [singing] we are [music] in [singing] your presence. We love you. Lifting holy [singing] hands to you. [singing] [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here we are praising [music] Jesus. [singing] for the things [music] [singing] he's brought us through. [music] Hallelujah. What a great honor. &gt;&gt; Our little brother has been so troubled about baptism. He said he couldn't wait till Sunday. He did not want to wait. &gt;&gt; I like it when God so gets a hold of somebody's heart, they can't wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what's going on? The angels are still working. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, what a great honor it is for us, Father. How we worship you and thank you. Thank you for dealing with our young children. Lord, we hear news all the time of a sevenyear-old, an 8-year-old, a 10year-old, all different ones shooting people, packing guns, doing all kinds of crazy stuff. The devil is going younger and younger to get his. Why would we want to limit you from doing the same thing? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'd deal with my little brother's heart. I can baptize him tonight in water, but only you can take his little soul and fill him with the Holy Ghost. Lord, &gt;&gt; may you be with him, Lord. Keep him by your grace. Father, I pray in the name of Jesus. My little brother, in obedience to his word, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [applause] [applause] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hey, just something about a water baptism, it makes you want to do it again. [laughter] Amen. Aren't you glad to be a part of the economy of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you accept and believe what the angel has said about you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not Luther's day, not Wesley's day, but your day, your time, your season, your hour, your manifestation of the word of God that's spoken concerning you. Amen. Every word of God will be manifested. &gt;&gt; None of his word will return unto him void. And we're a part of that word. Do you believe that this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You can see why the devil tried to sting him with a wasp. Amen. That's some good preaching right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. May the Lord bless our precious brother Donnie and strengthen him and take care of that sting on his finger. We just love him tonight. Let's just sing one more before we go. Can we, brother Harry? Just whatever is on your heart, brother. [music] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints. Let's just sing this D.

Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful? [music] Let's just bow our heads. Almighty God, [snorts] we Lord bow in your wonderful presence with thanksgiving in our hearts, oh Lord, for what thou has done for us, Lord. [snorts] And God, we are so grateful, Lord, that we can see [snorts] oursel in your word, Lord. For it's written, our God spoken through the prophet that Jesus had perfect faith because he knew who he was in the word. And oh God, we see, Lord, it's the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming word in our bodies. Oh God, how we thank you for it, Lord. We thank you for this word of God that we've heard tonight Lord to see God how you have unfolded under our day dear God and we're so grateful in this age of the darkness of Leosa you have turned the light on dear Lord that we see your word that you have unveiled it unto us God with your children now dear God we pray bless them Lord as they work tomorrow and bring them Lord back safely this weekend we ask God for traveling grace as make our way down towards West Tennessee and Arkansas.

Thank you, Father, once again, for all that you've given us for we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. [snorts] And amen. God bless you, saints. You're dismissed. You know, if you're in the Lord, hasn't it been good to be in the house of God? You cause the sun [music] to rise. You lay it down [singing] to rest. You [music and singing] hold this heart of mine.

Sister Judy Davis asking for prayer. Abdominal abdominal pain uh very severe. She's just asking that we would remember her as we pray tonight. Brother Kirk Sacker says to please pray for a neighbor of ours who is suffering from head to toe with severe pain. Area physicians cannot find the cause. They sent him to Vanderbilt for further tests last Friday. He is waiting for the results from those tests. So they're asking that we would remember that prayer request tonight. Then we have a testimony from Sister Wanda Bman. Says, \"In April of this year, I had gone to the eye doctor to get new glasses. During the visit, I was told that I had cataracts. The doctor said to come back in one year and discuss surgery to remove them. In August, my vision changed again and the eye doctor referred me to a eye clinic for cataract surgery. This past Wednesday night, I went up for prayer to ask the Lord to remove the cataracts. On Thursday morning, I woke up and the cataracts were gone. All praise and honor to the Lord Jesus for his grace and mercy. Amen. Praise the Lord. You had a good testimony tonight. Amen. Urgent prayer requests for Sister Mary Beth Holloway. The Lord knows all about that need. We just committed unto the Lord. Sister Janet Paynees asking that we would uh pray for two of her grandsons who lost their coworker to suicide and the family uh has really been hit hard and pray for all that's concerned in that. So, we want to remember that prayer request tonight that the Lord would be mindful. Brother Greg Robbins is going to have surgery to remove his eye on Friday. He's been in a lot of pain due to his eye. Please pray that everything goes well. Please remember Sister Shirley in prayer as well. So, we certainly want to pray for those folks tonight. Brother Smith and Sister Diana Ward are not feeling well, unable to be in service. I want to pray for them tonight. Brother Tyler and Sister Caitlyn Gagnan uh sent in a prayer request. She's having some difficulty with her pregnancy and they're just asking without going into a lot of detail, they're just asking that God would be mindful and let everything work out to her good. So, we just commit all that unto the Lord tonight. He's more than able to meet every need among us. Do you believe that tonight with all your heart? And then brother Bisc will be on this coming Sunday. I don't know exact the hour or the time or anything like that, but I I do know that it will be Sunday. So, we certainly want to pray for that family, that church family, that the Lord would just be mindful of all of those folks. And uh, Brother Bisco was a was a great hero of the faith. I believe that with all of my heart. So, we want to just remember all those folks in prayer. Uh, brother Michael says, \"If you want to help with the fall festival, signup sheets are in the library.\" So, remember that. And personal and business changes to the directory will be accepted in the library until Wednesday, October the 15th. So remember that all those announcements tonight. You have an unspoken prayer request tonight you'd like for this group to pray about. Could we stand to our feet? Let's sing that again. The course of that. I'm amazed that you love me. Are you amazed his love for you tonight? Somebody say it's the truth. Anyway, give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight if you love me with all your heart. I'm amazed that you love me.

Appreciate Brother Fred Perry, don't we? &gt;&gt; Good brother. Amen. Dave. Amen. Appreciate you. &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful to be in the house of the Lord. No greater place to be than right here at this time. We could have been anywhere, but the Lord chose us and destinated us to be right here. So let's bow our heads and go to him in prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, we once again we've been given the opportunity to come and sit in the house of God. Oh, it thrills my heart, Lord, to just to be able to say that I could come and sit in the house of God in this day and the hour that we live when such things going on around the world. We can say that we have a king that knelt before a cross in humility, but the father lifted him up in honor. And Lord, we want to do that tonight. We want to lift our hearts to you. Oh, that you could cleanse us, Lord, and help us, Lord, in these times that we have, Lord, our sicknesses and and pains and uh just the way human life is, Lord. But we know we are inheritors of miracles. We've heard one tonight, Lord. And we are inheritors of faith. We are the inheritors of all things only because you went down in humility and raised in honor. And we give you the glory and the power, Lord. We give you our lives, Lord. All things belong to you. And we're not here to fight for anything else. But what we want to fight for, Lord, is our surrender. That we could surrender our hearts and surrender our lives totally for you, Lord. Now, bless the service tonight, Lord. Bless the man of God as he comes. Let wisdom flow from his lips, Lord, that feeds our hearts, Lord, and gives us that uplifting power, Lord, that we need. fill us tonight, Lord. Whatever need we have, Lord, we know that we could come before you and you would answer those things, Lord. We have faith in you, Lord. Now, bless us, Lord, and help us, Lord, as we honor you tonight, Lord, with singing and praise. And let our lips be full of worship and the fruits of our lips be honored before you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Ushers, if you want to come tonight, receive the evening offering, you give us unto the Lord. Once again, if you're a vist, God bless you. Now, what if you knew that tonight was your last night that you ever get to be in church and you'd ever get this opportunity to worship? &gt;&gt; Would you make it a good one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you know it ain't? &gt;&gt; Let's sing with everything we got tonight. We want to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth, right? Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" Give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight. Let's sing. After all this life is over. After all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted. And I stand upon the mountain top topped so tall looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing.

You can be seated tonight. Give our singers a nice hand. Sister Adessa, if you want to sing, then the old people will sing. And then brother Caos, you want to sing? [Music] There is a blood that cost a life that paid my way. And death it price. And when it fell down from the cross, my sins were gone. My sins for God. There is a grave that tried to hide this precious blood that gave me life. And in three days he breathed again and rose to stand. in my defense. And so I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he drives every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves, to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you. [Music] There is a blood. His side is the blind. [Music] It heals the sick, the lonely fight. [Music] It has the power to free the bound has chains a fall [Music] upon the ground. Oh, pour it out to cleanse my soul and let it liquid. Gloryy flow [Music] because he lives to make me whole high. owe my life. [Music] I owe my all. And so I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he tries every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to provail that he's coming back for you. Oh, what can wash away my sins? Nothing. Oh nothing. And what can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood. Nothing but the blood. So I come to tell you he's alive. to tell you that he tries every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you. [Music] Mary is a blood [Music] that cost a life that paid my way. Death price. [Music] [Applause] Here's another song that uh Sister Betty wrote a long time ago. It seemed like the only people that request us to sing is other old people. I just don't get that. But that's the way it is. As long as you old people want to hear us sing, I guess we'll try to sing for you. Hope this song will bless you. It says, \"I'll soon be gone.\" Amen. [Music] When the darkness of this life is filled with sadness and our hearts are often troubled deep within. I stop and think of how our God looked down upon us. And by faith, he's lifted up where I can see. I'll soon be &gt;&gt; I'll soon be gone. It won't be long till I fly till I home in the sky. There'll be no fears. He'll dry my tears. One of these days with faith so strong, I'll soon be. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know the light of his presence is now with us. I have seen the amber light so bright and strong. It's brightest ray out shines the light of morning sunshine. I know is God assuring me I'll soon be gone. &gt;&gt; I'll soon I'll soon be gone. It won't be long till I fly to my home in the sky. There will be no fear. He'll dry my tears. One of these days with faith so strong, I'll soon be gone. One of these days with faith so strong I'll soon be gone. [Applause] I love to hear them sing. &gt;&gt; It's awesome to, you know, I grew up in Kentucky, a little bitty single wide trailer church, and I heard all these songs. Sister Geraldine, Sister Jackie, or Sister Betty. And you know, you you you hear the songs, but when you get to meet the person, you really see the life that made that song. It's just it's it's incredible. I love it. I pray this is a blessing. [Music] It's easy to bless you when the valleyies behind me. It's easy to trust you when my world is not unwinding. But this is the darkest midnight that I have ever seen. So I will stand my ground, lift my hands to you and sing. Before the prayer is answered. Before the battle's won. Before this trial is over. Before the healing comes. I will choose to trust you. I will bless you, Lord. I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before in the lonely days of silence. [Music] When the waiting gets old, [Music] I've found a flame of worship. [Music] Keeps my heart from growing cold. You've always been so faithful when I can't do my part. Even in my worn out weakness, nothing changes who you are. Before the prayer is answered, before the battle's won, before this trial is over, before the healing comes, I will choose to trust you. I will bless you, Lord. Lord, I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before you ever for me. You knew I'd be here on my knees. You're the one who's fighting for me. And you know where this will lead. Before the prayer is answered, before the battle's won, before this trial is over, before the healing comes, I will choose to trust you. I will bless you Lord. I will praise you after. I will praise you before. [Music] No, I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of praise we want to have, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Not just wait till the prayer is even answered, but give him praise before it ever gets answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read tonight Genesis 24 verse 58. Trust everybody's doing well. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Fighting the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Winning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not near as many of you winning. Are you winning? &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord. That's what we want to hear. Let's read together. And they called Rebecca and said unto her, \"Will thou go with this man?\" And she said, \"I will go.\" And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. Won't you notice the order? Who came first? [Music] &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Rebecca. Ah. And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. So you see the going away is not brother Brandham going to have a private resurrection and then brother Brandham's going to raise all the dead and we're going to have a tent meeting &gt;&gt; and people's going to get the Holy Ghost and &gt;&gt; that's contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the final voice of the final age? &gt;&gt; The bride is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. And they blessed Rebecca and said unto her, \"Thou art our sister. Be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.\" And Rebecca arose and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and went his way. I want to speak to you tonight on the bride's dowy. How many like to be remembered as we go before the Lord? Aren't you glad that our God, if there would be millions of people praying at this very instant, some need healing, some need financial blessing, some need a job, some need this, this, this. He could hear all of them at one time. and be sure and get your name on your package and then your neighbor wouldn't have to bring you a package because they delivered your package at their door and you got their package. But our God is so mighty and so wonderful that he can hear all of that at once and send each answer right directly on time to the right individual. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, we so so love you tonight. We're just so thankful for everything that you mean to us, Lord. Oh God, as we gather here, Lord, it's not to magnify man, magnify a system, magnify some brotherhood, but we are here to worship and magnify you, Father. And we realize the more that we learn to do that, the more you will pull us into yourself. I find it to be phenomenal that the more we give to you, the more of yourself you give to us. I'm so grateful for that. It's no wonder to me that Satan has so many of the preachers out in religious worlds today just focusing constantly on the people, the people, the people, the people, the people. Because the devil knows if they ever magnify you and ever see who you are, what a thing it does. So I pray we would not be guilty of that. Lord, open our eyes tonight. That we can see you and the magnitude of your love by the gifts and the great treasures that you bestow upon your people. You saw all the hands are uplifted. We're just asking you that you'd be mindful of us tonight, Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. The word sill you him. Sill you him. That's a Hebrew word for dowry. For us as westerners, the dowy doesn't really mean much of anything. But let me read it to you so you'll understand it. The dowy was given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life. It's also part of her inheritance. Let me read it to you again. Given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life, part of her inheritance. Now the dowy, the Bible here in Genesis of course doesn't mention it, but Rebecca actually would have been given a dowy not from Abraham, not from Isaac, but from her paternal and maternal parents, of course. And it would have included part of the fortune as far as what they had. It may have included things old and things new. Things that were more of a family inheritance, things that would have been a treasure to them and them only. Other people would look at and say, \"I wouldn't have that piece of junk. I don't know what that even is.\" But to that family, it would have been something very special. Now, she's going to leave with this man and depart. Never come back. Actually, never see them again. And yet they want to give her something from her parents that will be able to identify her in that lineage even though she will be so very far away. So the dowy was very very important. Now it's not just something in the past for some some marriages and some cultures and so on. They still do the same thing today. So they would give that then to the daughter because the daughter did not receive a divided portion of the inheritance when it come to land, cattle, sheep, oxen and so on. It was divided among the sons. And you remember one of the men in the Old Testament whenever Moses was there that they had to have a special hearing because the man had no sons. And then they went to God and God said, \"Well, because there is no sons, let the daughters have a part of it.\" But that was not the norm. The norm was that the sons would get it and the eldest son would get a double portion. So if you had seven sons, the inheritance was divided by eight, which meant the eldest son got two parts. But here now the dowy was something totally for the female only. No bridegroom got a dowy. That was not his. It was for the bride only. You know, as I begin to look at this, I've realized that the bride of Christ also has a dowy, something given to her from who? Not from her husband, but from her father. Now, we're in a very strange relationship as far as when it comes to our relation to deity. Now, let me explain it to you this way. Actually, our father had a son. Now that son was only a human embodiment or a human tabernacle by which the father could get into and create a blood and shed that blood so that he could redeem his people. Now that father is that great being of course that is light and his spirit and he was not a man but he gave to the world. He gave also to us of course his only begotten son. Now remember only begotten at that time. So he was the only begotten son at that time. And what was that? It was a human temple by which the father could dwell in in order to redeem and pay the price to bring us back. So here he plays two parts. So spirit God is our father and then the father himself gives birth to a son when before the foundation of the world but at that time he wasn't even a human he was the logos. So then he condescends from being the logos to becoming a human being. Now but we still have this wonderful relationship with spirit God which is our father. Now remember the body the human body of the Lord Jesus is not your father. &gt;&gt; The human body of the Lord Jesus is not your father. As a matter of fact he wasn't his own father. The human body was a body of time that God created and it was his own body and he called it sunship. Now watch in though believers then are given gifts by the father to equip them for their new life and for their journey as they're heading to be able to meet their bridegroom. Read with me in Matthew 7 11. If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your father, now notice the position from which these gifts are coming from? They say, \"What difference does it make?\" Oh, it makes all the difference in the world. You see, or if you were here and you were a gentile and you would have called out, \"Son of David, son of David, have mercy on me.\" You know what? you would have got absolutely nothing &gt;&gt; because you were claiming the wrong dispensational title. &gt;&gt; So you could only get from God and remember the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God. So that's why they can scream the name of Jesus in the day we're living in and hardly get nothing out of it. But it will be revealed in what he said the thunders. So when the voice of God makes his message known in every day, it will be the word interpreted for the age that the elect of God live in, they will be caught by that word. The others will pass right on by, join church, join religion, become religious, all that sort of thing, and miss it a million miles. But we don't want to do that, do we? &gt;&gt; Now notice then where the source of these great gifts come from. How much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? How many like to know tonight what your dowy a little bit of it includes? Well, if it's yours, wouldn't you want to know your sisters whenever you got married? Now, if your father would have said, \"Now, honey, whenever you get married, daddy's got something for you.\" I'll tell you what, daddy is going to give you a a surprise. It's going to be a gift. And your daddy was a wealthy man and you know, a man that was equipped to do it. And you'd be anxious, of course, thinking, \"Oh my, what's daddy going to give me? Is he going to give us a house? Is he going to give us $1,000, $10,000? What's dad going to give you?\" Well, let me just share with you tonight what our heavenly father has already given to us. It ain't going to be $1,000. It ain't going to be $10,000. As a matter of fact, it will be riches that you can't even think about without God helping you to do it. There will be so much of it that God will give to us just in this life. If this life contains so many beneficial blessings and great things of what he wants us to do, I cannot imagine what the world that is to come is going to be like. Now, let's look at and we'll start from the basic foundation of where we come to him. And let's look at being forgiven. Oh, aren't you glad you're forgiven tonight? Romans 4:7 saying, \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered, whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.\" Now, think of that old life that you used to live. Now, the downside is that us of human beings that we can still remember the wrongs that we've done. We can remember how bad they were, how terrible they were, how awful we felt when we done them. But there's one great thing I know. Our God remembers none of them against us. Thank God. Ephesians 4:32. And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ sake hath forgiven you. Now, this is why we are forgiven. It's not because we deserve it. It's not because we held our hands a certain way or we said certain words when we pray. God forgave you for Christ's sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the church said &gt;&gt; as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Colossians 2:13. And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your hearts, has he quickened together not apart from him, but with him? Has he quickened together with him? You mean to tell me that I was already quickened before I was ever even born? You was already identified in the quickening power of God before you ever draw one breast in your human body. How can that be? What if Adam lost my inheritance before I was born? The second Adam regained my inheritance before I was born. Come on, somebody. Now, you realize it's the work of God and the grace of God that's done it. And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all, oh, praise God, all trespasses. Colossians 2:14, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us. Now, I want you to listen to this. I was so curious about these words. So, I've done a little research and got to looking at it and I found the meanings of this verse. I thought it's so awesome. I wanted to share it with you. The burdens, some requirements of the law have been abolished. And of course, it's superseded by the death of our Lord Jesus. But what it leads up to is the word handwriting signifies an acknowledgment signed by us that we owe a certain amount. Now the handwriting that was against us, we actually had to acknowledge it ourself. So here was all this debt. Here was all this that we've done and we had to acknowledge it and we had to take our own handwriting as it were and acknowledge I am guilty of this and this and this and this and this and God in that sense made us acknowledge it. You say, \"When, Brother Donnie, when did that happen?\" When you come to an altar and you begin to acknowledge, \"Lord God, I'm a low down rotten sinner. I've drunk. I've lied. I've stole. I've cheated. I've done this. Don't you understand what you was doing?\" Your own personal handwriting will say, \"I'm a sinner. I'm no good. I'm no count. If God don't help me, there ain't no hope for me.\" And God said, \"All right, now that you've signed it and you admit the bill is too large for you, this is what I am going to do for you in exchange.\" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. So he took all that we did by our personal acknowledgment and he took it from us and he took that oh glory to God that agreement that we said yep I deserve it I ain't no good I ain't worth even living oh my and he said I'll tell you what I'm going to do now I'm going to take that and I'm going to nail it to the cross what a peculiar way to say that remember it was the Lord for Jesus who was nailed to the cross and yet your sins being identified as being lost and wretched and he took that and nailed it to the cross. Why? Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, he who knew no sin became sin that we might become the very righteousness of God in him. Listen little bride, this is part of your gallery. This is something that even after you get saved, it gives you hope because guess what? You're still going to fall flat on your face. You're still going to make mistakes. You're still going to mess up. &gt;&gt; But can't that same God who buried, oh, hallelujah, that died and buried and rose again? Cannot that same God that took that handwriting that was against you forgive you now to your sons and daughters of God? Oh, praise be to God. So, here is this massive sum on the bill that I owed all of this debt. My body, my soul, my temperament, my character, everything that I was was absolutely obligated to that. So, it brought me under the state of condemnation. The only thing he wanted me to do was acknowledge it. Just acknowledge it that you're lost, that you're wretched, that you cannot do it without me. And I will take it for you. I become that for you. But it will not do you any good until you acknowledge that you need a savior. Oh, no matter how great he is, how wonderful he is, he can only save you if you'll let him. He can only heal you tonight if you'll let him. He can only encourage you tonight. I wish somebody would preach with me. He can only encourage you. He can only lift you up. He can only be your peace, your joy, your satisfaction if you'll receive it from him. But if you won't let him, he can't do it. All of heaven, hallelujah, is at your disposal there. If you'll call upon his name and say, \"Lord, I am a member of your bride. It's part of my dowy.\" A dowry is not for you in the millennium. It's not for you at the marriage supper of the lamb. It's given to you for your journey from here to there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Having spoiled principalities and powers. Oh, I love this. He made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it. Triumphing over them in it. Right in the middle of it. He triumphed over hell. 1 John 2:12, I wrote unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. Do you understand that? It brings glory to his name for every sinner that will accept him as their savior. Praise the Lord. Now, remember, of course, friends, that many folks will be saved that will not be bribed. Oh, of course there will. There'll be all kinds of people that'll be saved because they're trusting Jesus as their savior. I don't want him just to be my savior. I want him to be my Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people, oh yes, oh Lord, please save me. Save me from hell. But Lord, don't you tell me what I can live now. Don't you tell me what I can wear and I can't wear and I can't go here and I can't go there and now. Lord, don't tell me that. Well, you say they want him as savior, but they don't want him as Lord, but the bride wants him as Lord. I said the bride wants him as her Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice another gift now that the father wanted to impart to his children was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh my, how we appreciate the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, I'm not talking about being baptized in your spirit, but I'm talking about your soul becoming illuminated by the very breath of God. The same breath of God that breathed into Adam was the very same breath of God that told the disciples and St. John receive ye the Holy Ghost and he breathed on them and a few days later the breast come into the upper room. &gt;&gt; So it was a delayed reaction but they caught up with it. Now the same Lord Jesus notice what he says in St. John 14:16. I will pray the father. I here's our Isaac now. I will pray to the father. Abraham in the type. I will pray to the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. Now remember the disciples were hearing some of these things for their first time. And they were hearing talking about leaving and going away. I'm not sure they didn't want him to go away. But Jesus tells them here in St. John 14, it is expedient for you that I go away because if I don't go away, the comforter cannot come. What is it another person of the Godhead? No, it's actually the same person of the Godhead but in a different manifestation. One that the church could receive. We could not receive the corporal body of Jesus in our body. &gt;&gt; Well, if I got the corporal body of Jesus in my body, then none the rest you ain't got the Holy Ghost. or if you got it, I ain't got the Holy Ghost. But what's he going to do? Change himself. Now God is a spirit and God gave birth to a spirit son, which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now notice Jesus saying that I will pray the father and the father will give you a comforter. Notice even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive. So a person that comes up to receive salvation, they cannot receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; According to Jesus, &gt;&gt; I guess he knew more about it than preachers. What do you think? &gt;&gt; The world cannot receive the Holy Ghost, but the world can receive salvation. &gt;&gt; But not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is for a vessel that has come through a process. A sinner comes straight from the world. They come to the Lord Jesus, receive him as their savior. The process starts and many of them never go any further than being saved. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. So, the Holy Ghost is not just for saved people. It's for people who are saved and sanctified and they're cleansed and they're ready to receive a filling on the inside. So God don't bring a sinner up to the altar and that sinner smoking, drinking, lying, committing adultery, got all them demons inside their body and God filled that person with the Holy Ghost. Are you kidding me? God sharing that soul with demons. &gt;&gt; No way. So that person has to go through a purging, a cleansing, a sanctification process to receive the Holy Ghost. And who's Jesus speaking this to? to men who are finalizing their stage of sanctification, even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him ought not and knowice. Now notice so you mean you can't receive him if you don't know who he is. &gt;&gt; So what if you're taught he's a third person? &gt;&gt; Well, that ain't who he is. And if you don't see him as he is, &gt;&gt; oh, brother Tony, what about you? What about you? I turned Pentecost. Did you have the Holy Ghost? Oh, yeah. I had a baptism, &gt;&gt; but I didn't have the person. &gt;&gt; I shouted. I run. I jumped. I spoke in tongues. I preached. I prayed for sick and watch them get well. All kinds of things. And still preach false doctrine. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I was ignorant to it. I wasn't intentionally doing it. I was blind. Well, if I'd had the Holy Ghost in my soul according to Jesus, wouldn't that spirit of truth led me to the truth? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him. For he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; Who's he talking about? The Lord Jesus himself, not his body, the pillar of fire coming back to break itself up. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you one thing, it's quite awesome. If you look in question answers 64, and you'll find the prophet of God saying, \"The same pillar of fire is on the earth today anointing sons of God to bring the word to the bride.\" It's absolutely phenomenal quote. Notice in St. John 14:18, I will not leave you comfortless. I &gt;&gt; will come to you. &gt;&gt; So you mean it's Jesus? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in the upper room was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. But the Bible said that they saw tongues of fire. They didn't see the corporal body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What was it? spirit son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice little bride. Oh, let's open our little diary package tonight and see what's on the inside. What do you say? Here's another little thing that God wanted to give to to his daughter, the bride, who's going to be married to his son, the word. You see, the whole family is a word family. And God can designate what portion of the word that he wants the son to fulfill. He designates what portion of the word that he wants the bride to fulfill. And then he also designates the portion of the word that he himself will fulfill as father god. As father god's spirit form he could not die for us because the spirit cannot die. As father god he had no blood. So what did he do? He took that portion of the word and created a son and lived inside that son, that human body. Hallelujah. In order to pay the price, oh that we could be set free. &gt;&gt; Notice St. John again 14:27. Peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you. How many of you all tonight will be honest and say you need more peace in your life? &gt;&gt; I understand we're living in a troubled world, are we not? &gt;&gt; We're living in a world when people will not even disagree politically or on, you know, different values of this and that and the other without trying to kill you. I'm sure you heard again today there was another uh sniper and they uh had shot at some ICE agents and it's it's the time that we're living at. Well, brother Darn, you think about that? Of course I do. My own life's been threatened many times. Do I think about it? Sure I think about it. But you know what I told Carol the other day? We can't live under the spirit of fear and thinking all, you know, oh my goodness, I can't get out. I can't go here. I can't go there. I will not live that way. God does not want me to live that way. How can I not live that way? Peace. &gt;&gt; Peace. I believe he brought me on the earth to serve his purpose. There ain't enough devils in hell. There ain't enough 30 odd sixes, 270s, whether they're Remington or whether be Magnum. There ain't enough cannons. There ain't enough whatever more to take me out of here until God is done with me. Come on, somebody. If I didn't believe that, I'd be mighty discouraged tonight. The way I look at it, if I'm flying on a 747 or whatever and that thing crashes, if it ain't the will of God for me to go, I'll be the only survivor out in the middle of the Himalayan mountains or wherever it is. And they're thinking, \"How in the world did that man live? I'll tell you how he lived because God wasn't done with him yet.\" And you and I need to get away from the fear that the devil controls our life and the devil numbers our days. No, he don't. He didn't bring me on the earth. He can't take me off the earth until God's done. Hallelujah. I am God almighty son and you are his child, his son or daughter. And the devil has to back off because God is the one who's in control of our lives. &gt;&gt; Y'all forgive me tonight. I'm feeling a little Church of Christy. Amen. &gt;&gt; My peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled. Neither let it be afraid. So you mean you and I have some control over our heart being troubled &gt;&gt; and being afraid. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Romans 1:7. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints, grace to you and peace from both Abraham and Isaac, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, to all that be in Rome. I I met a brother, let me share this with you. I met a brother in Switzerland and he come up to me. He couldn't speak English very well, but he had a younger guy there. He spoke English really well and he said, \"This is my this is my pastor and he he wants to invite you to Rome.\" So, I got a church in Rome. So, this this pastor, big tall guy, he told him, he said, \"Tell him to come and preach where Paul preached Rome.\" Well, I may never go to Rome to preach, but this scripture right here, even though I'm not a Roman, it's got my name wrote all over it. &gt;&gt; What about us? Some of you Indiana people, Tennessee people, Arkansas people, is this scripture just good for the Roman brothers and sisters, or is it good for us as a people of God? to all that be in Rome. Notice how he directs to beloved. Beloved of God, not just loved, not just love. Beloved is a higher degree of love, special one who is worthy of grace. Chew on that a while. Oh my. Beloved of God, called to be saints. You're not just called to be saved. You're not just called to come up through the tribulation period. You're called to be saints of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Romans chapter 5 verse one. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace, amen, with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not peace from God now in this application, but peace with God. Why would he say it that way? Cuz we were born at war with God. &gt;&gt; We were born at war. Oh my. Aren't you glad you ain't at war with God no more? Oh my. I'd rather be at war with this world. I'd rather be at war with the devil. I'd rather be at war with demons every day of my life than to be at war with God. At one time, I was at war with God. All of you were too. You might as well say, \"Amen.\" But how in the world did I ever make peace? It was not me that made peace. It was my Isaac. It was my Isaac that paid the price. And he said, \"You don't have to no longer be at war with my father. I will make and tear down the middle wall of petition. And I will bring you both together, Father God and man. &gt;&gt; And I will be your shalom.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 15:13. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. Wow. Fill you with all joy and peace. I'm a believer. I'm a believer. Well, do you have joy and peace and you're believing? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm the happiest person in the world. Well, let your face know about it. Rest of us, too. Okay. Oh, I'm so glad I'm saved. Thank God. I hope I die today. I'm so sick of this life. I'm so sick of it. And you got all joy and peace. You sorry dog. You ain't telling the truth. The devil's robbed you. Your diary is sat there. I mean, you got gold and riches and treasures and saffron and you've got needles of purple and blue and all kinds of things piling out of your diary chest. And you're sitting there all puffed up like a bullfog eating buckshot. And you're sitting there sad and down and depressed and weary. It's time that we rise up pride and say, \"I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm sick of the devil stealing my joy. I'm sick of the devil stealing my children. I'm sick of the devil interrupting our home. Oh, hallelujah. I am grateful tonight that we have peace with God. &gt;&gt; Now, the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. Brother Mike, I just seen you. That's the sneakiness preacher right there I've ever seen in my life. that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost. Oh, Philippians 4:7. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. The peace of God which passeth all understanding. Notice what's going to keep your hearts and your mind. The peace of God, brother Malca. That's your ability to quote scripture. Well, I I pay my tithes and and I go to church and and I pray for brother Donnie once every every now and then whenever I think about it and and I do kind deeds and I do this and no Lord, I ain't got no peace. That's not what that's not what does it. It's the power of God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Colossians 3:15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Look at the meaning of this word &gt;&gt; to be an umpire. to decide, determine, direct, &gt;&gt; control. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You mean peace? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Peace. The peace of God can be like an umpire. All right. So, the picture gets ready. &gt;&gt; He's doing them finger and all that whatever they do back there. Boy, he ready on. He whining her up. He's getting ready on. Boy, he sold that thing today. He boy said bow and the devil I I mean the pitcher said why he he struck out I that old boy it ain't in him to to hit a home run. Oh but it is. You see it's in us to hit a home run. Every member of the bride has a built-in mechanism to have a home run. Why? We come from home and we're going back and we're running on the way back. So we are doing a home run. We're not squatting. We're not sitting. We're not going to be pushed in a wheelchair. And they ain't going to roll us in on a stretcher somewhere. But the bride's doing a home run. So get out of our way, devil. And the peace of God is going to be the umpire in my heart. I may feel down, but the umpire says it's joy unspeakable and full of glory, but I don't feel it. You sure it wasn't a strike? I mean, I'm going to sit down if you want me to. I think I struck out. I think I I think I struck out. He said, \"You knucklehead you didn't ain't had but one throw at you. I don't know where you figured you struck out.\" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So the devil winds up another one. &gt;&gt; Boy, here comes that ball at 100, whatever it is. And you just know for get I'm struck out. I'm struck out now. And you're saying, \"Wow, you mean I'm still saved? Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wish we could let the umpire rule in our hearts.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you get up in the morning and you check your phone, you go look at all the texts and all the emails and, you know, all this and that and other all filled with all that negative stuff. Sometimes I wish uh some of us didn't even have a smartphone cuz it sure don't make us too much smarter, does it? Before we ever leave the house, we're so down and wore out and depressed and so much going on in this crazy world that we're living in and we let our phone control our hearts instead of the peace of God. You let your phone be your umpire. You let Fox News be your umpire. You let CNN be your umpire. I'll tell you one thing, you're letting the devil rob you, friends. Let the peace of God be your umpire. And listen to what he's saying. If he says walk, walk. [Applause] Well, the umpire is truthful. And the truth of it is tonight, he's telling us, some of us, that we're close to striking out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you done struck twice. You better listen to what the umpire is saying. He said, \"Boy, you better let me have control of your life. You better let me have control of your emotions. You better let me have control of your life. And let me be the umpire. I'll make the calls for you. And it's not dry calls. It's calls with power. &gt;&gt; If he says you're happy, well, I guess you ought to act like it. &gt;&gt; Let the peace of God rule &gt;&gt; in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body. And be ye &gt;&gt; sad and depressed. &gt;&gt; Thank God. What? &gt;&gt; Thankful. &gt;&gt; Thankful. Ain't that awesome? Now, if that wasn't enough, well, let me look over there. What is that? Oh my goodness. Let me reach down in there and pull out of that dowy box. Oh my goodness. Can that be true? Yeah. This little this little item in your diary is called we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10, for we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe God makes junk? &gt;&gt; Does God specialize in trash? Does God specialize in good for nothings? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All of us are known by our works. &gt;&gt; A sister that can bake and cook and you know, no matter what, if it's a country cook or whatever it is, she know that. Oh yeah, we're having a dinner. Be sure now and get sister so and so's beans. I'm telling you what, them beans are to die for. If Sister Angel Smith makes that chocolate cake, you stand right there in line. You get your cake. Somebody's going to bring that delish stuff and this and that and the other. Why? You're identified. If Sister Barbara brings some of them black cookies, oh man, alive. Them no bakes. I mean, get up there and get it. Boy, whenever we go to heaven, our fall festival here in a little bit. And some of y'all get in line. Boy, I'm going here. I'm going there. Oh yeah, brother so and so does that. They make them deer nuggets and they cut that up and they wrap that in that bacon. I'll tell you what, I'm slobbering right now thinking about it. Why? Because the worst. Now, what if it tasted like tar? What if it tasted like tarpentine with a little bit of sulfur and a little bit of apples, you know, asphalt on the side and you dip it over an oil? You know, you'd say, \"Don't never go to that booth. That stuff will make you sicker than a dog.\" You're identified by your works. You're identified by what you put out. Almighty God's reputation. If he does not produce a bride that is like himself, &gt;&gt; he is an absolute liar and failure. But I ain't worried about that happening. Are you? My God don't make no junk. He don't make no trash. He don't make hallelujah something that he cannot trust. My God will complete his work. [Applause] You see that stone column right there? That's my workmanship. You see this one? That's brother Dave Swanson's workmanship. Now, you study the way they're laid and you'll see I've got a style and he has a style. The sign out on the road, my style. Simon in the in the the fireplace over there, mine and his together. So you see, God is identified by his workmanship. So on the day of Pentecost, the great contractor come down himself and he said, \"Boy, I'm tell you one thing. Now these old boys, they're they're something. These boys are something, but just wait till I get done with them. Just wait till I get work done working on Peter. He is going to make me a fire brand like the devil ain't never heard nothing about it before. You wait till John gets the Holy Ghost. Him and James. I mean, they're the sons of thunder. I named them that. But boy, wait till they get the Holy Ghost. It'll turn John from a son of thunder into love itself. It'll totally transform John. It'll change Thaddius. It'll even change Mary. It'll change them all. Why? Because they are going to Lord have mercy. They're going to be my workmanship. And when I get done with them, even the angels of God will circle the earth with their heads bowed as they look at my work. [Music] So the astronomers say that there's over one setillion stars in the visible universe. So that's a one with 21 zeros. That's quite impressive, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I mean, I know y'all know the word septanian all the time. That's how much money you've got, right? &gt;&gt; If you're playing Monopoly, maybe. But that was not the height of his creation. The height was when he said, \"Let us make man in our image.\" And the prophet tells us that God wanted a world filled with sons and daughters. Now, he knew when he made this little blue dot and put it out in this Milky Way, and he knew that it would be one of the smallest. Had it been just a bit closer to the sun, it been too hot for life to survive. &gt;&gt; Had it been just a little farther away, it would have been too cold. But he placed it right in what they call the habitable zone. Habitable zone. So, they're spending all kinds of money trying to find another planet like this one. I I'll go ahead and tell them. I mean, NASA won't listen to me anyway, you know, but they're not going to find one. &gt;&gt; The Earth is the only planet whose name is in the book of life, &gt;&gt; which is the Bible. Jupiter, Neptune, Mars, Saturn, none of them are there. Why don't God throw this earth away and make another one? He cannot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this earth is his attribute. &gt;&gt; And remember, he come on the earth and took his own body out of the 16 elements &gt;&gt; of this earth. And the Lord God never had a permanent flesh body until Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now that body sits at the right hand of the spirit thrown universe there to make intercession for us. For we are his workmanship created. I was at the stone yard Monday getting some stone for a little bit of landscaping I've been doing over here at the church. And the guy there that he knows me and I bought quite a bit from him and he said, ' Do you know this man? I said, 'N no. And I I was over there picking up rocks one at a time. So this guy, they picked up a pallet and scooted it through on his truck and loaded it on the truck. Well, the guy that owned that truck, he come over to me and he said, \"I was going to tell you they do load them up. I said, \"Yeah, sir.\" And I was going to ask you, \"Was you holding your breath the whole time that's loading them up in the back of that brand new Ford truck of yours?\" And then the guy suddenly has said, \"Oh, he comes here all the time talking about me.\" He said, \"He's one picky fell. He goes out there in that yard and he picks them up one at a time and looks at him.\" Well, you see, I have something in my mind &gt;&gt; that I want it to look like. So, I finished most of it for the most part today. So, I was up here taking pictures of it and sending it to Carol. So, I get my phone down like this. I get as people pass by and said, \"That's the preacher.\" You imagine how the people are that go to church there. He's out there taking pictures of dirt. So this one had little green specks and that one had little silver and this one had this and that one had that. And I sent Carol a little caption down at the bottom of it. Handpicked rocks. And she answered back, \"That's the best kind.\" So you see that is a mirror of my work. That's my workmanship. Each of you are known by your word. Then how would we ever believe that God would have to settle for a faulty, flawed church that barely makes it to church once every now and then, and they can't quit overcoming sin and lying and all kinds of filthy habits. And the great creator has to settle for that. Well, I guess I just have to settle for that. &gt;&gt; No, sir. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. We are his making. And these virtues that we've been talking about for several several weeks, that's the creation unfolding in our lives. You see, we are his making. We are created by him and for him. Now, it's more than just the general sense of rocks and trees and cattle and all that sort of thing. But this is a new creation. Now, look at the word created. I about had a spell when I looked at this. We're created in Christ Jesus. And it means to make habitable. habitable to people, a place, a region, an island. Hence to found a city, a colony, a state, to form, shape, to completely change or transform. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for what? What? &gt;&gt; Good works. You see, this is why a person that really has the Holy Ghost, it's it's just as easy for them to do good works as it is an an evil person to do bad works. &gt;&gt; That's just their nature. Because their old nature has been annihilated and the workmanship of the almighty God has been recreated in their soul. You're quite something. You know that if you are born again, you are quite something. &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Oh my. God ordained you and I to live a holy life. And the church said God ordained us to live a life of holiness &gt;&gt; and purity and separation. &gt;&gt; Now the word here that that Paul used to means to prepare beforehand is to predestinate or to appoint before it. It includes the idea of a previous determination or an arrangement beforehand for securing a certain result. &gt;&gt; Ah, so if you want a certain result and you're dealing with old dirt bags, you better predetermine. &gt;&gt; There ain't no telling what you'll come out if you don't. So God said, \"Now this is going to be the greatness and the height of my creation. I will put my sons and daughters in mortal flesh. I will put them in that oil. I I I will put them in that and I will predestinate them. It is in my being. It is in my being to give me a purpose, a reason to be.\" I'll let you think on that for a minute. The previous preparation of the divine intention. You see, and Paul said that we should walk in them. Watch again. Ephesians chapter 2:1. Wherefore remember that ye being in time past, Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision, that at that time ye were without Christ. Oh my, remember that. I don't ever want to go back to that again. &gt;&gt; Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. Oh my. and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to preach to you sometime on these two words, but now that's what I was, but now. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, &gt;&gt; who has made both one Jew and Gentile, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us. He is our peace. So the Lord Jesus died for both Jew and Gentile to make in them one new man. The new man, the new creation is what? The church. They could never do it under the Abrahamic covenant of the flesh. They could never do it under the covenant with Isaac, the covenant of Jacob. So it had to be a new covenant. A star would arise out of Jacob. A star would arise out of Jacob. not a man, not that would come down through Isaac's lineage, but a star from heaven would arise out of Jacob and he would have the scepter cuz the scepter would come and it would be whatever he would bring forth. Oh, glory to God. And he would come forth from between the feet. And what would he do? He would make in one new man. One new man called what? Jew, Gentile, the church. Oh Jesus became our shalom who has made both one form one church out of two different types of people Jews and Gentiles by abolishing the law of the covenant that was given by Moses which is only temporary only to last for a while. Notice in verse 15, chapter 2, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man. So here he comes to take within himself the Jewish law, the Jews take within himself and merge the Gentiles in himself. And then once they come in him, the product out of that the two become one &gt;&gt; called what? The church. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. For to make it himself of twain one new man, so making peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in the one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby, and came and preached peace to you who were a far off, and to them that were nigh, Jew and Gentile. And through him we both have access. Here you go, little bride. Here are some more of your little dowy. Access the act of bringing to approach to God. That relationship with God whereby we are acceptable to him and have assurance that he is favorably disposed towards him, &gt;&gt; permitted to approach God through his name. Aren't you glad tonight? So here the Greek word here relates the word that Paul chose to use was someone seeking an audience of a great personage and an officer would go between the person seeking the audience and the one they're seeking the audience from. It was a person that was greatly trusted and one that had authority. And this deputy, this magistrate, this person mediator in our state would go between them and say, \"Sir, he wants to see you. He wants to see you.\" And I I want to sue you and say that I I think that you should see him. I think you should take time with him or with her and to help him that I I think that that they are worthy of it. They are worthy of it. Oh, children, they are worthy of it. They are worthy of it. You imagine the book of Revelation, the worthy one saying to the church, \"For ye will walk with me in white, for ye are worthy.\" &gt;&gt; So here we come to the approach, not to a stern, angry God. And you've heard me tell it before when I was a trinitarian and I didn't know how to pray. And I'd pray to the father and I'd pray to the son. I'd pray to the holy ghost. And I go back, forget which one I'd prayed to. &gt;&gt; You think, \"Well, that's pretty far out.\" Well, brother Brandham said he used to think that God hated him and Jesus loved him. &gt;&gt; He said till he found out that's the same person. &gt;&gt; So the wrath of God was swallowed up in the heart of the Lord Jesus. And he settled my account. My signature was on there. I said I was guilty. I agreed. I lied. I agreed. I'd done wrong. I agreed. I validated it with my own signature. He said, \"Sign it, Donnie, and let me have it.\" &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Ephesians 2:19. Now, therefore, ye are no more strangers, alien from a person or a thing, without the knowledge of, without a share in, oh no. Oh my. Unheard of. One who receives and entertains, another hospitably, and who stays or lodges. You're no longer strangers and foreigners. One who lives in a place without the right of citizenship. That was me. Metaphorically without citizenship in God's kingdom. one who lives on earth as a stranger, a souljourer on earth of Christians whose fatherland is in heaven. You were strangers and foreigners, but now fellow citizens possessing the same citizenship with others. A fellow citizen of Gentiles is received into the communion of the saints of the people consecrated to God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Notice this. fellow citizens with the saints and the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, and whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. Fitly framed together was a carpenter term. It meant to join together as a carpenter would join together the framework of a building. Oh, praise God. So, the materials are exactly cut by whom? God himself. So, we have some of the church that'll be like this. We'll have some preachers that'll preach this way, some that are preached that way, some that are preached the other way. Thank God for it. He knows exactly what to make. Is that right? So he does the same in your life as a lay person and God will take that and bring it all together. And what Paul identified in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth. Wow. What a strange building. This building is a growing building. growing high in faith and virtue and knowledge. &gt;&gt; Whoa. As far as number wise and all that close we get to the end, we ain't going to grow so much in number. I figure we're going to get smaller and smaller. &gt;&gt; There'll be more and more that'll turn away. Not only that, we're getting more on the other side than we got left here. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; But the building is growing. growing in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. The growth of the church is not measured by how many new people you get. &gt;&gt; I mean, go out and knock on people's doors and try to bring them to the message. We try to hand out, you know, doctrinal things and this and that. No, this this growth here, it's not so much the natural. In whom also ye are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit. In the book of Genesis, God walked with his people. But in Exodus, he decided to dwell with his people. Exodus 25:8 in the tabernacle also chapter 40:34 until Israel's sin caused the glory of God to leave the tabernacle. But then once again God appears on the earth in the body of Jesus, his own personal human temple, that the spirit of God could dwell in that structure. Let's read and I'll close your just momentarily. Ephesians 3:1, \"For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to youward, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote a four and few words, whereby that when you reach you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. Now, no doubt there were Christians in that day that was not concerned about the mystery of Christ. They just wanted to be saved, &gt;&gt; saved from hell, go to church, you know, do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Now, we know that had to be there because that church had already started riding. The white horse rider had already started riding and made a twin to the real identified church. So, they just thought, \"All you got to do is believe. You just believe and you accept it and that's it. But Paul said, \"Oh, no, no, no. There's much, much more. There's many mysteries here that if you're part of that elect, you'll enter into that great place with God, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. It is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellows of the same body.\" Can you imagine now some of them Jews sitting there? &gt;&gt; Now Paul wrote this to the church in Ephesus which is mainly Gentiles. &gt;&gt; You imagine some of them Jews struggling but they ain't them. They ain't fit to sit with us. Wow. They men ain't even circumcised. Somebody told me they seen them eating barbecue pork. Lord have mercy. They eat eggs. Ah, I I can't believe they they they say they got the same thing we do. You imagine some of them had the office time ever was. And you hear Paul telling them, \"Look, brothers, they're heirs just like you are.\" Oh, don't you tell me that God spoke to Moses and God spoke to Abraham and God said, \"This is an everlasting covenant. How you going to break an everlasting covenant, Paul? You're a false prophet.\" He said, \"I'm telling you, brothers, it's a mystery. Will you show me where Moses said them Gentiles would come in? Paul, &gt;&gt; come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Let's take Paul to the Torah. Now, Paul, I want you to show me one scripture in the Torah that said he'd have a gentile bride and divorce Israel. Now, what would you done? You're first century believers. &gt;&gt; Some of you Jews, some of you Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And y'all come to Word of Life Church. And I stand up here to preach and I'm reading from Paul's books. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And putting it up on the screen. &gt;&gt; But now remember in that day to a lot of those people, they did not consider those books scripture. or sacred. &gt;&gt; But some of them did. &gt;&gt; They saw it and they realized Paul had things that Peter couldn't touch. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; Paul preached things James didn't understand one thing about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? It was given to a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So has it been in this day, and I thank God for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Wherefore I was made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints. In this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unarchable riches of Christ. This word uncarchable means astonishing and boundless treasures of grace which God has given to us and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ. So in the heart of God was this secret counsel to make a people like himself. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; How many is grateful for your dowy? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Praise God. He is our peace. PE who has broken down every wall. Here our peace. His peace. He is our peace. who has broken down every wall. He is our peace. [Music] He is our peace. Let's sing it together now. Cast all your cares. Cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. He is our peace. Do you believe this tonight, children? He is our peace. Yes, he is. Cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. [Music] He is our peace. [Music] Check. He is our peace. Oh, he is our peace. who has broken down. Can we stand our feet now as we worship him together? Oh, thank you, Lord. He is our peace. [Music] He is our peace. Oh, he is our peace. who has broken down every wall. He is our Jesus. [Music] Whatever you need tonight, children, cast your cares on him. You're sick, you're weary, you're oppressed. Cast it on him. He bore it. He bore it for you. He is our king. Oh, cast all your cares on him. Lord, he cares for you. Oh, is our peace. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just close our eyes now. Can we just raise our hands? Play it, brothers. Let's just worship him now in your own way. Remember, you were one time without the Commonwealths of Israel. You were at war against God. Oh, but now not only are you just saved, but your bride called by him, chosen by him. You got a treasure box of a dowy filled with all kinds of good things. Gifts to encourage you along your way. Healing when you're sick. Oh, it's not little dime store trinkets that you'll pull out of there. He didn't go to big lots and catch it on special, but it cost him so much. Oh, hallelujah. Along your way this journey. Oh, cast all your cares on him. I know he cares for you. [Applause] He is our peace. My Lord, you are our king. [Applause] Oh, cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. He is our peace. He is our peace. I wonder how many you are tonight sick, got a need in your body, maybe a sickness, an affliction, something you're dealing with as believers, you're commissioned by God to lay hands on one another. Was down in the meetings in Kentucky with Brother Larry Hara this past weekend. Brother John Andy's did a great job. had some singing and a brother from India also there and I spoke a couple of services and at the end of the service I had the saints of God to lay their hands on one another. The anointing of God swept in that place. It was just wonderful what the Lord did. Brother Le calling me yesterday telling me of this one that was delivered. This one was healed. That one was delivered. Not not a preacher come up run them through a prayer line. Well, this famous preacher prayed for me. But saints of God lay their hand on one another. He said, \"Brother Donnie, I believe that's just going to be the the beginning of great things we're going to hear that our God's doing.\" You know what? You get what you expect. &gt;&gt; So, if you expect a Wednesday night service, well, we ain't going to do much. I guess we'll just kind of go to church and hang out a little bit. You can hang out if you want to. I come here to worship God. &gt;&gt; And where my God is, supernatural is always made manifest. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to lay hands on one another right now, would you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, these are his words. These signs shall follow them that believe. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord Jesus. Brother Daryl, come up here and pray for the people. Hallelujah. [Music] Lord God, we believe you, Father. Hallelujah Jesus. It's in your dowy children. You can take it to the bank as we say. It will not bounce. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; this is who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father God. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we lay hands up on one another tonight, God, We exercise our God-given rights as believers, Lord. Believing, dear God, that heavens and earth will pass away, yet your word shall never fail, Lord. And Father God, it's written, they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. And tonight, as sons and daughters of God, Lord, we exercise this right, God, to lay hands upon our brothers and upon our sisters, God. And we pray, God, in the name of Jesus, oh lamb of God, by that anointing that raised my Lord, from the grave. Hallelujah. And may it move, dear God, upon every need, upon every situation, God. Lord, may back trouble leave, may anxiety leave, may fear leave, may depression leave tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. May every sickness leave the people tonight. For you are our portion, dear God. You are our healer, God. You are our sustainer tonight. And we receive it, dear God. The ABCs of our healing is to accept it and to believe it and confess it. And we confess tonight, you are our healer, Satan, by the authority given to us as sons and daughters of God. We rebuke you tonight. Come out of the people. You're defeated in the name of Jesus Christ. We cast you down tonight by the power of the Holy Ghost that dwells within the hearts of the believers tonight. We receive it tonight. We accept it tonight. We confess it tonight. We are overcomers. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. We are sons and daughters of God. And every devil, every demon, sickness, death, hell itself is under the feet of the believer. And we triumph with Christ tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. We are free. The blood of the lamb of God has made us free. I accept it tonight in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Boy, if you believe it tonight, raise your hand and accept it tonight. Raise your hand and reach. I challenge you to believe it in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Second service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whose report will you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it tonight? Oh, let the chains he has unshackled us tonight. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Whose report will you believe? As for me in my house, we shall believe the report of the Lord. For his report says we are overcomers. His report says he wrote our name in his book before the foundation of the world. His report says we are the bride of Jesus Christ. His report says every devil is under our feet. His report says we are not survivors of Leosa. We overcome leosia. Hallelujah. That's the report of my Lord. And God does not lie. Oh, do you believe it tonight? Amen. Hallelujah.

Oh worship him tonight. The son has made you free. And whom the son has made free is free indeed. Amen. You're free tonight to worship in the spirit of his truth and the reality of the living God. Hallelujah. Let back pain leave. Let nerve pain leave. Let Hallelujah. Let cataracts leave the people's eyes. Let leave the people tonight. We're free. Lift up your hearts. Lift up your heads.

His report says victory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Daryl, I don't feel one thing. He never said, \"Did you feel it?\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; But he said, \"Did you believe it?\" Yeah. &gt;&gt; If thou can believe, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad tonight? &gt;&gt; What an hour he's been given to us &gt;&gt; to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We've seen it so much, friends. We've seen it so much. You've seen God. You know, Jessica came through the house one time. She's about six years old. She got that feeding tube scar in her stomach and always told her she's special cuz she looks like a belly button. She has two belly buttons. I said, \"You're special. You got two belly buttons.\" And she went on through the house playing, just playing, you know, just six-year-old, something like that. And I was sitting at the table praying and studying Genesis 24. And I said, 'Lord, if you've done so much for her, it would be a sin for me to doubt that you couldn't take that scar off of her body. And friends, he has done so much for us, this body of believers. Is that not true? &gt;&gt; It would be a sin for us to doubt that God couldn't touch something in my life. &gt;&gt; I said, I know you could take that scar from her. And this anointing, just this warm feeling come over me. voice spoke to my heart said, \"I could take that scar from her, but I left it so that every time you see it, it'll remind you of where I brought her from.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad where he's brought us from tonight, friends? &gt;&gt; He don't remember that you ever done it, but you remember. But I wonder sometimes if we don't remember, is that to remind us of where he brought us from? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Have you enjoyed the word of God tonight? Amen. Praise the Lord. Me and Sher's leaving in the morning for Galina, Missouri for some meetings starting out there tomorrow night and have to be at the airport at 5:00. So, we desire your prayers, the Lord, just give us traveling grace and bless the meetings. We'll have a prayer line, I think, on Saturday night. So, we certainly appreciate your your prayers and we certainly appreciate brother Donnie, don't we? What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful man of God. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come to the close of a another service, Lord, once again, oh God, have you come, Lord, and stirred our hearts. Once again, Lord, have you anointed your servant, Brother Donnie, to bring us precious words of life. And we are so grateful and we are so thankful. And Lord, tonight as a body of believers, we laid hands upon one another. And Father, I'm reminded of what your prophet told us, Lord, that if angels laid hands upon us, it would do us no good unless we accepted it. Accepted what you done. And Lord, tonight in the name of Jesus, we accept dear God that this means the way Lord of your anointing to flow from one to the other as believers laying hands. And Father, we accept that tonight as your word, Lord, and you said your word will not fail. So Lord, we accept tonight as our brothers and our sisters laid hands up on us that it was thy will being done in our lives, Lord. and we accept that which we have need of in the name of Jesus. Lord, go with your people now. Give them traveling grace and be with us tomorrow as we travel, Lord, and keep our family safe at home till we return. And we love you, Lord. We thank you once again for all that you've done for us, Lord. Be people now, Father. Renew the strength of Brother Donnie. We pray others, Lord, who was streaming tonight, not here. We pray, oh God, may the anointing go just where they're at right now, Lord, and lift that affliction off of them in the name of Jesus. That Lord, by the rising of three sons, may they know that they have been in your presence, that you have done that work in their life. Grant it, Lord, we pray as we commit these things into your hands for your glory in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you saints. You're dismissing the fear of the Lord. Remember the service this weekend.

But now I've seen the light [music] because he's opened my eyes from the darkness. I've been set free. Now for the rest of my days, I [music] just want to stay kneeling at my Savior's feet. I'm [music and singing] just a sign of the cross. Not [music and singing] perfect, just redeemed. You see, I once [music] was lost, but God's blood was shed [music] for me. Nothing I've done, it's all God's son hanging [music and singing] on Calvar's tree. Jesus made my call. I'm just a sign of the cross. Nothing I've done. [singing] It's all [music] God's son hanging on Calvar's tree. Jesus paid my cost. I just decided [music] the cross. Yeah, he [singing] paid my cost. I'm just a side [music] of the cross. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, &gt;&gt; you remember the little boy coming down the street one day and he went inside the bar and he told the owner. He said, \"Sir, your sign's down.\" So he walks out there and looks at it and said, \"Sunny.\" Took his rag and polishes his sign. He said, \"You must be mistaken. My sign's not down.\" He said, \"But I mean your best sign.\" And the drunk was laying in the gutter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody's a sign today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sign of grace. Sign of mercy, sign of forgiveness. I want to be a sign of God's love and mercy. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a baby dedication today. Brother Jake and Sister Lydia, if they'll bring a little baby girl, we'll dedicate her to the Lord today. Praise the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Bring them [singing] in. Bring them in [music] from the [singing] fields of sin. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bring them in. Bring [music and singing] them in. Bring the [music] little ones to Jesus. [singing] Wow. Oh, ain't that a beautiful little thing? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, what a great gift that you've given to my brother and sister. With it comes such an awesome responsibility. I believe they are willing today to assume that responsibility to be able to take their little daughter to raise her in a way the best to their ability that would please you. We know that our children much of what they will become in life is greatly affected by us as parents and adults that affect them. So I pray Lord Jesus that your grace would be upon her. Lord if time should get should have enough time and get old enough. May her heart be surrendered to you when she's young before the evil days come upon her. I pray for her mother the fifth gospel. Help her Lord Jesus to be able to influence her. I pray for her father. May she be able to see a godly man, a man that loves Jesus. May she be able to hear prayers and music and all sorts of godly input in her life. Keep her from the evils of the day and the darkness of the hour that we're living in. Lord Jesus, I dedicate her life to you today for a life service in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Congratulations. [applause] Can we stand together? Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world, world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. Let's bow our heads together as we pray over the word today. Heavenly Father, we believe what we have read here today are your great words. You inspired men that they would be able to write the Bible. We know and are able to hear as we turn from page to page, chapter to chapter, book to book that these words are not the words of mere mortal men. their thoughts from a great creator, the only one who could put such things together. Then we call on you today to help us. It'll take your same inspiration to help us to believe it. And then once we believe it, to listen to it and to accept it and live it. For we know that our lives need to be daily sermons, constant sermons after we become Christians, that we're living a life that is pleasing to you. Speak to us today once again from your word. Father, we ask in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. [clears throat] So happy we could be together today. Aren't you glad to be able to come to church? &gt;&gt; What a great privilege it is for us as the people of God. And what an honor it is to be able to assemble ourselves together in in his in his presence. But not only in his presence, but actually in one another's presence. What a great thing it is for people to understand. I realize for a lot of people, church is just going to church. It's a social thing. they don't really get that much out of it. Uh they go to see one another, visit one another, exchange their business ideas and different things like that of what they've done during the week. But I'm so grateful that God is God of people who understand why we go to church and the reason of it. And well, you know, we've been looking at it and I want to go back that way just a little bit today on the attribute and the aspect of godliness. And God loves to go to church himself. God loves to be where his children are, where his people are that he can be able to assemble together with them in order to do things for them. Because the way God looks at it, there's always been special places on the earth that have been set aside for his honor and his glory. The most fought over city on the face of the earth. Jerusalem been taken over and over again. Conquered by every man, every potentate that was coming to take the east. They always wanted Jerusalem as a prize. Still is today. The most sought out place that has ever been on the face of the earth. Why? Because God loves it so much. And we know then that there's a spiritual answering to that, a parallel to that of us being able to come together in the house of God. Whether it's a place like this, this size, whether it be this size over here, u God does not so much impressed by whether there's stained glass windows and gold on the altar, whether there's fine fancy woodwork. What what really gets God's attention is when people come together with a divine purpose, that is to worship him. to worship him and to hear from him that they can see their shortcomings and find out how to be better people. How many came for that reason today? And we know the Lord Jesus himself actually went to church whenever he was here on the earth. And he never found an actual ideal church whenever he was here. You can imagine living now in the first century. So they had synagogues. So Jesus went to the synagogue at Capernium and I told you Carol and I stood there several years ago and they had dug down several feet and found that original Roman era synagogue and they just recently found another city there called Basadia where Peter and Andrew and them different ones are from and it's quite an amazing thing when you think that the Lord Jesus would have went to such a place that was far from imperfect. Nobody ever got saved. Nobody ever got healed. Nobody ever got delivered. But Jesus went to church anyhow, which is a pretty good example, I think, for us as his children. I don't mind telling you before we go further into this today that there would that would be a real difficult time for me to go to some churches and make that my home church. If there was churches that was teaching ideology that was contrary to the word of God, it would be very hard for me to go there. I I don't mind. I'll go a little farther. It would be hard for me to go to some message churches and make them my home church because some of them are so far off of the beaten paths of the word of God. But I will say this, and I was thinking about it earlier this morning. I'm just so grateful that God has allowed us to be able to have a place where we can come together, worship him, see God, not only read about what God did, but see God doing the same things that he's always done. And I trust that we always count that a great honor. In Luke 4:1 16, speaking of Jesus, he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. and as his custom was. Now, Luke wasn't actually there, of course, at the birth of the Lord Jesus. And Luke wasn't one of the original 12. Luke actually came in years afterwards. So, Luke must have found this out. Part of it by divine inspiration, but part of it by going around and talking to people that was around Jesus. So Luke had found this out somehow that it was the custom of the Lord Jesus to go to church. So it wasn't something that Jesus visited, you know, twice a year, three times a year, but a custom was something that you do over and over and over again. Now, can you imagine going to church over and over and over and over and over again? You saw nobody healed, nobody saved, nobody delivered, but you kept on going anyhow. Would you do that? &gt;&gt; Now, you see, Jesus went because he knew there was one good thing that he could get out of the service. He heard the word being read. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, would that be worth it to us to get up, get ready, and drive to church just to hear the word be read? &gt;&gt; Wow. Now, you see what that shows me? It shows me that Jesus had a reverence and an honor and a sacredness for church that most of us don't have. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; The sacredness was knowing God's word was going to be there and that it was going to be read. But many folks go to church out of selfish ideas. What am I going to get? What am I going to take from the service? How am I going to be helped? Are they going to sing my songs? My favorite preacher going to preach? And church really ain't about God. And it's not really about them ministering to others. It's about will the service suit them &gt;&gt; and will their favorite people and I hope sister so and so is wearing that dress and I hope brother Donnie wears that suit I like. And you know is brother Donnie preaching today? Oh, I hope he is because if he ain't there, I'm not sure I can get anything. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; If the word of God is going to be read and the preacher, you may not get five five words out of what he has to say, but if he reads one scripture, you ought to be saying, \"Boy, wasn't that scripture awesome? Wasn't them quotes he read, wasn't that absolutely awesome? Wasn't it wonderful to shake the saints of God's hands? Wasn't it something to be there?\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. I think sometimes we need a little bit instruction maybe on church. Now, I want you to listen to this. I love the way the prophet said this. He says, \"And I say you get that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost sets her soul on fire. There's no signing cards. God's in their heart. God, he loves to worship.\" Amen. God's in their heart. God goes to church. He loves to worship. Now, I read this one and the next one I'm fixing to read you the last time we spoke on this, but it's so good. Now, you've got tapes on that. You've got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline of the church, how we behave oursel in the church of God. But of course this quote cannot apply to you if you don't come to church &gt;&gt; because the tapes was not on how to behave yourself in your house &gt;&gt; but how you behave yourself in church. So this is one quote that a lot of the message people will never have to worry fulfilling will they since they don't come to church &gt;&gt; and they see no need in it. &gt;&gt; Oh my praise the Lord. Now watch this. How we behave oursel in the church of God. How we got to come together here together and set together in heavenly places. Got to Got to &gt;&gt; don't stay home. &gt;&gt; Now you tell me how people say they believe this is the voice of God on these tapes. And I'll tell you what, they are liars. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about people that ain't got a church in their community to go to. I ain't talking about people that are invalid and people that are sick that their desire is to be in the house of God. I'm talking about people that could go and won't go. &gt;&gt; They're liars. &gt;&gt; I do not care what their name is. I don't care how long they've been in the message. And they say this is the voice of God. They are liars. And all liars go to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. and word of life said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Donnie, tell us the truth. Brother Donnie, if God is in your heart, you see that's the problem. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, can you imagine if you get into sports, baseball, basketball, whatever your deal is about sports and all that. My goodness, in Tennessee is playing, we'll say Tennessee is playing against Kentucky AND BOY, YOU'RE THERE for Tennessee and and then the Mayo, you get a free ticket. You and your wife and your youngans all get free tickets and you don't know how you got them. and you get free tickets and you've got the best place in the building or coliseum or whatever it is. I don't know anything about all that stuff, but you get all that and you're say, \"Well, should we go? Honey, what do you think? I hate to go there. There ain't no telling how many homosexuals will be there. There ain't no telling how many perverts, how many liars, how many people drinking beer, smoking cigarette, chewing tobaca, cursing, lying. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I don't think we ought to go, do you, honey? But it's Tennessee against Wildcats, you know, and they said this is the biggest game of the year and and they give us these free tickets, but it would be an ungodly atmosphere for us to go. Some of y'all as guilty as a hound dog in the hen house. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all's blushing. I ain't seen you blush in a while. Would you let the homosexuals, the adulterers, the liars, the perverters keep you from that ball game? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, you do let them keep you from going to Walmart, right? &gt;&gt; So, all of you now, you order your groceries from Walmart cuz it's such an ungodly atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And yet, if people won't speak to us, we don't go to church. &gt;&gt; We don't like this, we don't go to church. We don't like that, we don't go to church. &gt;&gt; Preach it. And the Lord Jesus purchased tickets for every one of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you're going to be held accountable for not using your ticket. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open yonder to get in there and fellowship with your brother. So you see, going to church is not just about God in the sense of you hearing the word and you just worshiping him and you just singing to him. It's also about fellowship &gt;&gt; with your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; If you don't feel that way, then I tell you it's time you got to praying. Cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another. That's right. Stay right together. Amen. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Notice this message entitled the token. &gt;&gt; We should love one another more than we ever did in all of our lives. There should be such a hunger to get to church. &gt;&gt; Notice the title token. There should be such a hunger to get to church. There should be such a hunger for us to get to one another. &gt;&gt; It should be a love affair. &gt;&gt; Not just with you and God, &gt;&gt; but with you and your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been missing brother Louie and Sister Glenda Sabath. &gt;&gt; Weren't y'all glad to see him up here today? [applause] There ought to be something in us godly. Notice again in who is Jesus, we should assemble ourselves together. The Bible tells us that as we see the end approaching, not of forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. It'll it'll not only do that, it'll strengthen you and your strengths will strengthen the church. Can't you see why Satan don't want people to go to church? &gt;&gt; So, your strengths will strengthen me. &gt;&gt; So, in other words, you rob me. And you rob those around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not only robbing yourself, you're robbing us. &gt;&gt; How many robbers will there be in heaven? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Wow, man. This makes me want to have a church revival. All right. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this in question answers. You see, when the prophet went to Arizona, there was a bunch of the message people that moved out there with him. But he didn't start a church. &gt;&gt; So, the people had the tapes, they had the books, but they also had the prophet himself. but they didn't have a church to go to. Now, a lot of people would think that was the ideal setting, but I want you to listen what happened to those message people that were in that setting. Now, I know a lot of times I speak of the Calvinistic belief. Now, don't think that that lets you loose to do anything you want to do. A fellow the other day, I said, \"Did you go to church?\" He said, \"I went hunting. The man's wife come to me and she's coming from the laundromat on Sunday. I said, \"Why didn't you go to church?\" She said, \"I done my washing.\" I said, \"You shouldn't have done that.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, remember, this is supposed to be the voice of God on tape. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, she said, \"I'm not an old legalist.\" I said, &gt;&gt; \"But I saw you were a Christian.\" &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice this is a message woman &gt;&gt; and they're there around the prophet himself. But because they didn't have a church to go to, it started working on their attitude. &gt;&gt; Now watch, when you lose the sacredness of church and you lose the sacredness of his presence, you also start losing the sacredness of the resurrection. You see, don't never forget one of the reasons that we come to church on Sunday is to honor the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So when you don't do that and you see no need to do it, you start actually dishonoring the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it goes to losing its value. Now he said, \"But I thought you were a Christian.\" She see I said, \"Do you know you're putting a stumbling block in somebody's way?\" &gt;&gt; Well, I I believe this and I don't have to do those things. I'm not a legalist. Well, but look, my brother, sister, look here. Paul said, \"If eating meat puts a stumbling block in my brother's way, I'll eat meat no more as long as the world stands.\" Right. &gt;&gt; And I think that'd be a whole lot better. &gt;&gt; Now watch. So brother Perry Green and many of you know the history of the message, how it come about there in the west. Brother Perry Green went there and there was assembly of God church and they merged together with another church. So it left this building vacant and empty. Brother Green goes in there and starts a church. Now brother Brandham comes and he wants him in the dedication part. So this is his subject that he deals with and notice his title. What house will you build for me? And now that brother Green, God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious faith that we believe in, we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service and take every place that we can. I wonder why brother Brandham didn't turn it into a tape only church. Now, if that was the perfect way and that was God's provided way, as we're hearing it said over and over and over again now, that this is God's way for us to hear tapes only, then wonder why Brother Brandham was not the founder of that move. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't. &gt;&gt; The founding of that was not God's prophet, &gt;&gt; cuz he was a scriptural prophet. And if this message come to turn our hearts back to the original faith, do you think they sat at home and read Paul's books? &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Donnie. Do you think they sat at home and looked one another, you know, and just said, \"What are you going to do today?\" Well, I'm going over to the coliseum to watch the games. &gt;&gt; I'm going here. I'm going there. They went to church. &gt;&gt; Even though in the first century it could have cost them their life. But they went anyway, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice how that he's encouraging the messaged people at that time what to do about this church. If we are asked and called on to pray, to seek, to do, let's be soldiers. Let's be anxious to do it. Keep the message &gt;&gt; honorable. &gt;&gt; Amen. and live the right kind of life. Don't let no smut. &gt;&gt; It's sad a lot of message people never read this quote &gt;&gt; or they never believed it after they read it. Don't let no smut come upon it. We're living too late now. We're too late in the hour. Let's live it clean. Anybody agree with that today? &gt;&gt; My life, your life, all of our lives need to be picked up before God. Now watch. He's going to tell us what the message people had got into in that Tucson area with no church to go to. &gt;&gt; Our young people just ride around from place to place, show to show, &gt;&gt; right? message people &gt;&gt; and they had not just the tapes, not just the books, the prophet of God was there with them, too. &gt;&gt; And this is what they had got into. Why church didn't mean nothing. Well, brother Brandham made a preaching. I ain't going I ain't going that old ASSEMBLY OF GOD. I AIN'T going here. I ain't going there. And little did they know, Satan was taking the preciousness of honoring the resurrection away from them. &gt;&gt; So the women went to the laundromat. The men went hunting on Sunday. The kids rode around on their bicycles and went from show to show to show. And they're trying to tell everybody, \"YOU WANT WHAT I GOT? Y'ALL are blind. Y'all a bunch of leans. You got to come AND FOLLOW US.\" WELL, WHERE DO YOU GO TO CHURCH? WE DON'T BELIEVE IN GOING TO CHURCH. WE GO TO the laundromat. And you think you're a light &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; My my young people just ride around from place to place, from show to show and drifting further and further away &gt;&gt; from God. Notice he didn't say from the tapes. &gt;&gt; He didn't say from the prophet. &gt;&gt; From God. Now that's the truth. I see it in my children. &gt;&gt; So you mean the Brandom family was not exempt from drifting &gt;&gt; because they didn't have a church? &gt;&gt; Oh, you ain't going to hear this preached by very many. I know you're certainly not going to hear this promoted from headquarters, but I'm called to preach all the message. [applause] I ain't cutting no corners for nobody. It's time that we fess up. Do we believe this is the truth or are we a bunch of rotten, sorry hypocrites? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many message preachers run across across this very quote and they will not read it cuz they don't want to cause nobody hurt feelings? Well, I don't want to hurt your feelings either, but I'd rather hurt your feelings now than for you to go to hell and you point your finger at me and God say, \"You're guilty, preacher.\" [applause] Mhm. Oh my. I see it in my children. COME ON, PROPHET OF GOD, BE HONEST WITH US. &gt;&gt; I see it &gt;&gt; myself. You mean brother Brandham needed Harry to go to church? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't you love this message? Praise God. Does this sound like a hypocrite to you? Does this sound like a guy that's trying to hide things from you? This guy exposed his own family and exposed himself. &gt;&gt; I can follow such a man. You've got to assemble yourselves together TO WORSHIP GOD. THE BIBLE said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see this day approach and that much more come together. If there's only two people there, &gt;&gt; you be one of them. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we come together and worship together, then we're just something another about it. Jesus said, \"Well, there's two or three gathered in my name, there I am in their midst.\" &gt;&gt; Trying to do God a service. He's in Freeport now. But this time, people had already began to misunderstand things that Brother Random had said. So he he was calling the people out from from systems and denominations and people were taking quotes that he said remember this is about a year after what he said in question answer 64 and you're in 3 months something like that four months so he had already picked up on it that it was starting to follow the followers of the message that the followers of the message thought well they don't need to go to church they don't have to go to church so they were isolating quotes and pulling them out and saying Well, brother Brandham said, \"Come out of church. Come out of church.\" Now, watch what God's having him to say. This is just a month and a half or so, or a month actually before he he's taken from the earth. The handwriting is on the wall. The second coming is at hand. The bride is being chosen, watered out. Now, that don't mean draw out from church. Now, watch. It's amazing that now he's going to insert this just a little while before he leaves the earth. Why? The spirit of God has already brought his attention to it that some of the message people are taking these quotes and they're making it sound like you don't need to go to church no more. So the Holy Ghost said, \"Let's go ahead and take care of this before you leave.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Not draw out from church. That means draw out from denominationalism. &gt;&gt; You must go to church. Everybody read this together with me now on three. One, two, three. You must go to church. &gt;&gt; Now, your own voice is on God's recording. &gt;&gt; Now, it just won't be me you'll hear at the day of judgment, but you'll hear yourself. I can quit now if y'all want me to, but I got a lot more [applause] &gt;&gt; now. YOU MUST GO TO CHURCH, BUT DON'T JOIN ANY ORGANIZATION. JESUS WENT &gt;&gt; all the organizations, &gt;&gt; but he never joined a one of them, &gt;&gt; MODERN EVENTS. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE TO LEAVE CHURCH. WOW. I want you to go to church. Don't forsake to assemble yourself together. But what I'm trying to tell you to do is press into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; now let's change. In order to be godly, we have to love what God loves and we have to hate what God hates. Now, this is a little bit, you know, this this would be a little bit difficult maybe for some people, but there are things that God absolutely hates. &gt;&gt; He despises. Now before we go on into this, let me reassure you that God hates sin, but he loves the sinner. &gt;&gt; God hates sin, but he loves the sinner. But there are some things that God detests, and it's actually an abomination to him. Read with me in Psalms 45:6. And this is a messianic psalm of the [clears throat] Old Testament. Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. The scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter. I'd like to preach these couple of verses to you sometime on a separate thing. But thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness. This is a messianic psalm. And David is actually calling the Messiah God. This is one of the scriptures that the rabbis use. And when they believe that the Messiah will be God himself. So he said, \"Thy throne, oh God.\" So he's calling the Messiah God. Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness. Therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. So the Messiah hates wickedness. I mean believes he hates sin. He hates ungodliness. All right. Now then if we are going to be like God, we must also be like God in love and in hatred. But we cannot hate upon our feelings being hurt by this certain individual or that individual and then we express hatred toward them out of hurt feelings or disappointment. There's only one source by which hatred can be perfect. &gt;&gt; That's from a godly heart. &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. The only way you and I can hate sin in the right way is when our heart is right before God. Because if we're not careful every time, we will lump the sin with the sinner and we'll throw the baby out with the bathwater and we will develop something against the individual. And even though they may repent and make the situation right, we will never let it go in our mind. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, you thought going to church quotes was tough? You ain't heard nothing yet. But see, God is able and has the capability of being able to hate the sin. Oh, it's so vile in his sight. And yet, if the sinner repents of that sin, then God no longer holds that past against them. We need help to be able to do likewise. &gt;&gt; Now, watch. This is part of God's character, not dealing with angels, but dealing with humans. And we need to be godly, not only dealing with God, but godly dealing with our brothers and sisters and godly dealing with the lost world. Read with me in Proverbsap 6:1 16. Now I want you to listen to these things carefully. [snorts] These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay, seven are an abomination unto him. It do you good to keep these verses real close to you. &gt;&gt; A proud look. &gt;&gt; It might be safer for me to go back in my office and finish this sermon. &gt;&gt; So, six things that God hates. Yay. Seven are an abomination. Now, it's one thing for God to hate a thing and then for it to move into the abominable aspect of God looking at it as an abomination. So, God hates a proud look, &gt;&gt; a lying tongue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll pay everybody a penny a piece for amens from this point on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all must not have no lunch money. These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay. S seven are an abomination unto him. A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's more than one way you can kill people. And you don't kill them necessarily in this day with a knife or a gun, but you kill their influence. You tell lies on them. You tell things to bring down their character. &gt;&gt; Oh my. A proud look, a lying tongue. I want you to notice he's not mentioning anything about homosexuality. &gt;&gt; And yet homosexuality is an abomination. Do you understand? A lying tongue is an abomination. Just like two men getting married, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; An abomination. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; an heart that devisth wicked imagination. So then a heart, notice he doesn't say a mind, but a heart. Why? Because out of the heart, Jesus picks this up in the New Testament. Out of the heart proceedth wicked, evil imaginations and on and on and on. You remember the the scripture. So a heart that would devise wicked imagination. So they think and they ponder over snares and over difficulties and over things that will cause people to to stumble. Now this is an abomination to God. Feet that be swift in running to mischief. So people then that they're fast. They're not slow held back by. They're just quick and doing what they can to to bring trouble and cause all kinds of heartaches and difficulties. That is an abomination to God. And you know what's difficult about it is some of these people right here might have long hair. They may wear long dresses. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Some of these people are here as message preachers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Any of you business brothers hiring this week? I might lose my job after today. Ah, a false witness that speaketh lies. So, A PERSON SAYING, \"BROTHER DAVE SWANSON, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE THIS AND brother Maddie, he done that and that.\" And boy, brother Dave Swanson. Oh my. I'll tell you one thing. Do you understand? If you are bearing lies. &gt;&gt; Now, you might not have even made up the lie, &gt;&gt; but you're carrying somebody else's lie. &gt;&gt; No wonder the Bible tells us to be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath. A lot of our motor mouths &gt;&gt; need to shut up. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; a false witness that beareth wise, and he that sweth discord among brethren, &gt;&gt; an abomination to God. God actually hates these things. &gt;&gt; So a person that would try to go amongst our church or go amongst a a family and so discord, &gt;&gt; do you understand the way God feels about that? &gt;&gt; He hates it. &gt;&gt; Let you know wherever church splitting preacher stands then. &gt;&gt; Now I guess the question is how do you feel about him? So we love we love abominations if we love these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I'd say the fell down at the Baptist church down the road got more amens than I got this morning. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 1:14. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hatest. They are a trouble. This is God talking now. Unto me. I am weary to bear them. And yet the new moons and the feast were things he gave them. &gt;&gt; So they were doing things that God gave them to do. But now God says, \"I hate it. I HATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.\" WHY, LANCE? You imagine they could come back and say, \"But God, it's in your word. Your prophet said at the new moon and the Sabbath and and the feast to have a feast and dance before me and do what?\" How could you do that? &gt;&gt; Because they lost the sacredness of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It just become ritual and routine. &gt;&gt; I don't want church to become that for us. I know some of you have wondered for years and years and other preachers have even asked me about it. Brother Donnie, why don't you have communion once a month? Cuz I've been to some of the churches who have communion once a month and I've seen the way they take it and it's no more than a ritual. &gt;&gt; It's like picking up a peanut butter cracker and drinking a glass of Kool-Aid to some of them. I do not want that. I am not going to have it in our church. I'll have it three times a year, four times a year, every other year. And if it gets to a spot to where that it's just common and ritual, we don't understand how sacred this is. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THE PROPHET SAID, I just finished a study this week. 342 times that the prophet uses the word sacred. 40some different times. Sacredness. Ah, I was overwhelmed by the things that I found. sacred desk, sacred pullpit, sacred word, sacred moment, sacred gifts, all the things that he said was sacred. As I studied them, I realized how that that element of sacredness is leaving our ranks. Oh, may God help us. That going to church will ALWAYS BE SACRED. THAT SINGING, clapping our hands, hearing the word read, oh my, living a Christian life, honoring the resurrection WILL ALWAYS BE SACRED. BECAUSE IF NOT, IF IN TIME GOES ON, GOD WILL SAY TO SOME OF THE MESSAGE PEOPLE, I HATE I HATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING. &gt;&gt; I HATE YOUR DEDICATING BABIES. I HATE THE WATER BAPTISMS. I HATE YOUR COMMUNION SERVICES. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU ARE DOING IT WITH no feeling, no love. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God even told him, \"Your sacrifices are going to stink &gt;&gt; and my nose.\" &gt;&gt; Zechariah 8:1 17. Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath. For all these things that I hate, sayeth the Lord. Malachi 2:15, therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. Now remember marriage and divorce is very rampant at the end of the Old Testament age. The Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away. You know how God feels about divorce? He hates it. &gt;&gt; But in the age we live in. Yeah. Whatever. I made a mistake. I changed my mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; Lord of mercy. If you get any choir, the seats is going to start crying out. My my. For one coverth violence with his garments, sayaith the Lord of hosts. Therefore, take heed to your spirit that you deal not treacherously. Now, hate is a it's a difficult subject in studying. It's a difficult subject in bringing it together. AND YET, GOD WANTS HIS children to hate certain things. Notice my words. Things. Certain things. In Revelation 2:6, but thou but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. Now notice how that this church that this is written to in the church age that they were displaying godliness and God wanted to make note of it because it meant so much to him. I can tell by the look of most of you on your face that you're puzzled by this. You think why? Why would that matter? Because to be like God is more than just hair and dress and jumping up and down and shouting. It's loving what God loves, hating what God hates. &gt;&gt; And God God wanted these people to know he was proud of them because they had moved into this attribute which very few ever will that they hate what God hates. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO NOTICE God amened their godly attribute. HERE IS GOD SAYING back to them, \"Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE DOING RIGHT. YOU HATE NOTICE GOD DOESN'T say they hated the nickelans.\" Now remember this was people in this first church age which had already got under this thing and the prophet says they wanted to get away with that fanatical bunch of Christians speaking in tongues and all that sort of thing. BUT IT WAS ALSO THE ministry the CLERGY THAT WAS TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF God out of the people and make them the big man. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. BUT GOD WANTED EVERY PERSON in the church to HAVE HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT IT TODAY IN THIS MESSAGE FOR THE PASTORS AND THE PREACHERS to be the only one that God hears and the only one that God loves. God loves you and God wants to dwell IN YOU. GOD WANTS TO HEAR YOUR PRAYER. GOD WANTS TO LIVE IN YOUR soul just AS REAL AS HE DOES THE GREATEST preacher in this message. &gt;&gt; SO NOTICE GOD amens now hate. Ain't that strange? [snorts] But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. Verse 15. SO HAST THOU ALSO THEM THAT HOLD THE DOCTRINE. NOW NOTICE we move to another church age. So it went from deeds. So they just kind of started among the people trying to divide them and separate them and pull them off to their little agenda. &gt;&gt; And God called it deeds. But already the saints of God, full of the Holy Ghost, THAT'S OF THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THAT ain't right. That's off the word. They're trying to pull people off the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this verse, God didn't comment them because they loved. But God commented because they hated, &gt;&gt; not people. &gt;&gt; So hast thou also THEM THAT HOLD THE DOCTRINE. So now it moves to the doctrinal stage of the nicicoatans which thing I hate. &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice in this church age by the time it comes to them, God don't say to this bunch of overcomers that you all hate it too. But God said, \"So hast thou also them that hold.\" So now by this church age they had let some of them people come among them. &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT AMEN THEIR ACTION. BUT GOD IS TELLING THEM HIS GODLY VIEW. I HATE THIS THING. HOW CAN YOU all tolerate it &gt;&gt; and put your arm around their neck and hug them and oh praise God. God said I hate this thing. But you all have it among you. &gt;&gt; So God hated their deeds AND THEIR DOCTRINE. YOU SEE, GOD HATES [snorts] THE character and the ways of the wicked. And the feelings OF ALL OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUS, godly people are the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Malachi 1:3. AND I HATED ESAU. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Romans 9:13. AS IT IS WRITTEN, JACOB HAVE I LOVED, but Esau have I hated. Now you see the problem is that we when we read such scriptures we evaluate this word by the way we understand hate. &gt;&gt; So we think God hates like me. Uh-uh. No he does not. &gt;&gt; GOD DOES not hate the way humans hate. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even mean what you think it does. &gt;&gt; Genesis 29:29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilha his handmade to be her maid. And he Jacob went in also unto Rachel. And he loved also Rachel more &gt;&gt; than Leah. and served him yet seven other years. But notice the key now to verse 30 is in actually verse 31. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated. Now wait a minute. Verse 30 didn't say that Jacob hated her. &gt;&gt; It said that he loved Rachel more. Now, I want you to keep in mind now the way God had Moses to write it. SO, WITH A GODLY hatred in the way that God looks at people and God say, \"I love you. I hate you. I love you. I hate you. I love you. I HATE YOU.\" GOD CAN SAY, \"I LOVE YOU.\" But then God can look at others and say, \"But I love you more.\" Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And God noted this in Genesis and said, let me read it to you again. And he went also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, or in other words, loved less, &gt;&gt; there you go, friends. Godly hatred does not hate like humans. It does not corrupt the heart. It is never reacting out of selfishness and vindictiveness at all. IT ACTUALLY BREAKS THE HEART OF the recipient, the one who has it. When they hate evil, it actually burdens them. It actually breaks the HEART FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE bound in wickedness and idolatry and sin. Now, we've all no doubt heard preachers preach from the pull pit. And ain't a question in my mind, some of them have preached out of hatred. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they ain't no question about they've been flat mad. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't mad at the devil. Sometimes it's mad at me. sometimes is mad at you. Sometimes he's mad at somebody else. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And you know it as well as I know it that a preacher can stand up there and burn your hide. But you know that if that man loves you, he's doing that because of the love of God in his heart. You know that, right? You've experienced that. And then you've known others and you just felt like they throw this at you and throw that at you and you just felt some ain't right about that. Some just ain't right about it. And a lot of times it ain't right. They may be saying the truth, BUT IT'S THEIR ATTITUDE. THEY'RE SAYING IT OUT OF human anger, human vindictiveness. AND WHENEVER GOD SAYS, \"I HATE THIS AND I HATE THAT.\" IT'S NOT FROM A HUMAN anger that God is mad. You are you broke MY WORD. YOU STEPPED ON MY WORD. I WANT TO GET BACK AT YOU. NO, THAT'S THE WAY US HUMANS DOES. BUT WHEN GOD SAYS, \"I hate,\" he says, \"I want you to be better.\" Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to be changed. So God loved Jacob more than he did Esau. Now watch this. In Luke 14 26, the words of the Lord Jesus himself. If any man will come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters. So you mean the requirement to be a Christian is to hate your daddy, hate your mother, hate your wife, hate your children. Oh, I saw the light come over some of you. Praise the Lord. You're smiling now, Brother Danny. Thank God. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; If any man COME TO ME AND HATE NOT HIS FATHER, NOW LET'S TAKE IT LITERALLY JUST LIKE JESUS said it. In order to be a Christian, YOU GOT TO HATE EVERYBODY around you. I know some people that sure would fulfill that easy enough. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And they ain't a Christian a bit more than the devil is. &gt;&gt; You know why? They can't do it from a godly heart. Jesus is not teaching us to hate OUR FATHER. JESUS IS NOT TEACHING TEACHING US TO HATE OUR MOTHER. HE'S teaching us to love them less. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love God's word. Don't you? Oh my. &gt;&gt; If any man come to me AND HATE NOT HIS father and mother and wife and children and BRETHREN AND SISTERS, YAY, AND HIS OWN LIFE ALSO, he cannot be my disciple. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Matthew 10:37, he that loveth father or mother. You see, this is one of the great things about God having four gospels. &gt;&gt; For those of you that never really studied your Bible that much, you'd be surprised how many of these same instances are written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And all four of them will say it a little bit different way. and they're recalling the same story. &gt;&gt; Well, come on now. Folks have left the message for doing that. And I've sent quotes to a bunch of them in scriptures and told them if they don't quit believing the Bible, they're a bunch of hypocrites. Cuz the Bible is wrote the exact same way. &gt;&gt; Now, here, I want you to notice this. Now, Matthew is writing the same instance, but notice how he phrases it. He that loveth father or mother more [groaning] &gt;&gt; than me. &gt;&gt; How many love yourself here today? DIDN'T YOU ALL HEAR WHAT I SAID ABOUT LYING TONGUES? How many love yourself? I'm putting my hand up cuz I do. There ain't nothing wrong with ME LOVING MYSELF &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I DON'T LOVE ME more than I LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS ME TO LOVE MY SISTERS, my brothers, my family. I love my MOTHER AND MY FATHER AND both of them are gone. I still love them. I love people that don't love me. And there's nothing wrong with that. As a MATTER OF FACT, HE WANTS ME TO. BUT HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO LOVE ANYONE more than him. SO WE SAY, WELL, I HATE MYSELF. AND THE TRUTH of that is yes. And in our language of scriptural meaning and understanding, it simply means I love myself less. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SAY GOD HATES EVERYBODY BUT THE BRIDE. THAT'S contrary to the Bible. The Lord Jesus, the very heart of God in John 3:16 says this, \"God so &gt;&gt; loved, &gt;&gt; not hated. &gt;&gt; GOD so loved the bride, [screaming] the world, THE WORLD. GOD HATES THEIR SIN. HE HATES THEIR FAIL.\" But God loves them. IT'S NOT EVEN HIS WILL THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, BECAUSE OUR MESSAGE IS SUCH A MESSAGE OF SEPARATION AND ISOLATION FROM THE WORLD, WE WILL NOT EVEN LET OUR LIGHT BE EFFECTIVE. I AIN'T GETTING AROUND THAT BUNCH OF DEVILS. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF Baptists and men wear shorts. THEY DO THIS, THAT, THE OTHER. WELL, LET YOUR LIGHT SOUL SHINE THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR LIFE. BROTHER DONN, IS IT OKAY TO LOVE THEM? BY [screaming] ALL MEANS, LOVE THEM. LOVE THE DRUNK ON THE STREET. LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOST WITHOUT GOD. LET THEM KNOW THE REAL LOVE of God. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Get out of here, devil. Thank you. Notice Psalm 139:22. I hate them with perfect hatred. Praise the Lord. Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; All of our nurses standing post supposed to do now. I HATE THEM WITH PERFECT HATRED. I count them mine enemies. YOU SEE, A perfect hatred of evil can only proceed from a heart which loves those that are in that sin and filth and debauchery. AND YET HUMANS WILL TRY TO USE THIS scripture and justify their hatred for people who've hurt them &gt;&gt; and say, \"Well, David said he had a perfect hatred. I HATE THIS BROTHER.\" I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE LEFT my church. This man done this. THIS WOMAN DON'T I I HATE HIM. IT'S A perfect hatred. Don't sound perfect to me. I mean, I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have thought perfect hatred would cause you to bust your teeth with your goodness. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It cannot be perfect if it doesn't proceed from a heart filled with love &gt;&gt; for those people who've done you wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many has been hurt by people? &gt;&gt; This is the most honest y'all have been all morning. I figured I'd get you somewhere. How many's been hurt by people? So, you're going to ride all people off then, right? &gt;&gt; What? How many's been hurt by preachers? I put my leg up, too. Yep. I do the other one, too, but I can't spread ride that part. OH, HOW MANY BEEN HURT, LET DOWN, DISAPPOINTED? WE ALL HAVE. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SHALL NEVER BE HURT AGAIN. AND you realize who you're robbing the most by that attitude? Yourself. &gt;&gt; SURE, WE'VE BEEN HURT BY PEOPLE. SURE, WE'VE BEEN LET DOWN BY PEOPLE. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME GOOD, GODLY people left in this world. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN HURT BY PREACHERS, LET DOWN BY PREACHERS. SO HAVE I. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME MEN OF GOD IN THIS WORD THAT STILL LOVES THE LORD JESUS WITH ALL OF THEIR HEARTS. BUT KEEP IN MIND, EVERY PREACHER, I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS, HE IS A HUMAN BEING AND HE IS A work in progress. Amen. &gt;&gt; Read with me in Galatians 5:1 19 and we'll start closing down. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanliness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred. So you mean God would put human hatred right next to witchcraft? &gt;&gt; Yeah. and idolatry and emulation and wraths and strife and seditions and hearsay. So God cannot hate with this kind of hate. &gt;&gt; Can y'all say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Let's see if you can amen this. Then God don't want you to. &gt;&gt; It's not godly. to hate people &gt;&gt; like this. &gt;&gt; It's ungodly. &gt;&gt; Our hair, our dress, we don't go here, we don't go there, we don't do that. Oh, that's well and good. But what good does all of that do if you've got a heart full of hate? Amen. &gt;&gt; Envyings, murders, drunkenness, reings, and such like, of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, what a terrible thing &gt;&gt; to go to church for years of your life and have a heart full of this type of hatred &gt;&gt; and wind up being lost. &gt;&gt; This is serious. Yes. &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:9, he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; is in darkness even until now. &gt;&gt; He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother. So there is a way apparently that a person can absolutely hate their brother and be convinced that they're right with God. He that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness. So he behaves his mannerism is in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. You see it's the type of hatred that Satan wants in our hearts. It would be a similar hatred that Iran has for Israel. &gt;&gt; Just in the last six months, they have sent over a billion dollars to Hezbollah in the country of Lebanon to build up their arms to try to destroy Israel. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THEY'VE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS sending it to Hamas, to the other in Fatada, the other different groups. Why? Because they hate Israel so bad. And yet Iran is fixing to have to evacuate their capital city of Thrron, which holds millions of people, because they have no water. Look, I I realize I'm not the smartest kid on the block, but you think, why didn't they take some of that money and figure out how to do desalination plants or pump water from here to there to there? But it's like they are obsessed &gt;&gt; with destroying Israel. And I like what I heard Marco Rubio say a little while back as he was standing under a portion of the Temple Mount where archaeologists have put big Ibeams of steel and dug down and found the original steps where the people would come from the pool of Sylum and go up to the temple. AND MARCO RUBIO STOOD THERE AND he said, \"Where are all those nations who tried to destroy Israel?\" &gt;&gt; The Romans, he said, \"Their kingdom has been annihilated. THE ASSYRIANS HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED. THE BABYLONIANS HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED. &gt;&gt; And there's one people left, the people of Israel.\" Oh my. [applause] &gt;&gt; But you see WHAT HATRED WILL DO? HATRED WILL DRIVE people to annihilate themselves &gt;&gt; because they hate this entity OR THIS GROUP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOT NOT ALL, BUT SOME OF THOSE who've left the message, they have such a hatred FOR GOD'S PROPHET. THEY HAVE SUCH A HATRED FOR THIS MESSAGE AND SUCH A HATRED for you who follow it and a hatred for the preachers. Some of them hate me so terribly. They would kill me &gt;&gt; if they could get BY WITH IT. WELL, LET ME JUST SAY IT TO YOU THIS WAY. IF I WAS THINKING ABOUT leaving the message, and I ain't, I certainly wouldn't go to none OF THEM BECAUSE I DON'T SEE more of God in their lives. I see less than what they had when they was among us. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT SOME OF THE PREACHERS that have left and preaching and saying and doing the things they're doing and they want to win me. They want to win you. THEY WANT US TO FOLLOW THEM. AND WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? &gt;&gt; COME ON SOMEBODY. BUT YOU SEE WHEN YOU GET SO UNDER HATRED, YOU LOOK AT THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. THEY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE THEIR LEADERS ARE UNDER THIS HATRED. for the Jews and they can hate him till they burn turn blue in the face and bury every one of them. And when there is no more Iran, Israel is still the chosen nation of God. AND WHEN OH MY ALL THE MESSAGE FIGHTERS AND ALL THE MESSAGE HATERS DIE, GO MY TO THEIR PLACE WHEREVER THAT WILL BE AND THEY STAND BEFORE GOD. DON'T WORRY LITTLE CHILDREN. ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS WORD WILL CATCH YOUR SOUL OUT OF HERE. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF HATRED. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF VARIANCE AND STRIFE, BUT out of love. &gt;&gt; The stand [applause] first John 3:15, \"Whosoever hateth his brother &gt;&gt; is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 verse 20. And if a man say, [snorts] \"I love God,\" and hateth his brother, he is a &gt;&gt; liar. &gt;&gt; For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? How many wants to be godly? &gt;&gt; Love the things God loves &gt;&gt; and hates the things that God hates. &gt;&gt; And look at things that are sin and evil and wrong and out of a heart of love. Brother Malachi, not vengeance, vindictiveness, but out of a heart of love. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, as we stand here today, Lord, I realize this has not been a sermon that made us all probably really happy and they just want to get up and run around the building. Probably most of us wanted to crawl out. Father, we we want to thank you for truth. &gt;&gt; We desire, Lord Jesus, that we can be godly. I'm sure like me, these people have been overwhelmed, all this that we've looked at under the attribute of godliness. But we thank you for it, Father. For truly we desire to be godly. Lord Jesus, I ask you that you'd help each man, woman, boy, and girl. May we search our hearts. I know some of them, Lord, have been so hurt by people and disappointed and let down, and they've been through so many things. as I sat back in the office and whenever I counsel them and hear the terrible things that many of them have been through, not only these people, but ones I've had to talk to around the world, they've experienced heartbreaking things. But yet, Lord Jesus, we believe that your power can so come into our lives that it helps us instead of being harsh, mean, full of hatred, vindictive, we can be forgiving, loving, gentle, and kind. Father, we want to hate the deeds of the nickelans, but yet love them. We don't want to be like that church age as time went on into another church age. And then when it become doctrine, God could not say to the people of that age, you hate it cuz I hate it. But God said, you have. So they had allowed the doctrine of the nickelans. And God had to separate himself from where the church was standing. And God let them know, I hate that thing, but it's easy to see you don't. You've embraced it. Maybe under the disguise of love. But how can it be true love when we love something that you hate? You hate discord. You hate division, telling lies, spreading gossip. You hate all these things, Lord. So, how can we embrace them and say, \"Well, it's the work of God. Oh, yes, God is doing this and doing that.\" When God himself says, \"Don't identify me with that. I hate that.\" So, how is it, Lord, that we can embrace so many this compromising spirit comes in the ranks of our message? And like Israel, we'll let the Amorites live and the Hittites live and the Jebusites live. It started with just one of the small tribes and then it grew from one to the other to the other until before long in their ranks were unbelievers, infidels, agnostics, marrying among them. What a sad thing. It won't be but a few more settings of the sun. We can already see it, Lord. As I see preacher friends of mine that they don't believe this that the prophet taught and some don't believe that that he taught and some don't believe this that he taught. Well, this this was just an idea in the 50s and the 60s and brother Brandham was under this influence of this and that and the other. I never thought I'd ever live to hear such words comes out of message men's mouths, but here we are. So, Father, we pray you'd help us &gt;&gt; to stay true. And then, Lord, we we admit we need your help. How do we treat those brothers who say such things? How do we treat them? When we see the prophet teaching this, this, this, don't do that, don't do that, don't do that, and they do it and they bless it and say it's of God, then how do we treat them? Do we shun them? Do we stay away from them? Do we not speak to them anymore? Or do we disagree with what they're doing and still pray for them and love them from our heart? We need you, Lord. David faced the same thing. It's easy to stand when a bear is charging against you and and raise up against him and take his life. A lion charges against you and you pick up a piece of armament and you take his life. But how do you deal with King Saul? A man who is the anointed of the Lord. A man who is a king chosen by God himself. Teach us, Lord. We know David slipped into the cave and just cut a small piece of his garment off just to let Saul know how close it got to him. And the Bible says his heart smoteed him. &gt;&gt; We need help, Lord, to know how to deal with the times that we're in. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I don't mind telling you, Lord, I'm shocked and surprised by some of the things I hear some of the message preachers saying and doing. We just need your help cuz we don't want to compromise, Lord God. Neither do we want to get to a spot we think we're the only just us and four more and no more. That's all. No, Lord. We don't want that old ecclesiastical thing. &gt;&gt; Teach us, Jesus. We love you, Father. with all of our hearts, praise the Lord. I wonder how many of you today would just with your heads still bowed, please raise your hand to the Lord and say, \"Lord, I I I need help. I I realize, Lord, maybe I've been I've been supporting things and standing with things just that you hate. It makes me feel awful, Lord. makes me feel awful. I want to be right. Lord, teach us. God bless you. Now, I'm going to pray for pray for each of you. Also, we got this prayer request here. Please pray for Lincoln Hornyak. He's been taken to the ER for continued vomiting that is recurring. Heavenly Father, we pray for Brother Lincoln today. Lord, you see this need in his body, Lord Jesus. What's causing this vomiting? In the name of Jesus, I resent this thing from our brother. May the spirit of God move forward. Lord, we join our faith together as your believing children. Lord, we know this is one of the many reasons why we don't want hatred in our hearts. For we know if we hide sin or we've got things in our heart, you won't hear us when we pray. And Lord God, we've got so many needs among us in the day and hour that we live. We don't want our prayers hindered. The husbands and wives don't need to argue and fuss and debate and so on in their home. Peter wrote about it lest their prayers would be hindered. We need each other so desperately in this hour. Father, help us Lord. It's easy for me to see, Father, why the very last attribute before going up into your love is brotherly kindness. Is it that it will be the hardest to achieve? It will be the very capping stone by which divine love sets on top of the closest connection to God himself. brotherly love. Teach us, Jesus. Teach us, oh God. Teach me as a minister. Help me, Father. Help me to know how to deal with issues. Father, help me. I pray, Lord. Oh God, we love you today with all of our hearts. Jesus, come near us now, Lord. If you see anything in my heart, Lord God, that I'm identified with that you hate, make it known to me, Jesus. May you search every heart. Begin here on the platform with me first. Then Lord, while you're here, go to the musicians, song leaders, deacons, trustees, all of us. Father, go to the mezzanine in the back. Go to the sound room up in the top the audio brothers there in the internet. Go out on the streaming. Father, may every heart be searched today. What a heartbreaking thing to know that we love something you hate or we hate something or someone that you love. Saul developed a hatred in his heart against a man who was after your heart. It shows us what hatred can do. And Saul's love changed from the love the way a father would love as a son to way an enemy would hate another enemy. Keep me from such Jesus. Keep our church from hatred. Keep us Lord God from the evil of rottness and corruption in the last day. Father grant it Lord Jesus. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sing something for us. Hey. Oh my. Let's just allow before we go here. I won't keep you much longer. The presence of God just to come by our way now in this cleansing, scouring type of service. Let him look down deep in us. Remember, you're a triune being. your outward being, your flesh, your spirit, imagination, conscience, memory, reason, affection, and then your soul. May the spirit of God search every avenue of every one of us right here today and see if he finds anything that displeases him. Are you willing to let go of it? Are you willing to let go if he finds something? Would you just raise your hand to him and say, \"Lord, take it from me, Jesus. You have my permission. Oh God, hallelujah. We worship you, Lord. We praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to be [singing] like Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; like Jesus on [singing] earth like &gt;&gt; help us Lord from the front to the back Lord God to be [music] like him &gt;&gt; godly like him all through [music] life's journey [singing] from earth to [music] glory my own.

it's a great privilege for us to be gathered together again in the house of God um before we read the word I wanted to say again how much I appreciate all the work and all the effort that everybody's doing in our uh flood relief I'd asked brother Michael earlier this morning before we came to church kind of give me a list of states that he was aware of that people have been sending help from just so everybody will know it would be totally impossible for us to do what has been done so you listen to the list Virginia West Virginia Pennsylvania Georgia Arkansas Kentucky North Carolina Louisiana Oklahoma Arizona and all over the United States of people sending Amazon packages so nered daily sometimes more than one trip a day Amazon is coming and dropping stuff off it gives you hope for Humanity you know you thank God is there anybody left that even loves that even cares for people but there really are there really are I want to say to U all of those of our church that have done all that they're doing daily how much we appreciate it so very much with that being said said a lot of the places where we're taking the stuff that we found so far um we're probably going to slow down to maybe two days a week as far as being able to make the deliveries so brother Michael want me to announce that to you that they will be posting it on Facebook when volunteers can come over and and help them sort through it all and um we so appreciate every hour that you're spending and giving of your time some of our brothers have t taken off work uh to be able to do this our sisters have come brought their children sitting over there in the cafeteria and it's just been it's been wonderful and I want you to know I appreciate it I took her of the I said you know I think it's good myself that I enjoy seeing our youth also coming and helping we need as as the people of God to realize our life is not our own a person that lives a life to themsel lives a very selfish life aelf self-centered life after all eternal life is living for others and doing for others and most of this that we are doing we will never see these people that we're doing it for but we don't have to that's not the reason we're doing it in the first place now myself and the brothers has been able to make some of these deliveries we're seeing the people and some of them we've seen some of them we've been able to see as they come and get food and come and get generators and gasoline and so on and so on but a lot of them that's getting it we will never see and we're not doing it for that anyway we're doing it to help and once again I want to say how appreciative I am for the facility that the Lord has given us to where we can be able to do all that from our place over here can you imagine trying to do this from our old church I told some of the people the other day in North Carolina that they would have died literally died had they been waiting for the federal government to get to them cuz some of the places were going to the federal government still hasn't showed up so they're backs in the hollers and the sticks and all that sort of thing and I told Brother Daryl a while ago I guess one reason that means something special to us going to those places is that's where he found us he didn't find us in the big halls or the great big Cathedrals but he found some of us on bar stools and some of us was in the offest shape that ever was but he and his Mercy aren't you glad glad he's that kind of a God so we're that kind of people so again I can't say enough and I I just want you to know Carol and myself were so proud of each of you of what you're doing some have given time lots have given money there's been thousands and thousands of dollars that's come from businesses and just all kinds of of people that's doing that and we say to them they probably never come to church here never hear me say it but I I would like to acknowledge that as well I want to thanked them for doing it many of the things that's been given have been given because of people here in the church as their business associates and they basically trust them so we want to be able to handle it in of course in such a way that'll please the Lord one day when we all stand before him according to the Bible there is a book I know the name of it it's called The Book of remembrance so everything we do not just in time of flood but everything we do to help anyone the Lord Jesus keeps a record so when these people finally get are able to Res resolve many of their problems and get to a stage of normaly whatever that will be for some of them who's lost absolutely everything and our church will get out of this mode of doing this I'd say we don't stop all the good works I'd say we don't stop being kind as a matter of fact for most of us we didn't just start doing it we've just just never quite done it in this scope before don't you love the Lord for giving us the opportunity to not be able to go around the world you see because I'm the type of person that I am a quiet individual I don't let people know what we're doing people look at our church they wow you know that big church big this big that they're so selfish they don't do this well people don't have a clue but for one time people can be able to look and see oh they're reaching out to the local community they're they're doing something that's just the first time they've saw it in a scope or they can see it but I think there's a reason in all that so I appreciate each one of you everybody understand me every one of you men women boys girls the sisters some grandmothers just coming watching their kids while their their children can be able to help about we just want you to know we're grateful and there's been people of the community or friends of the people that don't even come to church here that want to come in and help so if you find somebody that's not quite dressed up to par you know what's going on but they want to help you know what if they want to help I'm going to let them come and help cuz who knows it might get around us woo something might change their lives praise the Lord let's turn the scripture today in the book of fimon one the smallest books of the New Testament but filled with all types of wonderful nuggets from the word of God we've been speaking about the brides Bill of Rights and today I want to speak to you about the right to a position in Christ the right to a position in Christ fimon just of course the chapter 1 verse 5 hearing of thy love and faith which thou Hast toward the lord Jesus and toward All Saints you see people think they can love God with all their heart and not really love his children that's totally impossible if you love the Lord Jesus right you will love all of his children even those you don't agree with even those that you may not humanly ever have that contact and be close friends with them there's people like that and they may feel the same way about you but you still love them you may not like their ways and like certain things about them that's not even the same thing now look at this verse six that the communication of thy faith communication how in the world do you communicate faith that the communication and the word that Paul uses here is is coia so it's fellowship and being able to ajoin yourself that the communication of thy face may become or come to pass and be effectual that the communication so your your Fai is talking your faith is expressing itself how does faith talk how does faith communicate now what she says that the communication of thy faith may become effectual so a person can have faith in God and an element of his word and believe it's a truth and yet it needs to rise to another level to where the communication of their faith will become so it's not like the communication of your faith initially receives the full impact of all it can be but God gives to every one of of us a Measure of Faith then as we grow that measure can grow with us we will be able to endure more be able to accomplish more and it can also become effectual look at the word here that he used energus which of course you're familiar with the word energy powerful active so the communication of your faith may become powerful and active how just by hearing the word no just by going to church no just by doing good deeds no by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus so you mean that makes our faith more active more powerful more energous has more energy to it I love this word acknowledging you know I'm a meaning guy and I look I like to look up the meanings of these words eposis we've looked at it before precise and correct knowledge used of the knowledge of things ethical and divine so this is how that our faith becomes more effectual by the acknowledging precise knowledge by acknowledging not every good thing that's in our flesh and believe me most of us are professionals at doing that but that's actually not what makes our faith effectual it's by acknowledging with a precise knowledge of what we are in Christ Jesus of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus Philippians 4:8 finally bre Brethren whatsoever things are true now in order not to take up too much time today yesterday when I was studying I took every one of these words and looked up the meaning of them and I don't have some type of special concordance and some type of special bible program all you got to do is go to the Lexicon or the strong concordance you don't have one you can do it online and you click on every one of these words it'll change your life finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things well I can say amen and we can go home if we could get what I've read already this morning will be changed towards the world can I give you the meaning of one more word think on these things I may not say this correctly it's a qu a long long word longed zi to take into account to make an account of now probably most of you here today have a pretty good idea of how much is in your checking account or if you've got a savings account pretty much how much is in there you know how many outstanding checks that you may have and so on so you're not going to write a check for a million dollars if you ain't got but 75 cents in the bank because I'll be coming ministering to you in the jail if you do now this is what people you laugh at that but this is what a lot of times people do spiritually whenever they think above them what they really are so they think they have all this in their account of what they can do who they are so on and so on and so on but the word that Paul uses is absolutely phenomenal read me me hear the meaning of this this word deals with reality if I log isi or reckon that my bank book has $25 in it it has $25 in it otherwise I am deceiving myself this word refers to facts not supposition so then a person with honesty with loyalty with truth with all the great things that we read there then think think on these things so you look at yourself and say am I truly honest am I honest with God am I honest with my wife my husband my brothers my pastor my church am I loyal am I Royal am I true am I faithful and then you can think on that and then you look at the account in your life and you say yeah I think I've got $25 worth of honesty yep there it is on my account I've got $25 so we think on what is factual according to where we are and the church said amen let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus thank you so much for your word today I pray father you would help me to be able to get out of the way Lord I know it's a miracle every time that you're able to get a human being into your hands if it's for five minutes or an hour and they can be able to speak words that have value of eternal life because we as Mortals cannot do that so once again I'm asking for a supernatural event to take place in this service today that you would anoint that part of yourself and my life which is a gift help me Lord that I can step aside I pray also for my brothers and sisters that you would anoint them that they would be able to lay aside their duties of the day and whatever they're going through their anxieties frustrations of life that they may be able to tap into the anointing and grab a hold of what you're saying Lord in this hour that we live we will be blessed and helped father I also pray over this prayer cloth laying before me Lord you see this need of this individual dear God they they need your help Lord they realize without without Supernatural intervention they will die not live and they're fearing death dear God I pray in the name of Jesus you would move on their hearts father may they come to a saving knowledge they requested a prayer call Father May the Holy Ghost go to them today I pray we commit the word the people the speaker and the hearer into your care in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated things that are to be the word made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he was on Earth you suffered with him you died with him and you are risen with him manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I read all that to get to this all that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see our self positionally placed in Jesus Christ so if we have been given the right to have a position in Christ Jesus no doubt it will be one of the greatest battles of our life to be able to get to that spot and then after we are there to be able to maintain it like the children of Israel the historian Usher says the book of of Joshua covers a span of about 26 years so they start in the South SL when they cross the Jordan and they start moving they're moving northward moving northward as they do they're conquering cities they're taking kingdoms they're defeating Kings they leave an element of people behind them so the enemy won't rout around behind them and regain what they took away from them eventually they go to the north up toward the Galilee up to the Northern Heights that the where close to Syria is now and they finally conquer the land now the fighting men are able to go back if their inheritance was down in the South close to Hebron they would go back down there if it was in Ephraim they'd go there manessa Jerusalem wherever they were and whenever they come back now they have to change their mentality they're not fighting to get the land they're no longer running into these masses of Philistines and great Giants and all that by the grace of God they've been able to defeat the masses of them but what they've got is little tiny pockets of these people that are still hid little tiny Pockets here and there and there and it was I'm I'm thinking Joseph that the tribe of Joseph that they they begin to let this certain element of people live and they no longer started killing them well once it started with them it went from there to Dan from Dan to naftali from naftali to Reuben and it was like a move that started moving in the message of that day so instead of slaying the enemy they start letting the enemy live so they're living here they're living there they're living there and the next thing you know then these Jewish men are marrying these women which according to the law they were forbidden to do but now it enters into the element of compromise and God said because you have done this I will leave them here and I will make them to be a thorn in your side now that's a terrible thing because it was not the will of God but it was the people that did that because maybe they figured they had more Love by letting the enemy live remember God is not a cruel God he was not telling them to kill the amorites jebusites Hittites Philistines and so on and so on even their children because God is mean and cruel but he knew a baby amalekite grows up to be an adult amalaki if you'll remember that when you go to letting in little sins and little bitty things that start out as a little tiny baby in your life in your home remember that little tiny sin many times grows up to become a giant how many knows it's a truth from your own life so then they have to change their sinking now they're entering into spot that they're not trying to get more no more property no more boundaries although they never got exactly all the property that God told them but they change their mentality so they're fighting to keep what they've got well it's the same with us we're out there in the world we're lost decrepit blind we don't know anything about God God gets a hold of us saves us sanctifies us and calls us into his body then we find a church hopefully we get into that part of of a Ministry and we go to finding our slot where God wants us to be then why happens the battle changes many of you years ago you battled and struggled so hard with this Habit in your life and that habit you said Lord I'll never get over this but by the grace of God you can look back today and say praise God I'm delivered of that and yet God in a mighty way delivered you well that don't bother me no more and that don't bother me no more but don't think because you're free from those things Satan stops he simply comes in another way sometimes even with some of those things same things to trying to pull you out now of your new inheritance which you've received now it is a spiritual inheritance in that it is a new birth a quick and Seed Gene by the presence of God something you never had before something you never even knew was there so it becomes quickened by the Breath of God then maybe God gives you a wife if you're a man God gives you children so your inheritance is expanding those children grow up now it's a whole lot easier when they're three or four or five years old now son don't you do that don't you do that I'll smack you if you do boy I'm telling you one thing but when you deal with that boy whenever he's 18 or 20 it's a lot different than when he's five is that right so what are you doing your inheritance is expanding and it takes the spirit of God for us as parents to know how to be able to deal with them whenever they get older but what are you doing you're still trying to keep everything that God has given you and it will be a battle from the time that you're born again until you leave this world either by the way of the Grave or by a body change now perfect Fai in our position enables us to be able to see where we are then we can take what what God had Paul to write here in the book of fimon and a the people of God to see and know by the account that they take of themselves do y'all do that to yourself all the time do you ever you know like you balance your checkbook and whether you've got it online and you can pull up your account and you know show your face or whatever and open it up you can see the outstanding accounts or if you still get them in the mail and you do that why so that you'll know where you are just know where you are so you got this working balance or you ain't got that working balance and you're trying to figure out what's going on we ought to do the same thing spiritually okay I'm a Child of God I'm a word believer I believe this I believe that I believe that that's only the as aspect of your account that you're showing on your paper form as we would say but you've always got on the other side it's amazing that when we write those checks that the bank actually takes that out of our account wow why do they do that life would be so much more funner if they wouldn't right if they would just say okay well we're going to do you this favor for the whole year whenever these checks come through we're not going to take it from your account we're actually going to pay it for you wow let me know where you Bank okay but they're not going to do that and it's the same way with trials and tests and sometimes differences that come between us God saying oh Lord I love my brothers that's what the word tells me to do Lord I do I love my brothers and then God will force you to write a check on brotherly love and brotherly love will run through the account and boy the spirit of God knows what he's going to do and he's going to come up and I don't mind telling you there's many times we find our check bouncing on brotherly love I've never had any to bounce on those that get along with me of you oh my goodness those Little Darlings that think the sun rose and set in me I got plenty of money in my account to take care of them saints it's them ones that don't like me it's them ones that don't care for me now I use myself as a big example I got broad shoulders I'm a little man but I got broad shoulders if I do this to some of you it hurts your feelings but sometimes I get tried and I really have to struggle to love folks that don't like me oh Lord brother Donnie not you just like the rest of all you rotten low down mortal sitting you're hearing me today and what happens it's my check runs through the bank and I get a you know it's flagged and I get an acknowledgement as it was I can say on my phone in an app that you're overdown we're going to charge you $35 or whatever your bank personally charge it because you don't have the money to cover that well how in the world is that I'm a Christian I love the Lord I believe the Lord but you've not been monitoring your account properly you see you don't have the right amount of forgiveness that you need for others and you're holding grudges and you're not able to override this and override that and it'll always be those that God knows you struggle with are the ones that push your buttons and you saying how do they know me that well how do they know me to push the combinations of my a and Y and c and Z buttons and that brings me to the peak not of explosion in the Holy Ghost but in your Humanity cuz God wants you to check your account and the church said now watch if we then would be able to walk every day of our life constantly checking our accounts monitoring where we are God help me if I'm short in any Avenue please help me Lord that if there's if there's a check that runs through that it don't come up and fles that I'm short on what needs to happen now when the Lord Jesus come to the Earth we know we preached on this for years and years that he so condescended to our level that he laid aside this this stupendous Glory that was there and he become one of us and he laid aside all his robes and his dim and everything that was there and stepped into a body of Flesh and become a human being that he might be able to feel the way we feel so no doubt the Lord Jesus there was people that he really really could feel close to we know there's even certain disciples he was closer to than others and yet no doubt there was also people that he just you know he grieved and he sigh the scripture tells us that he did and he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and tipped it in all points like as we are so the Lord Jesus must have as a human become frustrated sometimes with the people that he loved the most and those that said they loved him the most and said they understood him and believing you imagine James and John when they come to him and they want a great exalted position and how Jesus reprimands them and he uses this instance in a way I'd imagine old James and John their face got as red as blood because they felt like that Jesus was publicly humiliating them and to be honest with you they needed it because they wanted themselves they thought themselves Superior over the rest of the brothers I hope you understand we still got a few jameses and John's around the message but the key about James and John at that time was they didn't have the Holy Ghost we never find James and John ever doing that again and the church said so you see without the Holy Ghost and our soul we will never have the proper Measure of Faith to be able to communicate the faith that we have to give us confidence in our position now whether or not you understand this the Lord Jesus even though he was the word and the fullness thereof made flesh he condescended Beyond a spot even though he knew he pre-existed now pre Jesus stage he was Christ listen pre human body stage he was Christos logos thought fullness of God attributes of everything God was pre Jesus now remember Jesus was not existing in the Old Testament what is Jesus human body of redemption but it was Christ the Bible does not say Moses chose to suffer the reproach of Jesus but the reproach of Christ what is Christ the anointed one the anointed Ed word so he must condens sin then when he becomes Jesus to a place that he's not living operating thinking overcoming doing all that with the fullness of Christos in his soul because how can you and I be compared to him so if we would be compared to him him was all of that great power and that's the way he overcome and then he' turn and tell us be of good Comfort I've overcome the world you said well sure you could because you've got the fullness of God in you well and yet that gives you a great Advantage but he overcome as a man with the Holy Ghost he did not overcome The Temptations of Matthew 4 as God he did not die on the cross as God but as a man so Jesus himself actually allowed himself to to be deprived of the dependency to depend on and overcome by this preexistence thought of Christ so he overcomes as Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost now in order to accomplish this you say why in the world would he do that so he could come back to the state of perfect faith in who he was now remember he was not born of the Virgin with that state remember they they they never called him Jesus Christ at his birth but Thou shalt call his name why he was not Christos at his birth that did not happen to 30 years later then the father come in Him Praise the Lord now then becomes Jesus Christ as a matter of fact you'll never even find him being referred to in the four gospels as the Lord Jesus Christ he never gained that title till after the resurrection Lord father Jesus man Christ Christo anointed word so he allows himself to be on this Earth for this period of time and he actually steps apart from these great attributes and he allows himself to be grown into a measure of perfect Faith so it's not like that he looked at it and said oh I know who I am I know everything about me I know all my trials are over I know all my tests is over I knew I pre-existed I knew I was the word I am the one who created all things all things were made by me and for me and without anything made that was made but he actually stepped back from that him himself and allowed himself to grow Luke 2:52 he grew in wisdom and understanding before God and man so the Lord Jesus would have to read the word and whenever he read the word about scriptures pertaining to himself and actually gave him face wow yes sir the very author of Faith himself had to grow in faith notice this oh my I love this perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him and he said now and my I can do nothing I can do nothing but it's my facei in God and God was in him and the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you amen it's made manifest for you are a Believer listen this this is why I do not believe every person that says they are a Believer is this kind of believer believer and a Believer is the Fai of God that moves in you a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you that's a real believer you like that you like that I like I like like the teaching of where we can see what faith really is now turn with me if you would to Genesis 3:1 let's let's look back at the Garden of Eden now and whenever Satan come against the first human being on the earth now remember they were positionally placed in the Garden of Eden Adam was placed first years later years and years and years after God had stopped creating he brings Eve into existence now watch the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay has God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden I want you to notice this is not a talking rattlesnake this is not a talking Copperhead or a talking gardener snake or a black snake it was a two-legged snake that's the kind you really got to watch most of us are scared to death copperheads and rattlesnakes and boy constrictors and all kinds of things like that and set under a two-legged snake that's leading you Soul To Hell Amen Brother D now what did happen Moses breaks into this and and he he doesn't go in to what had happened prior to this in order to make Genesis 3:1 able to say what it does but what happened of course we know was that Satan had a soul but the serpent did not have a soul but he had a place for a soul and Satan is wanting to inject himself into the human race he's wanting the Earth he's wanting a domain by now the Angels had already fallen and Satan had went over on the north side of heaven and preached to the angels and exalted himself above them and so many of them pulled away from the kingdom of Michael which was Christ and they joined over there where were they what Dominion what domain I I don't know I'm not sure that any of us know but I'm sure that the Angels fa the prophet tells us that God created to the Earth and brought it into existence after the Angels had already fallen so this was a Heavenly dispensation where they were so when God started creating the M the millions and millions or trillions maybe it is now of planets that they have found there was this one little tiny Speck of dust that God put out in the middle of this tremendous culdesac I'll call it called our galaxy and God put it in so many miles away from the the center of the universe and God gave it a moon and God gave it a sun and God placed it in exact proximity of where it needed to be to be able to produce what is called the habitable zone now our our planet rotates approximately being where it is to our our greatest sour of Light which is the sun approximately an average of 93 million miles from the Sun now if it was several thousand miles closer then the temperature would be so hot none of us could live if it was several thousand miles farther away it would be colder than it would be like Pluto or Mars so God placed it exactly in the right Zone where life could come upon it and uh our next main object of light of course being the moon on an average of I'm thinking maybe 237,000 miles now not million but Thousand Miles then our closest neighbors all around and we look out in the night sky and we see them so they they were placed there positionally in what is called the horizontal rainbow and then there's the ecliptical view which is what we can see from the Earth but what's amazing is I've been in South Africa and different continents of the earth and when you look at the night sky in South Africa it looks different than what it does here in the hills of Tennessee now being to Canada and seeing the northern lights and when you look at it from there it looks different from there so I'm told from being out in outer space whenever they look at it they see it totally different so if a person was on another planet and looking this way and look toward the Stars you'd never be able to read the same images of Leo the Lion the Virgin Urus you'd never be able to see it so it's like whoever put the Earth where they did they put it in such a spot that they could look at the night sky and read the story of redemption reconciliation the fall of the Dragon amen Aras so on and so on so God works and operates off of position you follow me so far or dilute some off the horizontal rainbow position is very important to God our spiritual position and also our natural position so the devil had had embodied The Serpent and the serpent could already talk of course he was the next one closest to man on the earth so God creating every form of life and he come right up right before he made his son he made this beast and he give him a futuristic image by that I mean he was the closest one that looked like man so if God made man in his own image and God is invisible well where do we get this image at then God is invisible right and yet the Bible said I to the image of God made he them male and female created he them where was that image Christ Christ so God places him in the garden and and oh my what a paradise it must have been and God simply gave them the a very simple command and God just told Adam I remember at this stage Adam was not planting So Adam wasn't going out digging holes you know and planting it and Miracle growing it and mulching it and all that sort of thing he all all that was already done for Adam but what God told Adam to do is just d dress it and keep it that's all you got to do just go out there and dress it you see anything needs to be done just dress it keep it so every day he would just go out in his dominion and he would dress it and keep it and all my just lived a beautiful wonderful life but there was one sad part about that life in that he had no one to share it with so he lived it by himself and then God opens up his side and brings out this rib and and then God divides his spirit and pulls out this feminist part because she was in him and places this inside this body that God has made which is not in the original creation and then when he when he woke up maybe God would have said to her now go over there and stand by just take him by the hand I've done it many a time with our Saints some sitting here and some that's gone on I'd be the first face they would see after a surgery well I can imagine that'd be frightening but I'm there with them patting them on the shoulder you know or holding their hand or whatever and you imagine when Adam went to sleep he went to sleep by himself but he woke up with someone her long blonde hair hanging down her back maybe real long beautiful hair her blue eyes as blue as they could be the azur skies that the Lord God had created and when he goes to batting his eyes as the Divine anastesia goes to wearing off and he comes to himself and he feels something he had never felt before it was a small dainty hand he actually felt two cuz one was under his and another one was on top of his It's A peculiar feeling within his humanity and he finally comes to him he opens his eyes and he looks there and something was in him struck his being and all of a sudden the revelation of God flooded his soul and he said you are is shy because you came from ish ish is our English word man Isa is the word woman the devil watching in the operating room or from the outside doorway at least seeing a suff thises it this is my way my entrance into the human race the Angels his Fallen Angels standing around him imagine him turning around saying mark it down I will get her by getting her I don't really want him he's Original Seed I can't mix myself with him but I can mix myself with her she is only a channel to accomplish the means I desire I want his domain so now I catch you up to verse two and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die now let's look again carefully at verse three but of the fruit of the tree Hebrew words are unlike our English words they can mean have two different meanings that are so opposite look at this word per this is what the word Moses used for fruit produce of the ground or offspring uhoh Offspring children progeny of the womb oh I mean I thought was talk about an apple tree oh was it a cherry tree maybe a pomegranate mango why are we talking about progyny or children or offspring of the womb from a tree in the Garden of Eden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst Toc middle among a number of persons so there is a middle ground of a number of persons between of things arranged by TW so we've got a man tree a woman tree if the man tree will come to the woman tree the progyny will be Christ but it's arranged by twos so if the right is arranged by twos there must also be another person on the other side of the dark side so it cannot be Eve alone because the middle can only be an arrangement between two persons well I believe this is about the quietest I ever heard y'all mou life children it's okay to breathe I mean it don't scare me you can there you go everybody now on three breathe in and out now listen this oh my my and the serpent said into to the woman you shall not surely die now what are we talking about position so what's it trying to do talk her out of her position I just it just because you find the word the message of the hour I should say it finds you by the grace of God and leads you to it don't mean that you won't fight all hell after you find the truth because Satan will do his best to try to talk you out of your place the way to did Eve in the Garden of Eden same might with every God called preacher every God called Deacon every trustee you know whoever you are just La member if God leads you here at our church we welcome everyone that God calls here that's as a matter of fact that's all I want here is those that God wants I'm not interested in having a big church I personally prefer a small church but I want everyone here that God wants but just because God leads you here don't mean that you won't fight to stay here until you get here so the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die now he's saying exact opposite of what God Said her position will be determined by her response will she say what the word says about her by his stripes I am already healed oh wish she said well the doctor said it was a hopeless case well you know what the doctor he may been perfectly honest but until the Lord says otherwise we believe what the Lord says now once he's going to explain the reason why he's already opened the womb of her mind now for God does know that in the day you eat thereof you're going to be blind lost wretched thrown out of the Garden of Eden you'll never have peace again another day in your life you're going to cause every blind child you're going to cause every man every woman he's not going to tell her the truth but God knows in the day you eat thereof oh wow then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes now let me just say this before I go into the meanings of this words I've eat a lot of apples in my life and like you I've got my favorites but I ain't never in my life eat no apple no Peach no apricot I've eat fruits in China fruits in Egypt fruits in Israel fruits in different parts of the world where I've been I ain't never had no fruit to do to me what we're fixing to read about so then I have to question maybe it's a different type of fruit and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant desire wish longings of one's heart lust so if any of you all ever went to Kroger and you see those honey crisp or those Macintosh or Gayla or and you're just standing there lusting oh I can't control myself I'm lusted I'm lusted Lord have mercy honey send me after church I'll buy you one if that's what so if any of you ever lusted after an apple like that you mean an apple does that to you well you starving to death you ain't never had no fruit in your life or what notice the mean's words now as I said you look at where I'm getting this Hebrew lexicon longing of one's heart lust appetite covetousness in a bad sense thing desired object of Desire oh I want that pump no I want it so bad I just can't take it I got come on be realistic and it was Pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired covet take pleasure in Delight to be desirable to Delight greatly desire greatly now maybe you've ate of an apple I've never tasted before to make one wise I am familiar with an apple today keeps a doctor away but I ain't never found one that can make you wise so she's standing there with this apple said oh oh if I could get that Apple I would be a PhD an lldd A Bachelor of Arts a Bachelor of Science a bachelor of chemistry a oh if I could just get that Apple if I could get it I'd become so wise thank God for the evening light a tree to be desired to make one wise to look upon have Insight so whatever this fruit is is going to illuminate her and what's it going to illuminate her about herself oh you were made for this you see your husband's never told you about this has he he's never illuminated you he's never enlightened you can't you see how tricky the devil is so this whatever this is is going to give her wisdom about herself it's going to illuminate her about herself what she is her potential friends cannot you see the political stance of our day she's he's trying to get her to doubt her god-given position and convince her she's another can't you see why politics in our nation and around the world is identity politics have you wondered and not understood why the homosexual agenda the transgender agenda look look how go sex this sex that sex something else why it started with sex in the beginning and it will end up in the same way so then what do they do they feed this and they started years ago of course not with so much the children but now it's aim right toward the children and trying to put image and slded seeds in their mind even though biologically they were born a girl but try to convince them you're not really a girl you're not really a girl you're a boy and try to tell a boy I mean I ain't too smart but you ought to be able to look at certain parts about you that ought to be the answer unless you're a knucklehead or you're under the influence of this agenda of the last day which is going to bring this world into destruction so what do they do they crossdress and some of these perverted abominable denominations churches bringing all this into their churches and showing it out before the little children why sewing a seed in their mind they not really a boy you're not really a girl what do they want to do change them from what God made him God made you to be a holy ghost filed child of God don't you let the devil talk you out of your place oh my oh my goodness so the word wise on the meaning of this word I would advise you to buckle up your seat belt cuz it may be a bumpy right to look at have insight to have Insight have comprehension apparently all the apples that I've got they must have been stripped of all these abilities I just get the plain old plain old apples you know that tastes good to have comprehension to lay yes sir crosswise some of you people that think you're so polished I ain't talking about you I'm talking about some of Renegades that like to listen to me to pick every word I got to say I challenge you you look it up in your Bible and you'll find the same meanings and let me say it again I put the challenge forth several years ago some of you that's pulling away from this word of this hour I make the challenge again if you're so right and we're so wrong meet me somewhere and we'll go to an insane institution and I'll pick the worst one in there and you pick the second one and let's see your God work don't give me your words don't give me your words you're not known by words you're known by power and demonstration so if we're wrong and we're Hellbound and let's see you do the works of God then if it don't shut your mouth a YouTube channel ain't nothing oh come on somebody don't sit there and get all scared to death act like a bunch of chickens come on put your wings in the air act like eagles this morning I'm not afraid to say that if you're right and we're wrong let God speak for you let God speak on your behalf YouTube Don't Count Google don't count the power of God is what counts and testifies [Applause] dear Jesus girl told me Wednesday night she said it sound like John the Baptist is at the church tonight oh my notice here in verse seven the eyes NOW Watch What Happens let me let me breathe the light part of this verse six let me goad and start the STP again when the woman saw the tree was good forfill that it was pleasant to the eyes in the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her gave unto her husband with her and he did it I see some of you is getting because your face is red as blood oh oh my this is how oh my that Satan injected himself this is what brings floods this is what brings storms I tell you some of the stuff I've seen the last few days I come home telling Carol said you know what I saw today is I looked across the Earth and I saw ravaged by these floods and all these things I told her I said some of these things that I saw we they will never they'll never be changed until the coming of the Lord trees 100 years old trees 50 years old 75 years old this Earth shall still still be bearing the scars in the tribulation period from this hurricane to come up to here but one of these days when the son of David comes on the earth she'll be healed of all of her wounds hallelujah oh children we want to be a part of a kingdom which will never end and the only way we can do it is get in our place and stay there oh dear God verse seven the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked I quote the prophet in saying this right if eating apples it makes you realize you're naked we better pass the apples around again so whatever it was they partook of open their senses that never felt fear that never felt anxiety heartache trouble you imagine the moment that they realized we have been lied to what a horrible thing it's going to be one day when people are judged before the white throne and they hear those words depart from me you workers of iniquity and as a man had a dream many many years ago he was in the regions of the lost and he would reach down and pick up a man and look at him drop him back down and go pick up another and look at him drop him back down go look pick up another drop him back down and someone in the dream said what's he looking for and a voice answered back for that man who sent that preacher that preached him into hell Being A God Called man can be one of the greatest honors of life but to be a preacher that don't tell the truth you couldn't hardly have any worse thing ever happen to you I know you pray for the ministry but pray for him like never before Oh my God and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons that's the English word the Hebrew word is loin cloth well if they ate an apple why was not it the first sign of human beings wearing masks that's what they told us we're supposed to do right we found out there lying so why didn't Adam and Eve go out there and then they get why get a fig Leaf I mean get one of these little video guys and just s them together and come out of the garden of e and got your Hello Lord how you doing well God I tell you one thing we realize that we uh we ate this apple here and we got we disobeyed the word so we decided that we'd make a we'd make a mask and we'll wear a mask around why would they cover thems with a loin cloth Lucifer got out of his position talk the serpent out of his position he talked Eve out of her position she talked Adam out of his then when God comes down in the Garden of Eden that day and search for his children it was their custom to go to church every day so God showed up a church and they wasn't there so he goes through the garden of Edom Adam Adam where are you he knew where he was but he's waiting for Adam to cry out here I am father I'm lost help me oh my so God kills a lamb and takes the skin off of it throws it in behind the bush and Adam says I'm hid I was afraid I was afraid and I hid myself who told thee that thou was naked and stop partaking the fruit of which I forbid me the woman that thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the fruit so the Lord God calls them to come out here walks the serpent God looks at him and says because you have done this thing on your belly you will go and dust will be your meat all the days of your life and somebody please remind me what have our human bodies made out of can't you see why he gets a thrill out of tormenting you why he gets a thrill out of trying to make you sick so he lost his legs his punishment is bowing down and on your belly you'll go he wasn't on his belly before that's in your Bible right but if you notice he offers No Redemption then the Lord says unto the man and you remember the story and the woman and you imagine they heard a harshness in God's voice that never heard before and it frightened them sometimes the way we get scared in church y'all ever hear that in the voice of God you say oh Jesus oh Jesus I'm sorry why it's it's the laziness of humanity that sometimes he has to raise his voice above a whisper and yet people don't like a preacher like that a lot of preachers that shows and not preaching with the voice of God CU sometimes God gets angry with us and upset with us and he use a man to express and God must have raised his tenor of his voice and changed and and my Adam was looking at him but oh I never heard talk before Oh and evil Stander shake it and oh Adam Adam ad what have we done and as much as it broke his heart he said leave get out get out the prophet said I can see him little Eve lays her head over on his chest she starts crying his tears out of his eyes come down and mingle with her tears and they run down his body and that sheep skin slapping against his leg the tears and the blood merge together God showing the tears of a repentant sinner mixing with the blood of the Lamb will produce the Covenant and the pillar of fire come down and got in front of him and said wait a minute I promise you I will bring you back you see friends before there can ever be a resurrection in this last day the bride must come to her position it will be so powerful whenever member of the the bride that's on the earth comes to their position it will cause a resurrection and a Rapture look at how powerful position is so when Jesus dies and raised again Jesus could not he could not call the General Resurrection before he went to the Cross but when he raised and he told John in the Book of Revelation I am he that was dead and I have the power of death hell and the grave he did not have the keys and his hands when he raised liers from the grave he did not have the keys in his hands when he raised the wiow from name son that didn't happen to do he went down on the door of hell and he snatched it now he's got the voice of the entire resurrection and when his bride comes to her place the bride in China the bride in Japan the bride in Guam the bride all over Africa the bride all over India the bride all over the United States when they come to their place they may not have to be there but an hour but all over the Earth the bride will arise and she will say I'm where he wants me to be and your wife will be send it and your children will be S and others will be saying it and all over the Earth they'll be sing it at the same time I'm where he wants me and he can answered back and said sweetheart sin you're worri I want you I'm going to be where you want me come home come on oh God help us Romans 12:5 Paul says so we being many or one body in Christ and everyone members of one another 1 Corinthians 1:2 and to the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours verse 29 that no flesh should glory in his presence verse 30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption 2 Corinthians 2:14 now thanks be unto God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and make us manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place Galatians 2:16 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the face of Jesus Christ not faith in him but by the facei of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ this is the way a True Believer believes in Jesus Christ not a nominal Fai not a nominal belief but a believer's belief let bu it hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah many of you know the Exodus walk as God called us out of where we were from Egypt as it were we've experienced the mult multitude that fell away we've experienced the Mana we've experienced the water from the rock we've experienced those wonderful things that God did for us but could it be that we've moved into the Book of Joshua remember the hand that God showed the prophet whenever he led him into the dream of the vision and he come down the hand and pointed to this in Joshua remember Joshua repres represents not some certain preacher but the holy ghost that is going to lead every believer into their position many of you are already there it's not like you're going to wake up after a while and oh praise God I'm finally going to get straightened out all 60 years of my life has been in vain absolutely not all it is is just being able to recognize that you're there and then once you get there by the communication of your face you can have the acknowledgement and allow it to grow and become energized and be God what God wants you to be because of your confession in Christ Jesus I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy Ghost brother Donnie will we always be human always until the body change that's right but Paul didn't say acknowledge what you are in your flesh but acknowledge what you are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I may would just raise your hand to the Lord today and say Lord help me to be that Give Me Faith in who I am Give Me Faith so the Lord Jesus read the word and it gave him Faith about who he was no doubt it helped him when he read about Moses no doubt it helped him when he read about Joshua and many of the Old Testament characters but it done something different for him when he read what was written about himself remember when it when he went to the church at Nazareth several years ago we stood on that that little place there and they reconstructed a little small community there in Nazareth and it's a it's a steep place it's kind like almost a brow that's on a head it kind of juts out a little bit and they they LED Jesus to this place after he reads the scripture when he read the scripture the anointing is upon me cuz he's anointed me to preach the gospel and Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfill so what did he do he read the scripture pertaining to himself and it gave him face I just can't keep on wondering if he didn't have an Enlightenment an understanding of what they were fixing to do and they led him to that that precipice am I going to kill him but the father give him that something and the Bible says he passed right among them just turned and walked away how did he do that by faith in his position cannot you have faith in who you are I'm a Christian I'm an heir to Healing I'm an heir to Deliverance well brother Donnie I've got my mistakes and my faults you're always going to have that that is nothing to do with your new birth and your inheritance both of my daughters made mistakes and I had to correct them and had to deal with them they were still my daughters even when they didn't did what I want them to do they were still my daughters even whenever I had had to correct them and you'll always be a son or daughter of God if you're born of his presence can we stand our feet praise the Lord Jesus I love this in Ephesians 1:1 I know you know it Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful am in Christ Jesus that's me that's you Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Ephesians 2:6 hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them a predestinated seed will have a predestinated walk and this is it right here good works and the saints of God said how many wants it with all your heart I need more of you let's just sing it together now and let's just meditate for a few minutes before we go on the things that we've heard I know friends there's so much trouble going on and so much stuff going around us and it's hard for us to keep our mind but remember the scripture gives us the direction on what to think about whatsoever thing are lovely and honest and of a good report all of that don't don't let us become so sidetracked with just things of life that

but father it's by your grace your mercy Lord your loving hand father reached down and you completely did away with the facts and Lord we're here today by your truth and we just God we ask this this evening that you'll just come and speak to our hearts Lord that you would be the voice behind the voice father it not be a man standing here to try to say anything that would help anybody personally but Lord may it be you to come and and just console the Heart Tonight Lord you you see the need here at the church you see what the church has been through the great Affliction but Lord we believe right now father that you're still God you're still on the throne and you're still much able tonight to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think so we just Commit This service into your hand hands Lord and we just want to say thank you for it now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles we can be turning to 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 7 just want to greet you in the precious name of the Lord just say what a great honor it is to be here with you this evening you each of you have been in our prayers the church has been in our prayers the Reagan family the Parker family has been on our prayers you know there's churches as we have we're sister churches and yet there's a great bond between many of us and our churches and when you suffer we suffer and you've not suffered alone and sister Erica didn't go down and defeat but she's going to rise in Victory right and that's what we believe tonight the truth is she's already won the truth is between 6:00 and 9: in the morning she's going to come walking through these doors the truth is she's already waiting on us the truth is it ain't over yet God has to final save tonight and so we just we just want to want to greet you and just I'm glad to have my wife with me my daughter Rebecca was supposed to be here tonight but she kind of took a sickness from the camp and his home or back at uh the house there running fever but we want to thank brother Donnie for having us uh glad that he and sister kurl can get away and trust that they can get a time of refreshing after everything settles here and want to say thank you to brother Caleb and sister Ruth for having us they've taken us in like orphans but I'm going to tell you man I've been living like a king and house it's been wonderful I just told my wife said I sure hope we hadn't overextended our stay but we're we're greatly honored to be here and we bring greetings from our church our pastor brother Tim but if you have your Bibles here I want to speak to you tonight on this ain't going to be the end this ain't going to be the end you believe that tonight how many of you come to have church tonight now Brother Lou kind of gave a preface of how I preach so you know you've seen us uh I'm not going to be a berserk up here but we just want to say something that's going to encourage you but we find here in 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 but we have this treasure this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death of for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present s us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man's outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and external weight of Glory while we look not on the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal God bless you tonight you can have your seats sure enjoy the specials and the youth choir it's great to see the young people appreciate that great to see the young people tonight just worshiping the Lord I think we have seen a change in our youth in this message over the last maybe the five to six years we've seen a shift we've seen those that you know they didn't want to have anything to do with it it was the rules of does and don'ts but now there's been such a love affair and these young people are are just apt to get to every camp meeting they can I know for you got four kids like me you take out home loans and send them to these camps cuz it means that much to you but you know I just enjoy to see their Zeal for the Lord and so thankful for that we look here in Psalms 34 and: 18 the Bible says that the Lord is n unto them that have a broken heart and he saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord we become a Christian and our lives are committed to God it's not going to be a flowery better eats it's not going to be just you know cupcakes and and and pancakes and anything else and and things like that but we're going to go through hard times and even as churches we're going to face difficult moments but the Bible says the Lord deliver them out of them all we have a promise tonight that God will deliver God's not going to allow you to keep going down in that same path of Destruction God's not going to let your young people go down in destruction but we have a promise that God is is faithful and he's faithful to his word and he's faithful to his people that will uphold his word and we know that as long as we're in this world and long as we're in these bodies I don't know about you but these bodies ain't perfect yet but as long as we're in these this body this this decaying Humanity we're going to face trouble we're going to face hardships we're going to face many difficult times but though this outward man perish the Bible says the inward man is renewed day by day by day by day by day how are you renewed cuz you feed on the word of God day by day by day by day we're not trying to get in on our own marriage or what family we're born into or or what church we're attend no the inward man is renewed by the word of God that's why God sent us a prophet God sent us a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith so that the inward man would be renewed and draw strength from the word because he knows this is not how it [Applause] [Music] ends oh Hallelujah see there's going to be times and it feels like even here maybe for a local church you're feeling like it's trouble on every side yeah trouble on every side but the inward man is invigorated he's renewed and the Bible tells us I love how the Bible puts it we're troubled on every side that word trouble means to be squeezed how about how many of you have ever been squeezed you just you feel the pressure of this age you know some people are looking for a squeeze stupid I'm ain't looking for I'm looking to get out of the squeeze but people are looking for the squeeze to come and when the squeeze comes we know he's coming look church I don't know if you're de dumb and blind but the squeeze is here we're persecuted on every side the Bible tells us we're troubled we're squeezed we're in his grasp we're pressed hard but not distressed Oh Glory to God tonight we may be in a battle but we ain't lost to war yet we may be persecuted but God is still on our side the facts may be stacked against you but the truth is we've already won the truth is we serve a living God the truth is he's still on the throne Bible tells us that we're perplexed and that word perplex is filled with uncertainty sometimes how many sometimes you don't know which way to go you're praying for answers and answers are not there you're trusting and you're like Lord are you even hearing my prayer the Bible says we're we're perplexed we fill with uncertainty yet not in Despair and the word despair is at at a complete loss as those that have no Hope Oh church we got a hope we got our anchor steadfast and sure that's behind the veil let me tell you we got something to be glad about tonight we got something to worship God about tonight will you say brother Joe something just drastically happened to our church I understand that and I grieve with you but yet the word is still true God is going to see us through this God is going to see you you through this oh this ain't the end church this is only the beginning of great things for Word of Life Church bible would tell us that we're persecuted pursue from place to place follow around with menaces and curses and reproaches imprisoned and threatened with the severest of tortures I don't know about you but my I feel like that every day we're persecuted but not forsaken brother Jackie thank you Lord Brother Jackie even in your old age you may have been persecuted and you've been perplexed there's been times you didn't know which way to turn but God had never left you alone and you're still here as a mighty warrior still standing for this truth sa said well I'm going to take them I'm going to take them by this and I'll take him by that but the devil don't have the final say God has the final word God has the final say and he's here to T tonight it ain't going to end like that amen we've been cast down and that word there means to be thrown down dashed into pieces but yet not destroyed oh I love that not not ruined we don't lose that word destroyed there means to lose we don't lose Church why cuz God can't lose and though we're troubled on every side perplexed and persecuted and cast down the Bible never states that the believer is defeated right the Bible never states that we we go down and defeat we lose it's over that's not what the Bible says but to every contradiction to the persecution God said there's a promise of Resurrection God says there's a promise of a new day God says there's a promise that this is not how it end it ain't over until God says it's over and God's still on the throne he's still full of rich and mercy and Grace for you [Applause] tonight many times the adversary has Us in his grasp many times we're troubled amilies go through Cycles troubles in the home churches go through Cycles Seasons trouble come to churches it seems like the adversary wants to get you at your weakest moment when you've been in battle and you you smelt the breath of the enemy in your face grasp his hands upon you brother that's real when he whispers in your ear there's no hope for you you might as well quit you might as well stop while you even trying don't you understand you just wasting your time the pastor's time the church's time your family's time you're wasting their time but I'm here to tell you tonight you're not wasting time church God has called you for this oh let me just tell you like one back in 19 1979 there was a man by the name of John Paul Jones how many famili with John Paul Jones oh he was a he was a general there and he he sail the Great season this was during the Revolutionary War time and it was the battle at flambo and yet here he was little lone ship he was after the British army sometimes you may feel isolated sometimes you may feel all alone and he had 41 ships that were coming against him and he turned his boat to the broad side of the enemy ship and he blasted his two 18lb guns and when they blasted the the the guns blew up and blew a great big hole in the ship and the ship was was on fire and his ship was taking in water and it seemed like he was going down and the captain from the other ship said do you surrender he said I have yet begun to fight oh come on church tonight oh you may have been hit enemy hit just church and he come and put a hoing but I'm here to tell you tonight we have yet begun to fight we're standing tonight for the truth we're standing for healing we're standing for deliverance we're standing for thust sayith the Lord we're now backing up we're not giving in we're standing here we're going to fight to the Finish we're going to fight to the end see Satan wants you to surrender he wants you to give up and walk away in defeat brother Lance Parker called me this morning or this evening and he sent me a text the day before sister Erica passed away and he said this is her comment that stupid devil right here she is gasping for breath that stupid devil he knows that it ain't going to end like this and so that's where I took my text tonight it ain't going to end like this right no it look like it ends in defeat it looks like we're taking on water it looks like we're destroyed oh it looks like we're persecuted it looks like we're defeated oh but Church we're not persecuted we're not in this we're not forsaken it is not the end of the end we're just beginning to fight come on Word of Life this is the time you fight like you never fought before this is the time you gather together like a church body like you never had before this is a time that we were we come together with one resolve one determination whatever we're going to live and we're going to preach and we're going to stand for this word this is a time not to lay down your weapon this is a time to fight don't give up don't walk away this is a time to be greater committed to the cause this is a time to be more determined than ever to be Fearless sometimes you know what it takes to get Fearless a nice drink of whiskey you're like brother Joe what do y'all do down in Louisana well I'm going to go ahead and be honest we get drunk right oh there was a a bar on 1700 three Highway 371 called even like Tabernacle you can walk in there sober but oh let me tell you you get your a good drink of that Holy Ghost you get your a good drink of that man you feel like you're 10t tall and bulletproof like that little mouse fell in that wine jar just Goble Goble Goble go back down and drink more by the time that jar was empty he kep crawling out of that jar where is that old cat at anyway let me tell you where is that Old Devil at anyway we have just begun to fight this ain't the end this is just the beginning and we're coming together we're rallying together what for the final push for the final call for the great fight we're not going down in defeat but we're coming together the church body Satan wants you to think there's no chance of survival you know we find today reports are coming in over over and over this one went cancer that one went cancer and when you hear it fear just seems to grip us doesn't it fear begins to grip us but you know I'm determined to preach Faith like never before that God is still on the throne either God's word is truth or it's not either he's a Healer or he's not either he's a deliverer or he's not right either the prodical come home or they don't but I'm here to tell you I can testify that God is his word and his word never fails in the mouth of a Believer amen yes sir but Satan wants you to give up he wants you to surrender he don't want you to think there's any chance of survival he wants you to think that death is the only option he doesn't want you to fight but Winston Churchill would say it like this when his country was in the greatest battle of their life greatest conflict he said we shall defend our Island whatever the cost we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender maybe the devil's whispering in your ear surrender just give up walk away don't you see God don't keep his word I'm here to tell you we're going to fight for truth church let me just put in my own words tonight we're going to we're going to defeat in this message with everything that we got whatever the cost we're going to fight for our families we're going to fight for our children we're going to fight for our healing we're going to fight for deliverance we're going to fight for Joy we're going to fight for peace we're going to fight for the Holy Ghost we're going to fight for the supernatural we're going to fight for prayer L we're going to fight for alter call we're going to fight all devil here to tell you tonight we're going to fight it ain't going to end like you think it is there a great big church here that's all Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the power of God tonight we're not backing up it may appear that the enemy's winning it may many are sick diagnosis of cancer coming in left and right homes are being destroyed marriages are in shambles many have walked away from this message young people strung out on drugs right but it don't end like that I'm telling you Church it ain't going to end like that brother B Will Tell Us in the greatest battle ever fought he goes there you are he said it takes the word of God cut your way through every doubt see sure that's it that's the next job let it get done right next thing I'm going to do is get away from my doubts and cut it down and that's my next job is get all my frustrations away can we just for a few minutes tonight get all of our frustrations away get all the cares of today in this week behind us and say God I'm going to cut my way through all the doubts cut my way through all the unbelief cut my way through all the Affliction cut my way through all the nonsense Lord I'm going to C my way through tonight and receive from your [Applause] word see my senses tell me Well you feel bad come on Word of Life well I just don't feel like it well poor you man you look at brother Ron Spencer stage four cancer brain lungs throughout his body that man gets up there and un pukes his guts up the night before and yet he's standing there preaching the gospel like you never been sick and you say well I got a toothache I got a headache I broke my fingernail oh come on somebody it's is time that we get in and we lay into this word and we attend the services and let the new man or the inward man be renewed service after service after service with with a more determination to serve God like never before cut your way through the doubts right you know young people you got to cut your way through some things got to cut your way through some family strains right there's a lot of things you got to overcome as a young person yes sir a lot of complexes you got to overcome am I good enough am I pretty enough am I skinny enough well let me tell you you ain't going to ever be enough that's right because devil was going to keep putting something out there a little bit better a little bit skinnier a little bit better looking a little bit prettier come on oh but we're not basing ourself and our character and where God wants us on anything that the devil has to offer so you got to pull down and cut your way through complexes and cut your way through depression cut your way through those suicidal thoughts right right brother Andrew and I have done a lot of prayer lines in youth camps together a lot of you find a lot of times that they come in with depression and suicide begins to to attach itself to depression and you begin to work with that patient and work with that young person and you finally click to it and you find what the issue is and we we many times we have cast that thing off because we got a right to cast it off but Satan tells well it's going to end like this you're going to cut your wrist you're going to die there's going to be so many people come to your your funeral and oh you're going to be remembered so great that's how he wants you to think come on brother I don't want be on the other side looking down because I've done something stupid stupid but we find you got to cut your way through these things cut your way through all these things that trying to come against you the Bible Will Tell Us in Ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brother be strong in the Lord Lord notice not strong in your own self not strong in in some man's Doctrine not strong in where you go to church not strong in this that other but be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might see put on the whole armor of God and there's no armor for the back there's no retreat for the believer there's no surrender for the believer it's a on full on battle full on war you got to face him head on we find here says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places then he says take onto us the whole armor of God that we may be able to withstand in the evil day that's this day God has prepared us to stand in this day and he's given us the equipment by which we are to stand in this day take on this word notice we're wrestling it's a contest we're not wrestling with flesh and blood me and brother Andrew or me and brother Joe or me and this other brother we're not wrestling because maybe I'm just a little bitty pipsqueak I mean I'm 5'5 and and a half that's right give me a hand clap I went to the doctor about 3 months ago and they told me uh you're 5' 5 and a half I'm like what my whole life I've been 5 six and A2 they robbed me of an inch brother Daryl I'm going tell you what I'm getting my inch back come on yeah I just turned 48 not too long ago and older you get the shorter you get the lost I mean I lost my hair thank God I got my wits about me but we find that we're fighting against principalities against wickedness in high places we're fighting to get back in our position as Sons and Daughters of God and their Satan and his minions and devil after devil trying to keep you from getting back to your position Satan don't want you to recognize who you are but from the beginning in the mind of God you always was a Son of God you always will be a Son of God there ain't enough devils in hell can take that away and if that's the casee then it don't have to end like this it don't have to go down like this we can take our position take our Authority and take our rights to the word and back Satan in a [Applause] corner amen we find today that many Believers even Christians many Believers today they're wrestling against anxieties fears brother Andrew how many times you deal with anxiet and fear in prayer lines fear that I'm not going to be healed fear that I'm not going to be saved fear that I can't keep the Holy Ghost fear that I'm going to go down in the feet worried about this anxiety and all pressur it up we they wrestle against depression complexes demon oppression and see these are not flesh and blood battles because if they were Flesh and Blood battles we'd go out and get the best AR-15 we can buy man we' have an armor full we could take care of but these things that you can't just go out and buy some weapon no but God has provided you exactly what you have need of God has given us the greatest protection not only for a defense but God has giving you what you need for an offensive War you know what I think many times we pray and we oh God help us here and oh God help us there and when the enemy comes in or we're in the battle we're in the midst of the trenches it's always the bride playing defense I'm here to tell you tonight it's time that the bride takes the promises of God and goes on the offense the Bible says that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you so when you're in the midst of the battle he's right there when the when hell's all against you he's right there there's no way for the believer to go down in the feet so spray your shoulders back tonight and begin to press the devil I'm not backing up Satan I'm not giving up tonight I'm holding this word that faith is the promise healing is my promise deliver is my promise my kids are my promise my family is my promise my marriage is my promise I'm taking God in his word tonight it's my promise I'm not backing off of It Go on the offense for [Music] once but B tell us in putting on the whole armor of God he said we don't wrestle with toe holds flesh and blood but we wrestle against spiritual powers wrestlers see they practice on breaking toe holes and things he says but you don't break these toe holes no he says could you imagine a wrestler come out with his fingernails polished got his little jelly band on what would Jesus do he wouldn't be wearing a jelly band on oh I better watch out huh right I'm not at home brother Joe all got his fingernails polishes trunks on wearing shorts got his trunks on oh yeah we still believe in a closed line religion the last time I [Applause] heard he goes but you don't break these toes no coming out there with his fingernails polished trunks on with all kind of gold beads around it he goes look like a pretty good wrestler but that's just only intellectual see he hasn't got a hidden strength there that when the enemy gets a Toe Hold on him that he can just pull them out of it see his intellectual beads around him and everything don't make much difference so all of our intellectual means nothing if they're in the hidden power that's right you can know this Bible backwards and forwards you can know every quote backwards and forward but if there is no anointing behind it if there's no power behind it it ain't nothing but head knowledge let me tell you God you'll take that head knowledge and you go right to hell with head knowledge but God has given us an anointing in this hour God has given us a word in this hour and it's got to be more than intellectual understanding it's got to be a Supernatural anointing behind this word to make this word live to go out into the highways and the byways and catch young men by the name of Reed ball and bring them back to the house of God oh in an unexpected place in an unexpected way he goes into some old place to have breakfast not even his favorite place I think God's pretty on time it may not be in his favorite place but it was God's favorite place and God thought so much to come by there and he was just bit annoyed with the old man that begin to bring him the word you may be a little bit annoyed tonight with the young man that's bringing you the word right oh but God God's going to never lose it may look like he was going down in the feet drugs ravishing his life destroyed him pulled him out of the house of God his own daddy didn't want anything to do with him right don't bring your hide to my house I don't want to be around that but God said they don't have to end that way God said it ain't over yet God says I got the final say God says you come from God you come from my thoughts and if you come from my thoughts and that seed is on the inside I don't care how much dirt That Old Devil puts on you how much sin he puts on you whatever he it ain't going to stop that seed Oh Glory to God it ain't going to stop that seed that seed is coming up it's going to come up tonight

matter what you're going through he's got it for says we're in a wrestling match wrestling not with fine dress intellectual psychology but we're wrestling with power and the promise of God which can break any hold on the devil that's right you're intellectual ain't got no power that devil fighting you that intellect that psychology it ain't going to break that toe hole but you take him back to this one time you take him back to to this where's sister Armstrong at is it Armstrong Jessica nope brother Tony's wife Tony big Tony y'all got a Tony here big Tony Tony stand up you're making me look bad I saw you the other day doing parking Tony MRA where's his wife at Angela right Jennifer I don't know these people's name I ain't never I'm not from here all right well they're on vacation but we're not we're in church so let's have church so a couple years ago at our youth camp just to give you another little testimony this is okay tonight at our youth camp it was Sunday morning after the all night prayer line prayer line went to about 1:00 in the morning I was exhausted I got into a bed about 2:00 I was up at 6:00 trying to get the sunrise service but you know I got a slogan call coffee before we pray I'm sorry I was in no mood to pray yet but she had a young girl out there and this girl was tormented and and so they come they said brother Joe sister McGraw needs you over there to pray for I'm like look I'm going to finish my coffee and I know this is going around the world this is it sounds awful awful doesn't it so I I I chugged it real quick and I went over there and be to talk to this young girl and sister Jennifer mgra was right there and we're kneeling down and I'm talking to her and she says you know her friend came in the prayer line night before she had a demon on her so me and my wife and sister lyia oy brother Aaron's wife were in the back we were working with this young girl and she's foaming out the mouth like a dog and this she's raring up and brother darl I'm tell you she was a h 100 times her strength she was a young 16y old girl I work with her for 45 minutes I was wiped out just trying to hold her down so we could pray and begin to begin to be able to cast that devil off and brother Matt McGary came back here and we just begin to work with her because he goes to her church and he knew some things and begin to deal with with anyway we got her to we got this devil cast off of her and I was like oh praise God well the next morning I go over there and this young girl goes to church with she was all nerved up I don't want to be like my friend I'm I'm scared I'm nervous I got all this anxiety I said well oh we'll just praying you can go back in service and enjoy the service it's a sunrise service so I go and lay my hands on her and all of a sudden that Spirit begins to speak I don't like you I said well good I don't like you either so I'm glad we got that settle and see the devil thought he was going to stay there he thought he was going to hide behind that he was going to scare me like I'm afraid of some Demon and I be to pray with her and I said look Satan you can't stay you're an unwelcome guest here you're a squatter here you can't remain here she don't want you here and by the authority of this word we cast you out and that thing left her and she went back inside rejoicing and praising God and she was just at our meetings and she still rejoicing and praising God what am I telling I'm telling you that God has the final say God has the final burden God has the final word your condition ain't too too far for God to move on tonight he's still on the throne Church brother will tell us he defeated Satan with it is written I didn't come up with some psychology to pray for that young girl I just laid hands on and prayed I just believed and you better know what you stand when you start fighting Toe to Toe with an enemy brother tell us the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any conditions did y'all hear that on the job in the school in the car in church at your house in your quiet time the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any condition but it takes a hidden man of the heart oh let me get just keep moving on here woo yall a good crowd to preach to tonight Bible would tell us in Romans 8 they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh 8 and verse 5 but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now I know I'm sitting here talking to a bunch of cherubs y'all ain't never had a caral thought have you not us nope we're Word of Life JC yeah we got this thing covered up brother Joe look around no we got Colonel THS Church come on but the Bible says to be carnally minded see to be carnally minded is imity it's it's against God see it cannot please God but the the caral mind is imity against God but and we're told that that though that walk out through the spirit and that's what we want to get into tonight is the spirit we don't want to walk and come into church all worked up in our cality and in our minds and all the pressures of the world we're living in Leo DEA we're living in Satan's Eden and we hear wars and rumors of war and we're worried about Israel we worried about Ukraine and got all this on them M no that ain't our that's not our battle that's not for us to worry about God's got all that worked out but to be carnally minded is to the things of the flesh to give into the things of the flesh the propensities of our nature and we know that our nature is a fallen nature but God wants us to be spiritually minded to cater to the things of the word things of the Holy Ghost let God be able to speak to you through that still Small Voice so he can nudge you and you know that that's God you're not so consumed with the things of life and the Affairs of life that you miss the nudging of God Amen cuz I know just to be honest with you we all at some point in our walk have missed it and then Satan begins to work on your mind you missed it you missed a call of God you you should have prayed longer come on she would have just spent five more minutes 10 more minutes 30 more seconds if you have not given up God have done something see that's how he wants to get he wants to work on your carnality but see we our battle is not in the mind or it's not in the carnal the carnality of our mind but it's in our spirit realm Satan's trying to defeat us and try to to bring us down and we find here in Romans 12:1 Paul would tell us I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed and that word conformed there means to conform to the same power pattern to be not conformed to the world but to be transformed metamorphosed right you come in like a caterpillar chewing around you know brother J for climbing up that tree walking out on that Branch just chewing away caterpillar but then you you settle in a place oh yeah you settle in Johnson City Tennessee spending a cocoon in Word of Life JC and all of a sudden you've been there a year you've been there two years some of you been in that cocoon a long time you been you still in that cocoon but eventually what comes out of that cocoon is not the same thing that went in that cocoon oh a butterfly went in but a Son of God comes out a sinner comes in all tatted up drunk up Dred up but oh he been spun himself around the word of God and then got into a spirit spiritual atmosphere and he comes out a beautiful creature he comes out a real Son of God where the things of the of the world the things of the flesh no longer have a pull on him no longer have a desire in his heart anymore no why because why he's a different creature he's been transformed by the word of God he's been metamorphed by the word he's been changed by the word church let me tell you I know what I'm talking about when I was 21 years old I was headed to a devil's hell and a sinner great oh but God rich in Mercy came down and he said turn your car around I was trying to kill myself but God said it don't have to end that way I was out on all night drunk by 2:00 in the morning spirit of God I wouldn't I didn't grow up in a church didn't grow up in a message Church didn't grow up in a BAP my family was on drugs and things like that let me tell you it was an awfulness but there was a seed planted I said there was a seed planted I didn't know about that seed I didn't know that I come from God oh but through the memory of my father he be to share with me where I came from where I'm going and he came down one night about 2:00 in the morning and he said turn your car around I turned my car around I went home and up beside my bed and gave my heart to God let me tell you I ain't never taking it back oh I'm a Child of God tonight I'm a Child of God tomorrow I'll feel a child of God why because God said it don't have to end that way you don't have to kill yourself you don't have to go down in the feet you don't have to go down in the you're my child I'm coming by your way [Applause] tonight the natural mind notice 1 Corinthians 2 verse4 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him yes yeah neither can he know them because why they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we come on put your hand up we amen but we but we have the mind of Christ and let this mind that was in Christ be in you what was the mind of Christ he

your need tonight God's able let me begin to wrap this up tonight next slide how many know what this is I know you're intelligent it's a chess board how many know what the main piece on that board is what is it it's the king the king is the main piece on the board and let me just tell you your king is the main piece chess it's a game of wit it's where you make moves to get your opponent to make moves it's to where you have to out strategize manipulate your opponent and sometimes you may have to make sacrifices brother Joe you may have to lose one of your pieces so that you can get your opponent into a position that you can Checkmate him see there is a story next slide how many have ever seen this picture this is called checkmate we find here there was a there's a story this picture once hung in the Lou Museum in France and there was a one day there was a group of people coming by to look at the the the museum look at all the nice artifacts and all the artwork and and in this certain group there was a grandm an international chess champion he came in and he looked at the Mona Lisa and just passed it on by and he he looked here at this picture he was in International chess champion and he begin to study and we look at this picture here and we see that we have Satan here on the left but before that we have a chess board that's being played on a coffin cuz Satan is in battle for your soul and we have a king who looks for loone and lost and we have an angel looking over his shoulder it's like there's no hope they're in despair the young king is in checkmate that's what the picture is called so this painting we find that the legend has it this man stood and he looked at this painting and he studied this painting and he watched this painting and we find in this painting we have a lion here with his paw on a skull of the previous victim because there's no Escape so Satan thinks and we see this red feather in his cap which is an ancient emblem of craftiness and cunningness and you look at the pieces of Satan his pieces he is his own King his Queen is a voluptious woman his pieces are anger malice all these different Pride false Su doubt and unbelief and we find the young man's pieces are peace love joy happiness goodness and all these pieces but when you look at this and you look at the pieces here Satan has a lot more pieces than the king there's a spider here who's making making its way to spin another web of snare for this young king to get his next victim so we look at all this and we see that Satan is after our soul right and every move you make plays into his hand and every move he makes can play into your hand so we find that we have we're in a we're in a chest chess match who's going to outsmart the next one they say that a a good chess player can make one move at a time one move ahead of a time or an average chess player can make one move ahead at a time a good chess player can make four to five moves ahead but a grandmas can make 20 moves ahead at a time so he knows you make this move then he's got these next 20 moves made and see that's how Satan does some of you get on that website and you make that move then he's got you boom bo b Bo boom and now you're spiraling down a word of pornography or you go to make this move and you click on believe the sign all of a sudden now you're down this spiral Road of unbelief and that God sent a prophet and that this message is true so Satan's always trying to outsmart he's trying to always blur the lines of black and white and make everything gray things that we used to wouldn't allow in our house now they're welcomed music that we used to would not listen to now we listen to novels and books and magazines that we used to not want to look at now we just allow our kids to feed on them and look at them you know it's not hurting anybody so that's the thing see Satan is looking for weaknesses he's looking for weaknesses and if he can weaken Word of Life Church by getting you to not believe that he's still able that God's still able to he heal he finds that weakness he'll slip in there and he'll begin to manipulate that and he'll begin to bring this one down and that one down and that one down and that one down so we find Satan is always thinking ahead and he'll get you sometimes to make bad choices now how many of you ever made a bad choice yes sir all right praise God I'm in good company he'll make you make bad choices based on your feelings based on your complexes based on fears based on worries based on regrets based on past history family strains well this is who I am I just have to do this no you don't see Satan loves to do that and to back you in a corner but see we find the Bible says or as my wife sung that song the facts may be stacked up against you tonight you may be in a serious battle Satan's going backed you up and say well there's no hope for you there's there's no use of trying there's no use even believing for healing there's no use even believing for deliverance you got to be stuck that way this is who you are it's your makeup but the truth is he's already won the battle right see the facts may be stacked up against you but the truth is God's on your side see the truth is that it's not the end of the story God's the one with the pen in his hand and he told your Prophet pick up the pin and write yeah pick it up this is what I want you to tell my bride that she's a lovely woman oh Church to let you know where you come from cuz he knew you would need a message like this in this hour when all Hells are selling you you can come back to this word and it'll be your anchor so as we find the facts is that we're troubled on every side but the truth is we're not distressed facts is that we're perplexed sometimes we we don't know which way to go but the truth is we're not in despair the facts is we're persecuted but the truth is we're not forsaken the facts are that we're cast down and many of us been cast down many of time but the truth is we're not destroyed we're still here Church we're still believing we're still plugging the law let me just tell you this when the devil is all gone and he's defeated you'll still be standing you'll still be here when when that healing is happened and Satan is defeated he's cast into that Lake of Fire we'll still be worshiping we'll still be praising God what did God tell job job where were you when I hung the foundations of the world where were you job when the sons of God shouted for Jo he was reminding job before the first Affliction before he lost his family before he lost his well that job you were in my thoughts and if you was in my thoughts there you will be in my thoughts now nothing can destroy you Jo this ain't the end of it I'm going to restore more and more unto you and I'm going to take Word of Life Church that God is the same today he's the same yesterday today and for forever church and whatever you have need of He's Able tonight to do it he's able tonight to meet your need He's Able tonight to heal your body He's Able tonight to save your prodical son he's able tonight to deliver He's Able tonight to do whatever you have need of it's not the end of the [Applause] story amen yes sir amen let's get back to the painting as we bring this to a close Grandmaster standing there he's looking at this picture and he's staring at it and he's looking at it and all of a sudden somebody may want to take that cell phone call Satan may be wanting to tell you something he's looking at this picture and he's in the L Museum and all of a sudden he says wait hold up a minute it's all wrong the curator of the museum came over there what's all this excitement about why are you so emotional he said the painting is wrong it's

mic trouble somewhere amen the mic's not be too great but our God certainly is tonight isn't he what a wonderful privilege it is to serve the Living God count it an honored to be with you and appreciate the opportunity to stand before you tonight and Trust something will be said to help you and encourage you along the way and battling just a wee bit of a cold and I just trust that my voice don't sound like I'm in a barrel too bad but we pray the Lord to just help us tonight but if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of 2 Corinthians want to read from 2 Corinthians chapter 5 sorry not working again well praise the Lord amen I'm telling you if I cross the river and somebody hands me a mic I did not make it it happens everywhere I go praise the Lord praise the Lord God is good all the time amen anyway we we're going to read second made myself laugh we're going to read tonight from 2 Corinthians chapter 5: 7 and also from 2 Corinthians chap 6 uh verse 16 do you love him yes amen the Bible says this very familiar scripture to us all says for we walk by faith and not by sight for we walk by faith and not by sight now you can walk by one or the other but you can't walk for both at the same time so you're either going to walk by what you see with your eye or you're going to walk by what you see with the eyes of your heart amen amen now 2 Corinthians 6:16 says this and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people amen oh myall what a wonderful statement that The God Who created the heavens and the Earth said that you would be his people amen that ought to make you shout tonight good amen do you love him you know in order to walk with God we have to agree with God for the Bible says can two walk together except they be agreed and the prophet of God said this and I thought it was so good he said when a man will walk for God and walk with God then God will walk with that man amen when a man will walk for God and walk with God God will walk with that man amen let us bow our heads Hallelujah Heavenly Father Thy word is true thank you Lord for loving us for it's written that while we were yet sinners you loved us Lord father I pray tonight that you would just take this simple thought and encourage

bless the little bride around the world we pray every Minister ministering tonight use them for thy Glory we ask as we commit oursel and this congregation into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you Saints you may be seated this evening you know inspiration for a message can come in so many ways sometimes someone can make a comment to you and it'll just something will just strike your heart and it'll inspire you to start looking in a certain direction or you can be going down the road and you see a just a a a a billboard on the side of the road and something on that billb billboard will strike your heart and you'll start looking at a certain thought you know like brother Brenham who was walking through the woods and uh he he's seen a cigarette pack and laying there in the woods and he stopped and looked at the at the cigarette pack and on the side of it was a was a slogan a slogan on the on the cigarette pack and the prophet got an inspiration from that cigarette pack and he preached a powerful sermon on a thinking man's filter and the other day Aiden my grandson was over at the house and after he left I was coming through the bedroom and I bumped into one of his toys that he had left out while he was there and we had it out for him to play with and as I bumped into it it spoke to me and it said let's walk together let's walk together and when it said that something just struck my heart so tonight for a few minutes I'd like to speak on let's walk together Walking with God in the season of transition for you see transition means a period of changing from one state or condition to another and I believe that we can prove tonight by the Bible and by the message of the hour and by the conditions of the world that we are now living in that we are in the season of transition now in our scripture reading we find that the sons and daughter Daughters of God they walk by faith and not by sight and the prophet said a man or a woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they will never please God so if you try to walk after the world and try to walk after the message you will never please God and a person that never pleases God will never take a Rapture amen I said if we never please God we will never take a Rapture for the Bible said that Enoch pleased God and he was not because God took him amen but a man woman that will not look at the things of the world but will go according to the leading of the spirit you will find those kind of people are usually in the will of God Amen and that's the great fight tonight and it's always been the fight that Satan took the eyes of a man's head to control him by his head but God never chose the eyes of your head he chose your heart God wants to lead men so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man could be led by the spirit of God Amen and if there's something in you tonight thirsting for more of God if there's something in you tonight thirsting for a deeper walk with God anybody here like that tonight say you know brother I really desire a deeper walk with God then there's something in you that thirst that's in you for a deeper Walk Of God is the evidence that there's a deeper Walk Of God for you to attain to because if it wasn't there then you would never have that thirst and I want you to know that the thirst that's in your heart for a deeper walk with god did not come from you it came from from God he put that thirst on Hallelujah he put that thirst in your heart oh do you love you tonight it was put there by God now one of the greatest examples in the Bible that we have of a man walking with God is Enoch is Enoch and the Bible says this that Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him oh God let that be said about me one day let that be said about you one day that he walked with God and he was not because God took him by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen Faith we're talking about faith we've got to have faith we've got to have it in such a place till we'll be translated like Enoch was we of me you all of us tonight we must come to that kind of faith that we can be translated like Enoch was that's right he had a testimony of faith that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God so you you've got to have the same kind of faith that you believe and that you know but you see this faith is that this knowing is not a head knowledge you don't know it well I've read a few good you don't know it by head knowledge but it's a revelation that God has given to you God has revealed this thing to you amen and that's how we know we can have faith in it not because of a head knowledge but because of a revelation what is faith faith is a revelation of the will of God for your life amen and so when the Revelation comes we can have faith that God revealed this thing to us because we are a part of what God is doing in this hour amen Jesus himself said I do always that which pleases the father that's keep his word for to please God we must believe his word and keep his word and so is it today every son and daughter of God in order to please God must keep God's word not the part you want to keep but all of it all of it God is not known by sensation come on somebody well I got a goosebump you can get that from an air conditioning God is not known by sensation he is not known by education amen well I can read the Bible well I know the Bible from cover to cover that's just being able to read amen God's not known by education God's not known by sensation but God is known by faith amen faith in his word that's the only way he's recognized faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God that's how it comes by the hearing of the word of God Enoch walked with God it was a walk by faith so Enoch must have heard something from God while he was walking there was something that God was revealing to Enoch while he was walking for Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen now we know that Enoch believed God you say how do you know he believed that because he acted on what he believed he walked with God that was the evidence that he believed God we know that Noah believ God you say how do you know Noah beli God because he built the ark before one drop of rain ever fell amen you see when you believe anything when you say you believe anything you've got to put it into action or do you believe oh I believe brother Daryl so does the devil but you got to put it into action amen hallelujah Abraham was commanded to separate himself from unbelief and walk with God Alone instead of getting weaker he got stronger and when he was 100 year old and Sarah was 99 they had the baby amen because Abraham believed God and he walked with God believing that he would have that child out because God said so he never looked at his body he never looked at it come on somebody he wasn't looking with the eyes of his head he was believing with the eyes of his heart and because he didn't look at his body he looked to the promise he never got weaker he got stronger stronger amen he knew he would have the child because God said he would have the child and he walked with God to the manifestation of the promise became flesh he walked with God to the manifestation of the promise was made flesh amen I thought that was pretty good you get me amens but oh my to the promise of the word became flesh whose flesh My Flesh your flesh the message of the hour not just in book form not just in tape form not just in CD form not just computer uh computer format but the message of the hour made flesh in you and I that we are the [Applause] message Hallelujah manifested on the earth making him the same yesterday today and forever so let's look at Enoch for a few minutes and look at his walk and see this walk that was so pleasing to God that God translated him now I don't know about you and I but that's the kind of walk that I want tonight that my walk would be so pleasing to him that he would say Daryl just come on home with me buddy amen so when we look at Enoch's walk we start to see some things that are laying in the message that the prophet said about Enoch and one of the things the prophet said about Enoch was that Enoch was a type he was a type Enoch knew that he was a type and he knew that before the flood came that he had to give an example now where did that Revelation come from amen how did he know that he was the type that everything his life was doing was an antitype of a type that's right where did that Revelation come from so one afternoon it'd be coming to him to take a walk notice not one morning not one morning he didn't take a walk one morning but it was an evening walk amen Enoch was translated just before the tribulation let me say that again Enoch was raptured just before the tribulation and he was took up and he was not found because God took him the type of the going forth of the church the type of the going forth of the church Enoch was translated from Death By God's transforming power and transforming means the ability to bring about a dram dramatic change amen we serve a god tonight who has the ability to bring about a dramatic change hallelujah oh I'm so glad tonight someone on the other day that God don't heal no more these Church of Christ people believe God don't heal no more I'm sorry if you're God suity he can't heal I feel sorry for you but my God my God still heals he still open blinded eyes he still makes the come on somebody we serve a god tonight who has the ability to raise the dead and to change our bodies brother Jackie back to young men again Hallelujah by the transforming power of the almighty God hallelujah you know was translated by transforming power why did God do that what did God do that for why did God change his body that he wouldn't have to see death yeah the prophet said for a type of the rapturing church that's coming for the rapturing church that's coming God done it for a type of the rapturing church that's coming well Glory Elijah was the same Jesus body the prophet said was quickened after it was dead in the grave Jesus body was quickened by the word of God and transform him from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified Son of God because the prophet said in Psalms 16:10 if you want to put it down I will not suffer his sold in hell I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption I'll not leave his sold in hell I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption that word has to come to pass why God spoke it God's word planted in your heart the prophet said if you want to go in a Rapture anybody here want to go in a Rapture oh yeah if you want to go into Rapture plant the word in your heart if you want to be a Christian genuine place this word in your heart and believe it as it was Ezekiel said take the scroll and eat it up and the prophet and the word became the self-same the prophet and the word became the selfs same did not John the Baptist John on the alatus was not he the type of the bride and what did he do he took the book out of the hand of he that descended and what did he do with the book he ate the book and John was a type of the bride and the book became one yes sir you take and eat the revealed word of this hour and you and that word becomes [Applause] one every promise has to manifest in your flesh it's not just for the preachers to lay hands on the sick these signs shall follow them that believe every promise must manifest in our flesh hallelujah hallelujah would you let some educated Theologian try to pump it out of you just let him spray you with some of this carnal science and knowledge and education you believe what God said well brother D I don't really understand it you don't have to understand it just believe it he'll reveal it to you when you have need of it amen I'd rather be found believing it than debating it because debating it will never produce nothing but believ in it Hallelujah believe in it will open blinded eyes believe in it will make the L walk believe in it we'll take a drunk and make a preacher out of them by believe in what the word said it'll change our bodies [Applause] amen hallelujah Enoch was the type of the church he also typed the seventh Church age what age are you in what what seventh seventh anoch typed the seventh Church age Enoch walked as a reflector Enoch the prophet said was God's perfect reflector and type when God was through with him he just translated him he took him up the mechanics that he had reflected become the Dynamics with the spirit and took him up the mechanics of the word that he reflected became the Dynamics with the Holy Spirit and it just took him the word that Enoch believed Walking with God the mechanics of the word one God water baptism reing the Holy Ghost forgiveness of sins as though you never done to justification all these Mysteries lay in there the mechanics of the word became Dynamics he reflected that word I was listening to a man the other day talking about leaving the message they said he'd come out of the brandom cult and they let him speak a little bit and this man said I believe in one God I believe in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I believe in signs and wonders and visions and miracles and healings I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in one God I believe in the Rapture of the church and I'm thinking where did the prophet miss it you walked away from something that you said you you believed think about that friends think about that everything he said he believed was what the prophet preached oh God he was a reflector the mechanics that he reflected became the Dynamics with the spirit that took him up and we are flesh and bone of him amen amen listen to me there's sometime in your life you're going to have to start amening what the prophet said there sometime in your life you've got to start acknowledging what the prophet said well I don't understand it he didn't say did you understand it he said did you believe it and there comes a time that we have to start confessing come on friends we all the time feeding our enemy well I'm no good God don't love me you know what shamgar did every year every year at Harvest Time When they'd come in they'd slap him around and they'd take his his grain away from him take his Goods away from him and leave him with just enough to plant for the next season you know what chevard was doing he was feeding his enemy and I am convinced that many of us feed our enemy with our negative talk well I'm no good God don't love me nobody cares for me it'd be better if I just die you're feeding your enemy why don't you shut that stuff up and start saying what the word said I am an overcomer I am a Son of God I come on somebody I'm predestinated I was born for the rapture and every year they come in but one time this particular season there was another seed that came to maturity Shamar said I am the Seed of Abraham and God promised my daddy his seed shall possess the gates of his enemy that year he killed 600 Philistines with a nox goat because he came to his position he started saying what the word said about him amen we are flesh and bone of him oh that's much better thank you we are you see we're not a church we're not a building we're a body when the when the when the cloud appeared in Arizona what was it was it a block was it a steeple it was a head what do heads go to bodies we are flesh and B we are his body represented on the earth amen a many membered body that's why he said the works I do shall you do and greater that greater means more because what he did was one body but now it's a universal body signs of Wonders being done everywhere because his body is on the earth flesh and Bone amen as long as we are the bride of Christ amen it's his word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in that's what it was that's what it was with Moses that's what it was with Jacob that's what it was with the rest of them sparking off that word of God the reflector God was reflecting himself and come to the perfect image of God Jesus Christ God's Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflecting him so I say to you tonight what are you reflecting an organization a denomination or are we reflecting him once more the world will hear from God it'll be through his bride for the final voice to the final age amen Voice Hallelujah God reflected himself come to a perfect Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflecting him Enoch was reflecting the word that God was revealing to him as he walked with him God said Enoch let's walk together now didn't that happen sometime in our age when brother bam spoke to a storm and Reb buuk the storm and the sun came up and dried up the snow and God spoke to him and said how would you like to walk with me he said oh God I would love nothing more to take a stroke with my Creator you he's given every one of us in this hour an invitation this message of the hour is his invitation walk with me let's walk walk together amen Enoch walked in the light in the light amen oh my someday the church which is a type of Enoch 500 years he walked before God walking walking in the light with the testimony that everything God said he did he didn't displease him for what the Lord said to do Enoch done it Enoch just kept walking in the light till one day his feet kept getting off the ground he just kept walking He Walked on into Glory without even dying that's right God took him away because God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony that he walked in the light of God he just kept walking he just kept walking oh friends never put a period behind what you believe always put a comma I believe this and this and this and whatever else God in his grace would revealed to me walking the prophet said Brothers It's time we make Footprints we can't stay here in this same camp the fire is moving on let's move on from glory to glory from Bible experience to Bible experience walking in the light of the revealed word as it continues to unfold it's like that Roman Candle you light it in the fuse if you walk away you never see the end of it when that first one comes out that's the beginning of the end but you've got to stay there until all of them it just keeps poof poof poof poof continues has the seals been open yes but it continues to unfold what do you see in the seals is it just a sermon is it just a series of meetings or do you see yourself there's a man I believe I think I've told you this before but it just comes to my heart there's a man by the name of bur from New Jersey raised in the Jewish Family wore the cap did all the things that the all the ceremonies he's an award-winning Native American flute player now why would a Jew from New Jersey be an award-winning Native American flute player that don't make no sense think he'd play a harp or something you know some kind of horn why a flute why brother Fred would a New Jersey Jew been an award-winning Sue flute player playing Sue music because one day somebody come to his door with an open book and they told him you're not a Jew you're a sue Indian adopted adopted as a child from the rosebud Indian reservation and when he found out who he was when he found out his genetics you see the ability the play of the flute laid within his genetics and when he realized who he was he surrendered to what he was and he went back to the red path and the sacred way and the elders why that's what he was and one day they told me I was a drunk because my papa was cuz my uncle was cuz Uncle Harold was CU a Francis was they told me I was a drunk but one day somebody came with an open book and said that's not who you are that's not who you are you're my son while you was yet in your mother's W I called you I set you aside for such a time as this the open book revealed to us who we really are walking into the light amen the light of the revealed word as it continues to unfold from glory to glory to glory Enoch walked has an eagle all these were the things the prophet said I just dug through the message all these are things brother brim said about Enoch Enoch walked as an eagle he walked with God whatever God said do Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle that had been called to that day that's pretty good he was an eagle who had been called to that day you know the Bible talks about four living creatures is that right a man an ox a lion and a flying eagle now those four living creatures three of them are Earthbound creatures the only way that they could ever cross a Chasm is either build a bridge take a boat an airplane but not the eagle the eagle was born with the ability to lift off the Earth and God never said Enoch was a lion or an ox or the face of a man he said he was an eagle who had been called to this day oh glory to God hallelujah that just stirs my soul to know that I was born oh the devil tried to put me in a the cage he tried to lock me up but Christ come and opened the door and said you're an eagle you can fly Enoch walked with God whatever God said to do he never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle who had been called to that day to that day you B talked about an eagle that he saw in a blowdown remember the story was out there and said he's just praising God and said he knows said he was looking at him he said at first I thought it was me but he said I noticed it wasn't me he was looking at it was an old ground squirrel chipmunk or something said ch ch ch ch chatter chatter chatter chatter said I a't going just his head look at him said after a while he just got tired of the chatter all the political correct transgender he got tired of all the chatter got tired of all the stupidity come on somebody what was it Forest Gump one time said it's stupid is the stupid does that's about where it's at right now some of the stupidest things they do well amen well you ain't supposed to get political I'm just telling the truth I'm sorry come on somebody amen he said he got tired of all the chatter said he just gave a flop just one big jump and he just flopped his wings one time and S them said he trusted his wings he didn't fought from one meat to to the other from one Church to another he just made one big flop and set his wings in the power of God like the Holy Ghost and he carried him away on and on and on and on he got away from that little old chipmunk that Earthbound chipmunk that ain't got no wings that don't know how to fly that don't know anything about the supernatural that don't know anything about God but all they know to do is run their mouth he got tired of it and he realize I am an eagle I don't have to listen to that I can set my wings I Can Fly [Applause] just set your wings in the power of God let the Holy Ghost rise you above it go on and on and on do you don't hear the Chipmunks No More the ground squirrels he got tired of the chatter oh if the church one of these days will get tired of that they'll know how to set their wings they'll take a walk with God and they'll go home they'll go home one they they'll just set their wings they'll get tired of it and they'll just set their wings they'll go home you see the most wonderful thing about Enoch's walk cuz I'm not talking about Enoch tonight I was hoping some of you would get it I'm not talking about Enoch tonight I'm talking about you I'm talking about you Enoch's walk was typing you God was showing through Enoch what he was going to do through you he was a reflector he was the light of his age reflecting the mechanics of the word the evening light is not the name of the church I'm sorry it's you Jesus said I'm the light of the world and then he turned and said you're the light of the world did he suffer from Amnesia did he forget what he said no he was giving you a revelation I'm the light of the world but you are the light of the world because I'll be in you reflecting myself through you and you shall be my people and I shall be your God and I'll walk in you Hallelujah I'll reflect myself through you that the world in 2024 will know that Jesus Christ lived lives he lives in young people he lives in Grandma he lives in Grandpa he lives in that come on somebody he lives in me he lives in you if that's true let's just look at it for a minute that let look at Enoch's walk in the season of his transition now the prophet said God is just loosening up the church everywhere getting it in order now so they can get into the Rapture he's got to give it Rapture in faith before it can go in the Rapture he's just loosing up the church everywhere getting it in order so they can get into the Rapture so that he can get into the Rapture he's got to give it rapturing Faith before it can go in the Rapture the people that are in the spirit of the last days just like they were in the days of Noah eating and drinking marrying in marriage unconcerned don't care walk around anything else as it was in the days of Noah and if you understand it right the prophet of God said that Enoch and Noah was preaching at the same time so the days of Noah when the world was in that condition it was in that season that Enoch translated it was in that season of drinking and marriage and giving in marriage and unconcerned and self-love take the place of the true love of God and earthquakes in diverse places rest unrest between nations wars and rumors of wars pestilence famines it was Enoch's day it was in his season of transition it was in that time it was in that time that uniting times and signs took place sound familiar it was during that time the prophet says you see that time that Nimrod had brought all the confederations together and made people come to Babylon and come into this great Confederation and at that time of all the evil going on between the women sexually and so forth it's at that same time that God had a witness on the earth Enoch who walked with God blameless it was during that time that this evil was on the earth when God said I'll destroy man for his heart is continually evil it was during that time that there was someone on the earth who was found blameless as though they never done [Music] it Hallelujah more than what Luther preached come on somebody a greater understanding of the word walking in the light as he reveals the light Hallelujah was in the season of transition that they were uniting herself amen he was found blameless he was found blameless and that that same time evil was appearing Angels appeared on the earth Angelic beings moved into men a very beautiful type of today as evil is appearing so is good appearing also notice back there in that evil day just before the destruction when God had a man out preaching the gospel a poor man a humble man not very much of the world but a man who had a heart to listen to God a man who had a heart to listen to God how can two walk together except they agree and there's only one thing that you and God can agree on and that's his word amen and you see we know that as it was in the days of Enoch so will it be in our day you say how do you know that because when Jesus was here he spoke more of his second coming than he did his first coming and he even gave us an understanding of what was to take place he actually prophesied of what was to take place in this day that we're living in now you'll find it in Luke 21 and they asked him saying Master when shall these things be and what shall be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass when will these things happen and what will be the sign that it's happening and he said take heed that you be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draw near go ye not therefore after them but when you shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is Not By and By then he said unto them Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places many places and famines and pestilence and fearful SES yeah ain't it something that all of a sudden our government is so interested in UFOs and brother Bon said they don't know what they are they don't know what they are but he told us what they were he said they were investigating angels amen oh god oh Hallelujah fearful signs Great Signs there shall be from heaven and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexity and the Sea waves roaring men's Hearts failing for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud not clouds cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass give up quit coming to church go to Dollywood every other weekend when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your hands for your Redemption draweth n and he spake unto them a parable saying behold the Fig Tree and all trees and all trees not just the Fig Tree and all trees when they shoot forth you see you know of yourself that summer is now at hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand and verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away to it be fulfilled heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away it shall not pass away I don't know if you noticed or not have you seen all the buds coming out on the trees the Bradford peirs are all turning white what's that telling us it's a law of God's nature that's telling us summer is on its way huh you see when the leaves come out the leaves don't come out in the winter time no first the buds come out and they start budding forth and it tells us spring is on its way spring is here it's sprung we say and then what does that tell us when the leaves begin it tells us that summer is n amen so you can tell what season you're in by looking and at the trees budding in the spring leaves are on the trees in the Summer Leaves begin to change color and fall in the fall and when there's no leaves on the tree it's winter but as brother Lind wrote that song there'll be another spring amen learn the parable the Fig Tree when it's young it put forth its branches and all the other trees you know summer is n likewise when you see this come to pass know the time is now even at the door when you see what the Fig Tree buding and all the other trees begin to Bud no the time is near speaking of the second coming of Christ that that time would be at hand that time would be at hand at the budding of the trees at the budding of the trees nations are breaking the fig trees putting forth his Bud all of the trees are putting forth its Bud the wicked ones are putting forth their buds romanism is putting forth its Bud communism putting forth it but and your church is putting forth its but springtime's coming oh great master of Life rise with healing in your wings Lord give your servants all power and signs to stretch forth the hand of th holy Child Jesus to perform Miracles and do signs and to preach the gospel to the ends of the world when all the trees begin to bud when everything begins to come into its own amen amen they manifesting who they really are and so are we the trees are budded amen Jesus seeking said father the time has come there are seasons for everything do you believe that you sew in a certain season and you reap in a certain season and there are seasons when the time comes that's right for things to happen yeah season is right for things to happen you see it couldn't happen in' 65 we wern't ready but when that last one comes in remember say she may be in Florida tonight when that last one comes in he'll close the book and call for his bride thank you amen so when the season is right he'll come with the season when the times comes it's right for things to happen he said do you believe that the time came one time for God to destroy the world with water and he sent a man by the name of Noah and God got the world ready for judgment the time came for Noah to go in the ark look Noah could not go into the ark before God was ready for him to go but when the season came for go for Noah to go into the ark God shot shut the door behind Noah he couldn't go in until the season was right but when the season was right he could go and he never shut the door God did God did so Prophet said you see we find that Enoch was a seventh from Adam and the seventh Church age is a seventh from the alpha BR the first church age Enoch was the Sabbath from Adam which is a type of the church ages now all the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh so it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture now there's no doubt we're in the seventh Church age we all know it it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture all other six died but Enoch was translated because he was not found God took him but Enoch raptured was the type of all the rest of them dying but at the end time bride will be called out the rapturing without death will be called out of the seventh Church age and we are now bearing record of that age we are now bearing record of that age as it was in the days of Enoch so is it in the days of the Bride right we are now bearing record of that age as Enoch was a seven from Adam took a Rapture he did not die so the seventh Church age will take a Rapture there'll be people on the Earth by the transforming power of of God will become about a dramatic change and in a moment and the twinkling of an eye will'll be young again hallu Hall the season of transition the season of transition stand up there where Enoch did my he took a stroll one afternoon with God and walked on home with him don't just to come back Hallelujah not one morning one evening the Rapture of the Resurrection he had a testimony that he pleased God because he believe God and that's what we need and that's what we want and that's what we have you're just afraid to use it but it's time we get away from this fear and from this scar BR B said I didn't come out I didn't come to mix up a Doctrine I come to straighten one out to get away from this fear and from the scare that you don't know who you are he said you're not going to be you are now Sons and Daughters of God you always were Sons and Daughters of God it's time we get away from this fear and from this skar and start saying what he said about us come on somebody there's nothing wrong with saying what the word said as a matter of fact everything else is true he said let every man's lie let every man's word be a lie but let mine be true amen let every man's word be alive but let my word be true heavens and earth will pass away but my word word shall not pass away that's what we need that's what we want that's what we have you're just afraid to use it but I say do not be afraid to exercise your god-given rights after all this is the age of people's rights I did who you going to preach with me I don't one a predestinated word for the season a predestin ated word for the season that God would hold a word back for a certain season before he would let it be released that's why Paul never mentioned the seals it wasn't the season but in a predestinated time God would give a predestinated word to a predestinated people that they would take that word and eat that word and become that word and manifest that word and the word would be Flesh on the earth once again which would be Jesus Christ Hallelujah in his bride fulfilling the promise of the last day when he said a little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you Enoch was translated 500 years he had a testimony that he pleased God and he was a type of the raptured church amen Enoch after walking 500 years with God God told him Enoch you're not going to have to die he walked walk with God and one day God revealed to Enoch you don't have to die I bet if he told you that you wouldn't be sitting there but he did if you believe it I wish he told me that he already has if you believe it amen he told Enoch after walking 500 years he said Enoch you're not going to have to die you're not going to have to die there come a more sure word of Prophecy a predestinated word for a predestinated season and Enoch believed everything God told him Enoch said I don't have to die I can go where he goes I don't have to die I don't have to die who told you that he did he said Enoch he said Enoch you want to come home are you homick Enoch and Enoch said yes Lord I'm homesick so just before the translation of Enoch he got homesick and I'm telling you friends I've been preaching for 30 some years evangelizing 30 some years I have never seen in all the years of being on the field as many people saying they're homesick and they want to go home and even so Lord come quickly as I have in the last two years I'm just telling you friends everywhere you go people even so Lord come quickly they're posting it on Facebook they're posting it on come on somebody you know it's the truth and God said Enoch are you homesick and Enoch said yes Lord I'm so homesick I don't fit in here anymore I don't belong here no more amen I want to go home he said yes Lord I'm homesick in a season of transition Enoch became homesick he said you walked in this pest I've done here long enough he said yes sir he said all right Enoch just start walking and the prophet said Enoch needed a ladder but God gave him a highway it's a highway Heaven none can go up there but the F in heart hallelujah amen notice God Reveals His word in his own predestinated season hry now how could Martin Luther know about the message today how could the Presbyterians how could Martin or the Catholic Church know Martin Luther's message how could John Wesley know Luther's message how could Wesley know the Pentecostal message or how could the Pentecostals know this message see he reveals it in his Seasons because it's a seed and it grows and matures and he reveals himself Enoch was a type of the church he was a type of the seven Church age can you think of that the seven Church ages there was seven watches and all six watches they slept but in the seventh watch there came a morer word of Prophecy and it said behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and they awoke and trimed their limbs in the seventh watch and Enoch was a type of the seventh watch amen it's the seventh watch that gets the revelation behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him Putin's threaten of nuclear war I saw it today in the news said he's not afraid of nuclear war but I got news for Putin he can't push the button until the last one comes in and if he does push the button said one day they'll drink too much vodka Russia push too much vodka when that bomb passes through the radar when it goes through there there'll be others go the other way and you'll know what'll take place the world can't stand it the gospel's been preached Christ been made manifest to the people just before the Rapture the taken away of the church before that can happen before that can happen the church will be gone I ain't worried about Putin pushing if he pushes we'll be gone before it ever hits he said we know that that could happen before morning it could happen before morning and if it could happen before morning and its capabilities are there the things are there that it could happen before morning but if it does this will be the last message you ever hear the trans position oh God's people hallelujah before that happens the church will be gone not one drop of rain fell Noah was in the ark before one Speck of fire fell from the heavens lot was out of Sodom and before that pic bomb the Nations the church will be gone to Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah do you love you we're walking in the season of Transitions and I say to you as we close tonight is there an Enoch in in the house is there an OK in the building tonight amen then I say edok let's stand to our feet tonight and say we will not walk by sight but we will walk by faith come brother Harry come musicians let me close tonight we will walk tonight by an unconscious Faith standing on what the word says you are you see faith is unconscious B said I'm going to say something faith is unconscious faith is unconscious you got faith and you don't even know if that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm the gals knocking the boat from one side to the other he was standing in the face of a mess of demons he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear anything around him that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knew it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh I wonder if I prayed through I wonder if I fasted long enough I wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was truth and the word must be fulfilled and he know that his life was here to fulfill it and that's you you're here to fulfill you're here to fulfill the word that's spoken for this hour God never placed us here to fail he placed us here to fulfill the predestinated word for a predestinated season for a predestinated people and we will walk unconscious a fear from the world come on somebody a fear from communism from fear from the Democrats or the Republicans a fear of missing the Rapture a fear of not being no good because the word's done said who we are he's done revealed to us who we are as we walk in Christ we walk in him not paying attention to the left or to the right just keep on moving just keep on walking walking in the light as he reveals the light from glory to glory to glory if we spent more time praising him than we did worrying we would be so much better off amen hallelujah hallelujah and I say to you that little bride if you're sick walk with God if the doctor says you can't get well walk with God if the doctor says you're going to die don't listen to that just walk with God just keep walking with God hallelujah if you got depression walk with God if your neighbors don't like you walk with God if they laugh at you at Walmart just keep walking with God just keep walking get your eyes on him Hallelujah keep your eyes on him he will change our bodies one day just like Enoch he walked with God till he walked all the way home Hallelujah you can't get well walk with God for God has promised us God has promised us I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you you said brother I feel so alone I don't have a friend in the world that's simply not true you got a great friend he said I'll never leave you I forsake you I'll be with you I'll be with you even to the end of the world oh little bride let's walk together as we walk with him you see it's an individual walk but we walk together individually as a body you see it's Christ in me helping you and it's Christ in you helping me that's the way God orchestrated it to me that I may not have faith for my family but I can have faith for yours and you may not have faith for your family but I can have it for yours and it's you helping me and me helping you and that's the body on the earth operating making him the same yesterday today and forever like the eagle in the blowdown he knew he knew he could lift above the chatter it was an unconscious Faith he knew he could do it because his genetics said he could do it you know somebody told me the other day you look more like your daddy every day and somebody said as long as you're living your mom will never be dead some people say I look like my daddy most people say I look like my mama everybody says Aiden looks like me but you know when I did my DNA I found out you get 50% of your DNA comes from your daddy and 50% of your DNA comes from your mama that's why some people see your mama other people they see your daddy in you and that's the natural DNA you know that's like why I could have so much well like like I'm I'm 5% Italian like so much seven 8% Southwest Asia 4 and a half% Native American got all this and then my brother he would have maybe something else I'll be 40% Irish and he might be 40% English but we're brothers because he got more of bomas it lean more to her than you know how and then when I got to looking at I thought the natural types of spiritual so 50% of my spiritual DNA comes from God my father and then I found a quote where brother B said we drink from the breast of Eli and we're birthed by the Breath of God so he said you see God is your mama so I get 50% of my spiritual DNA comes from my daddy and 50% of it come from a mama then what does that make us his seed do you love do you love what an agreement that the temple of God have with Idols you are the Temple of the Living God as God said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them he doesn't want just to walk above us or with us he wants to walk in us that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me and I and you and you and me God in his people manifesting himself God walking in his people in the season of transition are you glad to be a part of that tonight amen how many here so brother Dar you know I I want that more than anything a deeper Walk Of God I want to know him more than I've ever known him before friends I'm trying to tell you tonight that thirst in your heart for more of God was not put there by you it was put there by him and the evidence that we desire that tonight we know that we can obtain it because that desire is there if you didn't want that if there was no way to obtain that the desire wouldn't be there but the very fact that each of us stand there tonight and say these things these quotes look 99% of this message is quote you know that but the things the prophet said to us we should take these we should eat this and become a part of this amen and to know him and the power of his resurrection to hear him say how would you like to walk with me is God more than anything Lord more than anything is that your Des it's just about listen just lay your hands on one another tonight will you just reach over you can brother to brother sister sister family however it would be tonight am you're not heavy you're my brother you're my sister amen Heavenly Father we come before you tonight God I don't to believe these things were just somebody's ideal but I believe the prophet spoke these things as they come from the mind of God through the open of the word to show us dear God the season that we're living in Dear God that we are the people on the Earth people in this building tonight that will not see death but there'll be change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and father God As We Lay hands on one another because we have the authority to do that as Sons and Daughters of God the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe they shall lay their hands upon one another oh God we exercise our god-given right tonight as Sons and Daughters of God

let my brother let my sister let him have a closer walk with you let him have a deeper walk with you let them know you in the power of your Resurrection let them know you from glory to glory from light to light oh God that they might be a reflection of the word in this end time oh God let the world see Christ in them let it see him Lord walking down the street that they would see Jesus Christ
